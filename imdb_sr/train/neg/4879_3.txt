Is anything worse than a comedy with no humor? The answer is yes; one that does not create any interest in the whole picture. The premise is not a bad - naive front man for illegal business - but this is a potboiler with a bad script and script and just does not work. Was this considered a good 'B' in 1942? It's hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of this painting is the acting composition that contains several famous faces from the 1930s and 1940s, such as Varren Himer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always reject Richard Cromwell as a weakling who killed Garry Cooper in the "Lives of a Bengal Lancer" , so I did not count it). I can not recommend this and give it a grade of 3 - if you have a choice, get a channel for the root.
