The series of books "Boring in Time" is my favorite childhood series. I read them and read it many times than I can count in the last 35+ years. The characters, with all their virtues and flaws, are close and dear to my heart. This adaptation contained very little wonderful, magical, spiritual story that I love so much. To say that I was disappointed with this film would be a great underestimation. If you've never read the book (s), I guess you'll enjoy the movie. The acting is passable, special effects are well made for a film made for TV, and the story is interesting. However, if you like books, avoid this film at all costs. I found this statement on the Wikipedia page of the novel: "In an interview with Nevsveek, L'Engle said for the film," I expected it to be bad, and that's it. "br /> I, like the other reviewer here, feel the need to read the book again in order to distract this film from my mind.
