I was not impressed with this film, especially because I went to the cinema with my family in good faith to watch a movie that has been certified in the UK 12A. To my horror, this movie was full of unpleasant sexual jokes. (Which is not a problem for me as an adult, but it's not good to watch with children). This film was sometimes very rough with furry jokes, hitting the groin, and so on. ... and much of the movie is not so funny. The film's premise is that Calvin Simsi, who are dwarfs of 2 inches, get out of jail and steal a large-format diamond, but is then forced to put it in a woman's bag. So, the rest of the movie looks at him as he surrenders like an abandoned baby, he enters this female house to get this diamond back. So far I have enjoyed most of the output from the Vaians Brothers - but this film certainly takes a biscuit. A little good advice - wait until it appears on the TV or cable.
