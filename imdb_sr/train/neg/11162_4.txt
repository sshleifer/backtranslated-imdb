Jack Black is a boring figure. This is a boring indie movie for 14-year-olds. Do I have to write eight more lines? This film is a PG 13 version of the indie movie. I really like a movie that has the courage to explore Mexican culture. This film explores Mexican culture deeply. I'm just puffing about his cultural rudeness: Jack Black is so rude. A white person like Jack Black is not my most valuable envoy in Mexican culture, as it was. Presented here. I think IMDb has changed my review.
