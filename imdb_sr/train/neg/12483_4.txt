This film is like Conan Barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. Somewhere below this disdain is a plot, but filmmakers do not do it well, which is a shame because it could be a decent story. Richard Hill gives solid results in the lead, as well as a villain - who unfortunately did not appear in anything else. Even the battle scene is not bad - I love the way Deathstalker allows his sword to "drink" the blood of his victims - and there's plenty of nudity and sex to calm down the general level of machismo. All in all, it's not good - but not necessarily so bad ...
