Not only do extraterrestrial visitors look just like a furry pathetic human woman and not only are alien visitors able to speak English perfectly (with an Australian emphasis), they also call their stars with the same names of our terrestrial astronomers and adding them all! And surpassing all this, all alien life knows how evil, evil, wasteful and destructive people are. And they're ready to tell us how bad it is. If you ever have the opportunity to see this movie, do not. Well, unless you're sick of insomnia or choice, this film or an investigative operation without anesthesia. This film is trying to get a moral, ecological aspect, but it only succeeds to call you and asks it to end soon. .
