This movie has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I've ever seen. It's just as funny as it's hard to do physical work with cramps in the stomach. The film starts badly (I would rate the first few minutes of film 1/10), and then gradually deteriorates, minute by minute. The only way to evaluate it would be some sort of an abysmal spiral negative number that grows in ninety, long minutes. Unfunny is not the right word, but best describes the humor in this video. Somehow, the video succeeds even if the cute, scantily-dressed women and sex look grotesque and uncomfortable. This film is astonishingly bad. I would say that it would be better for us to be locked up with the TITANIC topic that repeats over and over again with Buscemi's character from ESCAPE FROM LA, which is heard in your ear, rather than watching this movie. The sequels are not nearly as bad. If you need to rent a Troma film, get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I'd rather watch Toni Little infomercials back than to see CLASS NUKEM HIGH again. Do not misunderstand me, it took some sort of criminal genius to make the film so horrible and if the film deserved a reward for what was terrible, that's it.
