When I looked at this year's Vrestlemania match, I was so excited and unable to control myself because I was full of excitement. It starts ... and ends. I sit there, angry at hell because of how much I wanted my money back. I mean, you are looking at Vrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) that will fall as a classic and then expect the same and you get the average garbage they have now and then. One moment in the whole show that ruined me was when HBK pulled out !!!! The moment when HBK lost from JOHN PRICE !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is such a loser / poser. She almost destroyed me Vrestlemania 22 when he beat TRIPLE H! I could not watch VVE after I saw Vrestlemania 23. I'm starting to look again (luckily). I again have faith in VVE after Vrestlemania 24 (the largest I've ever seen), which was classic Vrestlemania. It definitely made up for Mania 23 and gave us a lot of unforgettable moments. If you previously watched any of Vrestlemanias, like those who turn you into fans (Vrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan), please do not look at this and make the same mistake I made and leave VVE and for. And if you watch it and get angry, start watching and watching Vrestlemania 24, it's absolutely classical.
