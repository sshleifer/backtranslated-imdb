Unfortunately, this is not 'the best British film for Hellraiser film', although DVD cover claims that this is what deceived me to buy it. However, it is a homage to many of the great horrors of the old, films of the most significant stability of Amicus. The cradle ... is filmed on the mini dv, which although we all know more than a TV feeling than a movie, can be done much better. Each scene, set, and footage appears to be illuminated the same way (standard key, charge, last adjustment), which only improves the inexpensive appearance of the finished piece. The content of the upside is, quite frankly, ridiculous. From the initial shots where we see the obviously sparkling head of the tearing man, the sticky cheap bumps, the effects of the creature and the terrible cg, there was nothing that impressed me. The act is disgusting, from an almost comedy detective to a brummy dwarf, through Dani Filth, the least convincing bad guy of horror I've ever seen. Each of the substrates is more formal than the previous, and the sets are getting worse and worsening how the movie works. Pay attention to 'Mental Asilum' - a Georgian semi-detached house with a bad cg badge outside, and the most beleaguered (and not in a good way) submerged cell I've seen. Four attempts to get to the end of the movie without my attention wander (no, run) away at any opportunity. In fact, I was once in a mood while the film was working. However, this is one of the last known breasts of Emily Booth, which I think one (um, two) things will go to it. When it's off the road, it's all downhill. I heard people say good things about Alec Chandon, and I would love to trust them, but on this evidence I'm not likely to. If you want a decent honor to Amicus, avoid this and go to Mr. Božić's special league. You are currently fighting with Blair Vitch 2: Book of Shadows for the title of the worst movie I have ever seen.
