Visually interesting, but it falls within the originality department. This boring exercise in the technique is weak after the initial battle. Jude Lav has a burnt toast charisma, but in his defense, this movie contains some of the worst dialogues I've ever seen on the big screen. In fact, the scenario is so poor to get you out of the movie, and I've been thinking about work, accounts, my dogs, etc. Paltrow is as woody as they are. This could have been saved by the quick dialogue of the film or through the top camp. My only remark on the technique is that Black & Vhite film (sorry, the computer) helped because it looks like Turner is colored black and white. Just a big, boring clich√©. I'd rather break my femur than to go through this endurance test again.
