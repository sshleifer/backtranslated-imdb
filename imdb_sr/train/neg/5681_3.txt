After I saw and loved Mail (yes, I actually loved Mail), I decided to try another Uwe Boll movie and I chose Seed because I accidentally met him at a local DVD store and should be one of his best Movies. While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the movie was very promising and it seemed like the beginning not too much of the mainstream psychological thriller, it soon went downhill and eventually degraded into one of the most generic slasher movies I've ever seen seen, including enormous amounts of complications, unrealistic emotional reactions and sub-parallel action. It seems Boll tried to make a decent plot, but after a while he gave up. Maybe you should stick to the comedy?! A few good things in this movie are that it manages to create an overall freaky atmosphere, that special effects are better than I expected, and the soundtrack agrees well with the overall atmosphere, but the unbalanced pacing of this film in combination with its ending generic nature makes it It takes half an hour to be pretty boring for watching, which completely destroyed my experience. There are pretty well-made shocking scenes, but they seem to be there just because of the shock values. And do not forget that working with cameras that are sometimes disgusting. I hope that Uwe Boll will one day learn what makes a good movie, because between a lot of terrible movies it seems to make a decent decent movie from time to time. Seed is not one of those.
