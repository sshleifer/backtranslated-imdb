A terrific film with Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome. Here he is intertwined with a dead woman beneath the sea. Soon Rome will be engaged to find out what happened to a woman. Of course, it's a woman beneath the sea. Her friend from the room, Lainie Kazan, will soon be dead on the floor. The boss Richard Conte plays the policeman and friend of Rome. When the owner of the local club is killed, the injustice falls to Rome and becomes an interesting scene of the pursuit. So this is a bad picture if you have to depend on the hunting scene to secure the action. Rakuel Velch plays an intrigue to your door. Her acting leads a lot of things that she wants. Martin Gabel is a retired hooligan whose son is trying to outperform him. By the end of the movie you do not know why the girl was killed. Do not even try to ask.
