I would normally give this movie 6. It deals with a very important topic and it does relatively well - despite Katie Wright, which is an accomplishment in itself. I have no idea if it was Actually, I was told to act like this, or it was naturally irritating, but she did a great job to stop me from taking care of Leki. There is no other dimension besides her confusion, helplessness and senselessness, and how good she is in a whim. I can understand how a young girl who blames herself for losing her friends and whose eating disorder was out of control, was upset, scared and sick. However, Vright's entire performance is based on constant sinking and sniveling, while the rest is boiling. I could not help but feel that the problem of this girl was caused not by the demon who is Bulimia, but by her spine. I very much doubt that this is the meaning of the film.
