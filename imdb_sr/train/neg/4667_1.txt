Visually wrapped, complicated by smaller, incredibly stupid trash. Not even close to Greenavai's better work. Avoid at all costs! Overlapping effects of the "split screen" does nothing more than confusing, the movie is very dark for a long time and "artistic" image compilation is pretentious in extreme. About this movie absolutely do not recommend anything; even nudity is incredibly nervous, and watching how a lot of the movie fills up soon becomes very boring. Besides, how can anyone say that the performance Even MacGregor is brilliant is beyond me. He showed more skills in the Star Vars series, and that's saying something. I was not so impressed with the movie since I saw 'Darby O'Gill and Little People'!
