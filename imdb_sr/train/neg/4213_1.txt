Wow, I'm a big fan of Henry VIII / Tudor and this was ... interesting. The only one I was looking at was Catherine Aragon. And vow ... just wow. I've already seen bad acting, but this has reached new heights. When the actress who played Catherine um ... cried? she screams and screams and I must admit that I've changed many times ... many, many times .... funny, funny things. The only person who even showed any talent was an actress who played Anne Bolein (although I can have prejudices, although I have a little obsession with Anne Bolein, she was a really fascinating woman, she read it, it's worth it!) Also, I read about Tudor's time period and I think the characters were not very precise, they were all very stereotyped. Watch this movie only if you are ready to see a very important period of time, and the important lives of those involved are laughing.
