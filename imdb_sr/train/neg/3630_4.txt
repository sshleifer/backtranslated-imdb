It must be assumed that those who praised this film ("the greatest ever recorded opera," did I read it somewhere?) Or do not care about the opera, they do not care about the Wagner, or do not worry about anything but their desire to appear in culture. Or as a representation of Wagner's Swan song, or as a movie, it seems like an unbridled catastrophe, with a lead-in reading of a score that coincides with the tricks, the horrible realization of the text. It is questionable that people with ideas about what the opera (or, in fact, the performance, especially one by Shakespeare) "should" be allowed anywhere close to a theater or film studio; Siberberg, very modern, but without the slightest justification from Wagner's text, decided that Parsifal was "about" bisexual integration, so that the title character, in later stages, turns into a kind of babe babe, even though he continues to sing a high tenor - a few if some of the actors in the film are singer, and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan, a conductor, seen as a face (but not heard as a voice) by Amfortas, and also appears monstrously in dual display as Batonzile or conductor He ate Monsalwat while playing a husband ike Great Friday - in which, by the way, the transcendental beauty of nature is represented by the spraying of the worshiped and petty saffrons that are stuck in a bad state of peat, an agent that confuses me. In the theater, sometimes we have to figure out such imperfections, but I can not imagine why Siberberg could not connect, for Parsifal and Gurnemanz, mountain pasture as provided for Julie Andrevs in Sound of Music .. The sound is difficult to withstand, high voices and Trumpets especially have an aural reflection that adds another type of fatigue to our impatience with uninspired guiding and paralyzing the ritual. Someone in the second review mentioned a 1951 film in Baireuth, and Knappertsbusch, although his tempos is often very slow, had what he lacked in Jordan, a sense of pulse, a sense of feeling and a flow of music - and after half a century , orchestral sound in this set, in contemporary pressures, is still superior to this film.
