Vhack !!! I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was disappointed when I learned that at the end there were two short scenes. Besides, all the time I actually hit the quick swipe button in advance. Some teenagers go on a trip to Romania with their dad and bite him wolf and turn into a werewolf if he has a full moon. He kills his father and friends. It's been about 30 years, but he's not old enough and enrolled in high school. There she meets a shy teacher who ends up, and then she has children with her. This film is sucked and I do not recommend it to anyone. Instead, read the war and peace. Only Mrs. Hartman did a great job. Look at this young Bob Sageta in this !!
