At this point, I am discussing whether I should even finish watching this "poppicock" movie. They had a pretty interesting idea, with a buried movie, and that's it. So far this incomprehensible mess has no real story. There is a burial set, some wolf's head monster runs amok, amulet, and a bunch of bad actors attacked by a wolf masks everything that is. What I missed, if I had a good sense of throwing this nonsense is dina buggi chase, some very bad C.G.I., some incredibly stupid dialogue, worse C.G.I., and a paper-fought hero. Apart from the original idea, this film has absolutely zero. My mistake was to continue to watch. - MERK
