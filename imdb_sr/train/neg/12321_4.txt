Since I hate to read a long essay in the hope that I will find the point and be disappointed, I will first tell everyone that this film is terrible. Terribly terrible. And not surprisingly for the reasons listed in the first review. I thought that I could agree with him, since he gave the act he had earned, but he was sadly rooted after he read what he said. I am ashamed of taking the same side as someone who commented that the movie "definitely does not have a nice female". Allow me to say the first: "Wow, that was definitely a serious depth review there. My mind is hardly able to grasp the philosophical thinking about this film." Seriously, however, the lack of "handsome females" should not be considered relevant to the film. If you are desperate enough for "handsome females," you should really watch other types of movies, and not necessarily belong to the sci-fi category.
