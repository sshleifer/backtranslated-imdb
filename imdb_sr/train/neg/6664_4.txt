What begins as a deliciously beautiful land, a reckless and gentle enjoyment in a romantic story changes the pace as Edward Norton initially charming Harlan gradually reveals more about herself and things turn evil, because the film gradually changes from the southern romance to the modern wild West. A nice rancher (Norton) walks into the city and fascinates the young girl (Evan Rachel Vood), who seems to be saving from the dead end of her life with her shrewd father with a whirlwind romantic, but gradually it becomes apparent that she has this cowboy more than you can see. Edward Norton ?? a real chameleon actor (with a change of hair on his face to match) playing a rural peasant, an emphasis on a little suspicious, but perhaps because he's just trying to play a role without worry about the accent. He certainly seems to have no effort to make all the tiny little adjustments as we learn more about Harlan. However, with too little change this means that we are never sure exactly where Harlan is coming from, and what looked like a good Norton gradually becomes confused. Evan Rachel Vood is cute, and she never had much to do except the beating at Norton. Down in the valley strikes like a somewhat uneven story because of a change in pace and never. Really motivating the protagonists with clear sympathies of the audience towards the characters remains uncertain. Do we need this wanderer or not? Even after a dramatic turn of events, it remains unclear. This ambiguity is at the expense of the film, as if the writer could not decide what kind of story they wanted to say and agreed on a kind of hotch-potch. If the film remained one or the other, it could have been a solid film, but since that's what we left, something is messy. Lovers of old-fashioned romance will enjoy the part of the film, but will postpone the dark tone. The final lovers of Norton (or fans of the lush landscape of the San Fernando Valley) give this flaw.
