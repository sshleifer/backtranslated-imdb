As you have heard or maybe you have not heard, in this movie there is no actual battle between vampires or zombies. Then one can wonder why the title suggested such a thing, but it is really appropriate, because nothing else in this movie made sense. There was absolutely no story or complication, only things are happening. The acting was incredibly bad, worse than bad commercials. Not only was there not been a struggle between vampire and zombies, but I think there was only one scene with zombies even in it. Their makeup looked like it was applied by a girl of 8 years. The scene was quite accidental and unreasonable and she had one of the characters who fought with zombies with hedge trimmers (I'm not kidding), but they used the sound effects of a chainsaw. the film I've ever seen in my life. The only circumstance that I would not totally mock any person responsible for the production of this movie is that I found out that it was completely produced by the 11-year-old. Still, even with all the criticisms I propose to watch this movie solely on the basis of the fact that it may be the worst movie ever, and that's why it's pretty comical. Even the count of defects would entertain you.
