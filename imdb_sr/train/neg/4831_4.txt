I rented this film on Netflick after he won all the Oscars, to see if it was really so good. Hurt Locker is a very realistic view (in the largest part) of a group of military rotations. in Iraq. The film focuses on Vill James, an unruly soldier who repairs his adrenaline from taking risks and destroying bombs. Where this film seems to be missing in my opinion is the plot and direction of the film. This film does not have a clear plan unlike other films such as Black Havk Dovn. This film tries to focus more on characters and their different views on war. Bigel's real work is focusing on characters, but there are many points in the movie where the dialogue seems to be pulling. Hurt Locker is 131 minutes long, but looks like a 3-hour movie. One scene in a movie that was particularly terrible and ruined was the perfect credibility of the movies, it was a sniper scene in half the film. It was unrealistic, and very long. All in all, I thought this film was OK, but the reason I gave it 6 instead of 7 was because it was a big loss for winning the best picture. on the Oscars. I felt like this movie could have been much better because Saving Private Rian lost the best picture, but he was much better than this movie. Another significant mention is Black Havk Dovn who won only 2 Oscars. Frankly, I do not know how this got the best picture. If you are looking for an action war, rent Black Havk Dovn. This film will be forgotten in a year or two.
