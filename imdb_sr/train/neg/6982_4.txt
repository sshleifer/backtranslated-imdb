A humorous story of the American Revolution. When the farmer 'Tom Dobb' (Al Pacino) and his son arrive at the New York port, they are promptly called by street dick Annie Lennock ... Annie Lennock. ... contributing to the war effort. After being knocked down by chunks of chains fired from British cannons, Tom and his son were immediately punished by sympathizers of the Continental Army "Daisi" (Nastassja Kinski) because they "do not stand on the ground". After this moment of Kodak, there is a series of digressive chapters, including Tom's participation in "hunting hunts" in which he has to wear the model of "poor old Georgie Washington" stuffed in the face while running from the lace captain of England (Manning Redvood) and grilling with a group of Indians Iroquois are planning the best way to sneak into battle so that Al and his incompetent kid can kick out British officer Donald Sutherland. Director Hugh Hudson represents a unique style of film creativity, and the atmosphere is thick like a linguistic fog, but the screenwriting image of red cats as evil monsters once again reveals Hollywood patented hatred toward the British. <br /> <br> Steven Berkoff appears as an American soldier.
