First seen 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeies): Over-the-top rehash of 70 alleged horrors as of Friday 13th (version 1 through any?). Here I can not imagine a lot of redemption except (or can I remember something?) The story revolves around a bunch of stupid people who listen to the radio program a year after some children were killed in the forest as 'homage' on this, allegedly. But, look, look, one of the stupid people has to do with the real event, because her sister was one of those killed (again, how stupid it would be even part of it). Guess what? The killer is back on it and from the very beginning we are disgusting with who it is (so there is no mystery at all). And besides all this, where are 'cops' and why they are not called. I can not believe that this film was financed by someone and made. You would think that until now the American people would have been rated a little higher, at least in their film experience, but not from this filmmaker.
