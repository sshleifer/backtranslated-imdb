I was very excited when this series was premiered in 2005. The premise was very simple and attractive: each episode would be a one-hour mini-movie directed by a well-known horror director. Then, when I finally looked at them, it was a bit of a disappointment. From this first season some good episodes appeared, but all in all, it was a mixed bag. I attributed it to the learning curve, and I concluded that Season 2 would be much better. Boy, I was in shock. At least one season had several good stories here and there. Season 2 (with the exception of "Black Cat" starring great Jeffrey Combs) was a complete and complete loss for me. The "Sounds Like" episode can be the worst thing I've seen on television in the last 10 years, and most of the other episodes are not much better. I really hope that Season 3 will turn next year, but I will not hold my breath.
