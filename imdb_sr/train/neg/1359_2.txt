A good actor is terribly lost in this slower than molasses and accidentally stunning comedy. Peter Ustinov is trying to revive something here, but the result is a boring boredom that misses all the right shots that could make it visible. Regardless of favorable comments, this film is terrible. Badli designed. Badli edited. Badli acted. Badli screamed. You have to sit through hundreds of movies to find one of these bad things. Confused and disturbing complication is about Ustin's embarking on an American insurance company to hack a computer and get millions of pounds. As it does, it's beyond clumsiness and credibility (he only teaches his computer skills, apparently overnight reading some pamphlets, and hoodwinks by computer scientist Robert Morley to go to South America and steal his identity). As a plot, Ustin's romance fellow loner Maggie Smith, who just accidentally became his secretary accidentally after having received an apartment in his own building. In the end, he shares scenes with sex podtones with Bob Nevhart, who do not go anywhere, while Ustinov goes to vaccinate money and tries to stay ahead of Nevhart and Karl Malden. Then she married Smith and went to Brazil, which became the main finale of almost every British comedy since when (Nune on a race? A fish called Vanda?) The sudden turning of the ending is more ridiculous than anything it was preceded. By the end I thought that I had to be really on my rocker to stand like this. Even the comedy of Cesar Romero did not help. One of the brightest, badly guided "comedies" I've ever seen, and certainly the worst riviera. Do not waste your time. If you love this, you need to see better movies.
