Fina cast can not raise this routine story about a secretary killed by a married paramour. In fact, there are more questions than answers to this unilateral story of romance and murder; and since we were only received by the Prosecution, none of these questions will be answered. It's a type of trip that likes the "He Voman, Man Hater" clubs in America. As shown, this is the story of an innocent woman who is accidentally "caught up" in a romantic relationship with a married, distinguished lawyer. Could it be possible that AKM, she did not have two moments for her boyfriend and had an affair with a married man, could have avoided this nasty killer incident? When you look at this, do not worry about going to the fridge, you will not miss anything.
