This is the greatest burden of shit I've seen for a long time. The last time I hated the movie while I watched "28 Days Later" and "Magnolia". There is absolutely no point in this film, except to see some really sick and twisted scenes of sex / rape, Gillian Anderson is released on the side of the road, and every sentence of the dialogue must use the word "F" at least several times. It has extremely low cost and very small budget. My friend and I finally turned off the movie after half an hour. We tried to give her a chance, but nothing could save this rude. DO NOT WAIT !!!
