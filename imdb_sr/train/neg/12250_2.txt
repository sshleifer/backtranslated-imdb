After watching Tobe Hooper, Crocodile, in 2000, I developed a great interest in the niche of college / crocodile in the genre of exploitation / monsters. I am looking forward to an unwilling producer who will follow several sequels of these wonderful candy bonuses of the camp. If only Ed Vood could bring his subtle sense of sense and dignity to these extraordinary scenarios. With Edo who writes scenarios, and full of monkeys who create special effects on a computer, all we need is to make from chicken food with Russ Meier breasts and Ren Hoek breast implants. While Tobe Hooper's lame opus was referring to his films, Blood Surf chose to get a bunch of older themes from the godfather of other films. See if you can look next to the set of Revenge of the Nerds sequences to find allusions / homages? / Rip-offs for Javs, Temple of Doom, The Last Crusade in Indiana Jones, Convent, Godzilla 2000 and any James Bond movie. Likewise, try finding a TV ready to fade where the editor gave up the meaning of the stock. I was disappointed that the crocodile could not test its sotto fruit tenor with Solilokui about ecology ... or impressive appreciation, but quasi-captain Ahab stories got his tour. Maybe in the years to come we will see a gallop to gallop after the shooting in the golden sunset. Or, hopefully, the monkey will rush the silence into the toilet of the international space station for dwarfs and enjoy the exploiting waves of monkeys / dwarfs / crocodiles. All in all, I missed the bars in surf music.
