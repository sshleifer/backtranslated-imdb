I was so upset with real recordings at the beginning of the movie that I was sick on my stomach and I finished the film. How any one can give this movie more than 1 rating confuses me. I know that the intent of the film is to shock, but to show real footage of a dog that was alive (keeping my vomiting while typing) - Please! I turned it off after a scene with decomposing children. Most of the time until then I had covered eyes. No wonder this film was found in a cheap bin in HMV. I really do not want to see another movie of this Uve person. Anyone who enjoys it needs therapy. Period.
