The thematic sphere of cinema since its creation is a genre that includes seductive women whose cunning and means attract the underprivileged men not only in their own hands, but also in the terrible circumstances that usually endanger the male victims only, as well as the uncertainty whether or not it will be forced to they take medication, and here Susan Lucci performs like a siren, although her acting pieces from a predominantly sapphire pedigree are not adequate to make her performance credible. Isabelle (Lucci), the unstained wife of venture capitalist Steven Collins (John O'Hurlei), starts a love affair just for fun with yacht seller Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), simply a baggage for her but a serious heartbreak for Richard obviously enchanted by his mistress He uses his lust by engaging him in a risky plot that will grow into a scheme of murderous intent. When Davis is convinced that the crafty Isabella is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband, he desperately tries to get rid of what he considers a marriage trap to be able to marry himself, believing that the only clear solution is his condition in a basic essay on the employment of a professional killer who will be rid of allegedly violent Stevart. At the time of the Collins attack, a couple of police detectives, taken by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, are becoming more and more curious about Isabelle's possible involvement in the crime, while at the same time the reality is astonished Richard who may have to pay an expensive price in exchange for his maneuvering. Lucci and Kasnoff are properly set up as a sustainable couple of conspirators, each reading a book that makes it boring, not a charming set of lovers, but O'Hurlei and McDermott offer strong turns in a film that hurts the hacked scenario as well as non-innovative directions and design elements. Released on Fremantle DVD, this rather unbridled affair that shows a man under the seduction magic benefits from superior visual and audio quality, and although there are no additional features, the above-average production quality improves the competent efforts of cameraman Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards.
