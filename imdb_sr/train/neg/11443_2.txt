Here's one you can look at with the right face, with such a bad scenario, even Vill Ferrell would not be in it. In HOT HOT ROD there are two laughs. 1. Punch-Dance. Rod "should go to your peaceful place" before anyone can say Kevin Bacon, he makes a passionate, upgraded body for bands who want to have a great hairstyle from Europe. > 2. John Farnham, You're the voice. In one of those epic sequences in which the star and his cohorts are doing The Shlomo Valk Down Main Street, a citizens follow their heels, the soundtrack is a gag. How did filmmakers even come across this Austrian cameraman? Great Australian singer (and a real talent), which is celebrated in the early '70s covering Raindrops Keep Fallin' On Mi Head, then disappeared until 1986 for The Big Comeback with your voice, the anthem of John Farnham is so wonderfully cheesy <br /> <br Apart from these two highlights in the film - which are ruined anyway with unexpected writing - the rest of the film is like choking on someone else's vomit. Andi Samberg is Rod, an unsuccessful jumper who never made a leap. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that it drives the moped into the heart of darkness. Or his fake mustache. Yes, somebody really thought it was funny. <Br /> <br /> No one jump under his stellar band plans extravagance of 15 buses - which would surely kill less bad comedians, such as Jason Biggs and Rob Schneider - to win the day and preserve his stepfather and also wiped cancer and whatever ... Who's watching these films for the plot at all? By the way (as usual with the moronic traces in these comedies), he gets healthy fish (Isla Fisher), who must surely be retarded to consider the replacement chromosome with this loser. <Br /> <br /> Sissi Spacek (Carrie, 1976) has so little to do that almost phoned in his performance - then she changed her mind and just hung up. Ian McShane must have lost his bet to be here.
