I am probably one of the few who really read the book by Stephen King, the one on which this film was based. After reading this excellent work, I could not wait to look at it. After watching the movie, I was totally disappointed. The only thing this film has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is put into play. The main goal is to survive. But it's not in the arena. He relaxed in the city and must escape from the games (I think I would call them) villians, who do not absolutely have any resemblance to movie characters. This room made a lot of tension and suspension and ended up with a climax. The film was absolute trash. There was no film quality. I fully respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he messed with this.
