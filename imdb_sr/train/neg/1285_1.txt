Born, raised and educated in Scotland, I was amazed by this disgusting display of a man who is neither more nor less than a cattle miner. Worse, the thread of the whole film was sex in one form or another, implicitly or verbally. To see this, one might think that Scotland from the 18th century was populated by a bunch of sexual pervert and homosexuals. Lange was a joke that looked like a "young" mother at age 49, but Liam Neeson was worse! Swimming in the Scottish Lake is not common because they were showing it - but they gave them another opportunity to show how we are sexually guided. Save money and watch Pinnochio.
