Normally, I am a pretty generous critic, but in the case of this film I have to say that it was very bad. I'm wondering how positive the majority of reviews are. There were some great shots, but it's a shame that they are lost on this movie hole. It could have worked that "Daggers" was a pure action movie, not a romance, but unfortunately the movie was built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between any of the pairs, everything that exists between Mei and her men seems to be more lusty than love, and that the dialogue is mostly stupid. This may be a translation problem, but often the use of the word "flirt" reminded me of the 8th grade, not the head, together forever, worth the dying - for love; I also felt the metaphor of the wind blowing on the head. The audience has very little information about the characters they really care about and, consequently, very little emotional investment in the film as a whole. I wanted the remote control to swiftly rewind, I was prone to my seat and ready to snort, but mostly I just squeezed a lot. ******* spoiler ***** Now, cream on the cake. Or rather, adding insult to injury. The ending was really one of the most horrible, funny I've ever seen. Boys are arguing, shouting and shouting and hacking each other. Oh, and then the snow begins to fall. Randomli. Oh, and then Mei (a dagger in his heart) suddenly pops out of the weeds. Then he throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach his destination, even a slow midscreen to hit a small drop of blood. Wow, cool. Well, then Mei dies in the end, it's because he threw a dagger lying in his chest and bleeding to death. Jin sings, a jerk, keeps his body close, the screen becomes empty. Me and the people who surround me laugh. It's not a good sign. Visually stunning, but in the end.
