Nearly word goes this movie is bad and lacks conviction, but again, most people would struggle to show the commitment of the scripts as unkind. The dialogue really does not run and sometimes as it is in this case is less (or should be). This is also supported by unusual scenes (e.g., Slow Walk with Cemetry) that you think might bring you somewhere, but it seems they only spend a few seconds of your life. The combination of a gangster / situational comedy that I'm sure was at that time a good idea, but if there ever was a case that someone should be honest with the screenwriter, then that was the case. but then he seems to have one character that always plays, so I'm beginning to wonder if he got the script or just recorded it and said he reacted as normal. Finally - humor. This reminds me of 'Pithon (I think) a quote about Shakespeare, about his' comedies' - If he thought he was humorous, he would put a joke on him. So I did not see any one. Do not waste your time - I'm because I watched him with a friend and hoped it would be better. <br /> <br /> No.
