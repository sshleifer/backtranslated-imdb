Please, forget it. Please. Please. This is the worst movie I've ever had an accident to watch. I think the film is an insult to my brain, as well as my back side that both suffered from me and watching this movie. I have yet to see what the damage caused my vision and my ability to complete the sentences. What a waste of garbage! And do not start me about acting ... Somebody help me forget! "Veird Science" - come back !! It's all forgiven ... I'm "proud" to give this movie the first one here on the IMDb ... And I voted for hundreds of movies ... Many of them c but this is so bad that they do not I can not believe it either. Somebody actually came up with the idea and thought it was worth it to become a movie? Somebody actually read the script and decided to produce a movie? Somebody read the script and got an audition? Somebody saw a movie and decided not to put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity? * These * are the questions I want to answer. Not a philosophical question about that tree in the forest and well, you know ...
