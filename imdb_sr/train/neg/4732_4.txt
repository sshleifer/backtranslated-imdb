If I write a review about a movie, it may stay with me ... but generally I expect to forget that I've seen this for only two weeks. Then why torment? Because I see again that I'm watching a low-rated movie that was fun to watch. I did not expect to be able to stay in the room while she was still there. It was not great, but at least it was not unbearable ... it was not a comedy of errors. which always leads me. It was just sweet ... and if you can not take it, stay in the locker room. I agree with those who defend this film because it will surely satisfy the target demographic group and will not be completely boring for adults. side distributor. It's sure to be stupid and just a little fun, but at least not sucking (as many have said it is). Perhaps these people are afraid of their sensitive sides? I have a tendency to evaluate the ringtone, so 4.5 or 6 is actually a good bet in my book. By giving 4, he makes sense and will strengthen his rating at the time of writing this text. By giving him 1 or 10, as most have done so far, makes the rating numbers meaningless. I can not believe how people feel in one way or another about this forgotten palm (or even trying to write about it). Do I miss something? In any case, it should be noted that Emma Roberts performs her role as Clairedicata quite convincingly. Ariell Kebbel often writes in b * ch roles, but does not disappoint when her character gets credit. You can also recognize Bruce Spence playing Leonardo, although his role is helpful. You can safely miss this if you are an adult. But if there is a pre-teen girl in your life, rent this movie for her ... and be prepared not to hate her (maybe you even enjoy).
