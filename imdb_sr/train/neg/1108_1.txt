A dull and senseless little thing (damn snowflake). Poorly written, with meaningless and wooden dialogue. You do not care whether the characters (indeed, even if the actors themselves) live or die. Little grace or charm, little action, little attention to the whole thing. Perhaps some of the sets and environments will be interesting - those gaps between the boards of all buildings can be the true way in which life lived. The outline encounter is unnecessary and disturbing, and the Hoppalong Cassidy himself is both dull and incapable.
