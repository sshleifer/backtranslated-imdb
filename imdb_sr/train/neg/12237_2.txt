Original Claimation Rudolph: Pretty good. Original Frosti cartoon: It takes a bit of work, but it could be worse. But Frost and Rudolph together on July 4th? Come on! Give me BREAK !!! This was a movie that should not have been filmed. It was bad. That did not mean any vacation in particular, except on the 4th of July. It has deteriorated since the time when Frost and Rudolph are usually associated with Christmas holidays. And every movie can be ruined by too many singing. Frequent songs made this movie look much longer than it really was. The film attempted to combine two famous Chirstmastime characters with an American traditional holiday (which almost makes it "limiting" to America), too many meaningless songs and a bad picture. The result? A bad movie that can not be watched at any time of the year. I suggest you renounce this film even if you love Frost and Rudolf.
