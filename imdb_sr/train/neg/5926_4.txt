Another weak entry into the third season, 'Is there a truth without beauty?' it still has at least one key element of the plot that is very different, and for Spock to say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who has to wear in a black box, because his look is so terrible that people are crazy. Too bad the episode can not satisfy this incredible premise. Obviously, it seems to me to be a mistake that an alien is ever "shown", because his actual appearance does not in any way approach such intimidating construction; All we get is a standard Star Trek psychedelic light display that is used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when a ship goes through a magnetic storm or something like that. In any case, Mr. Spok can at least tolerate Kolos's appearance, and then only if Spock carries a special visor. (I used to think that the extraterrestrial name was 'Carlos', which I found witty, but I resigned.) Spock is obliged to reconcile with Colossus at some point, so an alien can return the company to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock / Collos returns to end his mind, Spock forgets his visor. Uh Oh. He crazy, but eventually recovered with the help of Kolos's assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This may have been a very bizarre, great episode, but it is poorly targeted and encounters another bad series of this series last season.
