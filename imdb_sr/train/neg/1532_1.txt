Although I am well warned, I actually sat down to watch this movie. Partly because I usually give each movie a break, and because I thought one movie can not be so bad. I'm fine. Even George Kennedy, Barri Bostvick and Ben Stein failed to save this tune from a ton of brick. Only once during this humor left the tragedy of lies. Namely, during the time Simon says the scene. Other jokes are either poorly performed or simply optional. And some of them really see how they are getting miles away. This movie simply does not have what it takes to be a good parody like an airplane! (I + II), naked pistol (I + II + III), or Scari Movie. Everyone had A. funny gigs, B. good dialogue and the most important of all C. unforgettable quotes. Men in white do not have any of the above. Calling this bad movie would be accentuated. AVOID THIS FILM YOU MUST! DISCLAIM YOUR WARNING!
