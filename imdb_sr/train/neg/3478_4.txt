Drev Latham (Ben Affleck) is determined not to be lonely this Christmas. Not only is the Devil a millionaire; but also disgusting and guilty of being very grandiose. Drev returns to the house where he grew up and offers a family living there, Valco, $ 250,000 to be his "family" through the Christmas season. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) is not willing, but greedy enough to accept the offer from Drew. Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara) has little to say in this subject, but she learns that she likes to turn the Drev ... it's not exactly the same feeling with her daughter Christina Applegate, but there's room for change. The girlfriend Missi (Jennifer Morrison) follows the Tree and wants her people to meet his family. Real entertainment is on sale, because happy Noel becomes a hilarious dysfunctional nightmare. Other members of the cast: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Maci, David Selbi and Stephanie Faraci. Affleck is a comedy, though weird.
