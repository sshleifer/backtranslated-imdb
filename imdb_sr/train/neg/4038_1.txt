As a terrible shield, he would have to write pages and pages, so it is enough to say that this is a monument to poor directing. "When directors go hard" it should have been the name of this production. Indeed, directors should bring their work into a sense of visual style and storytelling that drives the story forward. How's the story going? Of course, there is also the nonsense of "random numbering". Obviously this is by chance cut. I assume this is too big a job for good editing. The shield that lay as one of the most prolific and unbelievable shows of all time.
