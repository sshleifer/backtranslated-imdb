I love musicals, but like Dickens fan I love this. ** MILD SPOILERS ** Hungry boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in a workhouse? The poor London goes out to sing? Fagin and Dodger go to the sunset? He is not really a novel. As far as I remember, Dodger was publicly hanged and Fagin went crazy in jail. ** END OF SPOILER ** Oliver Reed is very weak as Sikes, does nothing more than a reluctance to show his evil. The worst, however, is Mark Lester as Oliver, who often finds himself in such an awkward and passionate way to wonder if he is really the main character. His presentation does not in any way contribute to the fact that the best they could do when he sings is the voice in the girl. I suppose they did not realize that triple boys can be found in almost every church in England. -80's. Avoid this bored music.
