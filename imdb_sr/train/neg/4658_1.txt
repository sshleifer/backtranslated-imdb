BRIEF MEETING is a horrible and senseless remake of David Lean's 1945 classic, based on Noel Covard's "Still Life". The doctor removes a particle of the female eye's grain at the railway station, he is in a poor relationship, happily married to a social worker of Italian descent. They happen randomly on the second occasion, they create immediate attraction and agree to meet every Wednesday. The couple falls in love, but after having spent several afternoons, they realize that they do not have a real chance of happiness and agree to separate. Covard's original one-act game was related to two ordinary people who fall in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two superstars and veterans of the Hollywood epics, are no one's idea of ​​'ordinary people'. Loren is particularly wrong - Sophia Loren in full composition, looks like a million dollars, working as a voluntary volunteer social worker in a counseling service for citizens, does not sound true. Burton, who looks exhausted, with colored hair, too much makeup and wears shoes with a platform, does not find it like your average general practitioner. In this regard, you can not blame them for the affair after seeing their spouses. Burton is married to a literary critic who opens her poisonous criticism tonight and treats her husband with utter contempt. Lorena's husband, Jack Hedley, is hunting home all day and is extremely boring: the most exciting thing he ever did is almost six years earlier. Their final scene together will cause nausea, ("You've traveled a long way, far away"). This great British actor, John LeMesurier, has three minutes as Burton's friend, and seems to be a little drunk, speaking his words with a bare voice. It's a sad and unforgettable performance in a dreary, terrible repeated cinema classics. Avoid at all costs.
