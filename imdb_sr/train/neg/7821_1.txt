Did the filmmakers even check out this movie before they let it go? The script jumps from place to place without much explanation. The beginning does not explain whether it's overtaken or not. It begins with Superman's beginnings on Earth, then jumps to the point after the last movie - but that does not actually alert the viewer to that. Very confusing! Superman himself is weak and he needs Prozac. He is portrayed as a potential householder, a persecutor, and someone who is obviously depressed and confused. This type of character rarely makes an interesting hero. The place is absolutely funny. Superman who ended up in the hospital made me kill him. I'm seriously waiting for the SNL skit in which Superman appears on Maurie Povichu and Mauri says: "The results are in - in the case of a child, Superman, you are a father." To sum up - OK acting this Superman and Kevin Spaceia, but HORRIBLE script. The film is basically incomprehensible.
