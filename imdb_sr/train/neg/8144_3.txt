I just saw it at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. The synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good, so we decided to look at this. I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed. Besides being badly written, it was boring. I will not take away the actors because I can not do much with this bad script. The first bite was a clich√© without ironicity, over the greatest seriousness, and it was not fun. The movie would have been better if Hunt Hoe went with a sense of horror. Instead, he took it seriously and this resulted in a boring film. I can not recommend this movie. It was too long and everything was all bad.
