Okay, I really do not have too much to say about this movie, in addition: I've seen over 4,000 movies in my life, and more than 2,300 movies were horror movies. Although I have some difficulty in deciding which is the best (unlike my favorite, which I can tell you is George A. Romero DAVN of the Dead), I can tell you without any hesitation that Todd Sheets ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is the absolute Worst Horror movie I've ever had I saw it. Simply I can not say anything about this movie. Acting, dialogue, direction, makeup, music ... Every aspect of this film is simply far below what is acceptable, to stun my mind that it has ever been published. Even if you are a complete horror or zombie movie, please pay attention to my warning and DO NOT waste time on this garbage. There is no satisfaction to see us this. You will not even laugh at the utmost incapacity on the screen ... Believe me. Please.
