*** SPOILER *** Do not read this if you are thinking about watching this movie, although it would be a waste of time. (By the way: The plot is so predictable that there is no difference if you read this or not) If you are wondering if you see "Coiote Ugli" or not: no! It's not worth the money for a ticket either for VHS / DVD. Typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick", you might say. The action itself is shallow as it can be, a funny and uncritical version of the American dream. A young pretty girl from a small town became a big success in New York. Several desperate attempts to give the film to any depth failed, such as the "tragic" misfortune of the father, "the difficulties" of Violet's relationship with his boyfriend, and so on. McNalli (Director) is trying to awaken the audience's pity, and sadness does not have the chance to succeed in this attempt because of a bad scenario and shallow acting. Especially Piper Perabo completely fails to convince one of Jersey's fear of singing in front of the audience. The only good (and quite fun thing) about "Coiote Ugli" is John Goodman, which represents a small grip of this film's hope. I was very amazed that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this film. First, "Spooked in 60 seconds" and now this ... what happened to big movies like "The Rock" and "Con Air"? That was true with Bruckheimer. If you're looking for a superficial movie with good women just to have a relaxed evening, you better go and see "Charlie's Angels" (it's much fun, fun, and self-irony) instead of this movement . Two inches down (3 out of 10).
