This film is an idiotic attempt of some kind of action thriller. A bus on the road to Las Vegas was attacked by a group of white hijackers who drove dinars. Take them to the desert and then steal all their valuables. The action is constantly changing. One moment they want to kidnap a rich daughter of a rancher, and the next search for a $ 90,000 stamp collector. Dialogue is terrible. Please do not watch this movie.
