There is absolutely no reason to waste time with this "movie." The original said that everything was still there. Or read a book or explore the story, and you will realize that this remake is ridiculous. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? His sister could do a better job! After Holcomb & Edgerton, KS where the story unfolds, sets and locations looked like NICE like Kansas. The originator is riveting, from shooting a location to using the actual participants, weapons and things of the victims. Unforgettable appearances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Soundtrack bi Kuinci Jones and Cinema Conrad Hall ... The original is available on DVD in videscreen format. Let this party die fast.
