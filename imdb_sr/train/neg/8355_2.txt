Vanda Nevada is a film about pseudility fantasy that uses ideas about 1979 about an illegal romance for girls of 13 years. Script, pacing and direction are just as horrible. Action sequences defy belief. The characters speak with simplified diction, which is usually found in films with a target below 10, but also includes multiple sexual references that include Shield's character and graphic death. The film wants to be a comedy at some level, but it's never a funny, adventurous picture, but the plot and action are unheard of, and a movie for children, but it introduces pedophilia and raping children as real options. He also wants to be an image of a friend, an image with years, a ghost film, an Indian spiritual film, a travelogue and a western film. The overall effect is massive nonsense with a nasty twist. Vanda Nevada is a complete waste of time, unless you want to see a lot of great Grand Canion videos. It is okay.
