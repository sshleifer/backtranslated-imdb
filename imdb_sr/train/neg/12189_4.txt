I'm surprised that this film is rated so high, although if I go with a typical scoring scale of 71, it's c- or d and maybe that's fine, but this movie was just a typical thriller, besides boring spores and unrealistic. It's not that the typical thriller was real, but it seemed that this was trying, and yet the woman who was picked up did not file a lawsuit because she did not want to be cross-examined in court, even though she would put the man who broke her hand and smashed it for life, but not for the attorney she felt for her family, and not only for random people she did not even know. There were other similar problems with a movie that would be fine if there was some morale to seize the film, but a few moral questions like whether it was right to try to kill / beat Kadi before he did anything unlawful. she presented a small side because, in the end, Kadi was just a crazy bastard who retreated in vengeance, so sure that the lawyer justified his family by waiting for Kadi to really rape his daughter in order to do something legally about that would be a bit absurd. So now I've just pulled more of my life for this stupid movie so please do not see it, so your life will not be stopped, and so my 2 1/2 hours or something like that meant something.
