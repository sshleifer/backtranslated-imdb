(spoilers) I should have understood. The DVD did not even show how long it was. I thought Vild Cardz was the worst anime movie I ever saw. This one is much worse. Does not make sense. Tiled together. So we can see big breasts on a figure that does not support them. It had to be a student film. This must got C grade 2/10 Quality: 1/10 Fun: 6/10 (until I found out that it will not end.) Ending made darn sense Replaceable: 0/10
