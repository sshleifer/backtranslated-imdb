I completely agree with other comments that somebody has to do with this movie. Must be one of the worst French movies I've seen for a long time (actually along with Brothervood). wolves, 2 horrible movies in a short period of time). It's very sad, because the acting game is really interesting and the original idea is fun. Especially Antoine DeCaunes and Jean Rochefort among my dear people, I was bitterly disappointed to see them endangered in such a bad movie. Lou Doion is pretty bad, as usually proves that a nice face and famous parents can get you into movies, but they do not give you the necessary talent. Avoid this film, if you want to laugh at watching Alain Chabat or some nice piece of fun such as LA FILLE DE DARTARTNAN.
