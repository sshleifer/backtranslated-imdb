Ignoring the plot, the uninteresting characters and the sub-parallel (at least) the dialogue is troubling this television production, which could hardly have been interesting even with a billion-dollar production budget. Characters are not convincing, in their motives, actions or their professions. The action is read as a bad hacker Dungeons and Dragons (TM), but with plasma guns and forces. There are serious problems related to continuity and the degree of meaningless interactions between characters has, at least, this writer. Avoid it as a plague. Watch any episode of Dark Angel and you will have a better acting, dialogue and plot. Iuck.
