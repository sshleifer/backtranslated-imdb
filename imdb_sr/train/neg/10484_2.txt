As a fan of Elvis, I can not understand how this can be done. It's by far the worst Elvis film of all time, totally stupid, stupid and many mistakes about the King. Come on, Elvis's tomb in a public park? To mention the Suspicious minds of 1958? ... and these are just two examples. Some people in the act of trying to do their best, Mike Starr is ridiculous (especially as an imitator), Tom Hanks comedy is a surprise, but the guy who plays Young Elvis is a shit. minute. If you want to see an ultra-cheap, crazy but absolutely funny little movie about Elvis, I really recommend "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this riot.
