I would have thought that the first landing on the Moon would be dramatically enough without the need to invent something about it. However, it seems that this documentary should throw everything in the most terrible possible light. He talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions Armstrong's almost fatal accident with the training vehicle, as if the trainer and the spacecraft had any connections. This leads to problems with overloading the computer (alarms 1202 and 1201) encountered during the final landing sequence sound like almost a disaster when it was just an interference, not a risk for the crew. It takes a "thirty seconds" call to mark thirty seconds of remaining fuel before it expires, when it is actually thirty seconds before the interruption is required. If you want to see the documentary or dramatization of Apollo 11, go to "From Earth to Moon" or one of the PBS documentaries, but skip this one.
