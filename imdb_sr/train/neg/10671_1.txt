MST 3000 should work this movie. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. First, you find that the shooter does not have a bank account and no history after leaving the army in 1993 and pays the rent in cash. In hell there is no way for such a person to ever be so close to the president that he does not mention a high-profile job. Also, the chief of security of POTHUS would not be so emotional to start drinking in a mist if the president was shot. This film is sucked. I can not express the extreme that this film was. Every actor was terrible. Even a fish in a trailer park. Shit on this garbage. What a waste of time.
