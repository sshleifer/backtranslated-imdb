I had an unhappiness that I watched this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, was the fan of the first one. This movie down to the right! He missed the magic of the first. You could understand every word the mice say, the animation is exhausted, the palace is much different from the first movie, there are new characters that have never been mentioned and were terrible, fortunately the prince did not have many lines that held him. from stupid sound. Basically, like the Lion King 1 1/2, apart from his various stories told by mice. The reason I gave this 2 out of 10 is because the songs that were not singing the characters were the best.
