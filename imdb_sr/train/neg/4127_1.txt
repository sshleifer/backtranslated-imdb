A movie as bad as this should be retrieved from all the shops around the world. So full of boring, boring, non-aggressive characters, and with the main character with such a boring attitude and a dry voice that constantly gives an unhandled voice for every action and feeling, this film holds the record for the most challenging film I've ever watched. Since I paid the money to own it, I felt obliged to see it and regret it. My head hurts me because of the terribly boring characters and their meaningless, complex lives. A lot of children who have nothing to do with anything, they are all frigid and the worst of all, have a terrible dialogue, they only think while the main character is trying to find a meeting with a girl. Bored, so much so that my friend was shaking with hate and I was red with shame that I rejected 6 pounds. The next day, the DVD was on eBa, and I did not make much money. Avoid plague.
