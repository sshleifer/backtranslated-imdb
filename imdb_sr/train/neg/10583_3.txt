I'm sorry to say that, but the acting in this movie is horrible. The dialogue sounds like they are reading their rows for the first time. Maybe I got a version of the test by mistake. The director excessively uses slow motion recording during special effects, perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the bad performance of the actors themselves. The story is pretty well written, and the fight sequences are actually better than I've seen in many action movies. Fighting seems pretty real. But all this is happening while the two leading actors survive over and over again with amazing miracles of fire from automatic weapons, grenades, bullets and bazaars. Enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst recordings I've ever seen, especially when they have a truck running from the sight of about 30 meters, and each bullet is at least 50 feet wide. Bazuke needs serious calibration.
