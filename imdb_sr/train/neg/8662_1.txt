What a horrible movie. I love monstrous movies, but I could not watch even half of the terrible acting, carbon characters and sinless special effects. Nothing can be used for this movie. The characters come from the endless supply of suicidally stupid cannonballs, otherwise they are empty, uncomfortable dolls of socks. The plot is formed, cut out and glued, a standard science-run-amok drive. Even the CGI is terrible. You know it's bad when you can not even depend on the movie to get a good candy. There is no surprise here, just the same old. This is really one of the worst films ever made. Director Roger Corman should be hung on a light pillar so children can use it as a pinat.
