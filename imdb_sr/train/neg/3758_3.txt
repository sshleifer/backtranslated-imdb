When I first saw this movie I thought it would be a good movie with Skukuatch. Usually when you have this kind of movie, generally, ONE saskuatch, but there is some kind of thing in it? 7 or 10? The acting was good, the plot was fine, I liked scenes where saskuatch kills the first few victims, very good work with the camera. I expected it to be a bloody film, but that was very little. This movie was better than Saskatchewan. The SCI-FI channel really needs to make more SASKUATH movies, I think I really liked Saskuatch Mountain, Abominibal was not good, the one I'm reviewing is fine, but the Saskuatch movie was not, but I'm not considering getting back on the right track. This film is good for rain Saturday afternoon, but for all other occasions, no.
