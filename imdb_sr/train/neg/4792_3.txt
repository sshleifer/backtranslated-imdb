Phantasm .... Class. Phantasm II ..... avesome. Phantasm III ..... erm ..... terrible. Although I would love to hold this movie, I just can not. It seems that the film is "sold out". The first bad signs come when the video contains advertisements for other films at the beginning (something that others are not). And too many pointless characters, examples that are small (which is a shot, funny in the beginning, but soon you want it dead), a woman who uses karate to fight the ball (erm does not work, or rather no) and flower zombies (what, to the devil, they work there, have nothing to do with them in other Phatasms). There is also a serious shortage of dwarfs. The only good bits are the start of the shoot and, of course, Reggie B. For me, this movie looks like a filler between II and IV because additional characters leave in the end so that I can continue with the main 4 in the IV. All in all very, very disappointing. 3/10
