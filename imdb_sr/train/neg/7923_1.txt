I'm a big fan of Ted V Michels and the original "Corpse Grinders" is the main reason why, but this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Even the brilliant casting of the legendary Liz Renai ("Desperate Living") could not save this worthless piece of garbage. This film should serve as a lesson to all past, present and future film makers ... when you have a movie that was successful as the original "Corpse Grinders", you should leave false dog dogs and definitely do not try to revitalize it for more than twenty years Later (unless you do not have financial support to withdraw an extra sequel like Herschel Gordon Levis done with "Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat") Even if you decide to do this, you should probably spend a little more money than you did на оригинале and for God's sake ... NEVER make a movie on video ... why makers are trying to do it when everyone knows that quality will turn out disgusting ... yet let's see a movie made in this way that even worth the dust to take it into hell ... if you can not afford to make a sequel that's better than your original movie then you are selling the right movie to someone who can ... and what did Ted V Mikel thought (or smoked) when he wrote this god vful script? I mean, a dog and a cat "aliens" from another planet? The cardboard box is colored to look like a devastating machine capable of grounding human bodies ... bones and clothes and all that? If any of these actors, except Liz Renai, paid more than five dollars for their terrible performances, then they are overpaid! Avoid this movie at all costs and watch the original instead.
