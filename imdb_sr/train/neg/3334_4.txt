This frightened me when I was a teenager. Now it seems to me more fun than scary, but with some rather disturbing moments and some kind of bad quality that I like. And, when I think about it, the plot is actually disgusting ... but with some taste. If there is a problem with this movie, that is, there are SOUGHT gaps in which nothing exciting or interesting happens. Also, the ending will last forever, making potentially tense climacts crazy after some time while Barbara Bach screams and screams. The "Monster", after being exposed, unfortunately is not very scary. The somewhat black look of the film also works against it, making it more appealing than something that has been made for theaters. But this is an example of the films that are rarely made today, so I invite horror fans to watch it and feel nostalgia ...
