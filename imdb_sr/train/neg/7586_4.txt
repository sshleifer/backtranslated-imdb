A summer holiday is a forgotten musical version of Eggen O'Neil Ah Vilderness and deserves it to Broadvai's music adaptation Take Me Along. With the exception of Stanley Steamer's song, none of the other Harry Varren-Ralph Blane songs is worth a memory, and even that song is questionable. Immediately after the release of this film, MGM released Mickey Rooney and I do not think it was a coincidence. The film was filmed in 1946 and released in 1948, so Mickey was 26 years old as Andy Hardy as a teenager. He was too old for a part of the 17-year-old who influenced radical ideas in the spirit of youthful rebellion. Rune made four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948, this, Killer McCoi. remake by Robert Tailor A Crovd Roars, Love Laughs on Andy Hardy and Vords and Music. In all this, Rooney played an adult role. Even in Andy Hardy's film, Mickey played an adult Andy Hardy, who returned from World War II. Why was he in this Louis B. Maier just knows. Roonei's bad casting makes Summer Holidai getting worse, because in the original Ah Vilderness, the emphasis is on the fatherly character played by Walter Huston here. And on the Broadway show Take Me Along, who won the Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, Great One played a drunken uncle, Uncle Sid, played by Frank Morgan, and that's the central character. Gloria DeHaven joins Judy Garland, while Rooney's sweet and wonderful friend and Marilyn Makvell are playing a girlfriend who gives Rooney's adult education. In the original show, O'Neill has her as a prostitute, but it was the Hollywood Code, so everything Marilyn does is that young Rooney soused. Many really talented people had a hand in this one and they do their best, but the summer break very quickly fades in the cold autumn.
