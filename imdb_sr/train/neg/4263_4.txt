Disappointing film. The impact of the player is weak. The sets are fine, they could have been better. The story is also weak. The battles are terrible. The sounds and quality of the film are messy. The history of the Kazakh people has been told very badly. This film should include several Kazakh actors, in leading roles. And it should have been in the Kazakh language. Kuno Bakker and Jai Hernandez are Hispanics. I do not understand. Since the Latino Americans play the Turkish-Mongolian people. This film is a disgrace to Kazakhstan film. Rustam Ibragimbekov disappointed me. He is one of the best filmmakers in the world. ÄŒek's director is apologized, because he is not a nomadic origin, he can not know the true spirit and history of the nomad.
