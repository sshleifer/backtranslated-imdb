Some kind of family parody that connects "Officer and Master", "Heart Coat", "Full Metal Jacket" (and no doubt other films I can not remember now) into a rather boring movie, with some bright spots. The gags are always where you expect them, and Damon Vaians's lines are predictably predictable. As I said, unfortunately this movie is never surprising ...
