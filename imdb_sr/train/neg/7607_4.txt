- When a local sheriff is killed, his wife takes up his duties until he decides to clean the city. However, not everyone in the city is happy with what he is doing. When the sheriff orders a police watch in the city, the owner of the local salon (also woman) hires the killer to take care of the sheriff. There is no way the owner of the salon knows that the sheriff and killer will fall in love. - Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a pretty interesting concept and combine it with a bad execution. There's a good movie here that's trying to get out. In more capable hands or with a higher budget, Gunslinger could have been a funny look at the role of women in the Old West. As it is, Gunslinger is a messy movie mess. - There are only so many things to do with the film: supporting the actor without any acting skills, stiff and unnatural dialogue, and posing that look like sets. But the biggest offender is editing. I was amazed at how many times the scene would start with the actors (and the horses for it) that obviously await Corman shouting "Action". The best scene is the two riders on a horse just standing next to the building. Suddenly, they leave and come to run around the corner, as if they were riding a few miles. Or, take an example of people who seem to be able to travel across the city. We see a man entering the building, and a second later he goes to town to find himself on a horse. Although none was a great star, Beverly Garland, John Ireland and Allison Haies were able to turn into good performance. But in Gunslinger, they are not given much work. - I saw both the MST3K and the non-MST3K version of the movie. I would strongly recommend that the MST3K path be moved.
