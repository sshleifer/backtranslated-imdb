Not only was this the most expensive Canadian movie ever made in BK, but the worst, never saw the light of the day. The director is not even Canadian, but British, and the boy shows it. We are all fictitious to be a bunch of over-ridden drugs and morons. The spirit of what it means to be a Canadian is absent, and that should be the reason why we are financing this bearing. Of course, the British character is normal. The rest is a set of stereotypes - can you say "Norm!"? Cinematography ranges from picture postcards to fuzzy inner silhouettes. It seems actors always turn. Are they bored as a viewer, or is it a film director's idea? Avoid this mess and check out some of Bruce McDonalds movies. A real Canadian boy with something original to say film. You will not be forced to go to HIS movies after 10 minutes.
