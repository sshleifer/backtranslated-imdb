This film is so, so terrible, that it makes the angels lose their wings. Shak tried to make other crossover efforts, such as his work in Shak-Fu for the NES and his unbearable rep-album, and later the epic serving of the terrible film making by Steel. There are no good things about this movie. I saw this pile of times when I was very young, but I had to be an idiot then, because this movie takes everything that is enjoyable in films and it breaks it. It's fun to laugh. I saw it on Disney Channel for some time and spent a few minutes. Though, once you get excited about the humiliation, you're still getting overwhelmed with his scaryness. If you see it on TV, try this: Think like you are watching a movie, removing from it all the scenes in which Shak uses his magical powers. If you do, it becomes a film about a pedophile that drives a child and a tail to seduce him. It's kind of ridiculous and disturbing. Terrible example of film. Do not, unless you want to mock, see this movie.
