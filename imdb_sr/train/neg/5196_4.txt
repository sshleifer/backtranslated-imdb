Although technically milder than the previous film in the series, the BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES, this is a weaker escapade into a complication that is less exciting and a leading man who simply does not have the charisma of Ray Milanda. However, several actors and characters continue their roles and manage to keep the flag fly. Also present is John Barrimore, who appears throughout the movie in various unusual disguises. In any case, this is another endless night for BD while he and his colleagues are jogging around trying to save the poor girl he intends to marry. Traces are stupid, but supporting actors often make them fun.
