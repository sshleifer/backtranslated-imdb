Let's face it - if you rented the STDVD sequel to the forgotten gem of the '80s, and you expected it to be better than the one above, then you're an idiot. Vargames: Dead Code joins a long list of unnecessary sequences that the DVD market has so easily filled up. These movies do not need a spoiler, because you already know them. The "plot" for this "movie" is as follows: Nerd meets a girl; girl likes nerd; nerd loves a girl; The nerd accidentally gets into a computer for Top Secret Government; the stupid and the girl go to another country; The groom and the girl eventually become persecuted by government lawsuits in another country; A nerd and a girl meet an important old man who dies at a crucial moment in the "movie"; trapped and stalked; computer for Top Secret government becomes crazy; Streber was hired to win the Top Secret Government computer; nerd wins Top Secret Computer using the same old Top Secret computer from the first Vargames film; nerd saves the day; nerd gets laid. Ends. The acting, script, effects, score and cinema are what you would expect - B-class. Some famous faces are here, and if you're not a fan of Colma Feorea, then you should avoid this. However, the film will not make you mad enough to eat your own fingers watching it, so if you love the cheap sequels of STDVD, then you are right at home. involved with some "masterpiece", that he could not even make five seconds in this. But can you blame him?
