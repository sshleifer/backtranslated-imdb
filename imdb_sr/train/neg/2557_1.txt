I actually love movies about asylum. I made a habit of seeing as much as possible. Even those who made it were cool as EKSORCISM AND VHEN A KILLER CALLS. This is just stupid. I can not believe that the same people who made DEAD MEN VALKING and DRACULA'S CURSE actually made this movie !!! It's not even funny bad like JOLLI ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which, by the way, is pretty bad). This is just bad! I mean, I can appreciate and / or forgive the bad acting or lame special effects in the asylum film, but this film is taken too seriously. I really hope that Snake on the train is better. It's a movie that I can not wait to see.
