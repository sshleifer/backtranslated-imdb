Just a regular movie, Jason Lee, there were some parts of the movie that were ridiculous. Podton's move is to live a life on the edge, I suppose. These are types of films that I think 14-year-old girls are looking at parties. It was a real movie. It's kind of one of those movies you are in the background and watch each time when and when something attracts attention. I think Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would love to see them in a movie with a good story and complication. It's just a boy who meets a movie about girls. This is the perfect movie to show on the comedy Central. I'm glad I did not see this movie in the theater, I would be angry. But I guess that's why I did not see him in the theater.
