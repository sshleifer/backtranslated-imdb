I got this movie as a gift, I knew it from DVD, this movie will be bad. After I did not watch him for more than a year, I finally watched him. What kind of pathetic movie? Nearly I have not finished watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair to write a review without watching the whole movie. Believe me when I say "this movie is shit" I'm really shocked that some bad directors were defeated even financed to make this pathetic movie, but could not cost more than $ 20,000 for the production of this movie . All you need are cheap camcorders or camcorders for cell phones. About 15 people with no artistic skills, a record written by a few drunken people. In the first part of this ultra-bad move journalist (Tara Voodle) suggests to be a drunken man on the road to report about the city being fished. He's completely unharmed. They went to a house that was allegedly abandoned, but fortunately, it is almost completely equipped, and a bottle of alcoholic drinks appeared on the door. just because it was supposed to be a drunken man, but everything is not what it looks like. Then the alleged drunk man began to talk stories about ghosts / zories Tara. Lame stories must be the worst in history. His story is Sgt. Ben Draper let one of his soldiers die of total exhaustion (I think that's what happened) after he let the poor soldier private Wilson sit and let him dig the grave, and then the soldier crashes, Ben Draper < br /> bury it in a shallow grave. But Sgt. Ben Draper was surprised. his wife / girl knows about it and she and her lover kill Sgt. Ben Draper to Revenge Private Wilson. (In addition to the grave soldier whom he killed), the soldier wakes up from the grave in the form of zombies and kills them for revenge in his name. The tricky endings were so poor. Even if you like B HORROR movies, do not watch this movie
