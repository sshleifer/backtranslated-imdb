There are some really great ideas in this violent film, which, if they were clearly derived, could have been lifted from spaghetti-western courtesy to something special. Unfortunately, A TOVN CALLED HELL is one of the worst montage films! The scenes begin and end abruptly, the characters leave for a long time, and the performances (and accents) of the actors are rather inconsistent, etc. destroying the village, remaining to become a priest (!) ... ten years later, the village is led by "Mayor" Telli Salavas. Stella Stevens comes looking for revenge on a man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Landau is coming to seek Shaw. They all shout at each other and they all shoot each other LOT. And Fernando Ray is in him (as a blind man). The performances are not bad, but they are very uneven. Savalas sometimes has an accent as well as Landau (who really does garage here). Shav and Rei prove they are incapable of real embarrassment, and Stevens seems pretty fascinating (if a little is out of place among sweaty dirt).
