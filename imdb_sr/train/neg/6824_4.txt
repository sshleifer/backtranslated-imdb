After watching Koiaaniskatsi two or three dozen times and liking every second, I finally had the opportunity to see how Life In Transformation continued. I was really disappointed because she did not even come close to the high standards of the first one. 90 minutes of people with basketball on the head is not my idea of ​​a good movie. The result of Philip Glass for this did not have the beauty, nor the correlation power of the first. Compared to Koiaaniskatsi, the film seemed slow and meaningless. Reduced version of Barake, which is the same idea, but done better. I sincerely hope that the third film in this series will not follow an example of this waste.
