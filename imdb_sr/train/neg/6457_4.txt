I guess I watched the movies above, but that may be because I'm so distracted as to how bad these horror films are. The assassination monster is really very bad, basically its type in some kind of green suit. There are many worse behaviors regarding B film, but do not even think for a moment that it was anything weird, hell no. In fact, he had a substance complication, but he was still pretty stupid. Basically, it's just a bad horor movie. But at least not as bad as titanic, this movie is bullshit, this only bullshit. The blood looks really fake in this movie. That's one complaint I have about my horror of a new milion, a low degree up, looks stupid. A good terrible scene of death with really false blood is so stupid. At least there was a nice shower
