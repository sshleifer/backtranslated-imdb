Wow, here it is finally; action "movie" without action. In a real low-budget environment (do not miss the hilarious flying saucers that fly several times) the future Seattle finds a non-brain stubborn who wants to revenge their childhood. There is nothing even far-fetched or interesting to plot, and acting performances are rival with only glupidity of theft attempts from other films, mostly "Matrix" without money to do it properly. Yes, we can see some running on the walls and slowed shots (about 45 seconds), but these scenes are as cool as stupid attempts to joke about male incompetence now and then. And, yes, we also used a number of tracks that do not lead anywhere anywhere, as if the script was designed by a previously invisible actor while recording scenes. Believe me, it's as bad as it can. In fact, it does not deserve to be taken seriously, but maybe I can make some of you not to rent it and save your money.
