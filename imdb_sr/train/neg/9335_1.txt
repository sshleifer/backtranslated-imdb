The reason why this is such a bad movie is because it's so badly written, and it's entirely to blame hack novelist Robert James Wolver, also author of the Bridges of Madison Counties. Writing is bad because the plot is perfectly banal and the dialogue is wooden and unbelievable. An unsuccessful couple-blocked American writer and a fairly Mexican woman with a history of embarrassment are preoccupied with powerful, self-governing criminals, and after several adventures (mostly violent) that alternate with scenes that show the warmer side of the killer, leaves the impotent partner for the killer, , badly, see more clearly than anybody else had. Nothing can help this film to succeed, even on the face of Scott's Glenn as a killer, rather than on the appealing latency of Giovanne Zacarias as Luz, and even Harvey Keitel's powerful performance as a CIA specialist in charge of tracking the killer. A serious waste of time.
