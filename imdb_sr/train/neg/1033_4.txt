I grew up on Scooby Doo, where I am, and I still love him. It's one of my favorite cartoons along with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and Pirates, and Tom and Jerry. This show is good for children, the voices are good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect as Scooby and Shaggi), the theme melody is tolerable and has some nice animation. However, this is quite disappointing. Usually I do not mind Scrappi, but when it seems to be the main character, it quickly becomes irritating. Complete with the breakup of Puppy Pover, Scrappi is a bit more boring than usual. And half of the gang disappeared after the first year, somehow it did not feel like Scooby Doo. And jokes and stories were generally lame and unoriginal, very little chasing the monsters or revealing bad things. All in all, it's not as bad as Shaggi and Scooby Doo: Get a track, but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for animation, voices, themed melody and the fact that it is nice for children. Bethani Coke
