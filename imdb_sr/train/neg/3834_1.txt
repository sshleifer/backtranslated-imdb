He watched this film after he really enjoyed Gregori's Girl years ago. This was stupid. The action was unclear with the teacher and his friend who were looking after girls from 14 to 15 years old in very short skirts. It seems that the previous commentators think it's not important, but I thought it was pretty nasty. If you have children in school, the last thing you want is to think that each young teacher is curious for his students. We were surprised that the censor missed it. In addition, the film was just a waste of time. The scenario was poor, and John Gordon Sinclair tried too hard to recreate the image of his schoolboy, somewhat jittery from the wall. Why would anyone want to want it in this show is incredible. This film has fallen on all accounts. Terrible. Please do not waste your time watching him. Life is too short
