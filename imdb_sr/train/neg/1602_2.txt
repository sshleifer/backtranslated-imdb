Anyone who thinks this movie was not appreciated for a comedy genius had to smoke with two stoners in the film. This movie is not underestimated ... it's a bad movie. There should be no comparison between this film and The Naked Gun or Airplane, since the last two films are well written and funny. The Reunion class is not one of those things. It's sad that he had such a potential (good cast, good stories), but good jokes are very small. The scenes that were supposed to be ridiculous turned out to be more boring than fun. Stoner guys, vampire, blind girl ... NO ENTERTAINMENT. The only fun character was Delores (the one who sold his soul to the devil). I certainly expected more than John Hughes.
