These are not the best-made slasher films of all time, but for what it is, it's pretty fun. The plot is poor, but the killings are not bad. I have to be honest, if you do not follow the bands shown in this movie, you will not find this movie so funny as those who do it. I knew someone who watched this movie and I was really disappointed by the poor quality of the movie, but you have to understand that it was recorded in leisure on a tour, between playing for children and drinks with friends behind the scene. ... not made to take it seriously. It's a cheese cheese on its punk the best and with over 100 killings, most of which are ultra-bloody, it's a fun movie for friends to watch, drink and be happy!
