I tried to watch this movie at a military camp during a mission abroad, and let me tell you, you will watch everything under these circumstances. Still, this piece is not whipped. For the first five minutes he set a tone of poor quality of actors of pornographic film, strange unusual complications and incredible situations and behavior. It's getting worse after that. This film has not only one salutary grace, but it is not bad in the way that would make it funny to watch. It's horrible. I've seen a lot of movies in my life and I'm not one of those snobber-known critics, I think I'll enjoy most of the movies to some extent, even if they're bad. This man. Take care of this, my friend.
