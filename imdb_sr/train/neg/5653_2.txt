Let's say it this way. I'm actually getting this movie. I get what the writer / director has tried to do. I understand that the dialogue should be dry and without emotions. I understand that the plot was to be non-climatic and stagnant. That's what the writer / director went through. Very very dry humor / comedy. With all this understanding, I still think the film is sucked. It seemed that the writer / director was trying to recreate Napolean Dynamites with this film. He had all the same traits. Even the main character behaved like Napoleanu. But Napolean Dynamites was actually fun. His script worked. This film is not. There is no point. Well, let me rephrase that. His only purpose is to undo Napolean Dynamites and try to capture that look and feel. Too bad it did not work.
