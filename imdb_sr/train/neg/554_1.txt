This movie is horrible. The scenario is bad, it's a central scenario, and even scenes of sex are worthless. The excitement and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking. This film was shot in a dark, shadowy and monochrome style (a la "War of the Worlds"), which is so disappointing for the beauty of the original film. Greg Morrison's lifestyle shows one face expression throughout the film. The enthusiasm and turnaround of the original action here were desperately needed; Those who exist there are simply anti-climatic. The only highlight is the performance by Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell, faithfully continued in this sequel, but this is not enough to compensate for other shortcomings. The only circumstance under which "Basic Instinct 3" should be made is that Michael Douglas agrees to join the actors.
