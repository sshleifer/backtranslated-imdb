***** Warning: Can contain SPOILERE ********* My huge problem with this movie is that it is completely self-contained and consumed by the wife of the adulterer! After spending one night with a slim psychopath, she was persecuted by him. He constantly calls and threatens her, and even sends a video clip of their night together. He's OBVIUSLY crazy and very dangerous. The problem is that she only thinks she is dangerous to the NJU (and the disclosure of her secret). For no second did she have the thought of taking care of her husband! Did she even think for a moment that she might be in danger of this psychotic? As soon as she understood how mental she was, she should have warned her husband regardless of the consequences. Maybe there would be no film then, but there was really no one, so what's the difference?
