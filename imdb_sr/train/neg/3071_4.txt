I thought the characters were central, and the story was uninteresting. I never had to read this book (fortunately), or it would be a painful experience. I got a review card for free, but it was not worth my time, or my friends yet. I do not think this story is worth talking about. It's like saying old people have a past before they get old (without screwing). The life of the main characters was ill to watch, one generation was not better than the next in avoiding stupid mistakes. However, I think actors did the best they could with chromium. I was always a big fan of Ellen Burstin. I write this review in order to confront positive comments that have unfortunately convinced me to try this film.
