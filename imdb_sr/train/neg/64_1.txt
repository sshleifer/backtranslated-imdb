This film was terrible. The end was absolutely horrible. There was no complication for the film. The only thing that was decent in the film was the acting of Robert Duval and James Earl Jones. Their performances were great! The only problem was that the film did not bring its actors to justice. If the script got closer to catching half a decent story, it would be worth watching. Instead, the performances of Robert Duval and James Earl Jones are completely lost on some terrible story ... or its disadvantage. Not only did I stay through the movie for something to happen to make the movie ... but a real movie ... not just an endless dialogue between characters for what ended without any reason. This is nothing more than a common dialogue that would have happened in that period. None of the characters had anything special. The only thing that was special was how Robert DuVall showed a roaring, senile, drunk, old man. Nothing is worthwhile during the entire film, including the end. When the film was over, I was surprised ... amazed that I was sitting through the whole movie waiting for something interesting to happen to watch the movie worth. It never happened! The characters at once suddenly began to roll, making it obvious that the film was really finished and I realized that I just lost 2 hours of life watching the film without any complication and without meaning. It's not even a story. The whole movie takes place in one day. That's it. It was one day in the life (and death) of some southerners in the plantation. How much can a story be played in a day (except for the Day of Training Training)? The actor's performances were great, but they were grossly lost on such a disappointment ... even if you can even call it a movie.
