I would not say it was total bullshit, but if there was no Netflika, I would not even have this in my house. Eccentric President Steve Martin in the chain of healthy food stores is falling. It's just not funny. He is another in a long line of SNLs that can only find a job that fights for the next SNL film. The Elmer Fudd Lisp's breast feeder is as gentle as the original one. Ami Poehler simply goes through the same moves that would work for 7 minutes SNL skit that has recently been fun as SNL. The only thing going on for this movie is that Tina Fei is easy on her eyes. The ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character could not get pregnant. The case could be opened with other comical attempts, but it seems that it simply passes by, not so much fun or creates a laugh.
