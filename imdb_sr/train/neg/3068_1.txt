Films such as originals are what the album-oriented stations like music was once-repetitive, boring and exhausted from the original energy by boardboats of corporate drones. I am glad that Aragorn did not appear as the expected psycho of this P.O.S. Go back and watch the version of 1971, number things that NEVER be included in the modern version, and thank each divinity that you adore that someone in the distant past had balls for writing and recording an original conceptual film that was not based on other ideas , and did not go through the corporate board before he saw the light of day.
