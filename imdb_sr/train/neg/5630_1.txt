The only reason I watched the movie to the end was "hope" to see something interesting. The film is really bad, and the girl's performance is really, really bad, honest, I'm not a film critic or an expert, but only a common sense to notice that this job is incredibly bad. The first thing that came to my mind as soon as she began to speak was: "She has an affair with Willm Dafoe and he accepted to help her with the script and appear in her film because she is a brilliant director" . ... surprise, surprise, the next day after I watched the movie, I found out on the Internet that Giada Colagrande was his wife. Terrible story and terrible performance.
