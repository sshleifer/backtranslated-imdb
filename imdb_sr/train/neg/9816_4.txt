This movie was like a bad wreck of the train, terrible as it was, you still have to keep looking. My boyfriend and I rented it and spent two hours of our day. Do not misunderstand me, acting is good. Only the film as a whole just made us angry. There was nothing positive or good in this scenario. After this film, I had to rent something else that was a bit easier. Jennifer Tilly is as usual a very dramatic actress. Her character looks manic and not all there. Darryl Hannah, although she is overly playful, deals with the situation where she is. More than once I found myself shouting on television and telling her to hit back or become violent. All in all, a very violent movie ... not for the weak ones.
