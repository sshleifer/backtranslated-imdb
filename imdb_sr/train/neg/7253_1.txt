We rented a DVD hoping for a good western one. The film was beautiful and the scenes were reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. Here's my problem with the movie. In the first part, why was the bad guy killed the owner of the mine? It's not very close to the film, except to find out how bad it was and to have a hideout. The bank official went badly only badly behaved to convincingly decide to hire murderers for his employers. At least let us guess. For the owners of banks or employees in the bank there is no character at all. Very long delay in many things is happening. The absurd assumption that Martin still needed to see the judge after the gang admitted that she had killed her relatives. It is even more absurd to admit that the judge will not judge the sheriff. even more ridiculous that Martin hanged and broke the rope, so the sheriff leads him to a ni≈°an to finally return to his city and save his wife from a poorly employed bank. Would not I just come back after a quick release of a gang to save my wife and arrest a bad bank? Just send the judge a message the gang admitted before she was killed on the track ???? !!! All in all, very sad acting and there is no point in filming.
