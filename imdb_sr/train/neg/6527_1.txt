There was certainly no TV show on Saturday morning in TV that was ever made so badly. After all, these producers had to count on the return of the audience. Well, in this horrible offer, they could at least count the money that saved on the sets. The scenario could have been discarded from a long forgotten space series, with a few bold lines added to the cold blooded Gerald Mohr to murmur Nauri Haiden. No director could do anything decent with such a bad story, so the action is just boring. Spacecraft Receptors are absurd - Bul's Wall Clock and a portable typewriter, for example - but planets must be the worst in cinematic history. Most are rough drafts, and everything is bathed in often wrong red light. Even Moh's dense hairy chest was used as a backing. And that's bad - like a thin ribbon as a plot. Any viewer who can get to the end of this movie will hear a message from the Martians - and it will probably be completely agreed!
