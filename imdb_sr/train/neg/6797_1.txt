What can you say about a grainy, poorly captured movie of 16 miles, where is the best and most attractive performer of the German shepherd? Nothing positive. Avoid this travesty at all costs. In any case, it would be hard to find it, because the bestiality remains a taboo and an illegal item in the United States. I strongly suggest IMDb to review their rating formula again, as 8.8 ratings for this faecal material are absurd! I am not, in any case, a cripple, and I spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the '70s and' 80s; but it is an inferior product even by loose standards (then illegal) of deer loops.
