I was subjected to this movie for the class of relationships in my school. As he understood, nothing is attractive and nothing new. Though trying to be genuine, focusing on a teenager instead of a mother shows the problems through which the father would pass. He had an interesting side for her, but he simply did not satisfy his originality due to the fact that nothing else in this movie was original. We have a protagonist who has an older sister who, like in any other film, has something against him, we have a home-at-home mother who is too expecting and giving more, feels abusive and leaves him in the dust, then we have a father who has always gone. Then the girls have parents who want everything and expect it to be perfect in everything it does. The story, as I said, was interesting, but the lack of good acting from the actor and the lack of any good writing or narration. Everything about this has fallen into the clich√©, a little kid at school starts to learn with a girl, they get together, they have sex and then we have a little kid. Perhaps it was better that writing was better and that the act was improved. I seriously got more emotion than Leatherface and his chainsaw than I did from any actor in this movie, and that's pretty bad when I see Leatherface movies shit and terrible treatment. So far, the only interesting teen movie about the pregnancy I've seen was Juno. So far, the comic side of this serious situation has proved more fun while still giving the same message. As I said the idea was genuine, most of these films focus on the teenage mother, but this has decided not to focus on the father's drama instead, but the originality does not save this film from the center. I really hope that someone will decide to re-create this film with a better actor and a better writer or simply make another similar film because this was a lost potential.
