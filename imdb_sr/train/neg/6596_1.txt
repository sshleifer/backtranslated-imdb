This is the kind of movie that looks into the buzzing-tooth, the horrified silence, and still keeps looking, hypnotized, as if watching the wreck of the train slowly. Still, in the background of your mind, thoughts are mournful: "Who has green on this earth illuminated this garbage?" Some of the previous user comments say things like: "A good way to get to know Laurel and Hardy kids" - insults to children everywhere. Whether children need a training plan to learn how to love a slapstick comedy shows a deep misunderstanding of the nature of children around the world. Others commented on the fidelity of the two stars Lorel and Hardy to whom I would reply: WHY? One would think that the drop-out of BOMBS based on the beloved series (Rocka and Bullvinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mod Skuad, ad nauseam) taught Hollivood that there are some things that simply can not be re-created. Laurel and Hardy films are easily available on the video: why bother with it? As for F. Murrai Abraham, a fine actor of the stage and screen ... well, all I can say is, He must have been in trouble with the IRS. Run, do not walk, away from television if this trash appears!
