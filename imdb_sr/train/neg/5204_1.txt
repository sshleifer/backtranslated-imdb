"Trigger Man" is definitely the most boring and beautiful movie I've ever seen in my life. Videos of my aunt are fascinating. The actors seem to be recruited on uglipeople.com. They have no talent to behave in a convincing way. They walk and walk and walk through the forest. It has more walking than all three of the "Lord of the Rings" together. After the first hour, I began to read the Porsche brochure as I watched "Trigger Man". Terrible. Totally wasting time and money. I would give the movie 0 stars of 10, because that's not possible, I have to give one star.
