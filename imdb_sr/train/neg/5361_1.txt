I saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970s and hated it, hated it, hated it! Simply the most lifelike film I've ever seen in my life. I do not know where Leigh got his inspiration, but this is one of those movies in which you want to shake characters to make them open their mouths and communicate. The title says all this, because in this film there are no moments of saving, only long, long silences with people who are unable to articulate what are (probably) feelings. If you want to watch something that will tempt you to drink, then this is one for you. If you have nothing better to do for two hours, then put a fork into the toaster: the experience will be infinitely more pleasant than anything you will get from this! Yes, Leigh came with a lot of really valuable things much later in his career, but he gave it this omission.
