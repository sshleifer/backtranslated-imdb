Very bad. Very, very bad. As someone who is trying to make, or, at the very least, sniffing a catwalk on a movie set, it's hard for me to criticize the independent ones who really received a movie of any kind. However, this movie ... oh God. The realization of Frightvorld does not aim at anything more than crude exploitation (in itself a honorable thing) and an attempt to comply with higher standard standards. error. And to be honest, it's more fun than, say, the Red Zone of Cuba ... but not much. So I will not try to criticize, just to ask to cast some observations. 1) If the top spot of the movie, should not you see it? > 2) If you have rented three speakers, at least one knows how to manage the equipment. 3) In horror film your maniac must be more terrible than smurf puppets. . Hard to know, but really ... 4) In the Buffalo / Rochester area there are many talented cameramen, most of which are cheap. Get someone who knows how to frame the scene. 5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other cool programs does not mean that it should work every two seconds. /> 6) The honor to get the girls off their tops, but next time, the girls who are at the top want to see it downloaded. 7) Editing should help to tell the story or set the mood. At least in this type of movie editing, you need to sell the above ones. A motor saw that suddenly appears in the stomach of characters is not scary, it's messy. Some good things. Not all acting was bad. Jack was pretty good and I liked Acid when he started fighting. There were some neat pictures, unfortunately, they were thrown onto the screen without rhyme or reason. "Acid Poptart" is the name that deserves a better movie. And I love Frightworld mockery. Next time, now that they have some kind of film underneath their belts, I hope everyone will be striving for something better than Coleman Francis. Upgrade at least Ed Vood.
