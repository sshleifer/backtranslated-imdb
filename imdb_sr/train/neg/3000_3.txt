School Scoundrel Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a group of colleagues, and then in a laboratory explosion (which they set up) where his face was damaged by acid. Years later, all the jokers were called back to high school (since they were closed) for reunion. What they did not know was that Marty called them to kill them. Then the storm begins, they are locked in the school, and Marty starts to get revenge. Pretty stupid. Murders are inventive and bloody and there are some dreadful atmospheric images of an abandoned school - but that's all. The humiliations that have been caused to Scuddamor are more than cruel (he is deprived of his head, buried in the west and burned) and are just uncomfortable to watch. Considering that Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after it was published, it's almost impossible to see them. And this film is lost in a way that has a nakedness. There is a full Scuddamore front (surprising for any movie), but one girl decides to bathe herself ... HOWEVER, they know that the killer wanders around behind them! And there is a couple who must have sex. This is the type of film in which the killer seems to know where everyone will be and can be teleported to them. It ends with a twist that sighs me and rolls my eyes, and then it's YOUR OWN tweet that I wanted to throw something hard on TV! Action is tolerable - not good, but tolerable. And Caroline Munro is in it. She is a very beautiful woman, but not an actress. This is 3 for some effective killings and the atmosphere. Otherwise it's a mill and it can be forgotten. Scuddomorean's tragic suicide gives this film more attention than it deserves.
