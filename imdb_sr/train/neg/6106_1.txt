This was awful only that the plot was fine, but the rest was bad. I mean, come on the doll, and then even tried to make the film digital, and that's even worse! I would usually like to film a low-budget movie, but this was just a waste of time and almost made me return the set that came. I have a dozen low-budget films with 6-8 movies on them and I have to say that this is the worst movie of all of them. Also, the text is turned off and they use fake plastic mats that do not even look real, they could use one that looked even closer to the right so that you save time and money and do not watch this horrorible movie.
