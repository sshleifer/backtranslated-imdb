Here's what happened: 1) The BBC3 head should make programs designed for different BBC1 and BBC2 public to retain license and work. 2) Lenni Henri offers his Unhealthy friends. 3) The BBC3 chief shoots them, completely ignoring the fact that they are not ridiculous. Worst of all, it's probably racist, as all the characters are playing bad stereotypes. If the white guy did such things, it would be upset! Dirt.
