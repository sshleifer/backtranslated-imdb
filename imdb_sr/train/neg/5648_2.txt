Boston Legal turned his tail and headed for the stables door, and the pig was created! When this show was first broadcast for almost four seasons, it was a humorous slap in the legal system that all actors look proud of in portraiture. It was funny, diverse and somewhat factual. The characters that were shown were acceptable and somewhat real in their views. Sexual comment and activity were limited and witty. Julie Boven was and was as beautiful as in other series in which she participated, but is now pulled into the depths of the Media Program of Sex and Violence. Julie is a great actress and needs a more stable platform than this "production". Rene Adjurdubois is an excellent actor who has kept his own in the field of entertainment since the time of "Benson", always showing humor and respect for acting in production. Captain Kirk is. Funny and humorous is Candace Bergan and she must admire that she continues this production and is a good actress. James Spader, he has no doubt about his acting ability, but he should return to his KSKSK origin, such as "Crash" because he seems to have a lot of talent and inclination in that direction. We demand that this series be broken because it is already really starting to smell !!!
