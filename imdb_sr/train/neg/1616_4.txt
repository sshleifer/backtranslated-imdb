STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning This second phase of Che films moves the story forward in the 60's, where The man has now relocated his resistance fighters to the hills of South America, surviving without food and water, and with tensions between the group. Everything crosses the border into Bolivia, and government forces are stepping up their campaign to topple it. Without flying between the time and place of the last movie, Soderbergh's second war focuses exclusively on action in the hills, and manages to be a more blind experience. And even more precariously, the result is immersed, giving another meal of more undesirable air of art that is proven as alienation. There is only unbearable air of boredom on a film that never retraces. You can not dissuade Soderbergh's ambition or Del Toro's lead in the lead, it's just a shame that they managed to take such a disappointing turn somewhere in the production of things. **
