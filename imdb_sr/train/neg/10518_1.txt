Oh, boy, where to go with this? Incredible acting, bad complication, stupid death, meaningless nudity ... This is not fun ... this is hell. Hell. Do not spend money, time or life on this evil. Just ... the damn this movie is horrible! Tom Savini, WHY ?! Why would he spend his life on this shit? This film is not worth it. I'd rather squeak and shatter my head against the wall than to watch THIS ... this sinful act again! Movie. You do not know what? I should not even have to call this thing a movie! Just stay!
