ET's obsession with Dannieln Smith is despicable. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention, she will most likely grow up psychologically, depressed or even worse. Think about Princess Diana and how she longed for privacy. Now the poor little wealthy Ashley Olson just wants to stay alone. No wonder Greta Garbo became a shepherd and said, "I want to be alone." How much ET takes away this girl? Does ET have anything better to report? I bet there are many people who do not really care about the color of her birthday cakes and balloons. By the way, I have never heard that Anna Nichole has ever won in any of these court cases because of her will and her inheritance. Who pays for Larry, Howard and little Dannielin? Is it ET?
