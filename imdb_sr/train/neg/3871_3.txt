I'm trying to be very objective when I'm watching a low-budget movie. I also apply less weight to independent and low budget outputs in relation to large budgetary productions. I expect almost impeccability from large budget productions and their studies. That's why I apply stricter criteria to great studio releases. But this film was just stupid. Period. The premise was terrible. The main character, Mari Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was incredible as a high school student with an unremitting desire to solve the crimes. There was not enough depth in her character or her acting that dragged you into her world. Also, in order for this film to be mysterious, lighting in certain scenes did not determine the mood, especially in the warehouse. Another disappointing movie that I could only give three points.
