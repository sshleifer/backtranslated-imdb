My teacher recorded it and showed us in child care to show how teenage pregnancy affects people. It just showed that teenage pregnancy affects a child's athlete who is not well educated about how sex works and a frustrated, unloved girl throwing a fruit when she is angry and can not say that she is with the wrong person even if she has a sign that she is such. I would not be surprised that the father of the baby had about eight girls in the first edition of the script. Mother Staci (baby carrier) is a mess. She is unconscious of the fact that her daughter has been four years old and seems to be stubborn when people spy through her dining room window. The name of Bobby's best friend (Davey) is Devei, and it's obvious that Sean Penn is cut off in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This film is horrible, simply because none of the characters is convincing. Thank God for making it only for TV, which limits the chances of the public to see them.
