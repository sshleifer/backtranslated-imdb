Plot: A love couple decides to engage in some extravagant hijinks in a cheap car. Then it staggers (literally) in a compromise position, while the said vehicle is aimlessly wandering around until the authorities save an unhappy couple. It's a whole movie. There may have been some dialogue there, but nothing comes to mind. Now it should be obvious that this film is not only meaningless, but also physically ill to watch. The fact that she acted the two best British actors (one of which sadly died now) only contributes to horror. by conquering 'Fire Cars'. To remember him for that role, and to try to pretend that this celluloid horror has never happened.
