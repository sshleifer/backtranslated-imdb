I do not recall that "Barnaby Jones" was just a very bland, a standard detective show in which, according to any show Kuinn Martin, the act was a murder, II act was the main character who discovered the murder, the third act was the Capture IV (the second killed figure), act IV was a resolution, and the epilogue was Betty (Lee Merivether) who asked her father-in-law Barnaby Jones (Buddi Ebsen) how he understood the crime, and then someone said something witty End of the show. One thing that I remember was the great song of great composer Jerry Goldsmith. Strange, the starting order made me wish to see the show, and for seven seasons the show was broadcast. I will also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in some other role than Jed Clampetta, despite the fact that Ebsen was a bad miscast. I just wanted the show to be more fun than when I first remembered it. Updating (1/11/2009): I watched an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith at IouTube through their Channel Archive of American Television. Let's just say I was more polite than Goldsmith in Barnaby Jones.
