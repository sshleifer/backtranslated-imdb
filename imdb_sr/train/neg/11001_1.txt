I've never seen a comedy that was so important to sit ... I can not go into it. Okay, maybe a little coward for Michael Clarke Duncan is like a big, black, bald gai virgin. But the rest was shockingly non-ridiculous. Moreover, no laughs are heard, "sketches" last forever! Stay away from this if you appreciate your time and money. DREADFUL !!! The worst!!!
