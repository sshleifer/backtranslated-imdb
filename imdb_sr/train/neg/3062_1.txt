Some would say something like "Babi Geniuses" with their giant robots or "Dumbo" with their psychedelic drug addiction to win the most award-winning movie ever made for children. You could say that, but it would be wrong. Here I am, because I bring you: Santa Claus, the most disgruntled family film of ... well, ever. From the opening of the scene, children from different parts of the world singing their inexperienced themed songs (seriously, this segment is 20 minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot!) the conclusion in which Merlin is coming out of nowhere and saves the day (do not look at him, he's from Barcelona), this is a childhood trauma at its best. And no matter how hard I tried, no matter how many therapists I visit, I just ... can not ... get ... those ... deer ... laugh ... out ... from. .. my head! Avoid this piece of garbage as you would avoid the starving whale during the mating season. However, if gamny gai-demons with a serious case of overweight are something for you, I suppose you should try. But really, this movie is not worth your time and mental health.
