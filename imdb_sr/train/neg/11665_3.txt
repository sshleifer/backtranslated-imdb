I enjoyed the film, emotionally, intellectually and visually. It does not contain any violence or sex or drugs or special effects, and I do not need them any, keeping my attention all the time with visuals, stories, and interwoven words of wisdom. However, though: [1] some accent in foreign languages ​​made it difficult for the dialogue to be heard and understood; [2] there is unnecessarily excessive swearing (especially F-word, which is the only reason why this film is rated as R). [3] The film is balanced with humor and emotions, but most of the emotions that keep you in the film, apart from the final resolution of the last minutes, is unpleasant because of the excessive long-lasting dysfunctional reaction of some characters to loss, for too long living in the depths of bitterness and depression. [4] I will not recommend this film because of 5 seconds of storytelling in the background, which did not add a bit of the side character to which it relates, or the film - it only turned me off the film and jammed in my brain through the whole movie and after: the mother of German origin of the protagonist , when watching films from World War II, "secret carpet for the Germans". There would be no "local color" or art if the Nazis would have won the war. Today, I do not know of any Germans other than radical skinheads who think that the world would be better if the Nazis won the Second World War.
