if you gave me the option of negative numbers, I would use it. This film was really horrible. I went to the theater expecting it to be terrible, and somehow it managed to overcome my expectations. The scenario was weak, the acting was painful. I wanted to leave, but my friend drove and wanted her money to be worth it, I think we both are disappointed. the color was wrong. Eddie Izzard looked wrong for the role of a super-criminal, he came as unusually weak and stupid. Jenni Johnsons (Uma Thurman) came out as psychotic and strange, as did Matthew (Luke Wilson) friend Vaughn (Rainn Vilson.
