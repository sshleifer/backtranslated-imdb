The film My name is modesty is based on an episode that takes up one page in the 10th modest Blaise novel called Morningstar Night. Describes an incident in which young Modesty (17 in a book, mid-twenties in the film) confirms his leadership in casino casinos. As this is set before the real adventures of Blaise, her trusted assistant, Villa Garvin, is not in the movie. This is one of the main problems, because the relationship between Blaise and Garvin certainly has always been one of the fascinating aspects of the novel and long-time comic book. The other problem is that the movie is simply incredibly boring because it's actually just one small episode that is lit in the script. Casting is fine, but Alekandra Staden is not as convincing as a heroine and is actually too old for the role of young Modesty. The impression is that this film was a quick and dirty decision not to lose the right to franchise Blaise.
