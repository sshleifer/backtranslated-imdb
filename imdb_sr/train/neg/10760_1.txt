This "movie" is the culmination of everything that is bad in a modern film. unnecessarily slow motion, unnecessary turning / jumping / somersaults, unnecessary characters, unnecessary dialogue ... basically unnecessary. (Is that the word? Well, it was only I, the robot, invented it.) What happened to the practicality? (ie car garage, skin spray) is the only tool that shows the combination of a futuristic and realistic function is slipping cards into a coffee shop. What happened to respect for women? (i.e. Smith's character does nothing else but degrades the doctor for a better part of the film, yet he "wants it." WHERE IS TENZY? I'll tell you where, good looks, not admiration or common language) /> What happened to the detective who detected him? Smith was nothing but sat and complained, complained to other people, and when they said something that caused the thought, he left. This is such a poor way to get the story from point b-c-d-etc ... it was OK once, but not several times in a row. (Speaking a few times in a row, what is it "I'm hurrying and I'm not listening to you, joke? Twice in one scene?" What happened to the small parts in the movie that are a little meaningful Shia LaBeouf (a kid) is in the movie for a total of TWO SCENE, we know that A-he degrades women, and B-he knows Smith ... COURSE we need to take care of him and whether he comes or does not get hurt, <br /> What happened to the Heroes? Just to forget that people, women and children are attacked by robots everywhere and to save the only person with my attitude that I have the knowledge and why he had to turned her bicycle through the air until the doctor somehow managed to reach the same distance in a few seconds. Do not misunderstand me, I am all for spectacle, but I am also for a piece of realism and meaning. I must say that I never laughed so much in the movie and for a long time. So thank you, Alek. </ i> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> Please return to social pendulum back on simpler technique, simpler stories and simpler things the rest in movies ... but mostly simpler techniques.
