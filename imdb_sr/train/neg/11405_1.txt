I had to watch this at school. And to summarize ... Actors without talent, without talent, and without the talent of the director. This film is such a waste of time. Do not watch the movie. Do not bother. You'll be so disappointed. My teacher said it was supposed to be good. How she was wrong. She even slept a little. Movie actors were just bad. The best actor was an old man, and that does not say much. He has a terrible plot with horrible characters. So unrealistic and can honestly say that it does not make sense. The scenario was without emotion and confusing. There were points in the movie when I brushed my eyebrows and said, "What?". Also, there were too many loose connections and holes. It was absolutely horrible.
