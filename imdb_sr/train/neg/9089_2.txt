The film has only one drawback, unfortunately, this error violates all the credibility of the work. It begins with the condemnation of Israeli occupation of disputed territories. He can not solve the reason why Israelis are there. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. That is why Israel "takes" their land, because these countries lost in the war that they started. The film also claims that Israel defied the UN by failing to respect Resolution 242. The problem, 242 was rejected immediately after its establishment ... ... by the Palestinians, making it invalid. Many movies are well-composed, and I can really show shots that change minds, but remember, when you look at anything, do not believe one of what you hear, and only half of what you see. All participants in this film are well-known critics of Israel, and some have given many anti-Semitic public comments, removing every possible credibility with their words. All participants need a history lesson that is objectively taught, not some Palestinian sympathizer.
