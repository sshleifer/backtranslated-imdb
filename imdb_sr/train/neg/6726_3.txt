Anyone who saw the movie "Shine", Scott Hicks, about the heartbreaking, but ultimately, the joyful life of the pianist David Helfgots; I'm sure I'm sure that 'SOLOIST' is very bad in comparison. The dispute is like a lullaby (I took five breaks by replying to emails just to wake up). Showing the homeless area over the top and extremely self-satisfied, I am afraid of a horrible description of the beach battle at Joe Vrights and other disasters. .J Fok performance was an extremely bad example of acting and lacked credibility with offset. On the other hand; although it fights with a bad pace, it still manages to charm, is it to me or is it turned into George Cluniff in more than one way? Comparing both these famous so-called "STAR", although unnecessary, because light is the brightest in terms of acting, it must be that "shine's" Geoeffri Rush, a brilliant performance, is definitely SHONE much lighter in my sky. And with "Attonment" and with "Soloist" the written word receives much more awards for the subject's empathy. Read the book and articles or wait for the DVD to be in a good basement soon.
