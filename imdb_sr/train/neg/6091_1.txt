I bought this film an exciting, magnificent, endless, fun bloodshed. I do not have any of them. This film fails practically at every level, not at all scary or funny, it's simply horrible film creativity and never gives the audience any worthwhile viewing. What is so bad about this is that it's far from being crude, violent and brutal, as promised, that there is very little violence. Practically without bloodshed, and without excitement. Action, routing and dialogue are absolutely intolerable. Frankly, that's really funny. I could barely sit through this whole garbage; I will never want to watch it again. Do not waste time on this kind of celluloid loss; it's really the worst movie ever made. If I could give the minus the stars, I would.
