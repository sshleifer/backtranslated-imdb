A boyfriend loves an affair / a continuation of songs, only this time she is punk and he is an arrow. Movie lovers really love this movie there? Has the fans? I have to say, the mind is rolling ... "Grease 2" is really a lame company that does not even have the courage, nor nonsense nor clean to take the memory of its predecessor in the flames (like "Jams 2" or Ekorcist II "). No, it buzzes in a slow motion, and often just plays the dead. It looks and seems cheap, with big losses lost in the middle of a messy direction and unconfirmed handling. This was the first time Michelle Pfeiffer saw a significant audience and, although she was not embarrassed, it's a role to be forgotten about. Failure to the lowest level. NO STARS from ****
