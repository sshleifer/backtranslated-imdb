Surprisingly strange, though exhaustive comedy-drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through Houston Astrodome. The quasi-comedy of Robert Altman with eccentric characters is so overwhelmed by the wonders that he begins to squeeze early on weight. Some of the cinemas are evocative, Shelley Duvall is a point in her debut as a tour guide, and Salli Kellerman sees every centimeter as a glamor as Bud Cort's vision of the "mother of a bird" (imagine that Altman and producer Lou Adler explain this role!). In the foreground, Bud Cort - again, after "Harold & Maude" - a true original; not rejecting such, say, Michael J. Pollard, Cort manages to be a geek, an infamous and harmless, difficult act to retreat. Unfortunately, this is one of Altman's cover-ups. He can make the acting team and exhibit like no one else, but let him resort to some wrong inspiration and he spirally descends. ** from the ****
