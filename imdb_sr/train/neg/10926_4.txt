Although the idea is more original than most Sci-Fi movies, execution is, as usual, a drawback. While the practical effects of the mummy are not bad, and the figure of "Gun Nut" is at the top of the challenge of giggling, the only real draw is to see Moreno Baccarin and Adam Baldwin back on the small screen. I suppose it was an idea all the time. They are doing the best they can with what they have, but the moments "must be seen" for me were in the first 40 minutes or so, while Moreno's character wore some Tomb Raider shorts. I do not know a cinema with high magic, but you can not deny the true beauty when you see it !!! And Adam Baldwin once again screwed up like a guy you love to hate. If you just want to look at a couple of your favorite Firefly characters to have fun with some sub couple stuff, then this may be for you. If you want a good acting and character development, we recommend that you look elsewhere.
