If there ever was a film that deserved a great zero thickness, it's this bunch of shit. I love zombie movies, and even bad ones usually have something for them, but not this crime. Actually, I began to be angry at watching this movie because it is so insultingly poor, that I can not believe that people who are responsible for it really will consider it acceptable. with scenes of sadism and bumping. People do not react, do not act, or in any way resemble human beings. The entire film was also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they should be. The whole thing is a meaningless mess, it does not go nowhere and when zombies finally appear, they look like garbage and do not do much. I could make a better movie than this, so would you and so could someone who has never seen a movie before. It's a poor and undoubtedly the worst movie of all time. Honestly, the worst movie of all time. By the way, you will notice that only positive reviews give this 10/10 and we invite you to BUY DVD. I can not imagine that someone neutrally thinks this is a good movie, it's terrible. 0/10 and it's generous.
