Given the title and strange boxing art, I was ready for almost everything. Maybe my expectations were forced to rise a bit, because I stayed a little dry. The filmmaker working on a soft-film movie will end up in a strange house when they lose their fog and decide that the best way to spend the evening is sex. Where did this set not be used before? The difference is that sex is sexually distorted. It is not allowed to show all the goods (chicken recordings were illegal in Japan for a long time, what is shown is blurred), the film tries as much as it can show the viewer how unnatural the sex can be. Among all the events of the event, a muddy monster (whose origins can not be understood) appears and begins to kill men and rape women ... and then kill them. Some of these sights are few, especially the woman who pulled the guts through the vagina or another woman who drops sip ... things, but otherwise the blood is quite a standard price. Finally, the film was demolished by its own design; It's too sexy to be a horrible picture of horror and too creepy to work as a sexual movie. The media can work, but there must be a balance. 4/10
