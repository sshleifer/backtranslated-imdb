This is an interesting idea. Hidden meanings in art that are left as a serial killer sounds intriguing, but the execution in "Anamorph" is incredibly slow and without much interest. There is no other way to describe the film than boring. Death traces are the only interesting part of "Anamorph". Everything that connects them is tiring. Villem Dafoe gives reliable results as an investigator, but he has little to do with a script that stretches to the limit. A few supportive actors are lost, including Peter Stormare as art experts, James Rebhorn as police chief, Paula Lazar as a medical investigator, and most importantly Deborah Harry, who is on the back of a DVD, but only has a few lines spoken through cracked the door. Not recommended. - MERK
