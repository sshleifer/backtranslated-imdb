As a big fan of only the first two seasons of the BSG and the independent BSG Razor, I hoped this edition would return the franchise to the original days of glory. I usually do not have a problem with a science fiction that is mostly guided by dialogue, unlike the visual richness of special effects. If the script is tight with some of the original ideas received by good actors, a deep movie with small CGI money can be created. This move does not have any of the above requirements. The world of virtual reality created by terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous and incredible. This scene is simply set to raise the rating to Restricted. It's not that teens do not like the virtual reality of mosh pits filled with sex and violence and heavy dance music. It is a part about these same teens who have intellectual depth and reason or political and religious passion to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers that confuse me. These kids are definitely not from this planet. The film is played as a soap opera, and the last 10 minutes is a little interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz, who gave his cyborg divine awareness through the upgrade of the student firmware, was fun, if not funny. But this old concept is far better presented and much more convincing in the brilliant, classical original "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Caprica discovers her only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horor movie. No surprises! Overall, this film was mild and unoriginal and inexpensive, using the recycled CGI Caprica from the BSG. I doubt that I will watch this cosmic soap when it is premiered on the Sci-Fi channel. Unless, of course, I suffer from a bad insomnia attack, if this show was definitely a cure. Zzzzzzzz
