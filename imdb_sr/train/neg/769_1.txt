The main mistake in this movie is that it is impossible to believe that any of these people will ever throw themselves into the professional production of Macbeth. Listening to the silent voice of David Lansburi who struggles with the famous speech "Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow" has made it impossible for him to believe that somebody would ever consider him a role. That's why I continued to believe that he did not get a role because he was a bad actor; not because the larger name was available. Then, when we see the parts of the performance on the rehearsal, it is difficult to believe that the director does not parody things with the hopelessly wrong, misguided tragedies of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verses and directors who see the play through their own noise of interpretation. Sometimes directors want to do their own films (and the writers think they have the ability to run their own affairs) to satisfy themselves less. It seems to be such an example.
