It seems to me at the beginning an interesting movie, a Spanish thriller in Madrid's interesting today, but it's none of it, actually a movie that is interesting only to future film directors who learn about what a film should not do, it can. In other words, even the presence of oscars (Mira Sorvino) is not enough to justify the $ 3.00 how much it's spent watching this movie, the acting is terrible and actors seem to just wait to finish the diary to shoot at home, it does not lead anywhere bored It's bad and bad, it does not waste time and money on this movie.
