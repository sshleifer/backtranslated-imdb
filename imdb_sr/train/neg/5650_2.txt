Villiam Shatner is tolerant in small doses. Unfortunately, instead of leaving his character as a little irritation, and in this moderately entertaining, it was considered appropriate to increase his role and exaggeration. As it happened in the original Star Trek series. I guess I'll never understand American humor, which often goes "over the top" to get the message out. I'm playing my legs. I no longer watch the show, which is a shame, because the other actors were good. It is a shame that Shatner's overweight role also affects the performance of James Spader. But the majority shows the way society goes, I suppose. I do not travel in the same directions. honest
