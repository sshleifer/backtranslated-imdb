So did I hear that I read all the reviews and comments on how this movie can earn an Oscar for the best picture, so I went to see it today. What a great disappointment! 1) If you read other reviews, you will find out from members of the US Army who served in Iraq how unlikely the events in this film are unlikely. They reflected my thoughts; while the movie was played by me - a complete civilian - I thought for myself, "I say WHAT? there is no way in which this would happen .." 2) There is very little that actually happens in terms of complication. There was a new type of bomb disposal that replaced the killed one (a death that is not clearly explained). The new guy gets an adrenaline from his job. His attitude puts others at risk. THAT'S IT! 3) This film is not nearly as tense as it claims. If you want tension, try one of Bourne's films. If you want to see a war movie that is emotionally powerful, try to rent the Go Tell The Spartans, which is about the Vietnam War, and the stars Burt Lancaster (who told me PERSONALLY in a happy supermarket that the film was proud of him and he considered some of his best works, which was still disturbed, largely ignored after the overcrowded Apocalypse now), or an old black and white classic from the Second World War, which, especially for the English film, is incredibly heartbreaking. DO NOT HAVE TIME TO Hurt Locker.
