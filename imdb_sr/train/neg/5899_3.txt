Of all the selfish people who worked through Miike and his work. I went through this film tonight. I thought, if half as good as Ringu, as I guessed from these comments, it might be worth my time. No luck. I am for finding the next great director (or writer), but I think Miike is not the one. I do not have the Masters of Fine Arts at NIU, but I know a lot: the horror movie must have a pace. Also, the viewer should be given greater laxity than this film does. This film wanted to shake my head. Some of the scenes near the end dragged so badly, I went to the refrigerator and stayed there while Kou Shibasaki stared at the camera seemingly a minute late, his eyes wide and his mouth. One famous director once said this claim, and I paraphrase, the film could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it turn. Kou is not a good actress for that job. She's paralyzed by an undead girlfriend for more scenes than I remember. And she is not the only one who imitates the deer in the headlights; other members of the band obviously feel the need to mimic this performance. The script gives them little space for a lot of it for too long. I love Asian cinema. The action in Hong Kong has lasted for the past 30 years, a Korean horror such as "Phone" and "Koma", the work of Ang Lee, some of the funny but entertaining Philippine films with free sex and battles, as well as others. Chakushin Ari could have been without it.
