Unfortunately, I do not remember books anymore, but I remember that I was enchanted with the stories of Edgar Vallace. This film represents a typical German production of low quality. It does not keep my attention - although the story itself is good, it is only poorly adapted. At the center of misery are characters that are overly exaggerated and exaggerated - they have no shades in their performances. Even famous and beloved German actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddie Aren can not save this bad spectacle. However, there is hope ... I was told that the films that accompany this film are getting better and better. So in conclusion, I have to say that this movie does not deserve a movie screen, but it can be enough for lazy afternoon.
