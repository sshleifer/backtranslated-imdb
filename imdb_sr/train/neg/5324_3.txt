Vovočka is your everyday hooligan against the author's film. Vovočka, the main character, is early marked as a bad influence on children in the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom from several adults who meet on the road, he thinks that it is difficult to change his naïve ways but deserves it. Personally, I discovered that the actor who played Vovocko was too boring for sympathy, but the change in the tone of the film would enable the majority to feel the emotional struggle that Vovočka has when he wants to be good, but the bad things continue to happen. This fight makes the movie a little different from other films of the same genre, that is the little taste that I thought. All in all, I did not really care about this movie, although it was probably intended for the younger audience.
