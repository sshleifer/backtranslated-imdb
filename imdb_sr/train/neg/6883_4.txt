I am of Puertorican origin, I had mixed fillings about this "documentary". First I insulted that Mrs. Perez compared Senora Campos with Che Guevara. And just a fact, Mr. John Leguzaimo is not a puerant. His parents came from Colombia. Whoever worked on it was not very precise. I feel that the future of our race rests on education. This message was to be echoed through this film, Education is our way to freedom and power. I think that every future effort of this production team should be their focus.
