Children's comedy Michael Keaton from the same title in 1998 was cruelly condemned for her special effects. The killer snowman seems to be made of styrofoam, and his hands look like huge gloves. Which were probably. The actors place him in this parody of dozens of other (much worse) films, and Paul Keith as a city doctor is especially remembered in a small but harsh role.
