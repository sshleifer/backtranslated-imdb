Do not watch this movie if you appreciate your mind. At the end of our collective watching, me and my friends, we estimated that each of us lost 5% of the brain during his course. The only person involved in his production who was not clinically crazy was the set designer. Most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth. Now I realize that, instead of the feeling of repulsion, this film has caused deep hatred in me. I hate this movie so much, very much. Some might say that this movie is not conceived as serious. Just do not take it seriously. But it is. The plot is a heated version of the Blade Runner-eskue universe, coupled with cheap rubber suits that dominate bad movie dinosaurs. Dialogue is not only childish and meaningless, but often literally ill. Vhoopee Goldberg does not even try, but George Nevbern as Theodor Reek's voice is like a nail on his soul. And whether Juliet Landua will again be with the British accent or Richard Roundtree (called Shaft) as an injured commissar, you are sinking into a growing sense of unbelief and disappointment. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see the depths of stupidity that humanity can fall.
