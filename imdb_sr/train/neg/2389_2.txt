Uma Thurman plays Sissi, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and strange big thumbs) that breaks into the cross, eventually finds her right place among a group of peoote-enlightened cowboys at a ranch dedicated to the preservation of the donkey jacket; Rain (onion) Phoenix is ​​their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellibean, who falls in love with Sissi, thumbs or no. Gus Van Sant directed and adapted Thomas Robbins' book, but his satire has no primary target and only skaters across the map, such as Sissi (perhaps it was his goal, but that's not for the audience). The infamous boxing flop is not so difficult as it was ignored, and it can be seen why: it's a series of sketches in a quest for complication, and performances, directories and cinema are variable. Thurman is a point posing along the highway and trying to get on the road, but this is pretty well put on the Phoenician career. Writer Buck Henry (who did not write it, but may need to have it) gives the most likely performance as a doctor working on one of these palaces. Two inches down.
