Terrible images of poverty from the 1930s and '40s, pushing me out of hell. God knows I have nothing against low-budget films, but those who have produced in that period have such a gloomy, gloomy look about them - and, ultimately, they're just not very good. "The Corpse Vanishes" is a bit more fun than the "bottom-of-barrel dreck" as "The Invisible Ghost" and "The Ape Man", but it's not a classic. White Lugosi, who has passed its peak "Dracula", plays another crazy doctor; Unbearable Elizabeth Russell plays his wife. They sleep in coffins, because, as Lugosi explains to the suspicious young journalist (Luana Valters), the suitcase is much more comfortable than the bed. Ho hum. Angelo Rossitto and Minerva They also are at your fingertips, which can satisfy the hardcore fans of the '30s and '40s.
