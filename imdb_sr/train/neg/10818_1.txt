Reading the novel before I looked at this film, I was incredibly disappointed with the woodwork and arrogance of producers in their open neglect of complications. I feel that this film does not in any way reflects the brilliance of Brunt's work, but gives the impression of a shallow love story. In film condensation for a short 2 hours, the film lost many key features that make the book understandable and progressive, resulting in a somewhat nervous plot with a little ground. It does not matter to the romance between Rochester and Jane Eire, so this looks pretty quick and unfounded, because these two characters have such a rare interaction that you can not but think that their 'love' is superficial. This is such an injustice to Bronte's novel, there is no impression of Jane's strange face and boldness that attracts Rochester to her, and his arrogance that draws Jane to him. that several characters were shown very sharply, namely, Mrs. Fairfax and Grace Poole, however, the total production was poor. Given the better scenario, the film might have been more successful. See "Jane Eire" (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for outstanding production.
