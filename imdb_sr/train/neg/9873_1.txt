I watched her with my mom and we were like ... What the hell? We did not get it at all. Maybe I was wrong, but the chair has something to do with the death of my father's father. That movie was terrible! This is not a movie for those who love a good tension film. Bad suspense movie! * shakes the film * I will never see him again. And I'm a big fan of life movies! They have to stop making movies. It drives me crazy! Wit was ugly, yet he loves him more than Hugh, who was MALI a bit nicer. : 1/10
