To make any kind of film about the presumed end of the world, there should be some facts and realism 1. We have never been told why these people believe in it. 2.Location is the New Year in Toronto, Canada. SO PLEASE ONLY ONE SHOW ME WHY THAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE PEACE AND WHY (BASED ON THE COTTONS) WANT TO SEE THE SEPTEMBER 3. The act was in this neo-in-natural style, for which it was a necessary director who knew how to do it. 4. Individual stories were gloomy and for no purpose. I could continue, but I do not want this to be bored as a movie. Rate * 1/2 (out of 4) 2 on IMDB scale Thank you I am as always JAI HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSSMAN
