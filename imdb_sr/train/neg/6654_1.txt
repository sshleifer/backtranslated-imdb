Usually, I think Hollywood productions are not suitable to be called a movie, so I call them movies instead. But this piece of elephant fertilizer is not even suitable to be called a movie, that is, quotes in the title. Where can I start? 1. If this is not the beginning of geriatric casting, it is certain that it represents. Stefanie Povers should play someone for less than half a year, she should play the 18-year-old, and she's fourteen! 2. A terrifying and stupid mindless portrait of Paris and France, where we see cliche characters such as: the cute soldier of the store, the bitch of the queen of models, the fairy tale of the fairy tale of the former queen of the model, and so on. respecting Da Vinci code, (which the reviewers correctly defined as a comedy). 3. It is very and extremely funny that you have no nudity in the film about time and place where nakedness was so commonplace, especially if the whole focus is on it 4. Terrible акценти !!! 5. Nana Mouskouri elevator-music! I could continue, but I think this is enough. And I was able to make these observations after I watched this shit in just half an hour while surfing the internet and chatting with friends about mathematical equations ... I mean ... !!!!! I invite everyone to add to my list. :): P: D
