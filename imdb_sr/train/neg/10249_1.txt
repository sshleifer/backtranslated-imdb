What to say about this movie except "I do not see". I waited and waited and waited for something (or something) to happen and it just did not come. Watch stunningly as two people walk around while setting a record for most of the screen loading time in a single movie. What are they doing? Do they solve the mystery? Are they collecting clues? Maybe it's hard to say. At the end of the film, after many radio signals are decoded (unclear on some type of PET monitor) and this guy gives some lectures, the action is finally revealed and cast as soon as possible. Some aliens want to return to their world utopia of the world and are so happy that they want to blow up the earth (I suppose they do not like to share wealth). I guess they finished shooting and saw their 35-minute work or art (trash!) And decided to let the editorial team convert it into a 88-minute feature film. Look at your own risk, it's not even ridiculous because it's so bad, it's just bad.
