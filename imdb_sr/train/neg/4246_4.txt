Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her consecrated son (Ron Silver) to find the withdrawn movie star Greta Garbo and present them before Estelle checks her forever. Maybe it's called "Bancroft Talks" because the actress attacks this uncertain comedic / dramatic / sentimental material for its duration. The director Sydney Lumet, who is hot or cold, can not achieve a consistent rhythm, and Bancroft's constant exaggerated reaction is not reduced at all by filmmakers - he holds his own right: sweet, teary eyes and ranking. Estelle becomes a drag on this scenario (not a thin-tangled plot has much further). Silver and co-stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks end up with very little work, but they support the star, and everyone is being thrown out of it. * 1/2 of ****
