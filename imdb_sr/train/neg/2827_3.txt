The story is at first interesting: slavery in (late) 20th century from west Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem is that he deliberately casts two favorite enemies of Richard Fleisser: the Arabs and the Germans. To convince us that people from Arab countries could freely wander around and easily catch black people in West Africa, it is as convincing as white people who sought slaves in the "root". Obviously, both jobs are guided by the local population and include (d) much more sophisticated networks. While Arab countries are involved in today's trafficking of children and sex slaves, Israel is one of the worst offenders in line with Amnesty International. Why then just point to the Arabs and then choose the German as the only European buyer? This is the apparent bias and hatred of these people by the Jewish director. Michael Caine (Dr. Linderbi) is as good as ever.
