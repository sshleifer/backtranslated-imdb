I am from the Dallas / Fort Vorth area and live in Arlington for several years. This film was far from being like Arlington. I saw mountains in the background of a scene! Texas does not have a mountain. I suppose this happens when a film in Texas is filmed in Canada. Accents are also very bad. It was supposed to act actors from Texas to play parts. There are a lot of Texas actors in Hollywood. The film is really sad, because it's a real story. I pray that the killer be found and convicted. The only good thing is that bc of her death, now we have Amber Alert to help us quickly find missing children after they were kidnapped.
