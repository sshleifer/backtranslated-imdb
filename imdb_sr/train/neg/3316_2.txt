This was the first film of Evan McGregor I've ever seen outside Star Wars. Since then I have become a great fan of Evan McGregor, but I still can not forgive myself for the existence of this film. My sister has always been a great fan of Jane Austen and because of this I have been subjected to various classics, Emma was one of them. I always considered them irritating, stupid and boring. However, after watching this terrible performance, I was forced to admit that the original Emma was wonderful and charming. Evan McGregor barely serves the purpose in this film after hacking and disrupting Franck Churchill's part. Gweneth Paltrow is funny in an already funny character, and the rest of the film is incomparable and stupid. My recommendation to everyone who is interested in English drama drama ... see the original. If you're a fan of Evan McGregor ... believe me, skipping this movie, you missed nothing but a five minute minority in his stupid hat and a bad haircut.
