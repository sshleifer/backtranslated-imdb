Not the best film to remember Paula Naschia. Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst swordsman I've ever seen. Zorro would be ashamed! His only salvation came because the competition was equally bad. This film is described as an adventure and horror. Forget the horror - there is no. No nudity, no blood, no monsters; only Robin Hood adventure against the evil baron (Paul Naschi) who wants to be king. The main feature of the film was the view of Graciela Nilson, who filmed only four films in two years and went missing. Where did she go?
