God, what a terrible thing! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something similar (see horrible use of music and pictures here), but for what really? It seems that the whole thing behind the "Natural born killers" is a "smart" look at how the media can turn into a totally trash, but unfortunately the film turns into a trash. Please. Stone, the next time you want to criticize fascism TV shows using violence to get high rates, avoid doing the same with your movie! Michael Haneke very cleverly said about this film to condemn media fascism in fascist cinematic ways. How true ... He just forgot to tell us about the massive headache you got after you've been through this long-lasting shit!
