I must agree with most of the opinions of all that this show was poorly produced, as well as written. The acting was not much higher than the lower value of production, but I think that the actor can rely only on the material provided to them and do the best he can. In line with that thought, I think it's important to emphasize that one actor has risen and persevered further from this campaign to unsuccessful production to become a respectable and rather talented performer. traveling through many poorly-produced shows and films to find a place on HBO's "Dead Like Me" role playing the role of Daisy Adair and acting on his credit worthiness in an effective way. on the young actress during this series in which Ashlei acted in a soft but intelligent 7th grade. I felt as if, if anyone could "pull out" from this series, surely to be Laura Harris and true to her nature, she was excellent in acting to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her talent and unique Nordic blue attraction. If ever you have the opportunity to look at this series, I recommend that you have something epic to watch after a department such as "godfather" or maybe "beach" to remind that there is a great deal of true productivity and is worth it there and that this series is just a low budget reminder to what Laura Harris can simply say about her time on the show and bet that she would quote many words of young defense saying "This is the beginning!"
