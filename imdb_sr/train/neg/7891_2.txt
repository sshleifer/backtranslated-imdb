The summary of the IMDb diagram does not in any way describe the essence of this film. She should read: "Be ready to be thrown back to the prison of the third bench on the back of your family's church at the age of 8, listening to the preacher of God's will, and all you can think of is returning home to your Lego." /> Begins with good intentions, building intrigues by planting some real and extraordinary traces such as Rennie's "how the cut on my thumb healed so fast?" Then he slowly turns into a Christian mushroom, sacrificing his a tangle entirely in the evangelical caress I used to use the word 'pray' about 53 times in the five-minute range near the end.After 31, I tried to turn the context of the word to its synonyms, 'booty.' Unfortunately, this small mind game made the movie at least tolerable for the last 20 minutes In addition, I laughed whenever a person said a "prej" for me, as it became totally unpredictable. Indeed, even my Catholic woman drowned in her chair from boredom, almost to the extent She ended up on the floor. For all Christians who have broken this film from 8-10 stars, I suggest you stick to your security standards that strengthen theology, such as Circular Square, the Ten Commandments, all of Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and the like . Stay away from a much more difficult challenging theme in movies such as the Jesus Camp, the God who was not there, what Jesus would buy, or soon published Religulous. Maybe Robert Whittle's book is better.
