This is even worse than the original game of death. A tainted, unconnected story leads Billy Lo down from the helicopter to the ground, killing him while we're left to follow his younger brother Bobi Loa. So, not only do we start with Bruce Lee's clown, but we kill him and follow another thirty minutes in the story. The main reason for this is when Bobbi Lo fights with a lion, who is obviously a guy in a lion's costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also a villain, who is usually pretty scary, but his time on the screen is significantly low. Mostly they watched this and the original game of death, because they are part of Bruce Lee's set. No wonder they were involved in Lee's finished work. Nobody would have bought them differently.
