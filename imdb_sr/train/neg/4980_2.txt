I just read the review that defends this movie because it had a small budget, now my point of view. CGI monsters were reasonably well animated, but they were implemented in the worst possible way. Fighting scenes were not even fighting, but only one actor's shot, and then one bullet of the monsters with very interaction. When the monster was in interaction, it looked like it was done in a professional workshop. In my opinion, if you have a small budget, you should use models and dolls. Maybe they do not look like a fantasy, but at least they're interacting, just look at the early films of Peter Jackson. where they are. The scenario seemed to me confused. One moment they would talk as if it was a modern day, and the next day you will get Shakespeare's drama club. I'm not saying that everything should be 'you' and 'to be', but you have to find a cohesive balance so that the lines sound like they come from the same person. I noticed near the beginning when Beovulf quoted an old vow that would find he had not spent the rest of the movies talking about gods and sights. In short, this film is very polished turd, but still less.
