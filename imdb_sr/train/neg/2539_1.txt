It must be one of the worst waste 35mm movie film ever released, a continuation of at least a fun pseudo-documentary original film, Legend of Boggy Creek. Poor scripts, worse acting, etc., etc. Dawn Vells had to hope that Gilligan would save and take him back to the island just to escape from this piece.
