The creativity of Frank Capra must have been spent while filming this film. Although there are several charming moments, and many marvelous performers, Caprina's open recycling of not only scenarios, but also significant footage from his first version of this story, Broadvai Bill (1934), is quite bad. It is understandable to re-use images from a top-end horse race, which is exciting. But he uses the whole scene of dialogue with smaller actors, then returns those actors and obviously expects us to not notice, for example, that Vard Bond is 14 years old! Unless you want to see one of Oliver Hardy's recent performances, skip this one and watch Broadvai Bill instead.
