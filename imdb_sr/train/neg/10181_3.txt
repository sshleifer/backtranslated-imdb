This movie is so bad it's ridiculous. Scott Backula plays a coach, but that does not matter, it's important to be a big black guy who plays 1st base. He must first have at least 75 years, but still plays baseball in a small league, the second time he starts a movie in the field, although he is not able to walk, let alone run. Coach Backula moves him brilliantly in the first place, stating that when he tries to run, he stays in the same place for too long a period of time. Backula shows a brilliant coaching strategy at the end of the film, (SPOILER), tells his player "dovntovn" to hit the home race, apparently the "center" considers it a good move. He scored a home run and won the match for his team, a smaller league team that played twins who were the class of mainstream films. Now, only if Toni Muser, the manager of Roials, was a smart coach like Backula, and told his players to simply hit the home run in every situation, Roials would never end innings, let alone lose the game.
