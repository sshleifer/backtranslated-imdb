... it was so that, with a good save, I can tell everyone how horrible this movie is. I barely passed twenty minutes before I began to think: "Wow, this is pretty bad." And, to be honest, I would give this movie 1 star that it was not Esai Morales (although he had very little time on the screen). He is the only actor of the film, which is a shame because I really like Gil Bellovs ... or at least I thought I was. As I watched this, I began to think about his role. Shavshank Redemption "and realized it was not as good as I thought. Problem: his act in prison / hard guy seems to be just an act; his dialogue sounded like he had a very bad impression. Has he ever met someone who it sounds like his character was COMPLETED? I doubt it, but maybe he should have it. And, to make things worse, they managed to put some philosophy in jail and make it appear to be nothing less than a fictitious, especially when you consider that the rhetoric has buoyed by "growth" that was so strong that it seemed unnatural. <b /> I would not normally slam such a movie, but when I saw the movie I had a pretty good preview. I felt like I cheated and lied, and I thought I should try to save someone from the misery that I have to watch this film. I say BOOOOOOOO.
