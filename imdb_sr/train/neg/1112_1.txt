I enjoy watching Western movies, but this movie takes a cookie. Scenario and dialogue are ridiculous. The acting was terrible, where did they come from? Music is fine, I have to say. Fortunately, I did not buy or rent a movie, but it is now postponed. I was ready at the beginning when a stranger (martin sheen) began to tell his story. I have to admit that I enjoyed the confrontation between Hopalong and Tek, where Hopalong struck Tove's finger and told him that the 40-year practice had reached his league. But after that it all went in the form of a pear. I had to watch the whole movie in the hope that it would be better, never.
