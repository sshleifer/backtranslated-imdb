Before you look at this movie, please review the reviews that are available on the internet regarding the falsification of the film's events, and especially its reversals regarding the widely accepted fact that 7-8,000 Muslim men were transferred from Srebrenica and killed by Serbian paramilitaries. The documentary also belongs to various pro-Serbian American organizations. Please critically watch this movie and read the reviews beforehand. Most critics argue that the documentary takes its arguments too far, even if it asks questions that are aimed at a conventional opinion on the war. A review in NITimes by Stephen Holden states that it would be "incorrectly label this documentary pro-Serbian language," but the facts should be re-examined, many of which were taken from reliable sources, and the omission of these facts by Serbian forces. I do not advise you to watch this documentary, but I warn you to review it with a particularly critical eye (as it should be done at any moment).
