I can not recommend this movie as a date movie. The semi-autobiographical view of Garry Oldman about the life that lived on a property in southeast London is violent, Beckett's account of one of the Dante's circles of hell, frankly. At the center is Rai Vinstone, who had previously done this kind of character, but never. The film begins with a drink order at the pub bar - that's all - and you've already been caught in the feeling of frustration, self-perpetuation and barbarism that expose it in many different ways during the film. It's an acting masterclass. Naturally, the backward and deprived are needed film in drama like this one and Vinstone is in line with Kathy Burke as his long-time woman, who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behavior. Charlie Creed-Miles is able to turn as Billy's son, who provided illumination, although he sometimes wondered why he allowed himself. Garry Oldman guides the actors, maximizing the claustrophobia of their plain riot. 4/10
