Pretty handsome guy falls on a cute blonde; and she loves him, but not for reasons you might think. A little-seen black comedy by writer Patten Proft has very good performances by Joe Alaskey and Donna Dikon, but this has no lasting impact. It's just a quick effort, led by Norman Bates himself, Anthony Perkins. Even at the level of B-comedy, something like "Eating Raoul" is a better bet. There is definitely a fun item here; Unfortunately, the picture has nowhere else in its other act. An interesting attempt, but it does not burn. ** from ****
