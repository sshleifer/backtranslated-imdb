I checked this movie when he still had 6 votes and said as 7.2 or something, but it's a serious horror movie. Let's interrupt him. The first thing you will notice about this movie is that it was shot on a hand-held digital camera owned by a college freshman. the next thing you will notice is that the actors are all friends of the aforementioned fruitor (they probably met them in the pub of the previous night. The third on the list you will notice that music editing is terrible, and try to absorb many songs in this movie, at intervals of 30 seconds. .. and all digital processing is done on the aforementioned home-based PC of the Bruce ... probably by using a Windows Live recording program. I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know, but I say that the writer and director watch this movie in hell for eternity.
