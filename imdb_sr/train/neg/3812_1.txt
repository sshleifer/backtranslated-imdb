Full House is one of the worst TV series ever! Why? Because all the characters are so irritating it is impossible to bear. The best character is Joei and he is quite irritating occasionally. This girl DJ, who wrote her character? to mention when Danny begins with his philosophy. Example: DJ has won about ten thousand dollars or more in casino. However, it is not eighteen years old and should not be gambled by law. ready to pay her the money, but then Danny, her father took her and did not let her raise that money because she was not eighteen. Oh, come on, give me a break, will you? Some of what they say in this series did not even buy a child. Who in the world could think that Full House is fun and fun? Every word they say in this series looks like Shakespeare wrote. In addition, Shakespeare knew how to write and besides being not childish and stupid to write something stupid as they wrote in the Full House script! For those who have a bad heart or any kind of bad health or any kind of life or any sense of the real world, I deeply recommend 'Do not Look Full House'! Avoid this series. Beware of stupidity and nonsense. This is the worst television show ever!
