This movie is bad. If you are thinking about watching a movie, there is only one decent scene in the movie, and it takes about 5 seconds (Amanda Carravai in Toples). The rest of the movie is horrible. I think that high school students probably play better. The action does not make any sense. The set was pretty sloppy, and it was not even good to be funny. She was boring and very bad! I looked at Starz so I thought he had to be at least decent. The mini description sounded like it would be fine. The girl is killed because there is obviously no reason at the beginning of the film, after having to look at some terrible music video. Transitions between the scenes are BIG HUGE and as if someone simply put the tone of the pics into a movie without thinking about how to translate them. It only cuts from one scene to another without smoothness. As if I accidentally switch from talking about how bad the movie is, let me explain why the action is bullshit. The sound is reduced in some places, where you can barely hear it, and then there is a loud gaius 'hysterical shrieks' casting randomly on the film. It's the same sound every time. This is now officially the worst movie I've ever seen <br /> Actress: 0/10 Effects: 1/10: 1,000,000 / 10
