There is absolutely nothing in this film that shows even the smallest talent. Nobody ever tried to play it, even the coffee statistics seem to be glued. Nothing looks like a rehearsal. The quality of the movie is terrible. Most 'actions' take place in narrow corridors or apartments with a cameraman who is pricked as a later thought, sweeping some inexpensive camera back and forth between the 'actors' while delivering their lines. No tripod and no suitable microphone, sound quality is terrible. Even Manos is better than this, at least they have the right equipment. What is simply lost in a production disorder. Stay home videos, preferably made by a five-year-old kid who is trying out a video function on Dad's new camera phone. You'll be in a long search for a movie that's better than this.
