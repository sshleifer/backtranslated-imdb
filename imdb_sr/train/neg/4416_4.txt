A less-subtle blow in the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church gets a darker shade of death near the end of the show. Through the show, dark humor plays a medium through which sets out a number of frequently heard rhetorical questions, in particular: "If God is so good, why does evil allow in the world?" Diane Keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version (though some may disagree) that they are a stereotyped religious teacher who spins the "company line" and condemns half the world to burn in hell. In order to celebrate the 25th anniversary of her school, she invites her first pupils to come back and perform their Christmas choices. However, when the quartet "restores" its game to parody the "wrong" teachings of Sister Mary, the nun pushes it over the edge, sending the story spirally in a chain of unfortunate events. The ending finally leaves the audience feeling sick in their hearts. It is not recommended. Go look at the play instead.
