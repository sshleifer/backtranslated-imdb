Unless you understand that the film is desperate, this film does not mean much to you. An attempt was made to put a little human into a cold and dark period consumed with alcohol and drugs - it did not function. When Salma Haiak made her big disco number, her voice was so obviously called "pathetic" - the producers could at least bring someone who sounded remotely like her. Our history. Nobody, except Mike Miers, can not be accused of acting; However, he does an incredible job.
