This is the first film of the Horrorfest I watched, and after I almost thought I did not have to see one of the others. I was told that it was a "movie about horror thoughts" and I have to say that if it should have made me think that I will hitch up to think about what the movies from the collection will be. Do not misunderstand me, even worse in this movie is not worth it to go. The shop is very washed with too much art for art. The effects of the camera and music for most of the time are not in place, and the characters are at least banal. Several characters and scenes look useless at the end when they begin to discover some of the hammers "The Hamiltons". I realized who Lenni was about half an hour when I realized the film. I was so visually under the aggravated and confused Lennie's discovery that I felt completely torn away. I was expecting what I had received, but they could go so much further, in fact, the worse it fell completely flat. With movies such as "Hostel" and "Sav" you should be a bit better for a movie that "is considered graphic or too disturbing to the general public".
