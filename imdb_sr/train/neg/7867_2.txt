Okay, I tried and tried it myself, but I still do not get that thing with Guy Maddy. Stories From the hospital Gimli left me cold, this film about the Austrian villagers and that of the Ice Nymphs looked pretty, but they were missing in the story department ... and this film about nudists about abortion and hockey is just boring. I am glad Madden is grateful for the silent film, but I do not like his films for the same reason I do not like Quentin Tarantin's films: they are empty homage to a better, imaginative film - films that have developed an art form or a new field has broken - and they all have style and they have no substance. Without the jumps and unusual corners of the camera, the fact that Maddin is an unusual David Linch, although he has an advantage over Tarantin, is concealed: he does not write an uncomfortable dialogue at all because most of his films rely on internal words. The ultimate conclusion is that Maddy's dick is a clever smart film for ambitious movie masters.
