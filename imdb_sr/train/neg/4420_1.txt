"Anything a great documentary could be"? Yes, if someone is deaf, stupid and blind. All but meanings, wit, visual style and interesting themes. Around that. . . Seriously, volken. This is a movie that is completely inaccurate. An adventure doctor without adventure, a war doctor without a sense of war, camping without any trace of wit. It does not mean anything, does not feel like anything and carries an implicit message that absolutely nothing matters. No wonder there are so many IMDb fans! Of course, going into the knowledge of a movie in which Big Skip Lipman plays will not have any culture, intelligence, wit (except corrupting adolescent jokes) and no recognizable human emotion? only adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a movie - panic attack! Avoid. There are too many documentaries and too little time to spend on building a toilet, such as "Darkon".
