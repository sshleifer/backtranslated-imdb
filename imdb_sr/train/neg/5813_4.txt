Tiernei is an authentic guy, but this film failure from a normally competent RKO undermines his influence at every step. The scenario is as convincing as OJ Simpson on the evening of Ten Obligations. Just counting the time when Tierney's incredible automobile companions swallow a miserable excuse for another because of his avoiding and violent actions. The old clich√©s about "just happening in movies" is here in peaks. Then there's the guy who played the guard, who seemed to wander from VC Fields's spicy comedy, ruining the menacing mood in the process. Static one-piece sets also do not help, and even the director Feist does not have an obvious lack of sense of material. Then add a final automobile move that lacks imagination and pays off, and the results are fairly straightforward. In fact, the film appears only on stage in stations where police officers discover the hidden powers of innocent gas station employees. It's a pity that Tienei's career never really wanted. I guess that was largely because he was a big and powerful guy outside the screen, as well as having one scratchy scratch after another. His icy cold and clarity of emotion remind me of Lee Marvin's time at his best guy. In any case, this project may have worked as a radio, but as a movie with a promising title noir, it's disappointing.
