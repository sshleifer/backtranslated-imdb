Someone will have to explain to me why is every film that characterizes poor people and adopts a pseudo-persistent look, somehow seen as "real" by some people. I did not see anything real about the characters (although the actors did their best with really bad parts) or situations. Instead, I saw a forced, self-conscious effort to be "sharp", "big" and "down and dirty". Unfortunately, it takes much more than holding a camera without rhyme or reason and does not light up a movie to achieve any of the above mentioned qualities in any significant way. It is a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only movies that see the inside of the film today are all copies, with poor cinema, a non-existent camera direction, and many curses in an effort to present themselves as "art." It's a little strange that films like "In the bedroom" or "About Schmidt" get such a rave. I discovered that the meanders are very average, but compared to the current number of independent clones such as "Raising the winner of Vargas" they are completely brilliant and inspired. A few years ago, the video of an "independent" movie meant that you would probably be treated with some originality and a lot of energy and concern, and perhaps a few technical mistakes caused by low budgets, today, that means the chances that you will get another one by numbers, come on -Shake-the-camera-around-your-hour attempt to alleviate the lack of taste of independent distributors. And of course, all this serves the character and situations that are completely unreal and fictitious. Is it surprising that the independent market has fewer and less surviving companies? Not until you see movies such as Raising Victor Vargas who do nothing but copy the worst films they have before.
