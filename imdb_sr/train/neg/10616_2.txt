Dire. Just dire. The script is fictitious, the act is painful, and the story only retreats. That is, without a doubt, the celebration of Sally Potter and a little bit of the other. It would not be that bad, but she's a director, a writer and a star of the movie, and that's self-glorification. I found myself not worrying about the development of romance between the two main characters, and the end did not come too early. He has two redemption properties. The first is that many recordings are really great, especially in Paris, and look pretty good in black and white. Second, whether you love tango or not, music is pretty good (except where Salli begins to sing). Watch this movie at your own risk, or if you need unintentional laughter. I'm sure someone likes it. Statistically, it must.
