I'll keep this brief, because I know I do not have much to say. Alive is a strange little movie that obviously attracts some, but I discovered that it's a shocking bland from almost the very beginning. The film did very little for all the characters to like, and the story sometimes became so intricate that I completely lost interest. As I said, I know that others enjoyed it, but I found Kitamur's "Alive" to be everything except - a chromatic, extremely boring drama disguised as a sci-fi movement that causes thinking. I felt as if I was drawn into watching this film, based on its intriguing room and uber-exciting title picture. My proposal? Get it for Kitamur's far more comfortable Bruce effort "Versus" or his rebellion from 2004. "Godzilla: Final Vars". ... And do not misunderstand me, I'm always ready a good movie of a man who thinks, but that certainly was not. It was a moment when I really worried about an event that took place in this film that was too loud, difficult for dialogue. If you want to talk about something ... talk about annoying.
