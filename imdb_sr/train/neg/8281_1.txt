This was a silly movie with a predictable story and a terrific game !! Villa Nelson was as rigid as braids. The movie looked like a long ad for the bright red lip that was worn by Jessica Simpson - especially as there were so many big plans on her face. The premise was not fun and as I said - soooooooo predictable. Whatever money was spent on making this film was a waste of waste. Any allusion to other old movies Marilyn Monroe did not even improve the viewing of Blonde Ambition. It was so incredible - Jessica Simpson was able to enter the position of Executive Secretary at the fall of the hat - it was funny !!!
