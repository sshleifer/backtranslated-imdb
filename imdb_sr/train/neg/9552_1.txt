Just a good old stupid. I mean really stupid, not very stupid like Killer Tomatoes, or Ed Vood movies, this is probably the dumbest movie I've ever seen. To make the film a golden Turkey is an insult to turks. Calling this movie stupid is offensive even for stupid people. If this is the future of American cinema and art, it's better to start 3rd and 4th World War at the same time and let the cockroach launch the show afterwards. Now I have to get drunk to wash this insult to my only brain ... This is a really good movie if you are suicidal.
