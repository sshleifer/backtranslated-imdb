It was definitely the stupid, cruelest, most irreverent movie I've seen for some time. I was tempted to turn off the VCR, but, as if fascinated by watching a terrible traffic accident, I literally found PRIMARY EDUCATION in every possible way and thrown it out to the end. I am not a crafty opponent who opposes the comic display of sexual antiquities on the screen. Animal House, Porki's, There's Something About Mari, and American Pie movies, and even the infamous Freddy Got Fingered I was very pleased at my own terms. Mamie Van Doren has the most terrible look of geriatric geriatrics ever since The Shining. Ineptly arranged and recorded, with the incredibly disturbing performances of Devon Saw and Jason Schwartzman, the film ended, without the benefit of being screwed up once. The only useful purpose of a movie is as a textbook example of how not to make a rough image. Oh, well, it would serve well as a fertilizer for grass.
