Previous comments encouraged me to check it when it appeared on TCM, but that was a serious disappointment. Lupe Valdez is great, but there is not enough time for the screen. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play well-known but promising characters, but leave the script stunned. The film revolves around ego character Lee Tracy, who is at best a selfish, physically and verbally abusive jerk. The reactions of the "public" are poorly thought-out and incredible, making the "shenanigans" look like a poor writer's contribution. And it is disturbing that the character of Lupe Velez could fall on him. The "one-piece", which is mentioned in the second review, must depend on the observer, since I did not even notice that the attempt was made.
