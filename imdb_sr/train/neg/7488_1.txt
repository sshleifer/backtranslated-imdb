Anyone who has seen the original 1970s film knows that an excellent actor, scriptwriter and director can compose a masterpiece of comedy. By the same principle, it's easy to see how it can create another unhappy Hollivood bore-a-thon! This film was pathetic! If there was no John Clayse (comical genius), I would walk out for about 15 minutes into this terrible loss of celluloid. Neil Simon would not write yet another script for this version (he said he could not fix it on the first one), and I am surprised that after this film fiasco I would not sue for a libel of humor! original, what did the producers think about when they dropped this one? How could the director and editor look at these scenes and think that any of them is ridiculous? I do not know, but one thing I know - not surprising why foreign and independent films are becoming more popular .......
