Final Justice has a great Joe Don Baker running around Texas and firing at people shooting at people. Then he goes to Malta where he shoots more people. He's locked up many times for shooting people. Then she goes into a shooting with a bad guy, dressed like a monk. There's a boat trip, and Joe Don closes in jail again. Finally Joe Don, with the help of Elaine from "Seinfeld", kills a bad guy, a boat or two raises into the air, and someone is shot with a torch. All this and an attractive theme, just like Mitchell!
