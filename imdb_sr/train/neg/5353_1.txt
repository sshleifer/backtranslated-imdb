I had the "privilege" to attend a special screening of the "Absence of Light" film at the horor convention in Ohio. First of all, you know that you are in trouble when the director introduces the film, saying, "Now keep in mind, we did not have much money ..." Not that films without a budget are bad, but when the director uses this As an excuse, the results are always bad. And there is no better example of this elusive sleep. In fact, the 'absence of light' marks the first in the world of the underground cinema: it's the only time I've seen talented genres that artificial parents really gave birth to. Charismatic actors such as David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister accidentally enter and exit the film and prove they are as uninteresting as amateur non-names. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? Who cares? Everything is so boring, you will stop worrying about anything or anything. After thirty minutes of this endurance test, I quit and left the theater. Not surprisingly, like most actors. Any fan of the genre would be good to stay away from it. With a little luck, this movie will never see the "light" of the day.
