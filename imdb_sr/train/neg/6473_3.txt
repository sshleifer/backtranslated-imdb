As a child, the first part ("Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie. He was filled with great characters, songs and a fun family movie. A week later, I first watched this movie. I believe this film was like most of the sequels and did not outperform their original. I think I feel like this because I had great expectations and I grew up. However, this is not a bad movie. It begins when Ariel just gave birth to a wonderful child, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgan (Eurselas' sisters), so they build a huge wall around his home around the sea. While Melody grows, she starts to wonder outside the walls where she is forbidden to go. The trouble is stirred as Morgan tries to take control of the seven seas. I loved that the voices were the same and again wonderful singing. I think this is a good family movie.
