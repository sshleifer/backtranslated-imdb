A movie with very few positive words for it. First, he has a zero pace and positively misses any drama. Using the same recordings again and again. I lost count of how many times I saw "that" field at night or that cracked ground. It also has the underlying reason that if the audience does not know about things that will not only be confused. So, without any signs that there are any questions, at once we find that marriage is not what seems to be like, despite the fact that it is given the impression that it is fine. We find that Jacob is perhaps the worst farmer in the universe, as he does not seem to spend time on the farm and he seems to have bought land with completely useless acre. Beth has the key from the book store? There are many other issues that some of them were resolved later in the film, much later, in fact, too late. And on the acre site. The film makers of the horror point out that the great inanimate things are not otherwise daunting? and also if they are meant to be great acres, and then do so. There is also a scary lack of reasonableness like Beth (the best contractor in the piece and then Jefferson's cop) suddenly seems to be charged for everything under the sun just because he is on "medication". With a full ten-minute drive from the field looking for a missing child (whether crawled out of It's six months old), the movie goes down into a badly written scene after a badly written scene. Bad plonka "horror" music does not add an atmosphere. Often bad movies can be fun, but not empty acrias, which is simply bad.
