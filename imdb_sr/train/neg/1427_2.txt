The British cremation series that put "witty" conversations taken from "average" people into the mouths of "sweet" imaginative creatures, at least had the advantage for non-British viewers of the apparent jerk and a kind of rarely cultivated humor that could not be used by American television. Someone made a mistake when he put it on US television. Unfortunately, the American version of the sublime Brit-com COUPLING, which died in a month at NBC, when the same basic scripts were not translated from British to American English, what looked like in England drol and cultivated (and only BIT bored), encounters in CREATURE COMFORTS, the American version, as simply boredom with dolls. There is no drawing line, there are no signs, and after looking at one and a half of the episodes (out of the three broadcasted at the end), there is no reason for suffering for more. The only positive thing to say about the new summer series and the mercifully short collision that he had was that the clammy was at least professionally performed and comes as a set for the worst performance on the CBS schedule, the New Adventures of Old Kristina (or " how to be HORRIBLE mother "- or a person - in an endless, unrecognized lesson"), children who wanted to stay upstairs in spite of their sleep time happily ran into bed rather than sit through this show, and adults could wait to include up to 21 hours when "Two and a Half Men" "(guilty pleasure ) and "How I Met Your Mother" (actual writing quality).
