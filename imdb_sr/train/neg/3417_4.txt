My first review of this film was so negative that it was no exception. I'm going to try to describe this. Lets be real !!! No one wants to see a Chuck Norris film in which the HE is not the main character. In the end, it was a good scene, but the rest of the movie stagnated. I have to wonder if old Chuck can no longer hang with the best. Has he so slowed down that he has to drop this kind of waste and hope that his reputation will carry him through the entire film? Chuck is a terrible fighter, and as we have seen from Valker, Tekas Ranger, a pretty good actor, but the trick is that both of these qualities are combined in his films, and this one does not. Very disappointing for us fans Norris. Chuck, stay the main character in your movies, because this does not work for you ... Gary
