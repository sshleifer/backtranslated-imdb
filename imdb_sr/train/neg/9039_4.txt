Noble effort, I suppose, but in the end poor. Before I saw this film, I felt that "Bartleby, The Scrivener" was incalculable. After I see him, I am still. Unfortunately, I think only those who read the story will understand what is going on, and they will be upset about the unnecessary revision of the film (update from 1850 to 1970, moving from New York to London). Even the talented talents of Paul Scofield can not save what seems to me a good meaning, but the wrong attempt to record Melville's metaphysical classics.
