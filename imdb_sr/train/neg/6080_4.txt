"Maladolescenza" has air of dark fairy tales, with its protagonists of the child, forest surroundings and the discovery of ruins of the castle. However, in essence, the film is essentially an unusual psycho-sexual study of adolescents. Opening in the order of dreams using a not so subtle metaphor Fabrizia struggling with his dangerous hunt, the film describes his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who promised her love for him, and his possible romance with the equally evil Sylvia. The psychological complexity of the film gives the film merit, but there is no doubt as to how much the film is unnecessarily explosive in the nudity and sex. The film looks more reliant on its beautiful location than on a special cinematic skill, and there is no doubt that the film is the biggest advantage of a creepy, childish choral sound spot. With its strange, sophisticated quality, the film is at best interesting, but fading next to Louise Malle's surreal and brilliant "black moon" from the same era. Certainly he deserves a debate on art and pornography, because unlike many forbidden films, for example, Pasolini's "Salo" or "Ken Park" Larry Clark, the film is quite unobtrusive from an artistic perspective. It seems that cinema gradually loses the ability of shock, so maybe the "Maladolescenzi" should admire because it has retained that power thirty years after its release. However, shock is the only reason the film is unforgettable. The film has its defenders. Still, this also applies to Nazism.
