Wow, I hated this movie. The subject should lead to a really fine movie, and the main actor was definitely sensitive enough and talented to deal with this topic, but the scenario - if there was even - was a script - a mess. This is a smaller movie than a random slide show that's not going anywhere. I would say that it is not going anywhere fast, except that it is actually the longest 81 minutes you will ever be sitting on. As I have already said, the main actor is good. So is Faruza Baulk (SP?), As his sometimes rough, but ultimately, the mum which accepts love. There are many things for filmmakers to answer, because this is a mess. It's a real shame, because I really wanted to love this movie, but it's essentially an out-out of a movie that has never been made. Skip this - it was not even worth $ 6 that I fired for pai-per-viev.
