The big concept was wrong. Poor acting, even worse writing ... After watching the first two episodes, I wondered why she had ever reached the second season. The characters are forgetful, writing is bad, the sets are fine. Special effects are simply sad - much better is done in the same time frame - where does this money move? The first episode starts interesting, and then goes fast downhill - the regulation of the whole show is silly. Now do not misunderstand me, I'm a great Sci-fi fan and a 'geek' - but this show is simply not cut. As I said at the beginning, I'm really surprised that he has reached the second season - much better was canceled after just one season (for example, Jake 2.0). This performance was only bad.
