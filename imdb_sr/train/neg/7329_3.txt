After watching this movie, I felt the need to turn away a little of my frustration. Selma Blair is a phenomenal, currently understated actress, and Mak Beeslei was pretty charming in the movie "Kill Me Later". The story, although not really original, certainly showed some promise. None of this mattered ... at all. I do not know what her job is, but the director Dana Lustig practically has no talent as a director. It slowed down the recordings, accelerated the recordings, turned the recordings, used the unpleasant corners of the camera, used unfavorable color filters, made zillion quick cuts, jumped back and forth over the timeline, and went through all with the disgusting "modern" soundtrack of the bushy garbage. I can not remember when I last saw such an incompetent job of directing a movie. Her ego must be enormous to throw out the acting and storyline and put her direction in front and center for audience members to pay attention to. In their throats it is pricked. There are several good scenes in the movie "Kill Me Later" which show what could and should be. Unfortunately, just when things started to promise, Mrs. Lustig would go back to her bag of movie school tricks and mix things together. Too bad that Blair and Beesley had good chemistry and you could say that the film really had a good heart. 3/10
