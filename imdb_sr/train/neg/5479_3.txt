I bet none of you knew that the famous Conquistador Hernando Cortes made a preliminary expedition to Mexico before he took over the Aztecs. It is good that he did so because he would never know of those T Rivers who inhabited a certain valley where the locals worshiped them as gods. It was understandable. What was not there was the throwing of Blue Ian Ziering as Cortez. Even when blue hair became known at Beverly Hills 90210 colored in black, Ian looked positively funny. At least he did not try to make a Spanish accent. True Hero of Tiranosaurus Azteca, Marco Sanchez also late with a television series with a semi-repetitive role in Valker Tekas Ranger as detective Sandoval from Dallas PD. He finds true love with the princess of the Aztec and life would be perfect if it were not for those boring prehistoric beasts held by the natives. Tiranosaurus Azteca looks like they used some products from the famous series Sid & Marti Krofft Earth Lost. All that was needed was the appearance of a Slestak. If you are interested to find out about this expedition that has not completely made history books, be sure to check out Tiranosaurus Azteca. Then try to sit through it with a flat face.
