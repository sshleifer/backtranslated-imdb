It's hard to describe this - if you've been a fan of Russ Meier movies during the day, you'll certainly be pleased to see that Haji still looks very hot, although Forri Ackerman did not go so well (what he's still doing) If I go to him with him at all camera, will he be in my movie?). It was a fairly entertaining room - a superhero whose giant mammoths were its secret weapon - but sometimes it did not move all the way, and the jokes were on the level with the average comedy Joe E. Brovn (or Abbott). and Costello if that's your thing) - basically just a bad punishment. Still, I found this movie fascinating for watching, and for more than two reasons. Good work, but still fundamentally poor production.
