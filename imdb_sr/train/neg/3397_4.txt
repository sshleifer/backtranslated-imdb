The trailer of this movie was enough for me to release a DVD. However, the film that was created is absolutely awesome! However, this is not the worst movie ever made, or the worst movie this year, but it got to the devil! The main question is that the movie does not know what it wants to be: comedy, drama for adults, thriller, teen porn? The story is interesting, because it deals with the traps of brides mailed, but the film is messy. What starts out as a mildly interesting "comedy" (the word I use in the weakest possible terms) then goes completely in the reverse direction and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynist thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin is lost! Like Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, I can only assume that they did it for money. This is a bad movie in almost every aspect. It's not funny, it's almost sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are simply disgusting. A movie to be avoided, unless you absolutely need to see Kidman or Chaplin in each of their films!
