"The Rainmaker" released in 1956 - has some of the best actors of his time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster are the main players. Even they can not completely save that melodrama. First, Hepburn is terribly wrong as a shy young woman - despite her luster as an actress, even she can not do this. She is too strong to be credible as so stupid, and she was too old for that role. Lancaster acts extreme, and Earl Holliman is too much ham and is more like Jethro Clampett. It seems that only bridges and always reliable Vendell Corei raise a little above your head - but even they can do a lot. It seems that the age of 50 was the time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings as an actress, and that's fine. She just made a bad choice. Luckily for her fans (which I am among them) did not rule them too much. Despite the A-list and good production values, it does not work.
