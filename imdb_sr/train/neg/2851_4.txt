There are often couples (in general terms) - in Huston's films: "African Queen" "Heaven knows Allison" "the roots of the sky" "Misfits" ... "Varvarin and geisha" (Check the title) is another good example, to say so. It seems that the Japanese thing at that time was trendy, because such works as "Saionar" "Suzie Vong World" and "Tea Party in August" testify. Huston's efforts could be the worst of this rather bad party (with the exception of "Susie" maybe). John Vaine fits perfectly into Ford's world, in Huston as a bull in a porcelain store. dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the film from absolute boredom. Only those who are completely in love with Huston's every work have to choose this, among all his great films.
