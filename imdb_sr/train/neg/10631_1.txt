Earth views claimed to be fictitious by NASA in this film have recently been compared to historical weather data for Apollo 11, and show good coincidence between cloud patterns in video sequences and real precipitation per day. It seems that this undermines the whole argument from the film that the image of "the whole Earth" is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft windows. I'm expecting that Bart Sibrel now claims that NASA has faked historical weather data, but that would undoubtedly include them in the replacement of each archived copy of the newspaper with a time map, and those of private ownership is still a problem. Ah, the answer: "Attempting to discredit this film by referring to NASA's weather forecasts that I say is a charming but weak and gullible argument. What about the rest? A wise man once said something about sowing mosquitoes and swallowing a camel. Do you in any way feel that this could apply to what you are trying to do here? :-) This film is packed with unmistakable evidence against the US government's claim that the missions on the Moon were successful and that now man is the master of the universe. Things are almost never quite what they look like .. Just watch the movie, and I'm glad you'll see things differently than before. First, the weather data does not come from NASA. Second, the weather data undermines the big claim in the movie, and third, far from being "full of indestructible evidence", the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly exposed. The earlier secret movie, and he edited it and added his own interpretation, unfortunately for him, his original film is a public domain, and the parts that he Sibrel betrayed him in contradiction with his claims.
