This is not a terrible comedy, but it's very DULL. She barely laughed and spent her luxurious production values. There is a moment near the end, when Fu Manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his "enemy" and says, "You were a worthy opponent, and now we can start over." This scene, however, along with the fun humor Burt Kvouka at the beginning, are the only memorable parts of the film. (* 1/2)
