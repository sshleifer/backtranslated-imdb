This was a terrible loss of my time. No plot. The acting was far below the vapor, it should be used as an example in the acting classes about what NOT to do. It's just a commercial discovery of an earlier Universal soldier, who also scratches the bottom of the boat. It is sad that the VD needs to confirm its ego every few years, and it is even more sad that people will pay good money to sit it. This type of scurvy gives martial arts films a bad name. For comparison, makes Segalla, Norris and Arnold almost talented. Perhaps VD should take the trail of Leslie Nielson and make the transmitter of his genre. At least then, we could laugh with him instead of him.
