This film is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a Catholic school, watching the RAVANDAN genocide break around him. The film begins with a brief explanation of the past history and rivalry of Ravanda. Then jumps to the story, told through the eyes of the young idealist "NEV-COMER", a young teacher who does not take life or the situation too seriously. While he and the driver approach the blockade on the road, he plays with his drivers I.D. not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if a driver can not be identified as a member of a real tribe to soldiers, they will be killed. And in this way he treats the story of chaos and unraveling around him. Suddenly he realizes that every Ravandan (including his driver) is involved and that European soldiers and tourists can not and will not help. Media cameras can not stop machetes, and there are too many mats used by cops. the title comes from the captain of the army, saying he would shoot at dogs who eat dead bodies around his complex, but they will not shoot people in the police who kill people around the complex. Mostly because they were not shooting at soldiers yet. In the end, he understands the hopelessness of the situation, and the guy telling the evacuation team that he wants to give up his place for one of the victims, and flee with a tail between his legs, and he does not face immanent death with schoolchildren. He promised not to leave behind. It is more of a character study, and came the moment of Jesus for one character, but the story of genocide in "RAVANDA". This film did not have to be held in RAVANDI, it could have happened any of the genocidal hellish holes at this time at any time.
