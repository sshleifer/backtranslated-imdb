This film had what sounded like a good premise: nine people were confronted with their fears that they would win a million dollars. Unfortunately, it was not a good movie. There are several scenes that are too long and really meaningless like a dance scene. A few scenes are just an excuse to focus the camera on the female parts of the body. The acting is bad, but some of the lines are fun in their horror. It's really strange that at the end of the film it turns into a five-minute western, and finally, the contours, which were few, make no sense with the rest of the film. It seemed as though the director had added something to himself because he thought he would look cool, while neglecting the film's plot until that moment. It simply did not make much sense. The only creepy thing was when old people danced down the hall, but it did not even come close to compensating for the rest of this confusion.
