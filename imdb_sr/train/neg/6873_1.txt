TV production at the beginning of 2000 was between bad and bad. Before tags such as Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives or Monk, TV had not yet had the right shot, which could have attracted the attention and interests of viewers from the 2000s. Titles like Relic Hunter, Mutant Ks, The Lost Vorld, Sheena, or even Baivatch Havaii were not encouraging to watch and follow, or at least have not been such a wonderful and interesting time before them. (Special Unit 2) was no exception. In fact, men in black agree with uploading KS files! (As if they were a special unit 1). But even with this great formula; did not work well. It was promising; at that time there was a saturation of "supernatural" cases after a decade of most Ks files, so that the natural spirit went to her in vain (imagine Mulder as a female!). However (the special unit 2) was not the strongest in this, or strong when it comes to comical Sci-Fi broadcasts. It was very funny, where, for example, every sexy situation must be turned into ugly disgusting. He was horribly enjoying a bad taste. (Michael Landes) was non-charismatic and generally unbearable as a comedian. His chemistry with (Alecondra Lee), as well as every alleged sexual attention, was all weak. Of course, the show got a funny look, but all in all, it was an awkward job. It was clear that there was nothing more interesting than his main idea. Among other works (Evan Katz) as co-writer and co-producer like (Seven days) before or (24) later this must be a low point! Despite the distinctive personality, she was a stupid joke for most of the time. So if that was the goal, then they really made one of the funniest! And indeed, it would be one of the hardest times to be thankful for canceling the show after just 19 episodes!
