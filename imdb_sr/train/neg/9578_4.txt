Can A-Pic ever do anything good? This film was to be seen on television in a mailbox format. Since A-Pik does not even believe in pan and scan, we see the whole scene where the shoulders on the left side of the screen speak to the shoulder on the right. Of course, you do not miss much. This film is incredibly bad. It's very hard to enjoy a movie where characters scream at the top of the lungs for 80% of the movie for no reason.
