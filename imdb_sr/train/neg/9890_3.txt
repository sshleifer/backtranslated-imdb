Another rape of history <br /> This film is a catastrophe; just uses the historical story and makes a sweet love story, with poor acting and low production of the budget. The film should be 1/3 of the time, just pulled the time to make a mini series. The battle scenes are so stupid and illogical, the soldiers are stupid, the costumes of the catastrophe. The Romans were good at fighting outdoors, one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans when they tried to fight in the woods, in this film the Romans choose to fight on the side of the city, I mean to get the real one. Cleopatra was made of Macedonian origin, which means that the person is light skin.
