I did not expect much from this film, but brother, what a stinker. I found this jewel in the giant pocket of the terrible $ 5 DVD in Valmart (where else)? As inexpensive as this disc, I feel it is staged. Special effects had a look for high school, cameras work was corrupted by three-legged tripods and sketched lighting, and the acting was the perfect example of a "Christian school". It is possible to imagine the long and exhausting 'prayer meetings' of the production house after the haste returned - the people who were managing these things must have serious anti-biblical feelings towards the ineffective production company that did it. Think about their anxiety as they saw their $ 914.86 investment in smoke. Someone asked why Christian movies are so bad - maybe Xian filmmakers should watch good movies and try to copy some of the things that make them so good. Confident stories and characters, less hysterical hand-waving and fanaticism, oh, and a story that calls for everything - not just the true believers. So. Stop the preaching, save it for the church. Take, for example, a series of Omen or Prophecy. Excellent movies with tempting stories, great cinema and intense music. No hysterical swinging with hands. Without preaching. If this film had a laugh, it would be much better.
