I would enjoy this film, but Van Damme is just doing the same old same old rubbish. Poo pants fight for scenes as usual. The only thing that this loser omitted is that the Russians were eventually killed in the end. This movie is the ultimate doggy to do the most naturally, please, please, please, Van Damme, you will get some lessons from acting, you need them. Anyone who loves Van Damme has problems. It seems sad that the only way Van Damme ever gets any acting is when he co-operates with a movie, who produces a movie and is doing a movie for the film. REMOVE OUT LENGTHS AND ITS PICTURES OF AN EMERGENCY. I gave this film two out of ten, because the one with sandman was better. To add insult to injury, I spent on this fertilizer
