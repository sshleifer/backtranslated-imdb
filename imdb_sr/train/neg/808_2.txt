An extremely disappointing film based on James Michener's novel. What was even worse was the performance of Marlon Brand. His southern line was ridiculous. I found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady who came home to the shelter. Brando, so exciting in previous films, was laughed at. Tyrone Sila, in the "Prosecution Witness", was supposed to be nominated for the best actor instead of Banda here. and Japanese. Brando was a stone in the whole film. His movement from anti-ties to a professional happens when he finds love with an Asian woman. His emotions and conversations made it difficult for him to see how he could accept such new views. Only Lord knows why Red Buttons and Miioshi Umeki received Oscare for their performances. Nothing was impressive either. Umeki's appearance on the screen was short and without much to be seen from her side. A better performance in this film was done by Miiko Taka, who was as good as Brand's love interest. She showed a great emotion as an anti-American woman who found love with Brand's character. Her face was carved into an accident she suffered because of the loss of her father and brother in the 11th World War. She realized that her dance was not an exit from that existence to live. Martha Scott went from Hebrew mother Iochobel to "The Ten Commandments", which was first interested in the mother's love of Brand. Her performance along with Ricardo Montalbano was futile. Patricia Ovens, as Brand's first love, showed the depth and conviction in her performance.
