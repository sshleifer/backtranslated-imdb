Hey HULU.com plays Elvira late at night with a horror show on their site and this movie is their under the name Monsteroid, a good party to watch Elvira comment on this Crappi movie .... Have fun with bad movies. After all, this film really has a very small value, except to see how bad the 70s were for bad flicks Bad Effects, Bad Dialog, only bad movie recording. Avoid this if you do not want to laugh at him. While at HULU, check out the other films that are now their, there are 10 episodes, and some are pretty decent movies with good times and production and you can watch them in 480p as long as you have a decent connection speed.
