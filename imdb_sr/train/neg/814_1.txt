This movie was simply bad. Almost every clich√© from the film of the police is present and explained. The bad guy escapes? check. Partner? check. A strange person is confronting a partner? check. Rookie with something to prove? check. The Rookie appeared in the gray veteran. check. The only one he did not touch was the idiot to get into the foot and to retreat, but I guess they're saving these old chestnuts for Dooley's next trip. Add to the battle poles with Girl Pover along with tired old scoops and banal material such as the Dooley's award-winning car that breaks down and you have a recipe for a really bad movie. Avoid this at any cost.
