THE RINGMASTER plays Jerry Springer as the host of the Jerry TV show, but it's not JERRY SPRINGER SHOV, his guests are garbage traps, but not the garbage you get at the JERRY SPRINGER show, attacking each other, but not like he ..... is the purpose of shooting a movie about JERRY SPRINGER and pretending it is not JERRY SPRINGER SHOV? And above all, this is a very boring movie
