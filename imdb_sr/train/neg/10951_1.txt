I have no idea what the idiots gave to this Palm D'Or film at Cannes Film Festival in 1999 because it was terrible! In fact, I looked at the whole thing simply because I could not believe that someone would make such a worthless film. There is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters are deprived of depth and there is no attempt to give any ambience with music or sound effects. Also, if you choose to spend 2 hours of your life watching this movie, be sure to enter something that you will draw because cinema is just someone who runs around with your handheld camcorder, and you can not view the main topics for half a minute. This style is much more successful in movies such as "Blair Vitch" because it creates uncertainty. In Rosetta there is no complication and uncertainty to which that style would borrow anything. I should have known better when it was at two o'clock in the morning that it would be terrible.
