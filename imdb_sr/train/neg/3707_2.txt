This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen (yes, it's even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and any movie starring Kevin Costner.) It did not even seem to be trying to act. Chris Rock is a wonderful stand-up comedian, but he just can not pass his talent to this movie, which probably only has two tense laughs in the picture. A film still, avoid it as a plague. Do something constructive and interesting, such as watching a time channel or watching a color on a dry wall. For Chris's efforts I give him 2/10! <br /> <br />
