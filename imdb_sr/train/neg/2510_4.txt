This television film tells the story of an extrovert Frannie who suddenly returns to Silk Hope to visit friends and family, but unconscious mother's death. Her sister runs a family house, but she intends to sell her and move her with her new husband. Franni strongly opposes this idea and promises to keep family heritage by getting a job and retaining responsibility. The handsome Ruben comes and the two of them are soon to fall in love (as you do), and from this moment I lost interest .... Farrah Favcett has more than just blue hair And, apparently, she can express the person extremely convincingly when she changed her mind. and this has certainly been proven here, as well as some of her previous efforts such as extreme and small sacrifices - an excellent performance by the legendary Charlie's angel. Silky hope is a kind of film that never shuts away from its cheap and cheerful TV footage, and you know there was a budget limit, but it's not the worst movie ever made. Positive aspects exist; you just have to find them.
