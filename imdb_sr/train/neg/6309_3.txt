This film had good intentions and a good story to work. The director and screenwriter of this film has collapsed and created a boring, boring movie lane that made me feel like I was back in the class of the 8th grade of social sciences. will anyone take this story and make a real movie - the story deserves it. Every time the scene had the potential, all we had left was a few clich√©s, combined with black and white shots that were probably given by The Histori Channel to show action. Shame. Ossie Davis was the only strong light in this boring festival. The other act was incredibly boring - it fit into the movie and everyone played captain set a new low standard for delivering the line. The film is not worried about enjoying or having fun, but they want to learn about USS Mason, it's worth watching.
