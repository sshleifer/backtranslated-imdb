First viewed 6/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Valter Lang): A disappointing musical from the point of view of the character's development, in my opinion, of this much fascinating part of Rogers and Hammerstein. He has a couple of good songs and a decent comic portrait, sometimes, King Siam, by Iul Brinner - but the film does not really do a good presentation of the situation and settings. I can only blame the script and maybe some of the acting because we do not fully understand the character and their situation. I know it would be a bit too much for music meant for enjoying songs and dancing, but even this part did not differ much from me. The basic story is about the English coming to Siam to teach children about top European issues. Later we find out that the king is actually the greatest student. There is a forbidden romance between the latest king's wife, played by Rita Moreno (Latin as the Arabian - Come on!) And a former lover who causes some complications, but nothing really is hypnotized. Deborah Kerr, as the main female character Annie - is fine, but not convincing. The king learns some things about her presence and then the film disappears like him. This is a really small story with some songs and dancing, but not so much experience for the viewer.
