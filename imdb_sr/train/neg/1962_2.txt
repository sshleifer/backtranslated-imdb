The only terrible thing about this movie is the idea that the one who made it could make a sequel. From the beginning to the end, "The Tooth Fairi" was very terrible. It looked like a bad childish movie that was confused, with the "Wizard of Oz" that melts and ends up with happy boys in combination with some bad effects up and cursing. except that it's convenient to be there to be killed in some way. Sisters of the two Cherise brothers, aura readers and Mrs. McDonald, make no sense in the film - they could include them in the main story for some interesting stories, but apparently they should not worry. People who watch the movie know that the characters are there because of some bloody scene of death, but come, at least try and have a little conspiracy for them. The story is generally poor with the strange behavior of the characters that you want them to eat all over the witch. Add a weak plot and bad that act together (children are especially wooden) and the film ends with complete failure. If only MST3K could refer to this ...
