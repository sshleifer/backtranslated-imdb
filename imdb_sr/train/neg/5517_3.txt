I regard this film as only 3 out of pity because it is trying to pay off. I like to praise a great movie and do not pay attention to "male" movies. Legal blonde was a great movie. The Georgian rule, on the other hand, was an unorganized, weak, poorly written, unrealistic example of filming the films in the worst case. To the end of the film I did not care who was lying or something was resolved. The most important thing in the movie is a good story. This story is weak and never evolves (just because the subject is deep does not mean that the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one who experiences a major change in character, and is prepared for that change during the film. As a rule of Georgia, the change of character was sudden and undeveloped. Second, there were too many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters. Withdrawing a really good dynamic character is a difficult job and it takes time (you only have a few hours in the movie). This means that too many attempts by dynamic characters will get too little attention on their own personal change. Even if I ignore the badly written story, and the litter of bad dynamic characters, I can not even say that I liked it. Every character was a mess. It's okay if you write American beauty, but not when you're trying a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a terrible mother, her daughter was a terrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being (I will not cut her off from any silence because she was abused, the bullshit happens to everyone and we are all responsible for our actions). "Dudlei Do Right" The Mormon child should have the courage to compromise his religion and obligations ... and Simon, I seriously think, what kind of type allows a 17-year-old girl who is abused just to stay on occasion (unless she is an actor or a politician). This movie is worth watching if you want to remember what is not good filming!
