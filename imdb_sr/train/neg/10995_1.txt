Anyone who watched the Comedi Central around midnight in the past few years, has probably seen ads for this film. I first saw commercials for this film in 2001. It seemed like it might be fun, but I did not want to call the number on the television screen and order it without watching a movie. I thought I would wait for the film to be available for rent in Blockbuster. About a year and a half later, I was in Tover Records and on "DVDS for less than 20" a bunch of copies of this movie. Seeing that the DVD was only $ 6.99, I decided to buy it. I came home, put the disc in a DVD player and waited for the laugh to start ... and I was still waiting. Laughter never appeared. I would have to agree with almost every other comment on this site when I say this film was horrible. Sick, desperately distasteful, poorly written and directed, THE UNDERGROUND FILM is an awesome piece of garbage and in my opinion is the worst film of all time. No star.
