This film was so unbearably bad that I could not believe I was watching it. Directing, editing, production and screenplay seemed to have been done by high school students who do not know all about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sense. The great emotional moments and peaks (such as early in Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (as hinted at the beginning) come completely out of place and are not set as if they were in a more elegant and effectively made movie. Unfortunately, the characters are underdeveloped, which makes it difficult for us to connect with them. Surprisingly, acting is not quite bad, but horrible writing abolishes relatively convincing performances. The film plays a particularly bad TV / Western / epic and unfortunately diminishes the fascinating (true) story he is trying to tell. I read a lot of reviews that defend the film as important to Australians for the topic. That's all very good, but only because Ned Kelli is an important Australian historical icon DO NOT GOOD. Nobody says that the topic is not good, but only the quality of the film. Pearl Harbor was a very important historical event for Americans, but that does not mean that I will defend the film and say it was good because it is still bad. Failure everywhere, although Heath and Orlando are great for watching.
