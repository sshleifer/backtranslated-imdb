This film is another great example of what Jerry Bruckheimer, about 1997, best suited for the movie one year before the release and does not come through a quality movie. I'm not a film critic, but this film was as predictable as they were. Every attempt at a joke, every attempt at a touching moment, and a poor attempt at a love story, was exactly what I predicted in my head. Do yourself a favor and save money on this.
