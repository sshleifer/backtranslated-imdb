I've read a few good reviews on this board for "Mr Scarface," but for anyone who is not referred to as a genre of Italian gangster films like me, the picture is likely to make little sense. Indeed, after the initial setup, involving a fraud of 10 million lire, the image turned into a rather routine vengeful swing with a slight twist in the identity of Rick's (Al Cliver) character. The whole story of a war gang for me was blurred by the inclusion of Vinchenco Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but as most other viewers commented, he was the only one who gave this life any kind of life with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I discovered that it was kind of incredible that the Manchari pigeons running for Tony through the streets did not really attack before Tony even put them on hand. For his entire construction as the title character, Jack Palance was rather drastically lost in the anti-climax near the finale, making the American working title "Mr. Scarface" quite slow. I saw enough spaghetti westerns to know that they do not do everything; I guess in this case my first look at the spaghetti gangster flick did not work.
