Avvv .... yes, it's heartbreaking and all that an unhappy family gets adopted by ABC / Sears and their home is "renovated". It ends humanistic attraction. I liked it early in my race, but now this show has become grossly exaggerated. Ten poor families could get relatively luxurious homes with lots of good things for each family in which each episode of this performance lends itself. People in the Habitat For Humanity must shake their heads in disbelief. For example, is a healthy sixteen-year-old boy needing a jacuzzi in his bedroom, or that his bed is cheated with the Lov Rider hydraulics? Is Mom really in need of its ruin, immobile and rusting an old truck that has been restored and "pimped" by some of the best adapters in California? The new job would have done quite nicely, and probably for a third of the price. Do people really need a plasma screen of sixty-five inches in every room in the house? And there is a question of who pays increased taxes on property and utility bills. Even after leaving the denial of "Makeover", someone still earns a living. I doubt that kind people in the social service will look at humor in all this greatness. This show is nothing more than a catcher for ABC, and a tacit ad for its sponsors.
