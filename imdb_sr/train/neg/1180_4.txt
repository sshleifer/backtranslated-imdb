Ignored for more than a quarter of a century (and often forbidden), his darkness is the biggest advantage. Hey, it's often better to talk about it, but actually see when you can not support the "legend" with the content. The film has recently been played in Los Angeles, and is available on home video, so that the veil slowly rises. Although there are still many to offend the masses, it is more likely that they will give birth to them, than to cause a lot of real passion. In addition to the free and long-lasting KSKSKS sex scene between the pair of horses ("Nature Documentaries" of anyone?), There follows almost an hour of boring agreed melodramas of marriage. Once sex and nakedness begins, it's a continuous sequence that involves masturbation, an incredible return to the alleged 'beauty and encounter' of the beast, and a naked woman running around the house (no one, even her supposedly protective aunt , it seems to even think of putting some clothes on her!). On the video, I guess you can accelerate through banality, but that's not really worth the effort. The nakedness does not go beyond what is seen in something much more substantial, such as Bertolucci - DREAMERS. Try to find some 'moral' or 'symbolism' in the body, I doubt it was worth any effort. Unfortunately, for LA BETE, now that you can easily see the movie, the reputation of something that was once 'forbidden' was abolished. And this beast is tamed.
