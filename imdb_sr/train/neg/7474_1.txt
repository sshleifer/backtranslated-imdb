This program did not do this for me, although I'm a fan of the genre. The main factor that disappointed me was that there are no scenes in which the main character is dominated. This made it a little two-dimensional and gave up itself before the program was completed. I hoped that I would leave my criticism there because I am not a film critic, however, the guidelines on IMDb state that you need to put 10 rows of comments. That reminded me of Hades Hoke in the way he is the main character in every scene, and I hope that the writers of this program might be able to hire more diversities to engage with viewers. I do not doubt the talent of any actor and team, just after watching things like "wire", I came to expect great things from the drama of the police.
