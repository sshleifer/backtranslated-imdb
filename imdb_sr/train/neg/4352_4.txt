If you see Friends, writing will be very familiar. Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of Friends often share the same comedy settings. The issue is about a group of people whose relationship is that they shared the same class when they were still quite young (about 10 years). years). Now they are in the middle of the twenties and they meet again at a gathering. This is where the series begins. Typical episode refers to multiple stories at once. Usually they are not connected in any way. Each story line is cropped into several sections, which are then shown in the mixed order. Sketches are a place where my problems lie in this series. As in the later years of Friends, it is often a rather stupid environment with situations that are hard to believe. One of the main characters makes something really stupid that is hard to believe. The situation is overly exaggerated, as if it was not stupid enough. If you are dealing with this type of humor, you may want this series. It's a great turn-off for me. The reason I started to watch Friends is due to the first few seasons. There are interesting and especially credible stories, with some romances that make you roots for characters. Class does not have any of this. The characters are simply too forced and stereotypes are overly suppressed. It is therefore impossible to treat them and to like them. At least with friends, it took several seasons before it was left without money and all of the characteristic features of the dairy. But in class, it seems that she was left without money before she started.
