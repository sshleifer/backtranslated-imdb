At the opening stage of "Malta Story". A. Guinness had such a striking resemblance to Noel Covard that I fully expected his first words to be "certain women should strike regularly - like gong" or some such world - tired bon mot. his dialogue is barely an immortal prose, and even the Teacher would have trouble resurrecting him. In fact, Mr. Guinness walks through the image as if looking for a focal point and fails to find it. And here lies the fatal weakness of the entire film. Mr. J. Hawkins also gives up and ultimately gives "Jack Havkins" a performance with no ounces of individuality. He could have been connected to any of a dozen British war films. Their puppies very little purpose. Luftwaffe failed to bomb Malta in the same way as she failed to bring London to her knees. The courage of the Maltese people in the light of the perpetual danger was recognized by the King and the island was given to George Cross. a decent topic you could imagine for a movie, but "Malta Story" does not even qualify for the term "decent" in its most persistent sense. It gives the appearance of hurrying to meet the deadline, perhaps before the actors lose their will for life.
