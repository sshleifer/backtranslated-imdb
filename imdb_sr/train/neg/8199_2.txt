I'm so oh sooo glad I did not spend the money to go to the cinema :-). It's nothing more than a compilation of the elements of several other classic titles such as The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abiss, etc., framed by a rather boring and absurd scenario. I really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie - it has absolutely nothing new in its story, which is further meaningless. Moreover, there is nothing to look at - FXs seem to be taken from a second-hand shop, you've seen them all in other films. But it's definitely a good lullaby.
