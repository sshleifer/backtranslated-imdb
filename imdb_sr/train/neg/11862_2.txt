This film probably had something for something; My confusion is how these extreme prozaic optional subjects continue to be in theaters, as if ideas are recycled only because they are generations. Indeed, the criminals behind most of the films are like dogs, returning to swallow their own vomit. Well, now $ 19 are richer for me. This was not at all fanciful, it was the moment of redemption, anything fun was shown in the trailer (and anything fun was not in the trailer) performances were strained (especially Mollin, inconclusive). What was theoretically supposed to be a comic relief was a homoerotic friend with a dislike for Disney movies; none of his analogies fell home, his small moral speeches were flat, I literally waited for him to continue to say something meaningful, only to find out he had done it. The so-called "hard 10" is the most delicate plastic creatures that exist (except for having a horse-like face with a strange smile); I honestly found that her friend Patti (which is called Hamburglar) looked much better than her. But again, gentlemen prefer brunettes;) Well, in any case, the whole premise is that society is superficial and if love is true, it goes beyond all social fa√ßades; as they showed the guy who shaved one's scrotum and routine premature ejaculation which was a million times mutilated and beaten to death - with obvious allusions to the American pie and happiness - the latter in ghastly denouement scene family dog). I feel like the movie is like I agree with funny jokes in a raw poor bowl of raw wastewater. It's going to show that marketing can push anything there, revenge any fetal mass and call it gold, people will come (they worked for me). Almost with a twist.
