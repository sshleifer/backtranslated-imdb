Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) becomes a lively babysitter for young Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole) who recently lost her mother. But Rosalie misses her dead mother a lot and is constantly visiting her grave (perfectly placed at the graveyard right behind the house) late in the evening ... where she and her "friends" meet ... Good starts with a really spooky order at the cemetery ... and then it breaks down. The story is slim and has a TON footprint to make the movie 85 minutes. The acting is terrible across the board (Cole is easy to be the worst). He is poorly referred to with some of the Largest changes I've ever seen in a movie. Scenes (and sound) are just cut off without rhyme or reason. The film also has a terrible (and obvious) post-production sound. As for blood and violence - forget! There is very little and what seems incredibly false. I never saw such fake blood - it looks like a ketchup! Bored, meaningless - with a truly forgotten drive-in movie. You can skip this one.
