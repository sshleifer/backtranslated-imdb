I suppose that the young people who took part in the film "The Necromancer" (called "The Vitching", plus a bunch of other titles) had to feel a little strange to film a horror movie with a man who: participated with John Houseman in the production of proletarian drama ("Cradle Vill Rock"); he scared people to think that aliens were attacking ("War of the Worlds"); and directed and acted in the greatest movie of all time ("Citizen Kane"). And now Orson Velles plays in a three-step film about the Satanic cult. Basically, in this film there is nothing creative. A lot of nudity, but music in the background always shows that it is really confusing. Even if the film was not particularly predictable, it is still not worth a look. How Velles sank. Fortunately, during the last thirteen years of his life, he has translated the documentary "Bugs Bunni Superstar" (about the Varner Bros. cartoons from the 1940s) and hosted the documentary "The Man Who Watched Tomorrow" (about Nostradamus). I recommend these two, but not this one. Just avoid him. Also featured are Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean.
