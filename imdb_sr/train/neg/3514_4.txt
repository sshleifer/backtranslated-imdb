Philip. K. Dickian movie. And decent for it. Better than Paicheck (Voo) and that horror is called Minoriti Report (Spielberg). But to face this, turning and ending the expansion was too much for me. Halfway through the film I have already begun to fear such an end, and unfortunately, I was right. But that does not mean that the film is not worth the time. Not at all. The first half (as many commented here) is great. There are some parts in which you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey a message that the presentation is a very important thing in the future (we will do such things on banal matters, because I CAN) or it's simply through a combination. But paranoia is there and it feels "out of common." Good.
