Search the channel and captured the LOGO. It was one of those "I have to watch this because it's so terribly bad" moments, like Roadhouse without joy. Writing is terrible; It's totally pointless and the acting is throwing-up-in-your-mouths bad. There is a low budget, and there is a sink in which this epic should be thrown away and never see again. I mean, the main characters go to a ski hut in a rented house, and the house is, well, ordinary, which is nothing terrible, but they choose to show all the guests overflowing over it like the Sistine Chapel. I'm sorry, but I'm looking at 6 guys looking at every boring room of 10'x10 with a futon in it and a pinching lapel. I guess they did not find out anything from Bad Nevs Bears in Breaking Training (see the scene for checking hotel rooms) ... vov a toilet !!! iaaiiiii !!!! I do not buy everything on top so everything goes routinely. If it smells like ... and it looks like ... well, you know the rest. Avoid plague. Edit: obviously other more transparent viewers I believe that, since I do not like this film, I am an "obvious hatred" who can only assume I'm fancy, which of course is not true. I decided to do this strange, crazy thing and judge a movie based on the actual content of the film, not just its presence (ie Refreshing to see ...) Of course, it can be refreshing to see, but It does not equate to a big movie, just give them better material for work and a firmer direction. In fact, I applaud on effort. Frankly, I'd rather go to my catalog of Kitchens of Distinction than to look at this again.
