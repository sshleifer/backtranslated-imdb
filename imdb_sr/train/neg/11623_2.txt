From everything I read about the movie, I was excited to support a film with a Christian theme. Everything about the movie was very unprofessional. Special writing! Without the good writing of the film, there is no way. In one interview, the writer / director said that he did not want to leave as the title relates to the story. Believe me, it was not a big surprise. I waited for a teenage / young adult story to continue, but it never did. As someone who went through a divorce, I was very disappointed. This film would not be pleasant to me when I first went through emotional anxiety that a divorce can bring to your life as a Christian!
