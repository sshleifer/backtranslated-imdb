Oh, God, what a horrible movie. Production was so cheap and unpleasant ... Remember the video from "Natural", where the lightning strikes in the wood (leaving a great stump) that Roi Hobbs makes a bat of ?? So the producers of this film used the same scene to prefix the scene where the tree branch was hit in the house. I wonder if they paid to use the footage from The Natural, or were they just hoping that no one to watch a movie would pick it up? Then in the end where they were trying to get out in the truck. Such excessive activity in the cabin. Really bad movie, really bad movie.
