An incredible book about a fox and his family doing what foxes do. that it was farm theft and killing prey. until the throne farmers decide not to have enough of these cuffs and try in different ways to solve the problem. Of course, they are "poured out" at every step and while the trio is camping on the fox, the family raids into three agricultural lands. the film is very loose, it's more than the terrible patches of American filming about robberies, especially ocean films. They even have George Clooney as a gentleman to add insults and succeed in completely missing the sense of the story. That's what they think. They will make a lot of money and destroy another classic book for children Roald Dale.
