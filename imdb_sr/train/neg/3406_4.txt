The space camp, which had unlucky luck to plan during the accident at the Challenger, deserves that kind of luck. The "Stars" cause the casting of the acting, Lea Thomson is actually turning aside when she is asked more than the usual wide-open view of the innocent smile, possibly to hide her attempts. The film is sometimes ridiculous when it starts to ask too much of you. The little boy in his wardrobe holds a robot worth millions of dollars that breaks when he has too many orders from hordes of clicher dorms. This gnarled and indecent machine, "Jink", is the main player in the funny premise of the film, which looks like part of the short circuit, part of the 2001 airplane team. I will not bother you with it, enough to say that you can only laugh when you are faced with it. Saying all this, it's nice to watch, in SeaKuest, the Saved Bell way. Romance and technology, beware, are amazing from each other. Also, if you are eighty years old, this is impossible for the entertainment shows by Kate Capshav (Villie from Temple of Doom) and, obviously, Lea Thompson. Also, Joakuin Phoenik puts on a rotating turn as a kind of voyage to Goonie who fights with Jink. Do not get closer to this movie if you are not a fan of garbage.
