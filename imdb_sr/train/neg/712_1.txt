When I started watching this movie, I saw a guy from Buffy, Xander, and realized how wonderful he was still living in the movies. Now a strange movie that I can bear, given that it is a good dose of strange films, such as, for example, David Linch's films, two climaxes, a lost motorway, and so on. This one, however, made me laugh crazy sites about the conspiracy theory that made no sense. I mean people who are Nazis who have come to terms with America to make a wicked trinity of evil forces? I was surprised that they did not mention the hollow country in this film with Hitler's flying saucers and people from the lizard. Perhaps, if I had 60 grams of heroin with this movie, it made sense, but I seriously do not forgive drugs as I do not forgive this movie. It should be burned, chopped and forgotten, just so good Xander can get another acting thing. It was not his acting, it was fine, but the script simply did not make any sense. Sorry.
