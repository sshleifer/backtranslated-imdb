What possessed Gui Ritchie to process Vertmuller's film is incomprehensible. This new film is a mess. There was another person in the audience when I saw her, and she left for about an hour. (I hope she asked for a refund.) The only reason I remained until the end was because I never got out of the movie. and Ritchie could have thought they made a good movie. The dialogue is ridiculous, acting is terrible and the only beautiful thing in this movie is the landscape. Ritchie took Lin's film and turned it into another "Blue Lagoon". This is a movie that would not waste time watching the late evening at Cinemak. Time is too precious to spend on this shit.
