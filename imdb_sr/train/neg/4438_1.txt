I borrowed this movie from the library thinking it could be wonderful. How wrong I am! It's such a bad movie that I have to write something. Mira Sorvino is so bad in the movie, it's very painful to watch the scene with her. She is a beautiful girl, but she is not seductive in this film, but I will have to testify to her clumsy attempt to seduce almost all the other main characters. That's so funny. The dialogue of the film is so pretentious, and it lacks a funny fact which then makes it acceptable.
