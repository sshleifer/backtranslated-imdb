Based on the self-serving novel of a former friend and group F. Sheikh Graham, a writer of college, wrote this dirty story. Gregory Peck continues in a shameful excess like a violent alcoholic who is drunk or cursed; in contradiction with the mild and silent real Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on the Fitzgerald era of Hollywood writing, late in life, the respected author, in fact, lived a quiet life and effectively fought against alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well-known. Fitzgerald was not too proud to recycle his closing stories to support his wife (in the mental hospital) and his daughter (at college). Living in a small apartment and driving Chevrolet's Chevrolet car, his life was 180 degrees different than shown in this movie. practically every film directed by Henry King was the work of excellence. The loved Infidel was an exception.
