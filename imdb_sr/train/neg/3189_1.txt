I suppose this proves that Joe Don Baker will do everything for one dollar. The film concept was not very good to begin with. This movie has so many bad things that I do not know where to start. The acting is terrible. Cinema is at best marginal. Soundtrack was pretty bad. The result is terrible. There's a reason why this movie ended up at the Misteri Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote this and I can not believe that 9 people really thought this film was excellent. They must have loved two go-go dancers. The ultimate justice would be to lock this stink in the movie vault outside Vichita and never let anyone see her again! Score 1 out of 10 is far better than it deserves.
