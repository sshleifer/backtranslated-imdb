In Texas, seven friends meet at the bar to celebrate Halloween Night before going to a party. In the meantime, they call pirated radio for the American night sea for entertainment and recognize their deepest fears. A serial killer who listens to their confessions makes their nightmares true, killing each of them in a sadistic way. The "American Nightmare" is a weird low-budget film that has a terrible start: without any previous explanation, a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area, as if on Friday, May 13th. Then the story is transferred to the bar, where seven friends celebrate Halloween. From that moment on, the story has great potential, and the unknown actor has a very reasonable idea, showing some beautiful breasts and naked bodies, as well as usually in this type of production C. However, the end of the scenario does not give any explanation for the killer instinct and motives for the behavior of sister Jane Toppan, giving the feeling that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting. With a better start and conclusion, this strange story would be a good low-budget movie. My voice is four. Address (Brazil): "Agonia" ("Agony")
