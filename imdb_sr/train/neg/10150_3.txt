Humphrei Bogart obviously did not want to be in this film, and he was forced to play a part - a Mexican or would be suspended. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! Probably after Dodge Citi's success, Varners tried with Errol Flinn and his usual list of friends, such as Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boi) Villiams, Frank Mc Hugh and omnipresent John Litel, but made a big mistake trying to present Miriam Hopkins as an interest in Flinn v. Randolph Scott, and as a singer, really bad things, because she proved one thing, which is that she can not sing. The story was not so bad, but with God, obviously it was wrong, it turns out that it was a poor Wester who was long-lasting, and in a low budget, but honestly, the color would not help.
