This film shows the order of the drawings, which partly cross into one another. I realized that it was late in the movie, at first it only irritated me. Many episodes in this film come without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to get around this fact using absurdity and lack of competence. Trying to remain a comedy without funny bits fails. My personal and possibly subjective result after watching this movie (My God, it hurts in my head every time I call it a "movie"): A brave attempt to turn nothing into something big. But it did not work. At least the director did something out of nothing. But that's not good. Many films did not turn out so funny as they were planned, but this one is overwhelming. It is a real manifestation of the worst scenario of making a movie. Not. To correct myself is even worse than that. A film with gags that are so bad that they are not ridiculous at all. It's not even fun to watch that actor, writer and director (all three of the same type) in the midst of drowning in the sea of ​​bad films. The film is too bad for that.
