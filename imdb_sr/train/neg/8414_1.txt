Yes. I am pretty sure that I saw this film several years ago when it came to Supremes. Another recycled story has overshadowed the Hollywood style, borrowing scripts from movies to create better music. Nothing original. More makeup, costumes of glamor and choreography = more money for questionable "talented" Beionce drawing. If as a style of return, you should appreciate the real groups that fought (without digitized voices and the Hollywood Empire). Beionce's involvement makes this hypocrisy rubbish.
