I can not believe that in 34 of the previous comments, no one mentioned that this film is an obvious break from Born Iesterdai. The man was hired to bring a seemingly stupid blonde to the needs of a gangster. An employed pistol and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after. The gangster is left on the bed. But Born Iesterdai was an intelligent treatment, while that's just a lot. Technicolor download to DVD is unfortunate. Natalie Kalmus would have rolled over in her grave. See paperwork. Do you recognize him? But it's historically interesting to see the roots of Rock 'n Roll. It is also interesting that Evell's introduction to CinemaScope, a new format at the time.
