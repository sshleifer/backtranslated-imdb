"How it moves" is revived only when its high-energy, talented actors hit their heels and lash their things for the camera. Otherwise, this story of stagnant tendency-suffering and success is low on energy, low on originality and low on everything that a movie could be distinguished from dozens of other similar films that came before it. Rutina Wesley has a modest attraction as an academically gifted young man from the city who thinks that the best way to raise money for schooling in private schools is by entering the step-dance competition, but she and her fellow actors are poorly cared for screen writing and inappropriate routing. As mentioned earlier, the film achieves some spark when the performers are on stage, but such moments are too small and unfortunately short-lived.
