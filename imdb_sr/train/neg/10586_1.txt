This is a well-made informative film in the vein of PBS Frontline. The problem is that Frontline has already done this piece and managed to bring L. Paul Bremer to tell his side of the story. The worrying fact is that film director Charles Ferguson, a former think tank, was a warlord until the occupation went south. What did he think would happen? The Polish invasion went very well, until they were messed up by those boring Nazis. . Ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been better - as if any war could be better.
