This was a disappointing movie. It seems that people do not have any substance, the main protagonist Martin Cahil has zero redeemable values, in fact everyone in it, including Jon Voight, is making the waves. I would not recommend this film to anyone. Violence is tricky, although skillfully done. The recording is in black, at least the print corresponded to this category. Frustration.
