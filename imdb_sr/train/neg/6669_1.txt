I saw this movie in my class. I'm glad I did not pay to see him. I entered into her with an open mind and I was even a little excited. I really enjoy Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Vood, and the rest of the actors were interesting. I've never tied up with this movie. The acting was great, the cinema was interesting, but the story, or rather its lack, was a problem. There was no central, linking theme for the film. Was it a romance between Norton and Vood? Well, no, not really. Was it West? Somehow, but not. I'm all about movies, I recently saw "Brick" and I liked it, but the place that this movie went was too much. It was so weird, and that it was not necessary for me to go through the whole movie, I would go out. Writing was not terrible, but it was everywhere. At the time this film was finished, I remained terribly confused, and I wanted it to end before. It was just something about this film that did not sound, I understand more unconventional movies like "Fight Club", but I just did not care about the characters.
