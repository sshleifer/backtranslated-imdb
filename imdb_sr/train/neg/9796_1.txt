Well, seriously, I can not think of anything worse than the PR series. There are many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers has GOT to be at the bottom of this list. Can you remember something more than five to six teenagers (who do not even behave like normal teenagers) who dance around in identical suits WITH DIFFERENT FIGHTS, SO YOU CAN WRITE? Fans, did you ever come across the right person tossed on the mental wall and get up almost immediately and continue to fight without injury? The Powers Rangers are for five-year-old boys, and believe me, I've never liked this show even at five years. I assume you can say that Dino Thunder is an exception. Teens actually go as teenagers, and Tommy Oliver actually acts as a mentor, or not, a teacher. She has teenage humor, although the struggles are poor, I do not hate Dino Thunder. Many say that Powers Rangers are crap, but I would not. It would be an insult to shit. Face it, five-year-olds, Power Rangers is a garbage.
