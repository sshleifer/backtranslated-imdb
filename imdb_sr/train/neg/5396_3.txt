I read the comments that you should not watch this movie if you are looking for Shakespeare's dialogue. It is, unfortunately, the truth, because all the touchy dialogue, this beautiful drama, is cut out and replaced with songs. I read this play, and recently I was lucky enough to see it perform, it remains one of my favorite Shakespeare comedies, but this movie seems to take everything I like about it. The princess, though without a doubt doing what was sent, did not have a royal relationship, and all the girls seemed to have lost the cunning of their characters - who were also affected by unreasonable cuts, which not only deprived female characters but the scanty dialogue but took comments out of context - it was a little nervous to hear Princess pronounce; "We are wise girls to mock our lovers!", When it was not mistaken at all. The news disrupted the film throughout the film, and took many great scenes because they were displaying information in scenes behind them and were in modern phrasing. In conclusion, a great game, destroyed by an unusual concept, and unreasonable cuts. Kenneth, I usually love what you do. What did you think?
