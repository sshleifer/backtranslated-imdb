Wonderful, this is pretty pretty. I mean, that's bad. It's really bad. But while the original was so bad - it's - demolition - my life is bad, this is so bad - it's a little fun. Okay, that's bad enough. The values ​​of production are rotten throughout, the act is painful, and Romero-vannabe satire can not think of which side of the ecological barrier is mocking. Internal logic occupies the last position in relation to the heads being ejected from the refrigerator, the time of virus incubation fluctuating, as required by the 'plot', the bullets that run against the zombies or not, the zombies have the power of speech or not. The mountain is unresolved, obviously, but the frame is so slapdash that it is irritating. The dialogue sounds like it was translated by the same computers that handle the instructions for use, and the extent of the zombie infection is implied without the genius of Romer movies. All this was accentuated by the terrible sintering result. Absolute waste.
