I'll be short ... This film is embarrassing for everyone except for the cameraman. The very fact that this is a criticism of the sex tourism industry is valid until we are "treated" with a long dance scene. The action is ridiculous, no one except the hottest fan of bad horror will get anything out of it. And for God's love, please stop saying that this film is a story about lost innocence or even about women's empowerment, because it is quite obvious that it is not (a childish lesbian, what the hell?). This was by far the worst film at the Edinburgh Festival (which I've seen anyway), someone even crashed into half the film, probably because they could no longer take it. This may seem like an overly critical voice, but I really can not find the redeeming feature of this movie, except perhaps if you consider it a pure comedy. In short, this film is best viewed on a Class A drug cocktail.
