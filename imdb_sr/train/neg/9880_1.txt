I've seen this movie since the first theater release, in a reasonably empty theater. Believe it or not, after decades of watching movies, this one is still clearly held in my mind as the worst film of all time; or at least the worst that I would allow myself to watch. The act is far below the standard set by every random group of drunken high school students who have been pulled out of the street and forced to learn their lines for 5 minutes or less. After the first shock of the disbelief, we laughed for a while while each scene hit new falls. But after a while, even that suspicious pleasure disappeared and it had to be really sad.
