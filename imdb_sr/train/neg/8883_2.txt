Cliff Robertson as a masculine husband married to a wealthy woman brings a splendidly-dignified appearance here if he ever existed; it's as if director Michael Anderson kept shouting "drop it off; you think it's zombie, just less alive" through his little megalon while practicing Robertson's effort. The rest of the actors are barely better; Jennifer Agutter from the LOGAN'S RUN glory can barely be seen in what was supposed to be highlighted as a key role. If the quality of the acting is three times better; if some of the stronger holes are filled; and if the pacing got an adrenaline, then this star could have been raised to a standard acceptable to the audience of the Hallmark Lifetime TV channel. As it is, his rating is so unexplainably high that it can not be thought that chronic insomniacs use DOMINIC to catch a little time for aging. Perhaps in late night TV telemarketers there is a big chance that it is not shilling.
