Would anyone tell Sach to stick with what's good in basketball? This movie was not fun at stupid level. In this film, Shak plays a genius who lives in a boom-hole that it's not an original ghost in the boom hook instead of a lamp. He should help a little boy playing an equally boring francais cappra. This film had the worst story of the aquatic world, the acting was terrible and I think that anyone who loves this flair would be afraid to recognize it.
