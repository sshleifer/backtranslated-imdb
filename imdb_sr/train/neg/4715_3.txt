I recently watched the Johnny Test in an attempt to find humor in it. I did not succeed, terrible. Cartoon Network usually tends to make its shows more enjoyable to all audiences, but the Johnny Test is a "fun" in its lowest form. Writing is incredibly predictable, and runners are not much gaga at all. Children will love it, and that's all. This does not mean that everything is bad. The original theme of the opening was actually pretty attractive, but for some reason they took the skeleton and figuratively smashed it with a figurative aluminum rod. It's embarrassing, because it was really one of the best things for it. Some characters could be very interesting, in theory. With a bit of work, characters could work together well, but they are too one-dimensional. Then again, it makes it easy for children to follow. Tempo too is too fast. Episodes are too busy, leaving little time for smart writing. This is a shame because there are so many interesting concepts that this show brings. On the other hand, the fast pace will prevent children from losing interest, which is really the whole of the target audience. it turns out to be funny or interesting. This is the show I want to love, but I'm not capable of it. There are only so many potentials that have not been achieved. Children will enjoy it, but that's all.
