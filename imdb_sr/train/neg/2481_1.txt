I have never heard of Larry Fessenden before, but judging by this effort in writing and directing, he should keep his daily work as an actor. Like many others here, I do not know how to categorize this movie, it was not terrible or horrible, so it can not be called horror, the plot was so thin it could not be a drama, there was no uncertainty so it can not be a thriller, it's just a bad movie that you should only see if you were a fan of the Blair Witch Project. People who loved this movie used words like "ambiguity", complex and subtle, but they read into something that was not. Like Witch Blair, people were scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that was scary. This film started well with the family "encounter" of the local population after hitting a deer. It seemed like a modern liberation, but then for the next 45 minutes, (slightly more than half of the film), nothing happened, the family stuck to their holiday home, which was very beautiful and beautiful, but not the least fun. It was obvious that the local population would in some way be involved in some phase, but Essendon obviously has no idea how to build uncertainty in the film. Finally, when something happens, it's not even clear how his father was shot and dying (the nurse said that his liver was just fired), and this whole spirit of Vendigo obviously reveals the obvious shooter in a very clumsy manner all the time. with special effects of the third grade. The film is called Vendigo, but no attempt has been made to explain it in a clear way, the film ends up being confused and leaves you very unhappy, I would pull out with 15 minutes to go, but I wanted to see if this movie can be bought . It's not.
