I just rented and watched this movie just to see what it was all about. Here are my reactions to it. It's easy to see that this is a low budget movie with poor actors. The main plot of this film is about a woman who is refreshed by her rapists. This concept, if done well, could easily prove to be a really provocative film. However, the film does not shock me at all or disturb me. I'm just bored. This film can be shortened to less than 45 minutes. All the scenes are mostly there to fill the time, like those scene scenes and some scenes that I have described below. ************ Contains a spoiler ***** ******* I consider the rape scene pretty pitiful. I do not know if I saw a cut or unsettled version, if there is such a version. I also found many holes within already badly written plots. Here's the list at the top of my opinion. Why rapists do not rape Jennifer during the night when she came out of the house to find out what the noise was. That would be a great time. Why they would not rape, instead of some of the rapists postponing pleasure and extending Jennifer's temptation for so long. Probably it would be more shocking and disturbing in that way. I thought it was really stupid that the rapists left her in the woods and returned to her house. Perhaps I can show that these rapists are really imbecile. These rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job, they should not send crab to imbecile to do the job. Why did Jennifer not call the police when the rapists finally left? What should be the first thing that appears in the minds of most people, especially for someone who is a writer. Why did not your rapists smell miles away when they saw Jennifer alive? I find it really incredible that a slender lady like Camille can pull a man's wood and hang it. ************************ Completes spoiler ************ But hey, this the film is not without merit, Camille Keaton is wonderful and I hear one of the happiest lines I recently heard when Matthev protested to return to the house and killed Jennifer, 'Why me? Why me, I'm not even c ^ m !!!
