The idea On behalf of the people is good, the killer does not want his only daughter to end up in an institution and asks the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter. And from the actors, especially Scott Bakula, you can expect to perform well, unfortunately, no! On behalf of the people, it turns out it's a regular Friday night. Flashback with the killed girl are quite pathetic and at a certain stage you can only predict what the actors will say ... If you want to watch a good movie about this topic, then watch Dean Man Valking!
