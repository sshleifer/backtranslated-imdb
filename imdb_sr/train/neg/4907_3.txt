SPOILERS THROUGHOUT !!!! I read the book "1st to die" and I wanted to see if the film was following the book and I watched it. Mostly he did it. There were some minor differences (the location of the last violent scene, for example), but not much, and in most cases the film has remained a loyal book, so most films remain. This may have been a mistake - although the film was perfectly bent - especially with Polen and Bellows - I was not so impressed with the book. Or to put it back. I started very impressed, gradually becoming all the disappointed, and finally remained completely dissatisfied and I felt almost pointed. There is no difference in the film. Here's why. There is no "payoff" in a book or movie. I rarely read who the thriller did, who created such a disappointment with his final resolution, and I hoped that the film would be a little different. Whole (he did it, NO she did it NO, they did not do it) - it was not interesting, not fascinating and confusing, boring and depressing than anything else. Add to that love for Lindsay's life dies in the end (after her HER disease is cleansed and she cries on his grave) .. and then cuts to where she is thinking of suicide .... then suddenly she fights for her life with GOLD the scapegoat who was released after the arrest ... but it turns out that he and the woman were in it together .... HELLO !!! All this has now become the "GENERAL HOSPITAL" instead of a good old-fashioned trilogy. I felt cheated and torn from the book and watching the film (I must admit that it got me nice enough - the acting was very good for a TV movie), hoping not to follow the book he finished. /> I still think the film is visible and for some reason does not leave such a bad taste in your mouth as a book (or maybe I just knew what would happen) but I have to say how this story is not done well .
