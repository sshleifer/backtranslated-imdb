Jason Lee does everything in his power to bring the party into a stupid situation, but the movie simply fails to connect. Perhaps because the figure of Juliet Stiles looks awkward as it is stiff and sexy soon to be a cousin. Maybe it's because she and Selma Blair are supposed to be cast in the opposite way. (Selma Blair was more crazy than Julia). In any case, this film is another Hollywood trivialization of a possible situation in the real world (to breathe with your pants on a mom's evening, not to tear your cousin), which, although it promises, fails to deliver. There are some laughs that need to be safe, and the actors (even if they are mistaken) are doing their best with material that did not outperform his rough topic. . So instead of getting a successful festoon (ie Animal House or American Pie), we remain a middle part of humor and part of the nonsense (ala Meatballs 2 or something like that).
