I've seen many stupid lines in my time, but this is among the worst. After capturing some disease in the universe, the astronaut returns to Earth and begins to melt. Then he goes on rampage, kills people (as he is behind me, I'm just watching them, I can not explain them.) This is the type of film that should not have been made in the first place.
