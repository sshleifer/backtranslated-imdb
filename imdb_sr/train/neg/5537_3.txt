What? Did not you know that Scooby Doo is fighting zombies? Well, maybe you are not even aware of this little movie directed by Victor Halperin, who also directed Vhite Zombie four years earlier. That would probably make it another zombie movie. No, do not ask Dorothy Stone to expose her breasts as you'd expect in most zombie movies, and do not even ask for the brain to eat. This is 1936, you know. So, what you will see is typical for that period - lots of stories. You came to see Dean Jagger (Twelve O '). Clock High) and Bella Lugosi's eyes, but that's why. Zombies in Cambodia, really!
