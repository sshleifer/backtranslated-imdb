I went to see Omega code with a group of other Christians, about 15 people in total. We all awaited a good piece of Christian film. What we got was a painful, exhausting and quite boring attempt to film. It has good production values, but it also has a bad acting, a poor script with poor dialogue, and no real sense of direction. From the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night. We all hated him, and some people in our group put this film in reeking more cheese than "Anaconda". None of us could believe that the film lasted less than 2 hours. The brilliant effects and sharper viewing of the cinema can not save this bad, bad movie. I would give her 3 out of 10, and the rating is just so high that I hired a disgusting "movie" Vukodlak (1996) the night before I saw this movie.
