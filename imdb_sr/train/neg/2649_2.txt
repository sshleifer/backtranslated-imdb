My wife and I started watching this film with anticipation. It looked warm and touching. It started well; But, soon he became boring and sincere idiotic. It became so bad that we turned it off. The film was poorly acted and honest, we could not really understand or want to understand why and how, hell, I can deal with that woman! You lost sympathy for her after being rude and acting drunks and cleaning. I would have committed it. And, of course, like most films and TV series made in Hollywood, we need to throw it on a "gay" character! This film was boring. I expected more than Diana Keaton!
