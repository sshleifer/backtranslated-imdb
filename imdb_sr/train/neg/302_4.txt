I really wanted to love this movie. I absolutely love Kenny Hotz, and the spicy rice has a charming side to him. I do not even like Spenni at all. Spenni destroys this movie. He should have allowed Kenny and his hot girl to make a movie. In any case, it's pretty boring next to the scene with Roger Ebert in it. There are really not many celebrities in this movie, and most do not make more than one order. All in all, this film was disappointing. I would just suggest watching it if you got it with season 1 DVD kenni vs spenni (it comes free for 3rd disk). Regardless of this production, I am still very excited to check Papel Chase.
