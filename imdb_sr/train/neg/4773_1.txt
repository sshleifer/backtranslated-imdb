a very good story, a good excitement ... but the last 10 seconds has destroyed the whole movie ... what happened? an extremely well-made and good story destroyed in the last seconds ... I'm sorry I have to say only one voice ... that's what it deserves, I think Chris Shadley could think of a better end ... but maybe the next time :) this meaningless blood for nothing? I would end up telling the story for almost 10, but that's not ... end destroying the whole story, I think most people are not crapping and when you go to the movie, you want a good end, even if it is intricate ... but the only chrome here is end ... sorry
