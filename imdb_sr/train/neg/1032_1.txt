Although I've never been an admirer of the original Scooby-Doo (because of its terrible productive values), it looks like Shakespeare in relation to this pile of shit brought to us by Hanna-Barbera! Without a doubt, Scrappi-Doo is about the most disgusting and horrible character created for children (and this includes Teletubbies as well as Tommi the Tapevorm). Whose idea was to create a kind of short-lived mutant and to be allowed to speak, and then cast Scooby-Doo characters with it ?! Whoever deserves to die or watch this show (I think it deserves death). The conclusion is that the little dog is simply immature, uncomfortable and nervous - and that's only in BIG Episodes !! After many years, it would be better to end the franchise than to make this mess! I can see why in the Scooby-Doo film, Scrappi-Doo was made live by virtually everyone - because everyone hates it!
