From the pen of Richard Condon (Manchurian Candidate 1962) this confusion comes about with a story about political intrigues and assassinations. The story, told in almost comic mode, is hard to swallow. All acting teams are considered, this bad effort is not entirely the fault of the actors and the team: the novel was full of the same shortcomings. It seems as though sometimes it is a story of sincere efforts in the "Manchurian candidate". Frustration at all points.
