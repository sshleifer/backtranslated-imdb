There is no doubt that Madonna and Guy Ritchie married because they both thought it would help them in the career of the movie. If you've gone through the temptation to watch "Swept Avai," then you know that at that level it was a game made in hell. After nearly 20 years of trying to become a reputable actress (or "octress", such as she could pronounce "The Nekt Best Thing"), she still can not get out of her long enough to turn into a taste show I could even call it decent. And that's why people do not like the screen so much: the feeling that her ego is so squeezed that it prevents it from being able to leak and connect with its audience. If there is any justice in this universe, it just ruined its last chance.
