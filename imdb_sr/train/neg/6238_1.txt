Man, it's amazing how one can claim that global warming is science, well, I suppose that this elitist stupidity is now replacing the eugenics science! Al Gore is trying to make this a complicated issue, even if it needs to be reasonably understood that this is a great story by a man with his own agency! How have scientists estimated the historical temperatures of this planet? Assessment of on-the-spot activities. Did anyone ask if this method was correct? No, not even alone! So, how come it is not accurate to predict the future temperature with on-site activities if it was in the past? According to on-site activities, the temperature today is fully in line with what it should be. How is the temperature in the whole universe growing (relatively) as much as on Earth? Do our SUVs cause a rise in temperature on Jupiter? Use some common sense! You do not need to be a rocket scientist to realize that this can be nothing more than HOAKS. Please investigate it yourself. What can Al Gore and his elite friends like Rothschild (the banking family that organized the event on Earth) get from it? Well, the new world bank will be based on carbon credits, i.e. tax on everything that gives up CO2 emissions, and it's easier to get rid of those taxes if people are lured to think that this is a saving world only if money, centralized control and the greater power of elitist bankers. Al Gore has even a company that sells carbon credits! Is not it noble to pay voluntary carbon credits to save the world, especially if it enters your company? I do not want you to believe in me blindly, please investigate yourself and use your common sense and I am sure you will come to the right conclusion!
