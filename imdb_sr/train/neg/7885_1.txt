I believe that religion is out of power and out of films. When I want to preach, I will go to church, but I do not want one from the movie. I do not mind some supernatural topics, (after all, religion is as supernatural as you can get!) But this film has so preached that I was really angry. The mistress reminded me of the witches I saw in other films. The bad guy even seemed to have horns. And what a stupid ending: the hero went to the meeting and yelled at all those old men, and it broke the spell. That life is just so simple. I think when movies are so dumb, they should be distributed with a warning: DANGER! PREACHING CONTAINED HEREIN!
