Boring. Minimal plot. There is no character development. I entered this film with high expectations from the book. It could have been a great movie. It could have been a cult classic. No, it was a giant discount. He was badly thrown and he had terrible special effects. It was difficult to determine who the bad guys are: rebels or army or church or all of them? I'm confused by some mini-films from the movie. I am amazed at some aspects of this so-called "prophecy", which has never been fully explained. I felt like watching a banner episode of the mini-series on the sci-fi channel. It looked like the movie was made for TV. Do not watch this movie. It's a waste of time and money.
