The statistics in this film have been well researched. No doubt about that! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it's no wonder that this film got the praise it received. Al Gore is certainly a good actor. Sounds so worried. But the works speak louder than words! Through this film, the film shows political treats and references to his political career. Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man of integrity who not only talks, but also a walk. Too. When Carter thought we needed to save energy, he threw down the thermostat in the White House and warmed up the wearing sweater. Al Gore tells us that we need to save energy and claims to create global warming as we travel with our private plane. How much energy does his plane use and how much more pollution creates his jet? How much energy is needed to heat the Gore Pool behind his house? It would be nice to save electricity using small appliances and to make a point to turn off all that is not used. But if we did, the electric power industry would react to a 50% reduction in energy, calling it a "loss of 50% of revenue" and regaining its losses by increasing the rate by 50%. So, "exclusion alone" would not be a good idea. This film is a covert appeal to allow the great government to take control of everything in the name of saving the planet Earth.
