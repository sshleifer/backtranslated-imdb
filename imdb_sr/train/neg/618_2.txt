Perhaps one of the worst teenage movies I've ever seen. I'll start with the bad spots of the movie, which mostly covers the whole movie. First of all, something that no one can avoid: \ t I swear they have picked up random kids from the street based on what they look like. Second, BAD / UNCONVINCING CHARACTER RAD / DEVELOPMENT. You barely know half of the children killed here. All you think is that they earned it in one way or another. The character of the scarecrow was excessive, and cheap capture of other great fantasy killers, such as Freddy or Pinhead. The following: BAD DIALOGUE: The scarecrow was full of terrible lines that would make you laugh just because it was so terrible. Lines like "Let's find small animals to torture!" really leaves you with a raised eyebrow. Last but not least: Next: BAD CASTING. How much did a guy who played Lester? Like 30? His butt was feverish in the name of God. It could be said much more about this film, as it's a cheap special effect, that's the effort of a "high school movie class," but the point is understandable. It's just a bad movie recording at the worst. Regarding what I found to be "good" in the movie: - Fun for those with low, low, low standards - Helps to put insomnia into sleep. - A very cheap laugh, or even giggle.
