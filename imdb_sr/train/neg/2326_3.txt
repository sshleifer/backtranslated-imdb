Dr. Mordridge is terrifying. I would not recommend to any adult person or child to see this, unless it is already an angry killer. There's so much dirt in the movie that it hurts me. Speaking of the eyes, there are eyes in the sky, on the background of the star. Only the devil could have imagined such a wicked thing. I rented all the copies that I could from local video stores and crushed them with a Â£ 5 cross. That film should remain locked in the basement behind the fourth dimension with all the other disgusting beasts of hell. This film belongs to. I suggest that if you want some scandalous fun, go and rent all dogs to heaven, or angels on the field. These films are worth watching. If you want to commit a sin and love horrible movies, you must see Dr. Mordrida.
