I expected the release of the film as much as any fan of Broadway drama. For months I waited and read reviews of award-winning performances. I mean, with the stars Eddie Marphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knovles, Danny Glover ... the movie can not be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? VRONG! I was definitely disappointed with the finished product. The film does not coincide with the publicity it has received, and the only savings are Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. \ T Multiple Holidays and Performance Jennifer Hudson forces you to pay attention every time it's on the screen. Her performance "I'm telling you," was the only time I felt that Hyper deserved it. You stiffened while praying to her that there was no good man to let her stay in the group and in her life. As many reviewers have stated, she steals a movie from more experienced actors and deserves all the praise she receives for this show. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with excellent voice and comical talent. Jamie Fock and Beionce Knovles, on the other hand, travel through their performances. Fokk's acting skills for this film seemed to have preceded his remarkable "Rai" performance, and Beionce Knovles was on expanded fashion photography or video recording, posing and casting through the movie. Her performance was not strong enough to care for her character at any time in the film. The film was too big, 30 minutes and 1 song (Beionce's "honest" solo Jamie Fokku) too long.
