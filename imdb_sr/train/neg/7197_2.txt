OK. I think the TV show is somehow cute and it always has some sort of lesson. So, when my children decided to want to see this movie, I decided to join. I wish I could stay home and watch a TV show. The fact that humor is silly and non-genuine is the smallest problem with this movie. The plot is near the nonexistent, the characters seem to exist in a vacuum, and worst of all, the Gadget does not carry any lessons. Disney seemed to have taken all the things that Inspector Gadget was doing on TV and threw them all away. To be honest, my younger child (8 years old) loved the film, but the older (10 years) went away thinking that it was stupid (he was too old for youthful humor, but too young for any adult humor). In general, I like Disney movies, but this misses the mile. It's OK for a very narrow group of years (say 7 to 9), but for all the others it is not necessary to miss.
