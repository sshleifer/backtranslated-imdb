This (extraordinary) low-budget film is comparable to the great classic "The Silent Night Deadly Night", because it is labeled Slasher Flick. First of all, I think that even Silent Night Part 2 is better than this (one was filled with flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie). "Christmas Evil" is trying to get psychology by introducing the main character as someone who is crazy (strong word), slowly (very slow). They are irritated by people who do not get the true meaning of Christmas, and at work they can not stand how manufactured toys are made with such a lack of quality and love. Dressed up as Santa Claus, she's finally going to kill. Also a strong word, as only 3 people were killed without the real need for special effects. No tension, no excitement, no worse, no heads. For one exception: Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is best known for playing Tom Hanks as one of the guards in the classic "Green Mile". It still has to be kicked out these days because it has ever taken on the role. He is truly the only one who can really work, his support is better than the main one. (which is also not so bad, but if you're overshadowed with a small supporting character, you are not too big). What about this weird ending? (you need to see that you believe). "Christmas Evil" is quite boring, nothing is happening and artwork is just deceptive. This is not a killer. You want to see the real Christmas slashers, look at all the best time: "Silent Night, Deadly Night".
