The LOC could have been a very well made film about how the Kargilsky War was leading; he had locations, budget and skill that India was "Saving Private Rian" or "Black Havk Dovn". Instead, it is encountered as an inflated, 4-hour long attempt to combine the war with the masala movie. Even war scenes are horribly executed, using the same hill in all their battle scenes, and spending unnecessary time on an optional conversation. Instead of trying to address the Indian public, a better film would be a book on what happened in Kargil (such as "Black Havk Dovn") or even spending time on a militant point of view (like "Torah"), Torah, Torah " ) Even better, he could have used a competent director such as Ram Gopal Verma to write, direct and edit a movie. Until then, I would like to see that someone is re-editing this film, with only the appropriate parts, which would make the film more visible.
