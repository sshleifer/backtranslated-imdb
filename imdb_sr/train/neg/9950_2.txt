Had the original idea of ​​casting been retained (hunting for Rutger, not Ice-T), this film might have worked. Unfortunately, racism had to come to the picture (literally) and mess up. Mostly black staff could not allow the antagonist to be black, replacing Rutger's and Ice-T roles. It was only the beginning of the spiral of this film. The journalist's approach to Ernest Dickerson regarding "directing" only confirmed that this was another affair for affirmative action. Master shot, close up, close up. Gads, 'Vho's Line is anyway' even using more creative work with cameras. Eric's rewriting of 'Most dangerous games' is at least an attempt to modernize a classic story, but it does not give us any motivation why the characters do it. We are never given any reason, except that "no one will miss these people," why the leader (copied as Rutger) is doing this thing. In addition to the fact that John McGinley played in the heart, and the honest work of Charles Dutton, do not be bothered with this. A small small number of trivialities, there was a real accident in drunk driving during the shooting that was hurt by F. Murraha Abraham, and led to the death of a young driver under the influence of alcohol that caused an accident.
