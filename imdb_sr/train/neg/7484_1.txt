Within 15 minutes, my whole family cheered for the character of Goldie Havn to die, or at least to leave the character of Steve Martin. In 40 minutes we turned it off. We only have a few movies annually that we are trying to get so boring that we can not even stomach it long enough to establish the story. , and I remember I enjoyed the original Neil Simon. So I blamed Marco Lavrence and Sam Veisman. Combine the director "What's the worst that can happen" and the writer "Miss Congeniality 2", and I think that's what we're ending up with.
