Peter Fonda is so deliberately fascinated as an actor that his lachrimose-line readings void any irony or humor in the dialogue. Performs sassi barbs and non-witty repartee with Brooke Shields as if it were a wooden block with receding hair; even his smaller touches (such as pointing to non-existent mustache on his gray face) do not reveal as many characters as an unreasonable actor directed by himself, an unsure director. In the southwest around 1950, the poor gambler (not above a little cheating) gets an orphan, potentially teenager Lolita in a rotten poker game; After finding a gold warehouse that promises gold in the Grand Canyon, arguments have become the researchers. Some wonderful visions, and the strange but interesting comedy of Henry Fonda as a gray man in the canyon, are the only compensations in a tired comedy-drama, with two traces that lead traces of cartoon killers who will not stop until what they reach . Shields are very nice, but - although the camera likes its pouti, great beauty - it does not have the presence of the screen (and its slim voice has no reach); Every time he opens his mouth, one is inclined to refrain or to pull himself in. * 1/2 of ****
