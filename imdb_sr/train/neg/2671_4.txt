** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ** Titular heroine in Toples rescues another beautiful baby and her father (an eccentric professor whose helmet is broken in one frame and the whole in the next) of mothers, a dime-store of mummy and nasty Nazis on - what else? - build the Fourth Reich. Mystic costume, like some other vimmen, gets short film while filming. The last part of the film is dedicated to a long-lasting lesbian action; this shot actually becomes really boring, very fast, which tells more about the creatures behind the camera, but about the rounded creatures in front of it. MISTI gets its nominal plot from the road first and fast, and then gives undivided attention to nudity and soft-core sex. This makes MUMMI RAIDER a return to films made in the 1960s by guys like Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harria Novak. Just think: if this miraculous work would have expanded four decades ago, it would have been playing on 42nd Street for years, along with VHAM BAM THANKS YOU SPACE AND KISS ME KUICK. In fact, MISTI MUNDAE MUMMI RAIDER went straight to home video. Get your own, quickly, before it disappears.
