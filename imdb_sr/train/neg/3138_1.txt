I see people writing about how this film was excellent. It was scary! The act was at best a sub-pair. He made a lot of money because teenagers had been watching film in cinemas for Leonard seven times. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I wanted to find out more about Titanic; why it sank, which went through many people's minds; maybe even a little conspiracy. Does anyone realize that certain people did not even board the ship because the ship was a fire before it even flew? No, no, because everything you see is a rich girl who falls for a poor boy and the picture is naked (does this rubbed garbage at least hint that the movie is stupid?). Although I cried during one scene. A scene when they showed the water that filled the boat. It looked like water in the pool! I think this film made all that money and could not even make water from the ocean look real? Unbelievable ... Ohhh band was playing while the ship sank .. Just funny. This was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor surpassed him in the "Nothing with Reality" section.
