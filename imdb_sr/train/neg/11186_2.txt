I wanted to watch this movie, but a bizarre funny scene forced me to exclude him. It seems that the character does not react to anything. Think about this: Heath Ledger walks at night (through the cemetery I believe) when it is attacked by the spirits he takes away. When this temptation passed, he walked out peacefully and came across a friend who saw it all. Asked what was going on, he said he was "attacked by demons, nothing serious," as if it was just a little more exciting than empty rubber. I exclude him when they go looking for something - a demon or something, I stopped worrying. The answer can only be given out by someone with the energy of their death, and the priest will look at what appears to be an unclear disturbance as a man is burdened and hung and asks him to fight, his body dies. br /> 0 of the **** star.
