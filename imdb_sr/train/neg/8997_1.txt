This is the worst movie I've ever paid to see and with the exception of "They've Saved Hitler's Brain" the worst movie I've ever seen. When this film came out, I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV, and that's why I was expecting what I thought would be the most entertaining film that could have been produced because there were no restrictions with which TV shows should be dealt with. The writers certainly thought that we would throw some rudeness, some jokes about numbness, some cheap sex, and hey, we have a risky side that separates funny comedy. Play show skates are nothing more than a cheap unimaginable take-off on "Make Make A Deal" with stupid roughness. The headquarters took a girl and her boyfriend was just bad school humor. The stun gun advertising was suicidal for Seasame Street. A skyscraper at LA's metro was a mild humor with unruly bloodyness. A French chef walking around the blind constantly saying "no difference" with the French accent was, you got a good point. That means you will get 60 seconds of fun in this movie. Oh iea. I've read the comments about the whole country that was stoned in the 1970s and you'll love this movie if you're tall. Most of the earth was not stoned in the seventies. If the incompetent writers were stoned, it must have been on drowsy sinus medicine. There were four more people in the cinema next to me when I saw this movie. Of course, the word has not yet come out about how bad the movie was.
