While the 3-D animation (the highlight of the show) worked well, most of the other elements fell. It was as if the filmmakers thought "well, it will be 3-D so we do not have to work so hard on the plot or character development". And the fact that this is a children's movie is no excuse. The public is attracted to three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Nem's Dad) as much as they are attracted to three-dimensional graphics. The only dimension shown by any of the main characters was a two-dimensional Scooter that periodically turned the action off with its compulsion to eat everything. A Absolute kicker? The appearance of Buzz Aldrin at the very end (after seeing a very robotic version of the same historical character in an hour and a half) comes to the screen and destroys all the good times, invoking the main characters of the film "Pollutants" and announcing that the situation on the screen was actually an impossibility. <br /> <br /> ??? ??? Did you just want to tell your children that the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus do not exist while you are there?
