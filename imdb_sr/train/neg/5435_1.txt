... do they mind making this movie? Anyone? I did not mean that. If you are looking for a film that comes in age, go to rent Summer '42. This is not '42. When your big stars are Nolte & Sarsgaard, and Sarsgaard gets more time on the screen, this is your first warning sign And, of course, for such an "artistic" movie, there are many curses and skin around you, just to look "artistic". Sarsgaard has made his usual uninteresting, cardboard figure, intermittent at times that should be intense. The intensity is in someone with a bi-polar disorder. Miller is best known for her appearance and what she had to say about the Pittsburgh city after this film. Pittsburgh should be angry with her. She misrepresented the true line from Pittsburgh. Foster gave Sarsgaard a chance for his money in cardboard style. Wow! Was it his first role after finishing high school? So, we have this strange triangle. Foster is in love with Miller, but he is with his boss / girlfriend. He can not take Miller to bed, and he will not take the boss to bed. So, he hangs with Sarsgaard and Miller, and looks at them as they get him. Then, after one of Sarsgaard's pseudo-intense moments, Foster & Miller gets it, the scene we "treat". in every slack, mourning the details. Finally, just to complete all this, Foster & Sarsgaard received it, with Foster in Miller's role. Now I know how the two guys do it (as if it was ever anything I needed to know). After all that, all that remains is a tragic end of one character and retrospective views on the rest of it is right in my stomach. Check! It was a pepper pie that I just had. I would like to return the time that this film has taken out of my life, please.
