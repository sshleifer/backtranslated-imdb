John Wayne and Albert Dekker compete for oil rights in the Indian territory, and for the attention of Marthe Scott in this film, Pictures Pictures from Jute, USA. Interesting Western species due to its character and its more modern setting, with Vaine & Dekker playing the old and new faction of the West. It's based on the story of Thomson Burtis, who together with Eleanor Griffin and Ethel Hill writes a script. Albert Rogell directs himself to a working style that suits his career. A fairly earthly story, in fact, was saved by his last third, where happiness of action was picked up and treated for something like a pulse. The bright approach to the romantic thread does not stand right, and the magnificent first fight between the two protagonists has been ruined because Rogell is not able to hide the stuntman who is doing the job. But hey, stuntmen deserve their moment of glory ever. Strong support comes from George 'Gabby' Haies and Vaine, as there are usually a lot of harris on the screen, especially when the pistol is sizzling. But, despite his better republican budget, he remains a film of interest only for Vaine's enthusiasm from the 1940s. 4/10
