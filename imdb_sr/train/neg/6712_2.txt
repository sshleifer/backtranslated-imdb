I guess you must give some points for the pure courage to write a musical about a lesson from history, but how about some decent music? Did the cartoon actor Howard DeSilve intend to initiate the interest of otherwise exhausted children? Is William Daniels Contemporary (during that time) acting style designed to appeal to the 1960s / 70s demographics? Do we need all the "jokes" about NI & NJ? (I can hear the blonde Broadway audience hanging at the sign).
