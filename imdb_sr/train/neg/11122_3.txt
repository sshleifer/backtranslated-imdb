I'll say a lot - This director is all about RAV images ... things most of us are not ready to face with the head. Images of sex, suicide, murders and people who are "freed" constantly bombard the viewer, which makes me wonder if the director has tried to pass the concept of relief or liberation. Although I do not think that I could ever see this movie again, I will say that the director has a good eye. There were some really nice recordings and "picture moments" in the movie (fans, wire fish in the hair), but the story left me the need for even more (strictly in what we left to wonder "what the hell did we do?" Just look? "). Note: If you tend to easily vomit or vomit ... you do not see this movie.
