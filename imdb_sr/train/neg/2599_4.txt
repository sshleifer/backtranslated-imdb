I got a DVD very cheap and I'm totally Drevbie, and that's probably the only constellation in which this movie could ever be interested in anybody. many of her sweet scenes, like a scene of a shower, a sexy dance scene, lots of sexy clothes, etc. She never shows the friendly charm we know from her newer movies. The film itself is quite average or sub-average, and it looks much more like it's made for TV than for cinema. There is no real horror or tension and dialogue are often na√Øve. The most interesting part is probably the end, because I honestly do not understand. But perhaps there is nothing to understand anyway. But at least you do not get the end that you would expect, and it also comes much earlier than you would expect. All in all, I think this film is exclusively for Drevbies.
