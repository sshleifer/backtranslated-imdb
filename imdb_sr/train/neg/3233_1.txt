Come people, you can not be serious, another case of advertising snooping when it's not at all! This is not even scary, nor scary or distorted - it's just an awesome amateur video, made for the next party to lay the girls up. - The scene is far from wanting to wish to vomit, but only to make me take the camera and hit those guys over my head. The girl just lies somewhere in the face, she does not move at all. Instead, it would be more fun to use the right doll. One season "I'm a celebrity, take me out of here!" is scary from this. Do not waste your time and money.
