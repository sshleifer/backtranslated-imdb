In 1454, in France, the wizard Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschi) was beheaded, and his mistress Mabille De Lancre (Helga Line) was tortured to death accused of returning, vampirism, and lycanthropy. Before he dies, cursing the next generations of his executioners. In today's 70s, Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschi) and Silvia (Betsabe Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Vinner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) go to a session where they evoke the spirit of Alaric de Marnac . They decided to travel to Villas de Sade, a property of Hugo's family in the village, to search for a monastery with hidden treasures. They find Alaric's head and the demon seizes them, bringing Mabila to life and killing locals in the victims. After her father's death, Elvira (Emma Cohen) recalls that the Thor Hammer amulet is hidden in a well; along with Maurice, are trying to defeat the demons Alaric de Marnac and Mabille. Last weekend I bought a box of genre horor with five DVDs Paula Naschia at US $ 9.98; despite the fact that there are no references, I decided to take the opportunity. The first DVD with an uncut and revamped version of "Horror Rises from the Tomb" is a garbage B (or C) movie that immediately prompted me to remember Ed Vood. A funny story is revealed through an awful scenario, directing, performances, cinema, decoration, special effects and release, and with many naked women. The result is simply hilarious and I can guarantee that Ed Wood's style has returned. My voice is three. Title (Brazil): Not available
