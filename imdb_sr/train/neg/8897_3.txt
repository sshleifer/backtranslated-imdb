I remember when I first saw this film, I was in the sixth grade when it happened. Before I saw it, I listened to the original Broadway footage, and I really loved it! But when I saw it, I was like, damn it! This movie lacks many songs from a musical for loud crying! Who decided it all?! I really am a great fan of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the worst of a musical ever made! The film looked more like a Hollywood set than the beautiful Scottish Highlands. Who decided to shoot all the films Meg out of the movie ?! I'm willing to bet that when they saw this movie, Lerner and Love were probably wondering, "Who decided in the world to do this to our masterpiece?" Well, they had the right to say that if they were, they were probably angry at the fact that Hollivood turned his big musical into this pretty blank film. Pjesma i gluma g. audition with flying colors, but you are in a movie that lacks a lot of text. So, in short, if you want a good film based on Frederick Love's music and Alan Jaia Lerner, this is not! 3/10
