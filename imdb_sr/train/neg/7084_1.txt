As many others have said, this is a horrible movie from all aspects of film making. As they have ever received some famous actors, the names for this project are astounding. Many people complained that it was filmed on 'cheap' video cameras. Yes, it was recorded on a video, but not a 'cheap' video. What made it bad was lighting, white balance, recording techniques and editing. There were so many different shooting and editing techniques that were used in production. Powerful, inconsistent lighting, using a manual shootout (ala Voodi Allen), turbulent editing (another Allen technique), but poorly implemented, without the proper purpose. The lack of a white balance in the kitchen restaurant scene is unpleasant; Very amateurish. Simulated sex scenes did not have any acting value at any level. How is this video ever made to print is beyond me. It's worth a look just to be surprised how bad it is.
