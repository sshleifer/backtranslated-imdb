The girl who called her testifies to the murder and becomes the next target of the killer. Director Brian De Palma is really on the pretentious show: his camera rolled around the corners of the museum (after being kept in the monkey's image for a long time), split into a split screen for artistic purposes, practically plotting the sequence (again in the split screen) where both characters watch a TV show about transsexuals and record their (first) finals during a thunderous rain. "Dressed to Kill" is exhausting, primarily because it requires us to swallow so much and not return anything significant. Most of the acting (with the exception of young Keith Gordon) is central, and (the second) finale is the break-up of De Palmino "Carrie" - not to mention "Psicho". The explanation for the dirty work is played as a Hitchcock bribe, not a homage. Stylish and cool, the ultimate results are extremely polished. ** from the ****
