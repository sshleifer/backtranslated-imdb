Jungle Fever is too stylized, stereotyped and encounters the essence of dishonesty. Vesely Snipes was not right to lead and there was no chemistry between him and Annabelle Sciorra. Although there are many talents in this film, it is mostly consumed because the pieces are reduced to more than the decorative imagery. Likewise, instead of just showing racism for an ugly and stupid thing, Spike Lee decides to wave her like a flag in the harshest and irritating way. I went through most of the film, but I could not finish it, and this rarely happens to me.
