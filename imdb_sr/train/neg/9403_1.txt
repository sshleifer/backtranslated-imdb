This film should not be classified as a cinema. Though now over 10 years old, he should never get the money, which is a detriment to the Australian film industry, which now produces such great movies as "The Dish". Actors can not It works, music is ... to be dull, not music, the story is completely non-existent and the fight is to sit. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. It's the total loss of your time.
