It touches a few interesting points .. But! - It does not show any evidence of all the 'exclusive' studies shown. Who are 'friends' and 'small groups of scientists' who collected these data? - What's going on with this biography of Al Gore?

Unless you live under the rock, this "documentary" should not be any news for you ... it's all old news ... And all that Al Gore is trying to do is gain points of popularity. P.S. I'm not an American, so I'm not even trying to say I'm a fan: p
