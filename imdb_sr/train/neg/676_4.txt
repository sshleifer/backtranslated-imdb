I wanted to see it for two reasons. First, it was a remake of the High Sierra with Bogart, two, Bogart's part played by Jack Palance, who can play drama roles with some subtlety, as in the Big Nose. why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra; Only actors here do not care, the director is lost in his thoughts and who knows what the producer has been thinking. Jack Palance bored watching Shelley Vinters and Shelley Vinters wondering what he is doing in this movie. I do not want to compare it with Ida Lupino in the same role. And, of course, they had to use the story of a dog again! They could certainly come up with some different ideas. Perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location as High Sierra, but that definitely does not add any quality to the movie. It's a waste of time if you've seen High Sierra before. Otherwise, why not see a pseudo-film noir. As far as I'm concerned, I'd rather die than see it again ...
