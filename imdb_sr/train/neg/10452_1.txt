I saw it at 10 o'clock. to show and I must say that this film was nothing special. Although I did not leave the theater trying to go back (as I do not actually pay for movies anymore), I did not really find some sort of redemption. There were several lines and the ones that made me laugh, but mostly it seemed that the movie consisted of unwritten fan service for the younger (considering more years than this film was ranked as R) male audience. The fan service seemed unimportant and quite disturbing. I know you all want to hear that Samuel L. says his notorious line, but let's be honest. The only really terrible part of the film was CG, which looked very digitized and did not fit well with live action on the screen. Now I am a reasonable man, I knew that I was going to the theater that I did not want to see "Casablanca", and at least I am grateful that this film is an original (albiet inane) idea, not some re-make or franchise spin off. However, to be honest, if you're not part of the cult that follows you, it's probably better to spend money somewhere else and watch a movie in the second race in a few weeks or rent it in a few months.
