As far as cinema is concerned, this film was pretty good in the mid-1950s. It was several times that the lighting was too hot, but the recordings were mostly in the frame and remained in focus. The act was above the average for a bad budget, but the direction was terrible. Several scenes were too long drawn in an attempt to tension, and the effects did not exist. The attack of the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the last cutting and every attempt to breathe life into the skull was evident with sticks and wires. I also could not help but think that their budget did not allow them to equip the house, so they continued to appeal to the drivers and that all things in the warehouse would soon come. Honestly ... it would be more fun to have been a worse movie. It was not bad enough to be a "good-bad" movie, but it was not good enough to be "good." Get the MST3K version ... it's more fun.
