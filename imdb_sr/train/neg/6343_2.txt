Maybe I'm not sophisticated. This and Closer are two of the allegedly cerebral films that I recently watched, both of which suffer from the exact same problem to the difficult level. Dialogue is a false false lie. It seems that nothing that comes out of one's mouth can not be convincing. Perhaps the way in which this film is set is the way it should be felt, but it was invisible. And boring. I went after 20 minutes of boredom. I will keep Sleepera and Banana for my Voody Allen repair. If I come across this on the teevee, I turn around and try to find an episode of Kuinci.
