The eight Jean Rollin films I've watched may also be the strangest; An intriguing action (such as this) seems to have originally been too weak to sustain even his 84 minutes, but somehow he can work out to get confused while going on! A female vampire (scrupulously dressed, as promised in the title) was held captive in a remote trap and appeared only to "accommodate" the blood of willing victims (apparently members of the suicide club). insecure where all this would lead him, the writer-director ultimately has a human criminal? in fact, the stupid father of the hero with an empty face? ridiculously reveals itself as a mutant (?!) from the future! A strange rhythm and a dreamlike atmosphere (cultists dressing hoodies and animal masks to hide their traits from a protected girl) are, of course, typical for the film maker (as well as the setting up of the sea on the anti-climax) and the "Euro-Cult" style , as shown in the beauty group. Personally, the most exciting thing around the whole visually appealing, but intellectually empty, affair was the sight of the famous actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in six of Louis Bunuel's latest films).
