This film, originally published on Christmas in 1940, was long lost. A very bad copy appeared and made on a CD, now for sale. Do not buy! The film is inexpressibly awesome. Casting is bad, the scenario is horrible, and the direction is terrible. Image Roland Ioung sings and dances. And that was the peak. Perhaps this film is deliberately lost.
