This film is the perfect adaptation of the English film Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emman, who Olivier and Malik represented the perfect role of Lana in cheating women. Even then, the film has full traces of disbelief, although it could not face the original. It was a cheap soft porn of fans of Bollivood, where Mallika showed much more skin than anyone would dare to show. Emran has done more of this kind of role and has even received a nickname of serial killers. In the future, if Indian directors plan to process the film in English, then they must investigate the feasibility of complicity with Indian censors. Although the film was bombarded at the box office, the actors received an inappropriate recognition. In the coming period, filmmakers should be a little more cautious in processing a movie nominated for an Oscar. All said, this is not a family movie, so be even more careful while watching it at home with your family.
