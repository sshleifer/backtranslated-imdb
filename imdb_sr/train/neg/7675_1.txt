Can I ever say that there are some movies that do not have any features? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After directing the horrifying director of the "Houses of the Dead", Uwe Boll has now transferred his less than a talented eye to another adaptation for video games. Do not these guys get it? For anyone who can not understand, it's for you in block letters: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT GIVE FOR GOOD FILMS! The operation here is, at best, below the standard. Set design and special effects are bad. Unlike the video game (which had its daunting moments), the film has no atmosphere of upcoming disaster, a sense of danger or danger. Pacing and plotting is confusing and the paper on which the script is printed would be better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses a camera with the grace and skill of the apes using a brush. Hacked zooms, jumps and pans are merging into a whole gloomy affair in unpredictable moments leaving the public disoriented and boring. Why this guy has ever been released near the film set to first place, must be one of the greatest secrets of modern cinema. Avoid at all costs.
