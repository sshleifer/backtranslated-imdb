This is a badly made, bad remake of the Bimaldean classic Parineete. The story is based on the Sarat Chandra, the book of the same name, and is a distortion of the original. Well, a degree of creativity can be appreciated, but not apparent creativity. Everyone is acting, and the whole movie is a lie. Shekar's choice of words in the abuse of Lolita (Balan) sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again, the scene in which Shekhar (Saif) murmured Lolita is rather unreasonable with the flow of film and characters, is quite disturbing for the senses, and could be easily avoided. Similarly, the sexual scene between Saifa and Balan is pretty unsuitable for a movie and a cheap trick that attracts the audience. When creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys its spirit, the work breaks down. The song "piiu bole" is all right. Another silver coating in the dark cloud of this film is the scene in which Saif stands for himself and bouts against his father. This is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit. This movie deserves 3 stars. Song and dance The river delights the skill and it's putting it. The song is melodic, but I remember I heard it somewhere before, and if I'm not mistaken, the melody seems to be plagiarized. Well, we agreed that the time has changed since then. But then this film is not even a reflection of modern times. This is what happens when modern movie makers from Bollivood are becoming increasingly obsessed with impressing NRI and capturing a lucrative NRI entertainment market. Such films end up not belonging to India or any other part of the world.
