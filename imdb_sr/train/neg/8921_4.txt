The premise of an African-American woman Scrooge in a modern city struggling was inspired, but nothing else in this film is not. Here, Ms Scrooge is a scandalous banker who uses employees and clients in the poor and black neighborhood in which she lives. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. Part of the problem is that the story's roots do not translate well into the urban setting of this movie, and the script fails to update. Also, the constant message of sharing and giving is repeated so infinitely, that the audience is tired of it much before the movie reaches its famous end. This is a movie that does not know when to give up. In the title role, the talented Cicelli Tison gives excessively tired performance and sometimes it's difficult to understand the lines. Roman Charles Dickens has been adapted so many times that it is a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant, despite its very relevant message.
