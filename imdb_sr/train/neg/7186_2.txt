I'm sorry for all the fans, but this is a useless movie. The act is a bad, even a wooden, overly hyper-early fear factor and does not work just like that. I think that in the end, there should have been a turn, but in the end, it was confusingly confusing. What the hell? The guy who killed everything was one of the hunters? Try again. Barely be genuine, and is not even as good as a slasher flat. And it says something. I think that whoever did the castings, whoever wrote the script, and whoever thought of it, should be ruthlessly fired and deported. This movie. If someone put this at a party, throw a disc out of the window and put on a good horror movie, such as Quiet Lamb or Superbly.
