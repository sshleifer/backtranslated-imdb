When I was younger, I really enjoyed watching a poor TV. We were all blamed for it at some time, but my excuse to watch things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" and "Silver Spoons" is as follows: I was young and naive; Ignorance of what the show really is worth. Fortunately, now I appreciate good things. Stargate SG-1 is not good. A twelve-year-old girl would love every exhausted part, every row of stiff dialogue, every piece of unnecessary technobabble. Writing is beyond the insides; So bland and uninspired it makes one miss the Star Trek: Voiager. If your show is eager for the worst Trek shovu ever, you're in trouble. Film Stargate is a great pleasure, anchored by two solid performances by James Spader and Kurt Russell. fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, wonderful music party and cool sci-fi ideas. With the exception of a bit of original music, none of what makes the movie entertaining in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGiver interesting and legend interesting, seems to be the most lully episodes. The budget had to be very low because the sets sometimes look like somebody's basement. Cinema is not much better, like vanilla and boring as well as scripts. It amazes me that it shows much more style (such as Farscape) and the essence (like reimagined Battlestar Galactica) have less, less angry fan base than this Pope. It just does not deserve it.
