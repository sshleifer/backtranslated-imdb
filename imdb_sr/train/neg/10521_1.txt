This film is a horrible waste of time. Although it's only an hour and a half, it feels somewhere close to 4. I've never seen a movie moving so slowly and without a goal. This is also a "horror" movie that takes place a lot of time during the day. My friend and I laughed countless times when we probably should have been scared. The only thing we want to know is why such a horrible movie is published in many countries. It can not be so demanded. Supermodel Nicole Petty should stick to the models because although the beautiful girl has lost her accent so many times in this movie, half the time she is a Briton, and half time is an American.
