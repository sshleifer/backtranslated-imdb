This film talks about a male escort who is involved in an investigation into the murder that took place in the circle of powerful male women. <br /> I thought "Walker" would be exciting and attractive, but I was so wrong. Pacing is painful and exhausting, even after 40 minutes of film nothing happens. Seriously, the first hour can be summed up in ten minutes. It's so slow. The fact that there is no excitement or action scenes worsens boredom. It's almost shocking that even scene scenes are so free and emotionless. Perhaps because of the rigid upper lips of a more social class? It's sad that "The Valker" becomes such a boring mess, despite such a strong vote. Curse it on a bad parcel and worse pacing.
