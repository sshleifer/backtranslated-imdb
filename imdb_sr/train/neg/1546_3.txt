I rented this movie for a few laughs. I've never seen SNL skit, but with hits like Tommy Boi and Vaines Worl, it could not have been that bad, right? Answer: he was. This film was hardly a means of relaxing after a busy day. I just kept waiting for the plot and a funny part, but it was not. The highlight was Tiffany Amber Thieson, and that's exactly what it was.
