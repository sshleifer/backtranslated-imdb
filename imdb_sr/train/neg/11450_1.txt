I had to see an early preview of this film and I hope it will have time to sort it out how it can improve it before it comes out on August 3rd. It plays Andy Samberg from Saturdays Night Live as Hot Kim Rod. He plays a teenager in a small town that wants to be a stuntman like his late father. When we met him, he jumped on a moped on a moped truck, yes, moped, and almost succeeded. That would be a decent Jackass film if he was not really trying to do it. Isla Fisher plays a slightly older and much mature girl in the neighborhood, Denise. She seems to be pleased Rod to join her crew. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half-brother, Kevin, who documents the recordings of the camcorder. Sissi Spacek plays Rod's mom, Marie. She married again for Frank Povella, in the role of Ian McShane. Frank is a real guy who enjoys beating Roda in some real wolves. It is clear that Rod will not earn Franco's respect until he defeats him. We found that Frank needed $ 50,000. Heart transplantation, and Rod is determined to raise money just to "be able to beat his ass" when he cures, and prove himself to be a man. A long fall down the mountain side convinced Rod to 'go big' on one stunt. A rod moves to take money for seeds by charging for acrobatics that will make you stumble if you see them in real life. Like a human torch - in a child's birthday. There were those who managed to laugh at most of the acrobatics at the exhibition. Just when all hope and money are lost, a sponsor saves the day by getting 15 school buses that Rod wants to jump. He gets exclusive broadcasting rights and sets up phone lines for obtaining donations. The rod gets new clothes and a real motorcycle. The whole city is turning out and the world is on. Is he a real jump? Did she get a girlfriend? Do they raise $ 50k? Does Frank get a beating from Roda? Wait for this 90-minute movie to be released on the video to find out.
