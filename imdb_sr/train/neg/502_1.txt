This film is not only a very bad movie, with terrible actors - or the presumed actors - a boring direction and an unattractive story, but also a copy of exactly one of the great "gallium" "Torso", directed by Sergio Martine in 1973 (two years earlier) one of the most famous psycho-trillers of Italian film and cult film around the world. In "La Sanguinusa conduce la danza", the director replaces the bed scene between a black girl and a white girl, with an observer looking from the bedroom window. Of course, the scene in Rizon's film is funny and inferior to the softness and charm of Martin's film. To put another black girl, another white girl and another virtuoso reprizer on the scene is simply the most appropriate way to prove that Rizon's film has no idea, originality, taste and anything. I think such things are an insult to the viewer.
