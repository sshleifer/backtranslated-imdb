The dead body of a little girl was found without all possible identification methods. When it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other, it is assumed that this body is missing the daughter of the couple. After this trauma, the couple separates and the mother becomes dependent on tranquilizers and leads poor life. Everything changes when one day, many years later, he gets a phone call from his daughter! With the help of a former police officer and journalist, she moves to determine whether her daughter is alive. "Los Sin Nombre" is a mess that is changing, moving at a slow pace, and completely unheard. The conservative grace is Emma Vilarasa, who performs extraordinary work as a desperate mother. The best part of the movie is the end, but I'm not sure it's worthwhile to withstand the rest of the movie. Watch the English subtitles on a recent release of R1 - not exactly precise.
