The film has several stories that follow several different characters. Different stories do not feel like one complete piece that makes this comedy very incoherent and sometimes irritating to watch. It's much better to watch the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discoveri channel with Steve and Terry Irwin. It's more fun and more hilarious than this movie. I am sure that both the actors and the team had a lot of fun in filming this movie, but the film does not give us much satisfaction. For comedy, it's just not funny enough, and Steve and Terry Irvin are simply not good actors, even when they play alone! Their fools are simply not good enough to make the entire film around themselves and their scene feel long, disturbing and unnecessary, and sometimes embarrassing. that in a strange way, I was intriguing and hilarious to watch, and when I first heard about making a movie about a 'crocodile hunter', my first reaction was; brilliant! The film, however, hardly suffers from its bad story and unwary stories with uninteresting and uninteresting characters. The film has some fun value, at least enough to make this movie visible at least once, but nevertheless, I would not recommend this movie. Watching this movie felt like a waste of time. However, this movie could only be seen once, when it appears on TV, in the rainy afternoon. There are some good moments, but the stories really destroy the film and its potentials. 4/10
