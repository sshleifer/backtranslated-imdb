What could have been an interesting and emotionally charged character study was completely undermined by the predictable factor. Fox is fine as Nathaniel Aiers, Julliard's musician who dreams of playing with Valt Disney's orchestra until his attacks with schizophrenia bring him to the streets and eventually slip. In search of a good story to strengthen his career, reporter Steve Lopez {Robert "rehab" Dovnei} meets him and tells his story. Taking each element of the classic movie "how we hit the skaters" movies, borrowing very freely from "A Beautiful Mind", getting a false "feeling of good" staging of movies such as "Rocka" - choose the number of sequels - and scouring many 1930 style melodies everything left on the screen burned the scrap film. It is scratched, loose, completely predictable and played too often on our feelings. I hate to say it, but this is a movie that, if you say you hated it, people will give you a bad look. I really want to say something positive about this movie, but I really can not. The role is somewhat redeeming, but it is not enough to give her more than one star. Strictly made for TV films. It's not worth your time.
