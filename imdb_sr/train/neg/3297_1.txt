Why do we have to show that millions of people have watched and loved us as kids and made a complete joke? They wonder why Hollivood does not make money. Because they dumped garbage and paid huge amounts of money to the actors to be trash and asked us to pay $ 10 to see their garbage. TV show was what was, good people in bad situations where good guys went to the top. It was not Gone vith the Vind, but it was fun. This movie is trash! Hollywood can not come up with anything original, so they take something good and ruin it for some $$$$. I just hope this film makes 10k less than it costs. The only ones who are having fun with this shit are the guys who had to drive General Lee. The audience is a victim. Do not watch it, watch TV show reprise. They are still held 20 years later.
