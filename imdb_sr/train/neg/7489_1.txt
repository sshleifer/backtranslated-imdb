American films about war and Nazis simply can not be good. I can not refrain from becoming an idiot and following the agenda. All the Nazis are bad, crazy, too proud, and the Americans are so modest, but so capable and reasonable and human. Come on, stop this shit. The main figure says something like "this trial, we must make an aggressive war as a crime." Is America a peaceful nation with its world budget of $ 420 billion in "defense" (# 2 China with only $ 51b)? Was it simply spent without any ... ROI? Why show America as a peaceful nation when it is not? I deeply dislike movies on the agenda - they insert art into hell and try to convince us to believe in something. Hollywood should put a label on movies, as the publishers also have this "parental counseling" tag. On some movies we should have "shit", "propaganda counseling" or "politically correct advisory" label. This is one of them.
