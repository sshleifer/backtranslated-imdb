Nu Image, UFOs and others produce films for the SCI FI channel that come with budgets of around $ 2 million. Some of them have extensive effects, others have recognizable actors, and some and others - for $ 2 million. Mr. Hines originally claimed that this film is planned for $ 20 million, but it is painfully obvious that this is probably produced for $ 750,000, if not much less than that. Several sets are used, a large number of scenes are recorded against the green screen and most of the effects seem incomplete and amateurish. It's painful to watch. Not so much because it is poorly oriented, poorly executed and misguided, but because many of us are following the progress of this production for a long time and hope for this film despite a relatively modest budget. Those of us who believed in this movie when they were originally published joined the legions of those referred to by PT Barnum.
