This film also gets a score of 6/10 from me, as well as 9/10. Here's why: As a standard horror movie for a standard audience of horror, where action is taken, worse and worse, this movie will bother you. It's basically a family drama similar to the one you'd see on the Lifetime Channel, but put into the horror universe. The story and formula are ancient, retarded hundreds of times. If you are looking for some originality in the structure of action or minimal conflict, you will be disappointed. Take zombies and you will have something as melodramatic as a lovely mind, combing with cheese. This is 6/10. However, the basic synopsis and ideas are pretty original and over-the-top. It's literally something you and your friends would joke when you're half drunk. . . but that joke got a theater release. The idea gets 9/10 from me. The only reason he is not perfect is that they could take him even further, but they are not. The combination of both is mixed. I thought it was funny, but like most comedies, it was not so funny. My mother and sister were watching him with me, and the jokes we made about it were more funny than the jokes they had written. There were moments of complete genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom. I sincerely hope that other films will take over this kind of excessive risk and original ideas. I can not say that it was perfect, or even close, because of the lack of originality for the plot. GREEN family film. Great movie to watch with a bunch of guys (or girls). Great movie to watch with everyone. . . but if you look it alone, it will be a bit boring. Other people always make this movie fun and richer. 4/10
