This film failed unsuccessfully at every level. I have an idea, let's take everyone involved in this movie and send them to a hot zone in the Middle East. Maybe if we're lucky, everyone will be killed and we will not have to lose them again. Did I mention that I was never so bitter about the movie pile of shit in my life? My God, I can not remember anything I've ever seen that was so bad. I'd rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row than sit in the 10 minutes of this sad pronunciation for the film. If I ever meet someone who was involved in this movie, I'll spit in their face and then break them meaninglessly. These are my two cents.
