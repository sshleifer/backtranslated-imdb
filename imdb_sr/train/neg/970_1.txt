I'm not normally afraid of horror movies, but this film is an exception. some how this movie came into my mind !!! It's a very simple movie, but at the same time extremely effective, it has a great atmosphere and it leads to some shocking moments, the girl who comes down the hill is the real truth. Another sighted was a family photo I did not expect and I jumped out of my seat !!! I would recommend everyone to see this movie, with the lights will stay with you a long time !!!!!
