Greet Bollivood and Men Directors! This is really the ultimate limit in the complete sacrifice made by the Indian! View the current state of things in India where women become more villainy day by day and are very selective about their husbands - directors ... can also be called Uncle Scars (refer to the movie The King of the Lions) who came up with a very new concept of how women and women can live together after sharing everything among themselves ... including spermicides! Line story: A married couple - very happy - but accidentally an accident occurs and a woman has a spontaneous abortion - she lost the fetus along with the ability to become a mother! Now, in India, the laws usually reject the daughters if they do not give them the successor! So, the woman hits the master plan - a surrogate mother ... but the scientists interfered - "Safe artificial insemination" - DOES say that the artist (director actually) - "The neighborhood will find out that the daughter-in-law is infertile and go for a surrogate mother!" < Gosh, the same people who watch fashion TV day and night - watch girls between the ages of 14 to 40 ... panties - good neighbors suddenly took the lead in family planning and decision making !! So, the husband sends her husband to the beer bar in which girls dance on stage - all mostly uneducated and n Written - but men love such women because they can satisfy their ego very much! <br /> <br /> <br /> He hires a dancer in a tavern - he asks to wear his baby - in exchange for money - she agrees - she comes home - pregnant - wife and hold - both co-exist in the same house - in the meantime, the prostitute gets the taste of the household ife - so many caring people around him - they all miss and cry quietly! In the meantime, no one in the family knows that real real wives wander with a pillow under her podsuknja !! - The mother or other elderly people have never taken the examinations - nor have they tried to feel the baby's movement in the bowels !!
