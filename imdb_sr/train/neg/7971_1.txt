I'm not sure who wrote these brilliant reviews for this movie, but believe me STKINKS. I've seen hundreds of horror movies and jerks, and this LAME is only 80 minutes long and believe me it's all I can. The plot is terrible, the acting is even worse. And there is no development. Even David Cocteau's movies are better than this. RUN AVAI from JIGSAV. I expected that I would hate acting, which can be forgiven directly from video films, if the plot is good. It was not afraid, very little up, and really unattractive game. I looked at this with three other friends who I hope will continue to address me! disk through the window. I can not believe that anyone could give a good overview of this move.
