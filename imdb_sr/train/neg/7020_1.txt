Watching Smother may be the longest, not-so-90-minute of my life. There was no laughter; In fact, I do not remember being ever smashed. Diane Keaton was terribly infertile as a middle-aged dog watcher who smoked dogs, a textbook of a mother's textbook, an irresistibly irritating woman who apparently suffered from some type of personality disorder. She is manipulative, subdued, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic and worst of all, boring. I guess I should briefly mention other characters, but why bother? It was just a long series of movie clich√©s - a dip, a socially incapacitated distant cousin who was only trying to break into "Industry", a rude and long-lasting, but somehow still cute father, a treasured woman who can. Take it more (but in the end it moves away from the mismatch and resigns back home), the dog's dogs that are unconscious and who like to chew pillows while everyone is absent, etc. God, what a snort. I've never been a fan of Diane Keaton and Smother just reminded me why. Exaggeration is exaggerated, no matter how much you made the picture at its peak. Her attempts at physical comedy were particularly humiliating. What did the director think? Although I like Dak Shepard and even can sometimes tolerate Liv Tyler, their performances were so mute and boring that it was clear that none of the actors care about this movie. That was fine, because I was not even. Keaton's infinite self-satisfied twitching was unbearable, and sometimes Shepherd's repulsion seemed to be honest with her. By the end of the film, I wanted to squeeze it. Terrible.
