I give this movie 3 as it is worse than the cult movies that deserve the right 2. That makes no sense to you? Well, it does not have to. This is another vampire movie with a stupid complication, no, let me rephrase, an incredibly idiotic plot, where space cowboys (along with cowboy hats) fight against the vampire moron race. from this? The only good thing in this movie was Natassia Malthe, with her amazing Norwegian beauty. God, I want Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers to stop playing a stupid role in stupid movies! I mean, the SeaKuest Bar was good! I know Mr. Ironside from many films, he played 164 films on this date !! The truth is, he was rarely in the main role, but nevertheless!
