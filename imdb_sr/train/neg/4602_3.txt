Film without conscience. Drifter agrees to kill a mobster for money. Then they duplicate it. In the meantime, she falls in love with the dead man's wife and, without knowing that he is a murderer, she moves to her. Then he "accidentally" kills himself when he finds out. Then, in the walking kind of heroism, he turns to the mobs who have crossed him twice. The first problem is that, by agreeing to engage in homicide, the wandering loses any sense of sympathy, values, and heroism. We can not accept any kindness in it, and as a result, the rest does not have a moral center. We simply do not care about this type. And a woman (beautifully played at the reach of Kari Vuhrer - the sheriff at OSAM LEGGED FREAKS), a high-ranking maid who runs a homeless mission, similarly loses some degree of sympathy by jumping straight into bed with a homeless lady (despite her) apparently weakened after her husband's death ). And when he finds out he's a guy? what does she do? She locks him to her house (as if all the houses have locks that you can not open from inside) with her and keep hugging him. Stoo-pid. George Wendt is, however, great in the role of a powerful bandit. Director Stuart Gordon did much better with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
