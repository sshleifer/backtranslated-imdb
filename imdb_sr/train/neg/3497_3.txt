Unfortunately, for Sarah Silverman, this show is not a compliment at all. The character is not even remotely sympathetic and it's not a situation in which you think "so she loves" only "she is such an ab * tch." This character is just plain old self-righteous, evil, b * ts. Sarah seems to be struggling to carry this show because she is the only half funny in her. Mood, the dialogue is all so damn bored and dry as listening to your grandfather, go and go about the balls he has collected as a child. The program Sarah Silverman is so incredibly boring that I was thinking about changing the channel to watch the old repetition of married children that's funny because the characters are so "immoral" and "rude". I'm sorry, but I do not find a show full of dry humor and tearful wall stories about some angry, bitter, angry, bitter lives of the loser with her boring and helpless sister and gay friends who sound like Keanu Reeves with a cold anywhere near can not stand this The performance even though I generally think that Sarah Silverman "I love her is because she is such an ab * tch character" as in School Of Rock, and most of her stand up. bored with characters who think they are evil and talking and doing things for shock value eg. the constant of the pub, the diarrhea and the $ hit in general for the laughs.The Sarah Silverman program is trying to be funny and fails or need a song of laughter or better writers. Something has compared it to South Park, but it's not even close. Opinions about the program Sarah Silverman and will not become a boring troll meaning you will not see me and keep publishing things like "This show is bullshit" and "Why it has not been canceled yet". as a program by Sarah Silverman if you enjoy.
