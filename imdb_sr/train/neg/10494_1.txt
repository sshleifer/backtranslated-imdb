Steve Irwin, he's a hilarian. He does not even try to be funny and it's just, but his movie was not even what I would call a movie - I think when this guy on his car is trying to kill him, he just says: "Oh, this is one disgusting bloke!" and he looks right in the camera He put too much face in the camera And when a man crashes from a car, do not you expect him to be dead And Terri had the worst thing I've ever seen Like a crocodile nearly ate Steve, "Steve." She did not sound scared or anything, it was just "Steve." I do not think I like to sound like I think, but that would not be of worth watching. I love Steve Irwin, but the film was too stupid.
