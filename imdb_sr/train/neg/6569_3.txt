Mak had a V-8, Trace (the last and only hero) with a jet engine on the back of his car, allowing him to accidentally turn ridiculous faces while the rocket around half deserts the desert. Be amazed when Mad Mak 2 (aka The Road Varrior) is cut off and tied together as a new movie, although shot in a brilliant manner with bad actors and poor stunt work. Why is VoF set up in a post-apocalyptic desert? Simply, Road Varioor was! In fact, all questions can be answered: so it was in the Road Warrior! Apart from acting actors from the original 60-tim movie The Time Machine, which makes the comic appearance possible for the audience to be able to cook for a few minutes. In the typical case of the '80s, all vehicles led by bad boys who hit or were slightly crowded exploded in a huge explosion. It will inevitably happen that all car runs will happen near practical rocks, and cars will inevitably fall off. Together with the wild-ride of the 80's, it's a general misogyny in this style of cheap movie. I generally waited for Trace's rocket to accelerate and extinguish the flames, so that another shot would be scratched on the face as if it were to be tough, which is more exhausting when it looks constricted. A bad choreographed action combined with a bad acting makes this movie a real undercurrent. The unintended value of humor can even make it worse. Rats: Nights of terror from Brunei Matteo are superior. And it speaks for itself! By this number 2020, Tekas Gladiators is a film masterpiece compared to Vheels of Fire. A bad passenger warrior rejects that there are not enough cheese factors to make the movie visible. <br /> <br />
