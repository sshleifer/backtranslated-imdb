Man, I really wanted to like these performances. I'm starving for good television, and I applaud TNT to provide these "opportunities". But, unfortunately, I am in a minority, I guess, when it comes to Cinematic Stephen King. As the king's writing is brilliant, the irony is that it simply does not translate well on the screen, big or small. With few exceptions (very few), the King's experience can not be recorded with the same influence as the stories have. Many would disagree with that, but I am sure that in the heart of the heart they have to admit that the best recorded story of the king is only a pale memory of the one they read. The reason is simple. The average story of the King takes place in the minds of characters from the story. It gives us insight into their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes broken or unrealistic point of view. In short, King takes up reading places where you can not put a Panavision camera. As an audience watching the captured King, we are left with less than half of the information than the reader has access to. It is not too hard to claim that a person becomes a character in the story of the King they are reading, while one is limited to the small voyeurism of that same character when it is filmed. As long as the king writes, Hollivood will try to record everything that comes out of his word processing program, whether it needs it or not. I do not blame filmmakers for trying, but an unbelievable amount of talent and cautiousness is needed to get the adaptation of Stephen King to work. The task is similar to converting lead into gold, or to some strange Zen mastery. Oh, well, better luck next time.
