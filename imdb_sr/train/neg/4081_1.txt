This is not the worst movie I've ever seen about Peter Greenawi, but it's close. This embarrassment goes into even worse pillow. The films of this director I saw were poor. Like The Cook ..., regardless of the positive cinematic colors it shows, it's completely unused by the disgusting nature of its material and the overall presentation.
