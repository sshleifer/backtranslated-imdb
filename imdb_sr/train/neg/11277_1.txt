There is no doubt that this film has an impressive role, but unfortunately this does not help with the main defects of the film. I never understand why directors are asking actors / actors to use accents, not their own, when it's obvious to everyone that they can not believe it. Fiennes simply can not work Irish, and Fitzgerald is not much better in Russian. When a voice is wrong, no matter how good an actor is, the character will never be convincing. As for the main problem .... the land .... is there one? I suppose it was a kind of story, but there was so much hole that I could not wait for the film to end ... it was funny. Save 90 minutes of your life and do not watch this movie!
