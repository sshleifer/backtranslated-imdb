Stephen J. Cannell decided to expand his horizons a few years ago and get scared in horror. The result, "Dead Above Ground," is a terrible piece of garbage. Had I noticed his name in relation to this particular film, I would have returned it, but no, I did not have my glasses and that's why I missed him, damn it, I really have to bring with me while I'm shopping. The first question would be, who is this target audience for this? It's almost like a "scary" movie for kids, but there are also babies in toples and some worse and some bad words. The main characters are so cute that you want to see somebody, anyone, to go after them with some kind of agricultural appliances. It looks like a guy opens a bed and a breakfast that has a past, a witch who kills kids who have been collecting teeth there. Probably something that the real estate agent did not mention. Of course, now in the modern day, there are ghosts of little girls who warn a real living girl who now lives there that something bad will happen. There are, and there are also two Bubbas who were squatting on that property when the new owner took over, so they also revived. The whole thing has the feeling that something is made for cable food that is for witches at night, except, of course, things that are not suitable for young children, so not only is this central but confused. The big side and the squeals of Anchor Bai because of this, given their usual record with fine releases, this is a new low level. In the United Kingdom they get a set of Fantastic boxes, we get "The Tooth Fairies". It's hard to be fair. 1 out of 10, absolute trash.
