A group of friends face face to face with a family of disgusting cannibals while camping in a beautiful German village. The concept of a 'mutant Cannibal family' is as old as hills that are often called innumerable fads, so every director who tries to breathe new life into a genre needs to think something special damn to impress. With Barricade, Timo Rose is trying to provide a well-spent routine with the Teutonic Reversal, transplanting Black Forest action and giving her a low-budget German treatment. The result is a very bloody but totally non-genuine effort that is almost invisible due to some horrific directorial decisions, especially non-stop use of filter filters and irritating editing techniques. Had Timo Rose not decided to use every naff trick that his editing software offered him, then Barricade could have been a pretty fun up-fest: his inexperienced actor has pretty good results; Bloody effects are suitable for stomach buzzing; and there are one or two fears, and even some well-thought-out angry moments. All of this, however, was completely destroyed by the terrible work with the camera, the thrilling montage and the overflowing barrage of visual tricks that gave the film an upset view that is so unexplainably popular with today's filmmakers. I give Barricade 3 out of 10 purely for weird ups, which includes a wonderful scene in which a guy is forced to drink acid, a bunch of nasty wounds caused by various sharp instruments, and quite decent damage to the shotgun.
