Every new fall line deserves, at least, my policy "3 strikes and you're out". I gave comedy 3 the chance to smile, that is, 3 complete episodes. After episode 1, I actually told TV: "Canceled Tomorrow". It was so bad. Now I watched the first 4 episodes of "Cave People" and I still have not managed to smile. No titer, crowd, bang, in fact, no movement of the face. I will continue to punish myself by watching every future episode because I am convinced that something is missing in this show. I just do not "get it", but I believe that the comedy on the big TV network in the hitting period must be ridiculous; but no laughs from me IET. There is simply no way to find ABC in the funniest comedy of all time at 8:00 am. I know that there must be an inner joke that just does not live with my brain. I read each of the previous comments, "get" the social aspect of it, but, WHERE DO JOKES ???? I will continue to suffer at least 30 minutes a week until I get a moment of light and hit myself in the head shouting "Eureka".
