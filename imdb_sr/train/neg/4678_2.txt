This film had some andrenaline blows, but this is an old story that just could not have happened. The Navy protocols could never have been broken so much that the crew of a much smaller KSO could go so far against the captain. I'll take Dr. Strangelove every day if I want to see this plot. Sidenote - the US Navy did not support this film.
