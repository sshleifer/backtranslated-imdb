Here, I'm going with another movie B industry. It's sad enough to see some badly filmed movies, but I do not care if Industry B or Industry C produces a movie. Show some effort in your work. The characters are really bad. The act is not about this (surprise), but it's complicated. How closely linked a team can testify that two of their fellow soldiers slaughtered, and then continue as if nothing had happened. What was embarrassing to me was that the writer even threw the rest of the members on the scene joking about how nice the doctor's ass was. Give me a break.
