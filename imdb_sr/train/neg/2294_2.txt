Poor Paul Mercurio. After setting Scott Hastings in the Strictly Ballroom, the best film in history, he managed to find a lot of garbage. None of the characters in this movie are unbelievable, or even faint, but Mercury's leadership is the kind of person you prefer to ignore - totally ungrateful and he carries the AUTHORS. Big mistake in costume design, that.
