Linch. The man has some really great things! He knows how to disturb us, and then rewards us by thinking in different ways. This is, however, quite different. The Dumbland Award is a 1% absurd comedy, earned with 99% nonsense. Perhaps I laughed once, but somewhere around episode 4 I started to watch fast movement in advance. He did not miss anything. I felt relief when I finished, and that's part of the point in this series. It's a boring series of boring characters in boring situations, rounded off by boring animations, voices and sound. But recognizing this and his other absurd qualities still does not make Dumbland worth the effort.
