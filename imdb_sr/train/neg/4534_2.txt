The book on which this film is based has seriously changed my life. But, saying that this film is a disappointment, it's underestimating. Acting, directing, cinema and stories were terrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I told countless people about the book, but now I'll tell them everything that definitely should not see a movie! I did not expect the shop to keep track of the book, but left out too many of the key components of the book. The film tried, but failed, to deliver a powerful and inspirational message and only humiliated the central theme of the prophecy. As I put myself in a position that did not read the book, I saw the Celestine Prophecy as a bunch of false B.S. I'm totally disappointed with Redfield because of the way this film turned out.
