This is so incredibly bad. Bad actors. It can be said that they are really trying to get rid of shit, but we all know you can not. Writing is so obvious and easy, it's sad to see how they are trying to sell it. Humor and pacing are so hard, it's hard to believe that any of these good actors signed for this. It's so scary that it's hard for us to look far from the screen. We just need to know where this train is going. But that's just because we caught him on TV. If we really paid for this, we would be horrified. So it gets 2 stars because at least it's fun / fascinatingly bad. A random music (as opposed to a heavy indie soundtrack) reminiscent of the ridiculous episode of Scooby Doo ... but not so good.
