I agree with the majority, if not with all Tom's previous commentator (bighouseaz@iahoo.com). The Zatoichi series is an excellent character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement. I saw Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe that 14 was not released in Zone 1 (USA). Zatoichi Outlaw was disappointing. The story was complicated, and it seemed that there was a lot of previous lines from the Zatoichi series. At one point, I wondered if I had seen the remake of the previous film, Zatoichi. less about the nobility of the character of Zatoichi. All the previous films were made on the basis of story and action, and they won an excellent performance without the need for effects. Just hope that the remaining Zatoichi films do NOT follow the same trend. This is the first Zatoichi movie from his studio. I recommend all the previous Zatoichi movies - and I recommend them.
