The reviews I read for this movie were pretty decent, so I decided to look at it. LOŠA IDEJA! This is another movie about the spirit of revenge against friends in the group. The story is stupid, mix the two parts of the Ring with one part of Prom Night, sprinkle the Knuckle that you've been through the summer, and add the tiny dash of the Single Vhite Female - now mix until you're totally meaningless. There is nothing new in this plot, and again look at the clichés I so loved, this time it was not fun. This film jumps to and from the past too, and when I realized it all, I realized that it still does not make much sense. The characters pass from a healthy to a psycho-killer in a blink of an eye. Speaking of the characters, these are all your stereotypical favorites - a greedy self-defense lawyer, an egocentric actress, a baseball star, a video voyeur, a bitter girl, a spooky quiet girl, a pretty but beautiful girl, a fucking black cat ... and I did not care for one of them. Perhaps a better writer could do film work, there were some decent scenes, but in general this film was a mess. I should also mention a certain "video cassette" that would be unnecessary for recording. This movie is not the worst Asian horror you can offer away, but it's still pretty bad. If you just want to see some creepy pictures in the dark, or just want to laugh with some actors, or just want to yell "you're stupid!" on the screen, or just want another Asian horror to shake when someone asks you how much you have seen - this movie is for you. Those who look for decent land look elsewhere.
