Sergio Leone is in the grave ... If there is a movie that treads the life of a man, his is this one. The "lonely wolf" of the character on the main character is unkind and chrome, and the scenario was allegedly written by an eighth grade monkey. Whoever imagined this, it should be a horse. The only reason I spend time on it is that there is a minimum of 10 lines. The family of Sergia Leone should sue, not because it's bullshit, but because it is now certified as a shit from the MST 3000. Shame. Odd. Krivim Hollivood ... at least Gary Busei makes shit that will not offend anyone other than users of cocaine and weapons experts ... this film is blasphemy.
