The year 1934 was when the Shirley Temple played three great films and really started to make a name for itself. Unfortunately, the studies had to experiment to see what the public most liked about here. Two of these things were singing and dancing. The other was a short, interesting movie that kept people's attention and distracted them from Depression. You know the other keys of Shirley's successful films. This film did not achieve any of the above, despite the presence of Garry Cooper and Carole Lombard and despite a very good director in Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are too many parts that turn into annoying, and too many arguments between the lousy Lombard and Cooper. Above all, you have not got a normal ending that's good and what the public wants. I guess they learned after this movie.
