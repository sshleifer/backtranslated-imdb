I saw this film for two reasons - I love Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor people were forced to wear a pretty stupid movie. I liked the idea that Dracula is actually the reincarnation of Judas Iscariotsky, because it explains his contempt for all Christian things, but there were so many camps that this idea was not realized as much as it could be. I see this film more as a way for talented Gerard Butler to pay his debts before it is truly recognized and the way that legendary Christopher Plummer reminds the public (me and five other people who saw this film) that it still exists. In fact, I enjoyed special features on DVD more than the movie itself.
