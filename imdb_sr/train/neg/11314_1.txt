This film is probably the worst I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad scenario, all bad. It is interesting to compare it mainly with two other films in the same genre and at about the same time. Both Ciborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and look much more robust in the story and direction, yet Albert Piun, who directed these two! The story is not genuine. The world has become a terrible city, probably due to environmental catastrophe or nuclear war, and people live in medieval times. A special kind of robot (cyborg) lives from human blood and there is a story ... Cyborgs have to list many people to fill in "prophecy," and people need someone to stop them. One girl, along with a robot (Chris Kristofferson), built by the cyborg creator, has set a fate to save mankind. In this film, the director is trying with the participants of some stylish fighting scene in Hong Kong. Fly high and jump away. The movie is unsuccessfully canceled in this attempt. I recommend this film with only one reason why most people will get a new "worst movie". I recommend cyborgs to fans of the genre because I think that this is a very underrated movie with a fairly high fun factor. And if you can not take Van Damme then look at "Nemesis". I rated this film 1/10.
