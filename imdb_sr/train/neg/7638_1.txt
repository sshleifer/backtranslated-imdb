I could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the end. I can not comment on the story because I did not watch the entire movie and the reason why I could not watch it because of 'actors'. First, they mostly looked stiff and I'm sure their scripts were in the hands just outside the box - but that's less important. The main question I have with actors is not their fault ... it's the one who throws a movie! Come on, this film came out in 2003 ... I thought throwing people in the late twenties to play teenagers came out of fashion with a new wave ?! I can not watch a movie where one of the first lines, from an adult man older than me, "I am 17!" How can someone take it seriously? Do not become a victim of this movie, go for a walk for 90 minutes and you will get far more than this movie could ever have given.
