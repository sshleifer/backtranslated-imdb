I think this is probably one of the worst movies I've been watching for a long time. Trying to get 'the same characters' with different people is such a bad idea. If in this case they could not get Sara Michelle G. and Rian P., should only reduce their losses and tell them they retreated. Instead, they get new actors who are terrible in what they did. I seriously felt like I was in high school or in a (bad) college with a lever of acting that these people brought up. Where are some of these people getting? Was this their first film? It must have seemed like it was. This film is also parallel to the original in several lines of speech. I just finished watching the first one and opened # 2. I was excited to watch another and ended up as the worst show I've seen for a while. I hardly EVER * EVER * turned off the movie, but this definitely went after 30 - 40 minutes.
