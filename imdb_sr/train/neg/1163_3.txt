Moderately fragmented, yet unprovoked semi-realized character study, examining different personalities of two college students: a talented but undisciplined basketball star, and a smoker-female rosary. We never know why your young men are friends. They can share confusion around the world and their places in it, but they seem to have nothing in common. His directorial debut, Jack Nicholson - who also co-scripts with Jeremy Larner based on Larner's book - does not introduce us with characters with any clarity, nor does he shape scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen. There are some very decent performances (especially from newcomer Villa Taper in the central role), but most of the images are unformed (maybe deliberately), unclear or uncertain. Bruce Dern plays basketball coach, Karen Black is an elderly, married Tepper with whom she has an affair, and Michael Margotta Tepper's ordinary friend (in an improper, over-the-top performance). Nicholson fails to set up sequences with any specific taste, preferring (I suppose) to allow character interaction to dominate the tone of the film; His script also does not help, and as a result, it is unclear who we should sympathize with. Small, random moments work (the battle of the supermarket between Tepper and Black, Dern visiting Tepper in his dormitory, all the scenes placed on the ground), but the entire third act of the picture is a painful mess. Hoping to compare one important game of a b-ball with a sexual attack, Nicholson does not show style in his craft (nor does he earn points for chutzpah because his setting up these events is bad and ugly). When the director goes off the road to humiliate his actors, he must question his motives. Perhaps, if Drive, He Said ultimately made a powerful statement in the contract, the audience might forgive the filmmaker for his failures in judgment and taste. Unfortunately, the puzzling proximity is so stunning as the rest of the film. * 1/2 of ****
