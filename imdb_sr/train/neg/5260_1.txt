Normally, I have no problem with a movie or ending story that leaves you wondering if you can figure out what really happened, when done deliberately ... But this film really feels like it got all but the last 15 minutes done, then he realized that $ 5 left to finish ... I saw him at TBS ... I recommend that you do not spend money on him . If you catch him on TV, watch everything except for the last 15 minutes, then move away and make your end in the head. Really, the movie would be better if they just fled, and go back to the state police station just to find out that the city and the cemetery of the car disappeared, and in all likelihood it was never there ... < br /> "I would like to have more thumbs, so I could give this movie 4 inches below!"
