I thought that I read somewhere that this is the last production of a monogram, but whether it is true or not, it does not matter, because if it is not, it should have been. It's a deadly boring affair where John Carradine plays gray hair to appear as an older scientist experimenting with his young scientist Robert Shaine in returning the dead to life. Every time their subjects are revived, they seem to have a pale face like marble while lying on a lab table (big thing). Carradine manages to bring his faithful dog back to life after he is dead, and the jouche gets an unusual ability to walk through walls in a spiritual fashion (vooooooooohhhh). That's about everything she wrote. For ultra-cheap Monogram kuickie, this thing at least actually uses the Fans-Schmunk laboratory settings than it is usually assigned. The funniest joke in the movie is that the "older" Doctor Carradine constantly mentions his "young" assistant Shaine as "m'boja" when, in fact, Carradine is actually 40, and Shaine 45 years old when they did this!
