I accidentally liked the sho that grew up, along with millions of others. That's why I got involved in this movie, thinking if it's not good it may be at least a bit glaring and fun. Wrong! I just have to ask, at the end of this, is Charlie's Angels really so boring? Apparently I do not remember him like that. But this film, like a movie of this kind, may have little similarity to the excitement of that time period and performance. I saw it all in spite of the negatives, it was not inconceivable. But it was very treacherous, which I did not blame the performers, especially the women who played the angels, because they really looked like them. The movie was just not so interesting. He tried to make every angel "a figure." (An angel is feisty, one is "a good girl", one is that in her husband ....), all the characters are depicted with one main characteristic that defines them and a bit of depth above the stereotype. The excitement of the show was missing and the dialogue was ... a dialogue. That's pretty much. It is not terrible. Not the worst of TV movies. But impossible.
