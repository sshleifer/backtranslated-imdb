No plot, stupid acting, and pointless dick ... This should be a movie about horror? No fear, or uncertainty, just BOOM BANG GORE, then do it. Some marines are in the desert for some weird, souring reason, and they are chasing them mutated beasts from the first movie, which was good, and it should have been left on it. It's just another excuse for money and the use of meaningless violence, just like "All" extensions. They know, no matter how complicated the plot is, and the more worse they can add, people will see it. I miss good horror movies. Come on Hollywood, you can do much, much better.
