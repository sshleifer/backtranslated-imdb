I noticed that "Fire" was on the cable some evening and I began to watch it because I could not think of anything specific about it except that I remember it was a horrible movie when I saw it in '85. Twenty years later, the film is still terrible. In addition to the synthesizer, the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the 1980s, as seen in the title song. By listening to that poem, I again wanted to insert a screwdriver into my ears to end the sound misery inflicted on them. And in order to merge this musical attack, the character of Rob Love played a saxophone, and there was one scene in which he played solo, which continued as if it were Charlie Parker. All the characters were relentless, although I must say that they have done a great job of playing equally unpleasant actors to show them. In fact, I thought that Mare Vinningham was attractive, and I was initially feeling sorry for her character because she was wearing funny underwear, but then at the end of the film she decided that sex with the character of Rob Love who would probably vote most likely to convey a series of sexual illness if such a thing is voted.
