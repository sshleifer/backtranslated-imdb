You wonder why this picture was made at all: the action as such is completely incredible, if not funny, the characters (experienced lonely policeman against the young, rather fascinated) are pretty predictable, the ending is totally foggy and impossible to understand (maybe after a few reviews but for that you should have a masochistic tendency, the idea that you must read the book in order to fully understand what is being done) and that the act is bad. Has the basic idea shown that French filmmakers can do the same thing as Americans in a genre that includes "Seven" and "Silence of the Lamb"? If so, this is a complete failure. It was quite successful (and has a kind of cult status as the first French film of a serial killer) and it seems to be considered a good product for export. Weird.
