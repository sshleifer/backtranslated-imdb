The only part of this film was the price I paid. At least everything I lost was $ 3.00 and the time that went through this bomb. A crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat. When the female leader and the FBI went to the site of the alleged killers, Mr. FBI gave the women a revolver. When the alleged killer stepped out of the door, the revolver magically turned into an automatic. One is left to consider whether the FBP agent would hand over the civilian weapon? I do not think so. Ms. Xavier seems to be a very attractive woman. It's a shame that rating R does not allow much to see. It seems that the film editor has shortened what might be the best part of the film.
