LIVE LITTLE, LOVE LITTLE is one of Elvis's weirdest films. It happens slapstick, partly, partly superficial and partly weird. Elvis meets a very girlfriend without any pain with a boring voice. Looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story does not make much sense, as is the case with most of Elvis Presley's films, and there's a bunch of unusual characters. There is not much music in this, but what I like, though none of them is remembered. Strange continuity. Elvis and Michelle Carey go to her house on the beach at night, but a few minutes later the delivery boy comes in and it's stark dailight !! What?? That's the essence of the film. What?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks great and B) the dog steals the show.
