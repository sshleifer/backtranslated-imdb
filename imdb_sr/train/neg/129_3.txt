I am curious about actually two films in one half, this is the sexual experimental side of Lena, and the other half is her curiosity with political / socialism. Whatever the managerial intention, the two do not agree. The director should have stuck with Lena's romantic side and make a special film for politics. There is a bizarre blend of political / war rallies, Dr. King, serious political interviews, flipping of breasts and pubic hair. The film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie. In addition to interesting sex scenes, you will be bored to watch this movie. Unlike many other reviewers, I think naked / sexual scenes are overdone for what it is. If you want to see real pornography, I'm sure there are better choices. The omnipresent nudity is the main distraction of any plot. I think actors did a good job. They played their parts faithfully. There is little that I am used to watching American movies at the time.
