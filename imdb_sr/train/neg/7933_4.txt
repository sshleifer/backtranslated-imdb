I'm a great fan of Randolph Scott, but this movie is stupid. The whole thing has a canned, fake sound experience, with a really terrible projection on the back screen. He has a good idea of ​​the scenario that the scriptwriter successfully buried in a modest scenario, which prevents the audience from plunging into action and really worrying about any character. The director is a pedestrian, and only emphasizes how much the script is bad but to help her improve. I've already seen a lot of good soundstage productions before, but this is not one of them. All you need is to enjoy even more sketchy Scott / Boetticher movies. Randolph Scott is trampled, trimmed and shiny through a million dollars. It's always a pleasure ... even in the worst movies. Apart from Scott, the other main reason I wanted to watch this movie was because I enjoyed Miss Vimore in Erro Flin's movie, "Rocky Mountian." In the movie "The Man Behind the Gun", she is also pretty, and she can be said to be a good actress, but she was forced to say some pretty stupid lines, and the blockade given by the director was really terrible. I saw Fil Carey in the Operation Pacifik, and he plays the same figure here ... the arrogant pain in the head that you want to break into unconsciousness. I guess the good actor ... made me hate him. There are some lame attempts of a comic relief that only diminish the film, in my opinion. Although there are many elements for typing, I must say that I really enjoyed two Spanish songs that are sung in music numbers ... but that's not the reason why we are going to watch Randolph Scott's films, right? It is certain that somewhere there is another worse movie about Scott, and this is certainly not intolerable, but certainly can not be considered anything more than a central one.
