Let's say it in simple words, so even the creators of this movie can have the opportunity to understand: This is a very dumb movie with an even stupid scenario, chrome animation, and a story that is just as original as thumbtacks. Do not bother - unless you need to find a way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children. They may laugh, especially if they are not on medication. There is a particular type of insult in a movie that is ridiculous - not only do filmmakers obviously think that children are meaningless idiots who can entertain themselves with a tent that costs roughly zero efforts, but they do not even try to break the sweat, gag there and there An adult could be fun. This film, honestly, has distracted me from the hand. I'm ashamed of you as you went down so low.
