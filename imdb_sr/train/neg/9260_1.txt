The only connection that this film has with horror is that it is terribly inexplicable. I'd rather stab my finger with a rusty nail than I had to sit down again. Even for the TV film is flat. The head is boring. The scenario is exciting as a bowl of sand. As the two directors conspired to create such a film, nothing will remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th century. There is only one scene, even vaguely worthy inclusion in the franchise Omen, and it is recorded in a layout and shortened to the expected payoff. If you're tempted to see this, insert it, set the alarm for 90 minutes and be comfortable. With a little luck, you will quickly catch up and the alarm will wake you up when the worst is over. Namely, this film.
