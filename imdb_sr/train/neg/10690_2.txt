I guess it's possible that I've seen the movies above, but this is a real stink! The plot is incomparable, but it's not the worst. Directing is not even close to what you would expect from andi ching. he is capable of a good job, but he failed to pull this film together. Angie Harmon, playing female leadership as a reporter who is fighting for the murder of the president, has really killed the role. there was no chemistry with good, her holding was flat and wooden, and the fifth of the 5 inches that she wore during the film was absurd. this accordion trip puts it to the bottom of the list "b". And what did she think of Cuba? he was credited with numerous extraordinary performances, but this was far below what we expected of him. Poor James Voods and Burt Reinolds. Poor poor poor poor.
