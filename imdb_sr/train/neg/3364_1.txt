So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who are invited to come to this house and (not surprisingly) that guards always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason. Anyway, people laugh, jokes, etc. This doctor tells them a freaking story about this woman and children. They are scared, they start to feel things. Oh no, the ghost of the girl sees. Something more talk then this great spirit comes and so on. This girl finds out that this ghost has killed little children and has to free their souls, yes, blush. She does it, but, no, she dies as she does. And it goes to heaven as this evil spirit goes to hell. Two people survive and escape from home. The scenario is awesome because a man cut his head off and Elanor (the one dying to rescue children) says "oh no." The play is wooden, the effects are shit and the set is a couple of free rooms that are used over and over again. Basically, if you like to laugh about bad films, watch it, but if you're looking for fear then let's definitely miss this movie. I was extremely disappointed when I was watching this. Very high downhill. My sister (which is very easy to hear) is bored in this movie, which is terrible.
