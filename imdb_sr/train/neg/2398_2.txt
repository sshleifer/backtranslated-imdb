As a fan of films such as "Firefighting", "Where Is Poppy", "Avion" I saw it because it positively mentioned it in the context of real comedies and satire such as the one mentioned. Well, a wrong conclusion! Not only is this not funny, it's already angry because it's not bad in the shell, nice way, but in a very bad way. It's bad-bad. The script does not contain any ridiculous lines that are more on the go when you are trying to entertain the audience with humor. Adam Arkina speech impediment is probably the most unfortunate thing in this movie. However, this cruelty of nature does not prevent him from being complacent during the entire film and that it is difficult for him to look in the camera. This amateur without charisma fits nicely with constant mistakes in continuity and inexhaustible throughout the story - if you can find one. , who always refuses to call himself an actor. Well, I've seen several Leno movies and he's Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon. Kenneth Mars is good. In several lines he gave. I am very afraid of bad comedies, so I watched and asked for all quasi-jokes every five minutes. The film actually becomes a kind of comedy as soon as Alan Arkin takes control. - he literally: Starts 75 minutes in the movie in every scene. But that's too little, too late. When movies try to deceive you to believe that their lack of professionalism is the reason to love them because they have the right intentions that remind me of the students they have not prepared for the exam. In these cases, you must remain strict, and the rating must be 'F'. (But do not assume that I am a teacher. It is a profession with a reputation somewhere between politicians and child abusers). It's fun to watch and contains jokes to try "The Man With Screaming Brain" by Bruce Kembel. Or watch Sunshine / Core if you prefer the modern loud, shallow SciFi Schlock. They are just as funny, though inaccurate.
