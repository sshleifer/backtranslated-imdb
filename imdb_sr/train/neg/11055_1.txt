I just watched this movie in high definition on television. I am in wheelchairs because of a neuromuscular disorder and I like to watch a few films recorded on people with physical disabilities. First I found the main character of a little noble and stunning. His message on persons with disabilities and the time spent by him, fighting to ensure that persons with disabilities are recognized and integrated into the mainstream society in the labor market is large. And my problem is not with the right person who did these things. He was a great man. But this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message he preaches, which I considered offensive. First of all, they did not throw anyone into the mainstream with real physical disabilities. . They are sure that they were competent actors, but it seems totally untrue to preach about hiring disabled people and then actually do not hire them disabled for anything in the movie. Furthermore, the fact that on one scene in the middle of a movie, a man sees walking on the podium on the crates, it seems to have only one leg. But CGI in this scene is so obvious that it is shameful. What? Could not find current amputators for the film? For 5 seconds shooting, there were more financially healthy effects for CGI effects than just HIRE ACTUAL amputee? At that moment in the film I found him so fake and totally against the message he tried to convey to me that I came here to bitch and whine about it as if I were a pathetic goddess. Take It.
