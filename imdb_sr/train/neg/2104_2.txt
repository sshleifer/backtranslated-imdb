I bought this video in Valmart's $ 1 bin. I think I overpaid! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi made a long series of third-party films for small studies (in this case Monogram - those who shot most of Bois's films). While the misery of most of these films is not approaching the level of horror that his latest films have achieved (Ed Vood "classic" such as the Bride of the Monsters and Plan 9 from the universe), they are still bad films and should be avoided by all but the most stubborn admirers. I am an old film addict, so I tried this. In addition, some of these smaller films were actually quite good - just not this one. Lugosi is, what's more, a crazy scientist who wants to keep her pretty bizarre and violent woman through the serum. He invents from young bride. They never explained WHY it had to be a bride or why it must be a woman, or even what is his wife's illness - so you can see that the shop never sprayed at all. In any case, a really boring female reporter (Lois Lane type without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the corpses were STOLEN! So, she follows some tracks to the threshold of Lugosia. Lugoshi's home is complete with his crazy wife, assistant and two strange men who are obviously assistant sons (ugly humorous sexual villain and dwarf). Of course, this brave reporter is constantly repeating the film - apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! At the end of ALL maniacs die - mainly because of their own hands and everything is good. In the end, the journalist and doctor she just met decided to marry. And, of course, the stupid cameraman of the reporter is fainted when this happens. If you have not noticed, there is a lot of unconsciousness in this movie. Or, perhaps because it was such a slow and difficult movie, they just fell asleep!
