Do we really need more narcissistic garbage on the Babi Boomer generation? Technically, I am Boomer, though at a time when all the "idealistic young" of the sixties read Marx, ignoring their designs, and generally extending the war that destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in elementary school. But I remember them well, and nine out of ten are just stupid fools who would believe anything as long as it was destructive. grown up.
