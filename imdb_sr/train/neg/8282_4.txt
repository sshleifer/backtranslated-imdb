So far, you should have known about this movie, Jessica Simpson's "bomb", which mostly went directly to video (limited, anemic theater running). Basically, Mrs. Simpson Katie travels from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend, to surprise him, just to find him in bed with another woman. She is stranded, but she has one friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I want to see more often on the film), which allows her to stay. Katie eventually gets a job over two thoughtful associates (Penelope Ann Miller and Always Fun Andi Dick) who only use Katie to expel the president of the company (Larri Miller). This is a strictly b film, which should not be deep. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress, but she's pretty pretty and never boring. The film can be seen in that it is not abominable, but its softness. In comedy, Penny Marshall is funny (a subtle joke about Milwaukee made me funny), and there's a funny scene with Norwegian priests (do not read too much). So it's not terrible, but easy to skip. Your betting bet is that you watch it on TV if it ever does. Again, it's not good, but it's not a deep disaster.
