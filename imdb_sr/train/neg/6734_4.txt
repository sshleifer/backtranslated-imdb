I discovered that this film is a great idea that has not been delivered. They seem to have found a way to build uncertainty, but they could not pay off their payments well. In one case, the police are on guard to find the hideout of the kidnappers. They go painfully from dentist to dentist to respond to dental record. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) runs through the lift shaft. After all, the police arrive at the same time when it is freed, which is at least anti-climatic. There are also great scenes of narration that take us "within reason" to a terrified husband and wife, which diminishes uncertainty, and does not add. We are fully aware of their tension, and the voice is an insult and takes away the viewer from any chance of personal experience with fear, as Hitchcock has always proved to be far more effective. The biggest disappointment is to sit through the entire movie, and get a fast, rather endless ending. I'm just ... "ending up" in snoring.
