I went into this, hoping it would be "provoking" the little gem that he considered this. I love indi movies and I expected to dig this too. knowing what this hot button of this topic was, I was expecting to really have fun, maybe even see the perspective of an outsider. You will like this. Personally, I do not like the idea of ​​pee'd on or cutting myself, so I thought it was garbage. bad scenario, bad acting, bad story, bad directing, bad editing ... I could go on. I have no idea why the reviewer claimed that he or she made a political point by giving this film 10th what is wrong and unknown. voting for a movie on IMDb does not set a precedent! It just allows other people to think that the garbage bomb as it's okay to watch as long as it's controversial (this film is not, it's trying very hard but it does not work). You know that the movie is bad when you 15 minutes pray that all the main characters are terribly dying. unfortunately they die, but not in painful ways that give the viewer a certain justice or justification because he watched the 2 hours of the shit they just endured. Do yourself a favor, just do not bother. I got this movie in a cheap bin in my local video store for .50 and I feel like I've gotten out!
