I do not usually write reviews, but I can not understand why this is rated so high and I wanted to warn horror fans because I can only assume that all these high ratings were given by average TV viewers. I just watched the first two episodes, but the two were so cliché, that it was no longer funny either. the same old stories that you probably saw / read several times - live toys, evil things from other dimensions ... and it's not just that these stories are not innovative, but they are also pretty bad versions of those clichés. I'd rather, for example. "Chucki" and "quiet hill" over these two episodes at any time. and do not even ask about the visual effects ... they in the first episode are fine, but they're in the other ... horrible. It seems that the project of a student of the film was wrong. blood ... or worse ... erm ... nothing worthwhile. It could be interesting for a ten-year-old kid who probably has not yet seen / read so many scary stories (although I'd rather recommend "beyond belief" - now this is what I call a decent mysterious TV show). but for adult horror fans this is worthless. I gave only 3 points, because in fact there is some wonderful cinema (especially in the second episode) and some nice acting.
