"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is, simply put, the worst movie ever made, far easier than even an incompetent "Plan 9 from the Universe". Lampoon film is told in three segments, each of which is allegedly a gimmick of the conventional film genre, but each of them landed on our feet with a tormented blow. There is no rhyme or reason for these horrible vignettes, and there is no visible story. Another reviewer on this website has written that they are the only good points about the film of the naked scene. True, Miss Ganzel and Dusenberri flickered a bit of meat, and it's very nice. But the director does not seem to realize that even T & A needs a good story to surround it. There is none of this here. Probably the worst of these three segments is the last, featuring Robbie Benson and Richard Vidmark. Here, we see Benson as a young cop who is eager for a beaver and is paired with the cynical oldtimer that Vidmark plays. And for a moment, those of us who are still watching this disgusting movie exercise are encouraging the idea to see a story of redemption about how a young, idealistic policeman brings a purifying change in the approach of the old-fashioned police work. But no luck. As we have said, this film has no value for buying. It is disgusting until the final disappearance - which is, outbursted, extended longer than it should last on the screen. Obviously, filmmakers knew they had a bad thing, and they wanted to do it.
