It was great to see some of my favorite stars 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarre and Audrey Hepburn. They looked beautiful. But that was it. No signs or good lines are given to them. I did not even understand or did what the characters did. Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patti Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small parts. They showed some talent and it is sad that they did not continue to play in more and better movies. Unfortunately, I did not think that Dorothy Stratten had the opportunity to star in this only important film role. . I am a great fan of Peter Bogdanovic and I enjoyed in his latest film "Cat Meat" and all his early films from "Mete" to "Nickleodeon". So, it really surprised me that I barely managed to be watchful watching this. Ironically, this film is about a detective agency where detectives and clients are romantically connected. Five years later, Bogdanovic's ex-girlfriend, Cibil Shepherd, had a hit television series called "Moonlight" that stole from the story of a story from Bogdanovic. Of course, there was a big difference in the fact that the series rely on a tone of witty dialogue, while this is trying to do with slapstick and several screw lines. Conclusion: It's Not That Paper Moon "and only a very pale version of" Vhat's Up, Doc ".
