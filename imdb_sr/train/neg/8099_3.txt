It was a great book and the possibilities for a really big movie were definitely there. But casting decisions have completely destroyed the film. Hanks is a big player to be sure, but he lacks the salient, morally ambivalent characteristics required for the lead role. Jeff Daniels would be my choice. Putting Melanie Griffiths in, for reasons of candy, is understandable, but again, she did not show depth or ambivalence, so this needs to be done. /> This film is a great example of how any decisions, even those wounds in film production, can make or break a file.
