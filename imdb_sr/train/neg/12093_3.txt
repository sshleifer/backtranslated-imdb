Isabelle Huppert is a wonderful actor. The director of "La Pianiste" understands this, giving the viewer a long catch of Huppert's face, and it is a pleasure to see. Huppert is not an animated actor - he registers emotions with the slightest lift of eyebrows or flickering smile. Apart from enjoying watching an experienced actor who stands out in his profession, there's nothing this film that makes me recommend it. (Well, if you enjoy self-esteem, sado-masochism and bizarre behavior, "La Pianiste" could work for you. Apart from these attributes, I could not find any compensation in it.> In all this strange material there is a kernel of truth. People who compete at the highest level - music, athletic, whatever - begin as strange people, and compete with the competitive environment in unknown people. It's not worth the journey to the cinema to learn this life lesson. <Br /> < > <br />
