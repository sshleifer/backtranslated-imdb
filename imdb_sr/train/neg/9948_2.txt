Ice-T plays a homeless Afro-American who is hunted by rich hunters (Rutger Hauer, Gary Busei, Charles S. Dutton, F.Murrai Abraham, Villiam McNamara and John C. McGinlei). Prey then the usual targets in this funny and slow action that takes too long and sets the action and then completely destroys them.
