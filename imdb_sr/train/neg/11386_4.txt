One of those documentary films of gratitude to God. This story speaks of two warring factions in Colombia, guerrillas and paramilitary units and surrounding nations in Medellin. Boys, not older than 22 years, and not in the midst of war, are in prison. The girls ?? Not women, girls? he always reacts in the same way when one of them is killed, with tears and screaming. You scratch your head; What did they really expect? I do not know what is more disturbing: night shootings and civil unrest, or that everyone simply passively accept things as they are. Or, watching this guy drink what is obviously not his first beer, because that's all, 10? If you took any of these young men out of their situation and set them up somewhere where they had the chance to do more, be more, how much would you decide not to stay? This documentary, everything, I'm afraid.
