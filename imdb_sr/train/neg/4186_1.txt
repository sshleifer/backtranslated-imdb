My comment has nothing to do with political feelings in the film. In fact, they are quite consistent with mine. What gets me is the fact that, in terms of film, it is stupid and devoid of any similarity to a story, motive or dialogue. Perhaps one should say to Neal that replacing lyrics texts that do not inspire anyone beyond the declining audience is not the same as creating characters who are motivated to speak about events created by the writer or director. Stupid narration remains as such despite the iconic heritage of Neal Iounga. The most diverse scene is the one in which the devil dances his way into the bar, inserts a tonic hero who doubts nothing, then finds the way to the dance floor to pronounce the words Young Hero heroine, who is not aware of what to take. Somehow these two dream of a plan where they will go to the west coast looking for ????? I'm sorry, Neal, hanging around the music and leaving a movie on Steven Stills.
