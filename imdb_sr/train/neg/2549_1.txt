my friend bought a movie for 5 ?? (not even one cent worth) because they wrote it was American pie. but we'll soon find out there's a long way from the American pie to that shit. it's not even a comedy, it's really a really really bad documentary. Not only is the story bad, but also the picture and sound. They put alcohol, chickens, dwarfs and drunken teenagers. and the result is a disaster. If you see that this movie does not buy, you spend money on something else, and better. if you're going to get bored, then you do not call your friends unless you really hate and want to get rid of them.
