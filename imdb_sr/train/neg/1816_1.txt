This movie is really brilliant. It is flooded with banality to get shot at such speed that you do not see a good sense and a shared responsibility for humanity as it passes through the past. But that does not stop! This film hits the bottom of the boom so strongly that it reflects to the point of a comedy comedy: look like Kor Beergutted Conan vannabe with an excessive selection of hair on the neck that swings his sword like it does not have tomorrow (and the way I swung, I'm really amazed * tomorrow for Do not miss this movie, it's fantastic bumping through idiocy, and damn curse! And when you're done watching this, dry the tears of joy (or tears of frustration because of such an incompetent attempt to narrate) from your eyes because some stupid f00l gave the team $ 5 more people to make a sequel!
