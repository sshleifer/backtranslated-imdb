So I finally saw the movie "My Left Foot" last night after my mother told me how incredible she was ... The central performance of Dai-Levis is truly extraordinary and amazing, but anyone who is even minimal exposed to her other job should not expect nothing less. The fatal wrong assessment in my eyes was to become obsessed with proving the normality of this man; the film chose to show it as a complete and endless jerk. On the one hand, I see this as a logical correlation; Humanity always has the ability to be unacceptable, and disability should not hide it. I just want impartial observers not to forgive such unnatural behavior and assume that circumstances automatically make forgiveness. They do not know. The action is normal, and so, people with disabilities behave - but they do not do it because they are disabled; they do it because they are unreasonable. Physical damage does not allow you to squeal in public, just because someone you like is refusing to. There are certain things that do not work wisely, whether you are disabled or not. Giving someone a tacit approval to run football directly into your head, with the sole purpose of fitting is one of them. (However, once I saved the penalty from the school attacker with my face, but I already belonged at that time. It was not for acceptance.) Participation in the bar is another. Familiarizing yourself with the fact that your father just expanded your socializing after you showed yourself capable of jumping metaphorically through physical hoops, takes too much masochism. All these things are stupid, and the suffering through them as a way to show your courage does not make them less cunning. So, yes; just because you have overcome obstacles to reaching great things, do not make you less than an asshole ... Being a good man has a priority; setting up an inspirational example for people with disabilities should appear at the bottom of the list.
