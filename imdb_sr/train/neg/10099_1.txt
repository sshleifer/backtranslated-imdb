Thank God! I did not spend money by renting it, but I took it off! This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, f ***** g visual effects, unnecessary worse and naked! Far from other Zombie movies such as Night of the Dead Dead and others. There are many loops and bugs in the movie. Ok if you get the time after reading this comment, please see the Ulli Lommel profile. After I saw that I received an explanation of why this film is, I think every film directed by Ulla Lommel gets a score between 1 and 2. And now I'm not willing to look at the films he directed, but I can finish this by saying one powerful sentence. Even for fun or for passing time or even for an extremely bored state, do not watch this movie.
