I just watched the Going Overboard. I must say that we should send all copies of this film to Iraq and make them watch. I even tried to find a blind woman to watch this and she turned it off in 20 minutes. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this? Regarding writing, if that's what you want to call, the responsible ones should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell !! I believe that I read somewhere that the budget for this film was $ 10,000 and that they were below. Has Vallmart got a good deal on this? Each store has a huge huge bucket of this shit at the point of sale. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use a DVD as a coaster, or sell it to a friend, but then it may not be your friend anymore !!
