This movie should have been fun. Young Lea Thompson, young Joakuin Phoenik ... and Terry O'Kuinn. In space. But she did, she had rude characters and she did not have the target audience. Have children go to the space camp and accidentally launch them into their robot friend's space (named, conveniently, Jink). Spatial scenes are then long, repetitive (the same accident occurs twice) and was either poor or scary depending on your point of view. Adults will get bored and children will be scared, because the way it's captured really leaves a sullen feeling about it. There is romantic love, but unlike a shuttle - this never disappears. Why this is included in the first place is not clear, except perhaps to further increase the tension between the characters - but that did not work if it was an idea. Young Lea Thompson should be weird and attractive, right? I mean, "Back to the Future" is great. But no, it was irritating and average. It's not someone you would like to know, to have a friend, or to consider him as a model. Joakuin Phoenik? He's really happy he's ever re-appeared in the movies. Maybe he can act like Mikey in Animal Grain Advertisements, but he does not seem to know how to be a normal boy. It does not fit on the screen and I do not think we can identify with him at home. I would be more fortunate to never return to Earth. I do not recommend this film to anyone.
