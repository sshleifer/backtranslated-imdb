Start with the script. I saw cartoons with more depth than "envy". Whenever characters repeat what you have already seen, and for the first time it was not funny, the film is in deep trouble, and "envy" is certainly. A film that relies on a joke is better to have somewhere to go. Here we have a movie that absolutely does not go anywhere. Christopher Walken specifically wants to forget this bomb, because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller in some pretty good black comedies, "Flirting Vith Disaster", and "Duplek", come to mind immediately. Be sure that "Envy" is not a black comedy. There is no double meaning, only total stupidity. "Envy" deserves a low grade, because as the subject is, it stinks. - MERK
