I wish so badly that I give this piece of GARBAGE to zero, unfortunately, does not exist, so I had to give it 1 only to warn you that it's stupidly horrible this cheat of a famous cartoon! The characters look like they were attracted by preschoolers, no, wait, I saw that preschoolers do better! I prefer "Misadventures of Flapjack" for this awesome excuse for a cartoon! Probably say what others said, two words: RIP OFF !! You remember those episodes of Decker's lab when they were running a mapping down that volcano? Yes, Mr. Fellows even redeemed this idea and failed! They even ruined Shad's Lugi in that episode that parodied Pokemena! (He even cashed that franchise!) That character is a cheap robbery of Mandark from Dekter's lab! Mr. Fellows should be sued for the offense for this shit !! Everyone has his own opinion, but those who love Johnny (RIP-OFF) test, just lie to themselves. Do yourself a favor, change the channel when this disconnect attempts to embarrass your screen!
