I can not say that this movie really liked me. He has several fun moments, but he seems unable to decide whether it's a comedy or a drama. light in tone is drama, and fun moments are very small, and there is not much sense. It seems that things are not happening for no reason. And that's also extremely clever. as they went. If they only took some time to explain things, this might have been a better movie. I would say that the ending was anti-climatic, but that would mean that the rest of the film actually built on something that was not. It just ends, and that's it. I did not consider him boring, really, but as I said, there simply does not make sense. and weak 3/10
