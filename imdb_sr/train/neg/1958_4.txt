Where to start. This film began as something that seemed to be a "Darkness Falls" break. An old, mutilated woman living in the woods, giving children a gift for their teeth. Sounds familiar? Then it changes. In Darkness Falls, a tooth fairy killed you only if you saw her. The tooth fairy in this movie killed you no matter what. Why did they need a rocker, his girlfriend hippie or Bubba and their sister? I think the movie would be good without them. It seems that the producers sat down and decided they had to put additional people in the film just to have the tooth of the tooth have people to kill. Although, it's nice to see a pretty blond girl who is not portrayed as a change balloon. It's okay to rent, but I would not suggest buying it.
