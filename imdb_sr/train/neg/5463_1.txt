I've seen Arthur (TV series and books) many years ago and I never liked this show (if you're a fan of this cartoon, I'm sorry if I'm ruining it, but this is actually what I think. Many people liked it, but I did not. < (especially Arther and DV), they were often good to each other, but gradually tired of Arturo's sad attitude towards everyone and his sister DV (as the name was written) ), and the DV was an ADHD (or ADD) - as a 4-year-old Arthur's sister, who sometimes demanded (which is why Art hours got worried by what routines were her, such as her imaginary friend and her collection of stuffed animals, etc.), Arthur's friends behaved like teenagers, instead of being as in Arturo's books, and their parents, well, they were not Much care. The biggest cartoon was Rock's Modern Life, not Arthur (no offense).
