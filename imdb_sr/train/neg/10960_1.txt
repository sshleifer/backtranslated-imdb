Ouch! They do not come much worse than this horrible adaptation of the beloved novel C. S. Levis. Although the adaptation is very true to the novel, the acting is simply terrible and the sets and special effects are on the scale of an equivalent school performance. I have read that the budget for this miniseries is the most beautiful that the BBC has ever given at that time, but they could certainly collect more than $ 2 that it seems to have been filmed. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know that the computer effects at that time were not at the level that was necessary or even profitable, but the costume designer in the suit looked horrible. It's better to just cut the character from the movie than to do it! Avoid this at all costs.
