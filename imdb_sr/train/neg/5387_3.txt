At some point when it seemed to become interesting, it never arrived there. People go from one point to the second point, with really no point (if one was very boring). There was no action, tension or any kind of horror, and the characters were quite soulless, so there was no worry what happened to them. All together the movie was pretty boring. I give her 3/10. I like the fact that there was no trembling shooting of the camera, and if there were any music it did not irritate me as some really bad movies and the acting was not terrible.
