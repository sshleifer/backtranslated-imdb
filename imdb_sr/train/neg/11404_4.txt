It's a little fascinating that many reviewers consider me a masterpiece. I'm not good at quality films, and I agree that from a technical point of view, as well as to a few characters that are shown, a movie in a class that is worth rewarding. But it makes no sense (for me) that this film really goes anywhere; I mean, keep the viewer anywhere. It's a series of mood scenes, perhaps exquisite as such, but I want more than a movie. I'm looking for a story and a moving and fulfilling arrival, and I did not find anything in this movie. Yes, it can be considered poetry on the film. . . but there are many poetry with which I can not live for the same reason: that the image of the picture without leaving anywhere. Another thing to say is that it documents English childhood in the middle ages, which is necessarily limited in its universality. Personally I was amazed at what the young British boy had to live through, at that time and at that place. Growing up in America a decade earlier, I can authoritatively say that the contrast is huge. I can not wonder if this contrast had an effect on those who watched the film so favorably. In other words, is there a tendency for the film to be fully assessed on his "film magic" (which I admit to exist) and completely ignores its lack of relevance to the nature of its truly recurring experience?
