I'm not usually motivated to write reviews. But this film was so painful that I felt I had to. I grabbed on the stunningly predictable story, the lame actors, and laughed at the moments that had to be strained. Indeed, most audiences seemed pretty boring and chatting even in the "most forgotten" moment of the movie. Molly Ringvald emphasized as the only performance of any merit in tortured production. Not even a "twist" was in the end. I heard that the film is not taken seriously; but I found little evidence in the film. The cut should be left on the floor of the cutting room. Do yourself a favor and spend your time and money on something else!
