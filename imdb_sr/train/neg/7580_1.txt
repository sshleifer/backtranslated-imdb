This was a horrible movie. Basically, Jane March was a semi-Korean North Korean spy who sent Kim Jong Il to do something terrible to the US forces in South Korea. She becomes a servant of an American military family; everyone is considered Korean although she looks more white (I think she is an actress or 1/4 or 1/8 of Southeast Asia, and not Korean), and the teenager of the household begins to hate and end up with her. The way Korea and the US military are shown in Korea is completely crazy. Of course, the screenwriter and director were obviously white people who never spent a day in Korea before this film and did not intend to show any real insights into life in Korea, either for Koreans or for American GIs, and instead they just tried to fill it. their pathetic Asiafilm fantasy without any reference to a completely incredible movie. Anyone who has ever been to Korea will know this is a total waste. In the end, a North Korean girlfriend for killing a spy was killed, in an obvious way. Very bad movie with a sense of TV.
