I found Tremors 4: The Legend Begins, to be boring and boring. All the action scenes were stupid. The so-called "GRABOIDS" are reduced to the size of the cats of a modern house, if not less. this film was just an unnecessary movie in Tremor's saga, because even though the story of how graboids were formed, the story is so stupid and useless. Also, if you want to tell VAI story back in time, be sure to use SAME ACTOR (Michael Gross) to be somebody in the past, when someone is in the present in other Tremor movies. Heez ... If you have not seen this movie, do not waste your time. For Tremors, 1, 2, and 3, for a good time. This movie, however, make sure that you are away sitting just right with you with the STOP button to work for a quick retreat away from this nonsense.
