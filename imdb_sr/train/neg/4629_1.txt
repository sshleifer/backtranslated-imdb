Apparently made to show famous strippers from the 1950s Misti Aiers "acting" talents. Too bad it can not work. The boring little story of the sweet, innocent Salli Dovn (Aiers) is drugged and forced into white slavery (prostitution). Then he meets the cute Tommy Cole who is currently in love with her. She wants to help her escape, but can she? You really do not care. Here there is no real skin - Aiers only slowly lowers her underwear (twice). The rest is just a boring story of a bad act, a terrible "comedy" (she never thought prostitution was funny, but what do I know?) And a terrible dialogue after that. I admit that there was a turn in the end that I did not see coming, but that's not enough to expand. Ajerov's attempts to play are hysterical! A real bomb. Avoid.
