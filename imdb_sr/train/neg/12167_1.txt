Despite the continuation of a stronger original, this is a more comical remake on Friday, 13th, in connection with additional antiquities of the psycho Angela, killing more nubile teenagers for their "immorality" in the camp. Pamela Springsteen (Bruce's sister) looks great. There are some pretty funny sexual scenes with some pretty damn attractive girls, but the film is so (unintentional) comic, and not uncertain, it's a stinker. * From ****. > MPAA: Rated R for graphic violence and up, nudity, and for some sexuality, language and drug use.
