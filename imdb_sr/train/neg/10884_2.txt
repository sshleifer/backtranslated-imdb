In fact, these young people were so unlucky that I could not wait for everyone to slaughter them, which included Clarissa (Joanna Canton) because I considered him the most disadvantaged group. But I knew it would be a mess from the beginning when Christina's teenager opened fire on the priest and nuns with Leslie Gore music in the background. She had no way to go downstairs. Even the prosthetics looked fake and "blood" looked suspicious like Hawaiian drilling, although later on a red-and-white look it fitted stupid Halloween dresses all were dressed. I'm sure all the idiots of GOTH will appreciate this shit because they will like that crowd. I certainly did not like it. Blah ... And not even my favorite horror baby Adrienne Barbeau can not save this stupid horror movie. It still looks hot. I'm glad to take care of myself because today we do not see too much of her. However, this is a step from Dante Tomaselli's crooked HORROR (2002) in having a somewhat coherent plot, so I'll give him so much. That little Boston Terrier named Boozer also portrayed him. I like what Boozer makes Clarissa in the end. It was the only good scene in the otherwise silly movie. Lion's Gate Films was certainly desperate when they picked this up. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
