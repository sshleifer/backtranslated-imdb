Cannon removed the true visual beauty of a medieval epic that looks fascinating (except the dragon). Now, as a long-standing studio known for Chuck Norris movies has come to a complete lack of knowledge? Point: amateur acting and terrible plot is a sign that the revival of a medieval legend is not a cure for some bad execution. They actually went on and made another cheap exploiter with hundreds of lusty bimbos, only to make this look even better. For the two "brother brothers", they certainly know how to make strange sounds, but become brave warriors so strong and brave enough to save their native land. This is the biggest loss of potential I've seen from a "expensive" low-budget movie, and worse to get rid of the ax through a lavish press without grace. All this came after an advertising campaign that sold T-shirts based on BARBARIAN! The film itself is a great souvenir!
