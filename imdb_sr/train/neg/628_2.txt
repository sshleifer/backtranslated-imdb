This film had the potential to be a decent horror movie. The main hero was decent and I was very sorry and there was a decent amount of story. Still, everything else is shit. Director Emmanuel is quite incapable of filming films. Use some of the idiotic images ever. - A couple of random sequences of random images that are scattered through the film. I do not know if he tried to be deep, intelligent and poetic, but he did not. It was stupid. Random recordings of the trailer in which the main character lived, random objects, random pan recordings of buildings, the random cat going. VTF? And clouds. A lot of gloomy dark clouds. - He really liked this technique to have a scene cut to different shots, not just one continuous shot. EKS: Gui is trying to light up his weed and the circle around him. Instead of just one shot, he edits it in 10 different shots so it really is EDGI! and HIP! and SMART! Stupid. The acting is terrible, but that's what makes the movie so ridiculous. And the scarecrow is a gymnast, because it is constantly rotating and spinning. And some of the deaths could have been better. You expect the main bully to have a long-established death, but not. Simple corn in your ear. Love interest was hot. Voluptuous. That's why this movie gets 2.
