I just finished reading the book about Dillinger. This film was terribly inaccurate. It's like they got a list of names and they just did everything. His robberies and departures were well planned, all the way to the next - when the time had expired, they went away regardless of whether they had all the money or not. They had notes of each path, where to turn, etc. Purvis never saw him at the restaurant, he was told that Dillinger paid for his meal after Dillinger left. Purvis never even saw Dillinger before Dillinger was shot, only his photographs. The way his gang members died had been invented. Dillinger never robbed a bank, as he did in this movie. If I had never read the book, maybe I could enjoy the movie. The acting was a bit more at the top. The action was also exaggerated. On another thought, I doubt that I would enjoy much, even if I did not read the book.
