When I got this movie out of work, along with three more similar films ... I was watching with very low expectations. Now this film is not bad for itself. You get what you pay for. It's a story about love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. It's definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but it's not so bad for cheap excitement. I probably would never watch this movie again. In short, this is a movie you will see or very late at night at a local television station that just wants to take some time, or you will see it on Sunday afternoon on local television that is trying to take some time. Despite poor acting, clich√© lines, and sub-paramilitary work. I did not want to turn off the movie and pretend it never popped into my DVD payer. The story is made many times in many films. This one is not different, not better or worse. Just your average movie.
