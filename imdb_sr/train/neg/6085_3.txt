In this paranoia guided boat, our reporter hero fights against authorized authorities, bipolar associates, revoked UFOs and silent, hot aliens. (Although they are capable of controlling the mind and stopping objects from a distance, it takes three to control the control panel of about two dozen buttons.) The script shifts from event to event, leaving many riddles. Why are aliens blinded by a dog? Why do they bake airborne troops when they only patrol the empty landing site? And what kind of space guys are worth their monthly cheese first to kidnap an ugly photographer instead of his model? Seeking minds wanting to know! Screenwriter and director Mario Gariazzo apparently explored his topic by collecting a pile of tabloids on the UFO theme, as he took in the dual feature of Sunn Classics. (The final crawling of the screen can boast that it is based on real events ... just like "Plan 9!") Some may feel burned out of a sudden final, but they should still address the conspiracy work.
