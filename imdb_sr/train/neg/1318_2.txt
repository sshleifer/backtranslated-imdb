A sentimental school drama set up in Denmark in 1969, "We Will Overcome" offers a pathetic Danish attitude to American culture. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), obsessed with floral force, a naive thirteen-year-old, comes out with a half-ears hanging from the brutal masters of the Lindum-Svendsen (Bent Meyding) office. Lindum-Svendsen, school principal, portrayed as a fascist tyrant, controls the local community. Lindum-Svendsen went too far this time, and with his father, recovering from a mental breakdown (surely, there was not enough drama ..), and an excessively stereotypical hippie teacher of music Mr Svalea ('Hello, call me Freddie'), Frits is committed to justice. I will tell you what. It is so incalculable, excessively (methodically) acting, and so much misery, that as a "family" picture this grotesque filled with the clich√© pronunciation of the movie fails to convince convincingly to the non-Scandinavian audience. I'm sorry, kind Danish writers, to fall into our sentimental travels this way .. But this definitely is not a story about the 'boy becoming a man fighting the system'. The boy never becomes a man, but remains a naive, great look. If you name the church of a small, small town, led by a dictator like the caricature character of the "system," I'm sorry if I miss something. If you are on family photos, instead look at Happi Feet ..
