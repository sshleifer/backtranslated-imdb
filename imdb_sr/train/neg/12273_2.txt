PLAN B has the appearance of a fast-made, raw, untidy scenario for a movie with a trip attempt for involved actors - a trip that should have been thrown out from the start. It's just another "mafia-based comedy" that has nothing new and reduces the standard for those involved. Joe Maloney (Paul Sorvino) is a criminal boss who is more concerned about clothes and looks than about his job control. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is stupider than dirt and his ignorance should be fun. Maloni defeated one of his debtors (who accidentally married Fran - Diane Keaton), and Maloni took Fran as his assistant who would pay him the debt of a dead husband by being Maloni 'hit'. Fran fears his own shadow and is unable to perform Maloney's tasks, instead of choosing to transfer his "vhackees" to Florida to hide in his brother James's house until he realizes what's going on. This alternative to killing three candidates is called Plan B, Plan A is to kill them! The ending is completely predictable as each line is assigned to script characters. Diane Keaton has made many fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and comedians, but here she screams and twists and thrusts the way through a funny part that quickly becomes boring for watching. Paul Sorvino, well, Paul Sorvino was acting from other mafias movies. It is also permissible that players are supported on the balcony in the widest gravel, imaginative mode. What should be a comedy ends up being silly and exaggerated. Director Greg Iaitanes should return to the TV series: whether this short story is compressed into a half-hour concert may have had a chance. Builds Harp
