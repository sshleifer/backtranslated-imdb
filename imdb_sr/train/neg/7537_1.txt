And I thought the beach was bad, with the difference that this film has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Do not blame him for the horrible script, if anyone can think of what, to hell, the meaning of this movie, pat on the back. It's a cross between a village and a creepy letter. Its beginning begins to get you in the eye, and then, as it goes further into the plot, it just does not make sense, and do not start me around the end !!!! What was that? The only thing that makes this movie is Nicolas Cage's usual great humor, and his ability to be funny in strange situations. If you go to the hit, and this is the only movie you can watch, save yourself five dollars and just go back home and turn something into the fire and when some ask you why, just say the stupid thing that comes to your mind, and here you are!
