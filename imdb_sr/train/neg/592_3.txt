All logic goes directly from the window of the train in this British horror movie, set in the London Underworld and plays the generally trusted Run Lola Run, Franka plays Kate, a businesswoman on the way out of the party to meet her friends sleeping at the subway station , only to wake up and find that she was imprisoned and persecuted by "someone" or "something" with murder intentions. The plots and the incredibility are full and there are very few moments that are actually strained / intimidating, but plenty of it is simply boring. All in all, an unpleasant film that should always remain closed underground and do us all the service. > The only positive thing here is the inclusion in the acting scene by popular veteran actor Ken Campbell, who is better than this? it even includes "Erasmus Microman" !.
