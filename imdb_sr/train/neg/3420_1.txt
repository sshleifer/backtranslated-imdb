I saw this film for the first time on Saturday night around twelve o'clock. It's really the right time for this. I've never seen a movie that was actually predictable and full of stereotypes. If you want to see an exciting action movie, do not look at it because you can lose the will to live halfway. However, if you want a good laugh, please watch it! I even bought a collection of Chuck Norris 3DVD thanks to my pleasant Saturday afternoon. What particularly aroused me was that this scene, which would be expensive to make, was mapped out of the Discovera documentary or an old TV special on the US military. Besides, I was astounded by the fact that they did not invest even the slightest effort in making production. Afghanistan, as far as I can remember, is nowhere near the sea and with one click Deke escapes from a terrorist sandy castle with his jet-pack and is driven by a submarine (probably Discoveri). Later in the film, Deke throws an Islamic terrorist on the wall. On a slow-moving scene you can wonderfully see the long hair of a Korean stuntman in the air when it breaks into the wall. I have to love him. I recommend that you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer, but only then will you understand why I am crazy enough to spend 6.99 euros per box.
