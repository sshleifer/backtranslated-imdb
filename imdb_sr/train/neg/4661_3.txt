This film has Richard Prior, Rosei Grier and others. It is an interesting World War II film and serves as a statement of racism. It's worth watching to understand the fact that Movies reflect how we feel about issues when they are produced, not about the time they show. So this is a movie from the '70s, not a film from the' 40s (VV2). Nevertheless, there are some good action scenes of seven seven blacks headed by a white captain trying to catch Dam. The story is based on a captain who teaches that these people are soldiers, not just a service company. There is a scene that can be from a Civil War movie, not a World War II film that reflects what it is about. The black lieutenant gives German women an innocent pawn on the face, and the white captain gets upset. I enjoyed the film from the point of view of curiosity because the stars and genre were interesting to me.
