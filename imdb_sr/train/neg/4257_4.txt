"Dracula II: Ascension" is a story about a group of medical students who encounter the body of Dracula. When a mysterious alien appears and offers $ 30 million to students for body harvesting and stolen blood at auction, it's a bid they can barely repudiate. Soon students are tirelessly turning to a Vampire Killer from the Vatican! "Dracula II: The Ascension" is a bit funny horor film that has a lot of flaws. there are some good upscale effects like a really cool double scenes scene, but there is not enough violence for my affection. The film becomes fast boring and forgetful and there are absolutely no suspense. So if you like a modern vampire shift to give it a look. I like atmospheric vampire coolers from the 1960s and early 70s like "Lips of Blood," "The Brides of Dracula "or" Lemora: A Child's Tale of Supernatural "to mention just a few of 4 out of 10.
