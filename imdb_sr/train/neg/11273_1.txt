How can you collect this distinguished actor of young British actors and invent such a bunch of film manure? A terrible script, a disturbing busy camera, horribly arranged, terribly behaved badly. Only Rhis Ifans is trying to fulfill his role in life. Another painful proof that "differently" is sometimes the same as "dreck". Why money that people can not read before? Do yourself a favor: spare yourself and do something else - like hitting your hammer on your knees. It's less painful and funny than this movie!
