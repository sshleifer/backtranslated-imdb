All right, slasher movie. A very, very stupid slasher movie. We have your stereotypical teenagers in the house. We have a FBI agent who saw Dirty Harry too. "So, what is the secret ... the punks?" We have about 4 different cameras and a scene that makes no sense. "Hey, man, I fix the sprinklers" (this guy was my favorite part of the movie.) Suddenly, the preacher is bound on the couch watching home movies, killed. Follow the killer in the middle of nothing, no cops. She is suddenly in church, wearing a wedding dress. I swear this is the dumbest movie I've ever seen.
