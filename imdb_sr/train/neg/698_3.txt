An uninteresting addition to the nail cycle cycle that dominated the horror genre of the 1980s. This was filmed as Pranks, but released as The Dorm That Dripped Blood, which is apparently a theft of the 1970s horror anthology. The House That Dripped Blood. Daphne Zuniga is the only recognizable face in the acting team and it was her first horor film (appeared in The Initiation and The Fli II).
