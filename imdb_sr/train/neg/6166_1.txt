I do not recommend this film, because it is inaccurate and misleading, this story was to be in the territory of Algeria Berber, this was recorded in the southern Tunisian desert (a completely different culture, I know I am from Tunisia and Algeria), the second shocking element was the character of her aunt , speaks in a film with a very eloquent French, university academic French, while the character she plays should be disturbed and never left her mountain personality, so she lives as Bedouin with such kind of education in this context is impossible, the most disadvantageous and disrespect especially for people in the region is the "femme repudiee" segment that is the pure invention of the writer / director, such things will never happen in Algerian society ever !!!
