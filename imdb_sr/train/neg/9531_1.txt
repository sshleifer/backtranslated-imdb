This is a horrible movie. Two demented young women seduced and tortured a middle-aged man. There is not much that could be given in terms of pitch or "spoiler". I would just comment that the end is almost the most unusual part of the film. Most of the film includes Locke and Camp, who are unwillingly treading, all the time laughing mentally on the camera. Add to that soundful sound that repeats over and over again, including a vaudevillian song about "dear old daddy" that indicates the incestuous quality that the viewer never sees. Music is at first annoying, and then the viewer submits to the torture that is worse than the one shown on the screen. The theme is the youth that has flourished, understood as a reaction to the sixties, but done with little imagination or style. Avoid this!
