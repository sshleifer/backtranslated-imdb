After the debacle of the first Sleepavai camp, who thought that a franchise could be born. SC II is superior in view. More inspired murders and much more fun. Although it may not say much (compared to the first film), Sleepavai Camp II is worth paying for. Disadvantages: Crappi's acting and shoes are abundant. Bottom line: 5/10 <br /> <br />
