While some performances were good - Victoria Rovell, Adrienne Barbeau, and two Italian friends came to mind - the story was crap and derived, the emphasis on the racial background of the girl was best treated awkwardly, and relatives are mostly portrayed as stereotypes, not like real people. I found myself struggling uncomfortably in many moments that should have been ridiculous. I can hardly understand why the local paper in SF said it was a good movie, and to wonder who posted a glittery preview here on the IMDb. Very disappointed in this film, and I crazy I actually went to the theater to see it, based on an incorrect relationship with Garden State, which is far more silly, more inventive and more touching than this. In particular, I must mention the emotional peak in the church, which was so woody and the number that I almost left, and some in the audience are really DID. After that, there was a stupid culmination at the cemetery, which I saw 10 minutes before it happened. I really do not like being fooled into wasting my money so useless.
