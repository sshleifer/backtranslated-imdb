After reading a lot of criticisms, I do not know what kind of film some people were watching, but it was obviously not the same one that I saw. This film is horrible. Acting, first of all Moore, is terrible. A woman can not work. Nice tits, but she just can not play. At no point she did not find the real character. Instead, it was a spoiled Hollywood actress going to the beach to play with fantasies. And that's what this movie ultimately is - Hollywood imagination. Training sequences are above the top. Politics - across the top. Political correctness - over the top. Battle scenes - you guess, at the top. Your mission is to enter and exit without revealing. So what are you doing? Why shoot as many circles as possible and do as much noise as possible, of course. Oh G.I. Jane, you can be my man at any time. The premise is good, but as soon as Hollivood comes to pass, we'll end up with the Top Gun with boobs. What more can be expected of Commercial American Movies? Not much.
