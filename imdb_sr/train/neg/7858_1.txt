I appreciate the need to hire unknowns for these types of 'horror' movies, but they should at least hire some real actors. The sergeant is especially guilty of using the monotone bulldozer for every line he has. But let's face it, the lines are not very important. There is no really recognizable action, so most of the writing includes words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** and other bad sides instead of the correct dialog. The story, like it, is mostly composed of seemingly random murders and deaths, with a pair of defiant surprises, which take place about 10 minutes after you see exactly what will happen. Not only that, there are already some enchanting cavities and mistakes in continuity (why do they go there? Did not have a gun? Is not he dead?), So it seems that the whole movie seemed to be reduced in a few hours that would have been necessary to repair them. Another movie that simply relies on blood and blood instead of any real movie experience.
