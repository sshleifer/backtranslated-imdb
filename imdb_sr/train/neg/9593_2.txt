Judging by some comments in IMDB, I expected an action movie - perhaps dramatic or stupid or simple or comical, but essentially an action movie. If I watched, he certainly did not feel like a movie. The story is simple and clear (although the prolog attempts to look complicated). Take three interest groups: 1) government 2) rebels 3) killer group. Now take the first one (they never appear in the movie). Then just one of the killers, the princess, becomes an outlaw on the vengeance. Add to the rebellious love-interest with the wrong conscience. And you have ingredients. But they still have not managed to turn it into a story or a movie. Between some random action sequences and some unusual visions that try to be Sci-Fi at a low budget, what you have left is the feeling of emptiness. The film does not feel like a movie, it's a weird, boring, boring dream. Avoid. 2/10
