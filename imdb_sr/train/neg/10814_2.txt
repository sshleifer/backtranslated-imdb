As a fan of "Jane Eire" I was excited when this film came out. "Finally," I thought, "someone will make this book in the film, following the story the author wrote." Vrong !!! If the casting director intends to throw "Jane", which was clear, he certainly succeeded. However, he certainly could have found one who could work. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the gloomy uncertainty of the novel when a laugh broke into the night seemingly out of nowhere? Where is the spark of a child who flirted and danced like her mother? Finally, why was the store changed? You wonder if the scriptwriters actually read the book. What a disappointment
