I saw it in the theater when it came out, and yesterday I saw it again on the cable. This I managed to get to know myself again how much this movie is disgusting. A whole lot of characters are self-absorbed narcissistic pre-men. Worst of all, this intensifies any negative stereotype of dating of 20 years, even when it comes to celebrating people who "find". The nice guys end up last, the nasty guys look great, the worst guys are doing the best. Girls are all children's toys. It is apparent that only one character ("Wendy") makes something useful to society, and it liberates its long-saved innocence on a night stick, in a crazy scene that we need to think is romantic. What this is actually is the Hollywood concept of a young America: permissive, separate, promiscuous, thoughtful.
