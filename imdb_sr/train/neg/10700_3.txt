The film is about Sir Christopher Strong (member of the Parliament - played by Colin Clive) and his affair with a figure similar to Amelia Earhart, starring Katherine Hepburn. Until they met, he was a very devoted husband, but when he met the strange but fascinating Hepburn, "he could not help you" and fell in love. It can be said, because they look a lot in space and endlessly talk about how painful their unrequited love is. Frankly, this is a terribly obsolete and virtually impossible film to watch. Part of the problem is that in pre-code days, films of glamorous adultery were very common. In addition, even if you accept this morally suspicious theme, the complete sobriety of the dialogue sounds like a romantic novel from the 19th century ... and really bad. Sticky and difficult-to-figure characters (after all, Clive's wife is a beautiful lady and no one bothered) make this big time loss. The only interesting aspect of this movie is the costume that Hepburn wears in the early scene where she is dressed in moth's costumes! You have to see it in order to believe in it - and it looks like one of Bugaloos (an unclear but appropriate reference).
