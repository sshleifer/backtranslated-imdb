This film should be called "Plan 9 by Joseph Smith". I think his strangeness is underestimated. It seems that the playwright read Paul Ehrlich's "Population Bomb (1968)" and made a musical response specially made for mormons. The whole point of the play is that there are so many children as you can be part of the plan of the "heavenly Father" (divine). and everything that stands in the way of having more babies is very bad. This version was shot in 1989, which is confusing. it's utah, so it looks and feels like 1983, the play was actually written in 1973, and of course theology is part of the 1840s, part of the batlestar galactica. some of the actions take place on the ground, and some in "pre-existence, a homeless romantic room where unpleasant children are waiting to reach their bodies to come down and try not to slam the door of the missionaries, losing a bullet in heavenly glory." /> It's as constant as it comes, but do not let poor poor theatricality spoil your gratitude for this disturbed Mormon universe where all 'cool kids' are in control of the population, (possibly) counseling that their parents do not have more children to have large families at the time of writing p the cultural norms in the LDS community, and, more importantly, are considered part of God's plan. Since then, the Church has made 180, and family planning is a choice of parents, and large families are now much less of a cultural norm, making the entire doctrinal premise of the film modern Mormon conflict! ahhh but it's really just like music, there are some appealing melodies that simply do not allow this film to die in the 1970s death for which it was predestined. brother and sister sing some love songs to each other to ask themselves if something else is happening - the mice. And heavy, cool kids make new kids on the block look like a metal. so toast to all this! bring together the family around, make some jell-shooters and enjoy the show! <br /> <br />
