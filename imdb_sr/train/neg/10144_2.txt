Like Steven Segal in the movies, this is the bottom of the barrel. His best was just food for teenagers. This bends the scale, then falls. All the characters are cardboard. The story is double. I can not spoil it by telling you the end. You already know how all Steven Segala movies end up if you've seen them. Here goes. He is a government agent who knows too much to be free to decide, instead of killing him, to touch his brain until he recalls the squad. He escaped, of course, arrested and is found with his old general, who needs his one man in a million years experience in order to recover the secret plane surrendered to a terrorist gang in Afghanistan by a pilot pilot of the Air Force, which, surprisingly, was a surprise, Segal trained. All heroes, except Segal's character and his gloomy girl, are dying heroically, and Steve-Babi saves the whole world with one stroke or fall. Whatever. Made with some surplus Air Force and Navi flying movie. And a lot of boom booms. Instead, take some Popeie cartoons.
