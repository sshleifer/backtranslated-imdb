This sarcastic, homophobic thing was dated in 1976. It seems that this is now particularly sordid, filled with gai stereotypes, and characters to be laughing, and not them. Redd Fokk runs his standard school, Michael Varren at least tries to bring mankind to one-dimensional character, and Pearl-Pearl what did you think about ...? Pearl Bailei deserves much better.
