Satire in Monika Mitchell's film has a laugh and violence. I would not say blood soaked; but there are insults and injuries. Mak Matteo (John Cassini) is an actor in a character who has an unusually flexible presence on the screen, but he has a terrific trail to be selected for those parts he follows. There is always a producer's nephew or seemingly trivial reason not to get the role he seeks. Well, the best thing to do is get rid of competition ... Mak becomes obsessed with such thoughts. An award-winning career is just momentum, pushing and shooting. Other members of the band include Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and cameos, Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, it's a show business ... or is it?
