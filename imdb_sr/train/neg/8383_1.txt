... Ever. This is the bottom. I'm not kidding. The theater should have a warning. "Leave all the hopes you enter here" would be appropriate. I do not have the words to accurately describe the hell that is this movie. His stupid stupidity is not even fun. This film is definitely focused on some slower turtles in sandbox. The story was attacked stolen from the "Bugs Bunni" caricature for 10 minutes, and then spread like Mr. Fantastik in 90 painful, painful minutes. I assume that Hollywood's pressures to produce productive products are blamed for any occurring at a constant rate. I'm sad and offended that they think we're stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of a ballroom ball with a thin parcel based on a cartoon film. I did not like almost everything about this movie. I will not spoil anything, but the baby is actually a dwarf with the face of Marlon Vajans who is slightly overwhelmed over the body of the dwarf. What I loved was the end. Not the film's resolution, but the real end to which we all stood up and walked out. I gave this movie one star, but obviously deserves less. I do not feel that the six minutes spent in writing the script are worth the stars. This deserves Razzie and I pray to God to receive it. When people will learn; If you stop paying for seeing that idiom, he will stop drinking it. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film. Avoid it at all costs. You are warned.
