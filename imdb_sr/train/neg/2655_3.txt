** 1/2 for this farce Diane Keaton. Someone should say to Ms. Keaton, enough with your philosophy and hats Annie Hall. Keaton's daughter, Sara, dies in a car accident while her boyfriend survives. phone jack, grieving in a new way for grievers. It reaches to a summer location where all Sara's friends stay. She cleans the house, sleeps for two days, and then begins to discover things that it is better not to discover. Looks like a sweet Sara was sleeping with her girlfriend and the guy who finally got married. In addition, she abated by this type. Now we are all on this guilty journey. Her only hope is to find the insensitive diary Sara kept. He also hopes that the boy, Adam, who is a dramatist, will not include all this in another show. When the log is found, it is written in Japanese. Sara had a doctorate in this language. It's not great news for Mom when a part of the diary was translated by a Japanese chef in a Japanese restaurant. Naturally, everything seems to be in the end nicely interconnected. The title of this schmalta comes from the Wizard of Oz. Every time Mom and Sara spoke, they would say they surrender to Dorothy. As if this was not enough, during this bizarre extravagance of mourning, Keaton told Adam not to be the second Voody Allen in his film, Interiors, where he tried to imitate Ingmar Bergman successfully. Ms. Keaton also tries to take drugs with the group. Come on, people, can we realistically believe that somebody in a healthy mind could mourn this way? Fair and central best compresses this movie.
