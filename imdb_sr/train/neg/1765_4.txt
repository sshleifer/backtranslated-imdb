OK - the recordings of the helicopter are fantastic, and the director has made good use of some of Barcelona's best attractions. Otherwise ... the production value was blown up in the first few minutes, and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was charming and fun to watch, Abel Folk had the greatest depth and was very effective, and Villiam Baldwin was ... well, Villiam Baldwin. He had to train his martial arts to be well-used and to be a figurine with action on jumps. The rest of the head was at best wooden, but mainly paper. So - if you are nostalgic to Spain - it's a postcard with an action turn and a healthy dose of El Greco. If not, skip.
