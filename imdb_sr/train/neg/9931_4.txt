The "black angel" is insignificant, with June Vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from an electric chair after being found guilty of the murder of an old acquaintance. Dan Durie (husband of a murdered woman) decides to help Vincent find the right culprit. Peter Lorre has a blatant role as a suspect. This film noir looks and plays as a cheap programmer and never achieves anything special. It is pleasant enough, but then, at some point, it ceases to make sense and the mystery solution causes one of those big "give me breaks" reactions. The finale itself could completely immerse the film, but not even what precedes the conclusion is not very good. Vincent is a poor hero and Duria has never been good at playing good guys. I love film noir, but this was a real disappointment.
