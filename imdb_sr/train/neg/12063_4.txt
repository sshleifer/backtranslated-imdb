The team of husband and wife Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were huge stars in the lead, but they made very few films. As is the case with some other artists of their age (George M. Koan, Fannie Brice, Gertrude Lavrence), the most accessible film footage for Fields and Seeley is a biography about them, featuring other actors: 'Somebody Loves Me', in the main role with Betty Hutton and that unrepeatable song and dancer Ralph Meeker. - Jesse Block and Eva Sully - have achieved almost the same glory that performed almost identical act, becoming the "other team" Fields and Seelei. However, there was a big difference in the way of life on the stage. Filds and Silly lived in hotel suites, paid the prices of services for every meal they ate, and in the end their money went out. Block and Sully lived modestly and wisely invested their wages, ending in a comfortable retirement. The first 30 seconds of this short vitamine are taken by two sleeping pianists. Obviously these two men in 1930 had something of their own name, although I never heard of them. Finally, Fields and Seeli are entering and starting to perform. They both have a lot of peppers, and it's pretty attractive. I was upset that both performers keep moving as if they are getting ready to dance, but they never do it until the third. of the three songs performed in this short text. When they finally start digging, the results are not impressive. I was thrilled to have had the opportunity to see these two main performers doing their venture. Now that I've seen it, I understand why they have never become stars in movie musicals. My rating for this: only 4 out of 10, and I'll stick to Block and Sully.
