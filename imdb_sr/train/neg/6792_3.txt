Here's a movie with good acting and a nice look, but it's just not there. Director Richard Brooks had to be a little tired at this stage of the game; How Much Was His PROFESSIONAL! The horses and the rest of the action appeared to be in a slow motion even during non-slowed scenes. This film should have been accelerated, if nothing else. This horse surely looked terribly fake and obvious traces of tires at those moments of desert tracking - just lazy. messy job. A pity. The actors were fine, but I certainly saw everything better. Ben Johnson is always happy. I first saw this film for almost 30 years; then he was disappointed and stayed in second place 30 years later.
