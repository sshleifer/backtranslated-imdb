The brain (or head) that would not die is one of the more imaginative budget films of the early 1960s. It is very difficult to imagine how a reputable sexist script could have been written without the intention of self-parody. And the themes that are repeatedly expressed by the female leader, Ginni Leith - a separated head held on machines, I-Vs and clips - as if to confirm that the film should simultaneously exploit and criticize gender stereotypes. Shades of underrated boxing Helena. Gnisms are abundant, and just as irritating as an army of angry ants. The dialogue is hyperbolic, over-dramatic and incredible, and the acting is just fine (but not consistent). Why did I give this film 4? Because some thoughts have clearly entered into it. I'm really not sure at what point the film was really trying to make, but it seems clear that it tends to be an unusually sharp and harsh horror (without the blood and bowels of today's audience). Another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that in this movie there really are no heroes, and none of the characters is particularly nice. Everyone took into account that this is a rather painful and disturbing look at the early American pop sexuality of the 1960s, from the standpoint of a woman who remained alive despite losing her body after what she was supposed to be a fatal car accident. Her lover is threatening to sew a fresh, high-quality body on her and forced her to live with him. It is understandable that all this is unbridled and forced to be friends with a creature that is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend. Oh, there are some vague references to the clich√©s of the 1950s / 60s about the evil of scientific diversity. It is recommended for students B sci fi and postgraduates in gender studies. O / v is not recommended.
