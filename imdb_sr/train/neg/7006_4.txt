Mark Hamill should have been feeling very confused with CORVETTE SUMMER! This time, he uses a new kind of "force" to regain the possession of his dream machine, the bright red Vette. It looks as if another acid teen gets up the first half an hour and turns in the wrong direction. Writing and directing work is terribly done, with a few scenes that you can barely take. You expect it to happen anyway, and you also sniff the scent of the late 70's. Only a former novice like Annie Potts would steal a shov and save this poor creeps movie! Her impractical, but wonderful personality retains your interest in the good, and this is the best opportunity to see her in a bathing suit. An hour for Annie! Sorry, Mark! I suppose the Force was not with you this time.
