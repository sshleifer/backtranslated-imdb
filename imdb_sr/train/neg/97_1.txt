I have not seen many low-budget movies that I have to admit, but this is the worst movie ever likely, the main character an old man was talking about, lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, the year might work better. The story had the most terrible story, and the soldier put what he thought was an army, and then he just went over the top, I just watched him laugh at how bad it was, and hoped that this led to a real movie . . I can not believe that it was within a rent for 2 nights on blockbusters, instead of taking it for free and not being at your fingertips. I think there was a half-decent actor besides a woman, I think the only thing in the line with the budget was make-up, but they show every important scene in the movie at the beginning of the musical bit. Terribly simply terrible.
