The beautiful Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who dies after the iceberg broke down before she was "I am" with the bridegroom Henry (Paul Rudd). Two years later, Henry did not go any further and his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) was very worried. Chloe organizes that Henry talks to an attractive psychologist Ashlei (Lake Bell). Ashley will contact Keith's spirit in the hope of helping Henry continue her life. When the psychopath begins to attract Henry, Kate's spirit seems to quench the romance in the root. There are some funny situations; but if you saw commercials, you saw the essence of the movie. Also in the acting: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, Villiam Morgan Sheppard and Wendy McLendon-Covei. Personally, I thought Bell stole Parker's show. And Biggs as well as common aches in the ass. This film was still too big.
