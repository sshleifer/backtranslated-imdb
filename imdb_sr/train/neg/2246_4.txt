I never saw the original version of 1954 with Judy Garland, so I have no means to compare. Also, it's been a few years, but I have not found this story, it's neither attractive nor romantic. The film tells the story of two lovers whose musical career is moving in opposite directions. John Norman Howard is a worn-out, disappointed rock star at a fall, embarking on a romance with a fresh, talented new singing sensation, Esther Hoffman. Her dramatic success only highlights his fall. The main actors, Chris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, are adequate in their roles, but neither their chemistry nor the shop did not leave much trace to me. The film is worth the significance for just one aspect, Streisand's wonderful performance of the song "Evergreen", which won the Oscars. She really has a powerful and magnificent voice.
