As Grinch stole Christmas, he was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy, I never saw the reason for the remake. Not to mention the remake made with people, the cartoon was perfect enough, what is the purpose of this film? But it also seemed a little strange that Jim Carrei was Grinch. I mean, he's a great comedic actor, but he's like Grinch? It simply made no sense to me. His performance was a bit above and unintentionally funny in moments. Not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and was not pleasant. The whole story of Grinch and Cindy Lou-Vho was over and it was not needed. They just destroyed the story, the period. All those who are in Vhoville are preparing for their best Christmas season, but where everything should go perfectly. But Cindi Lou-Vho is curious and worried about Grinch who lives above them and will not get such a good Christmas like the other one. He throws out and decides he does not want Christmas this year and he should actually steal Christmas all together to show who his version of Christmas is. But soon realize that one who knows is a little more than what is a materialized version of Christmas. I really recommend that you keep the cartoon just because it's a rather disturbing version, at least in my opinion. Make-up and the presentation of the whole movie is just a little over, not to mention how Grinch stole Christmas! It was supposed to be more like a cartoon, and not as a version of Jim Carri. But at least this version makes you grateful for the version of Boris Carloff playing every Christmas. 1/10
