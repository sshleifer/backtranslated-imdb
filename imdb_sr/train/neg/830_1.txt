I really do not understand all these positive user reviews. This film is the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be pessimistic. But I think it's not her fault but the directors. He somehow managed to make everything artificial; their acting, idea, makeup, everything. The star I give is just for the idea of ​​a movie, which was very bad. Do not look at this shit, look at Fellini, Vudi Alen or some David Lynch.
