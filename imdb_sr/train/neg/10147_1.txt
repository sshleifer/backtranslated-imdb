I usually do not comment on anything (I read the opinions of others) ... but this, what I want to comment on ... I was convinced that I was watching this film worlds like action, F-117 and other hi-tech things, but for just a few minutes and I changed my mind ... Bad acting, bad script and great science fiction. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen ...> Simple ... Do not Try ... Another One Before Before which movie, I usually check the comments and ratings of users on this site ... 3.7 points and give this movie a try, I'm wondering if you rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points ??????????
