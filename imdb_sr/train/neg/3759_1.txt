Oh, where to start. The cinema was great. When the film first started due to the initial landscape scenes, I thought I had a good movie. Then Cgi Bigfoot appeared. He looked like a drawing of drawing a lion king and a royal child of love. He completely took away his character's conviction. Now I knew that there was no Bigfoot running people walking through the forest for no obvious reason, but the sirens were cartoons. So from then on, the whole movie was shot for me. The money that was washed in a cgi toilet that they could spend on a costume like that did roger Patterson. It was the best Bigfoot costume no one else could match with his. I'm a hardcore cheese Bigfoot movie fan and I was warned about this movie, but my habit led me to watch this movie and I was disappointed like me previous comments were warned. I know that after reading this review you will still say: "I have to watch the hunters on Saskuatch, they must watch the hunters on Saskuatch." Then you will tell me why I spent my good hard-earned money on such a painfully boring movie!
