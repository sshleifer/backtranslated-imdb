I think I found the most notorious movie of all time: Darklight. The essence of the film - Lilith was Adam's first wife and was considered imperfect and expelled from the paradise garden because she was considered Adam's Garden. equal and refused to subject him. You see, I took those words directly from the script. Then the film continues and although it's the hero of the film, the only time it becomes acceptable is when it does what people tell her to do! She ends the film under the control of "Faith" - all the male group! Apart from the fact that the scenario was predictable and FKS was horrible. Apart from the obvious hatred towards females, which is usually much more subtle in the modern film, nothing was original about Darklight.
