This must be the worst movie ever !!! The acting is more terrible than the movie. A lot of blood, but there's no idea where it comes from, because they do not even show cuts. I can not believe I lost my time watching this movie. We laughed as if we were watching a comedy, not a horror movie. This is a disgrace to horror films! For one, if they are in Asia, why is a white cop passing by a trash can? There are so many other languages ​​that you do not even know what's happening half the time. Editing a movie is a joke, my teenager could do better. And if I went to the cinema and that nasty old man was working a window, that would be the first clue. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!! DO NOT ALWAYS SHOW HOW IT IS, BE YOU WILL BE RECOGNIZED!
