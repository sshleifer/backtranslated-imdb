The plot is simple, and one old man living on the main road in the forest one day testifies that a man is killing a child in the forest. Soft For Digging follows the old man's attempt to persuade the police that what he saw was not the fruit of his imagination. However, there is a problem every time an old man leads the police to the place where the murder took place without the body being able to find a corpse. Soft For Digging has a small dialogue that reflects most movie scenes, an old man living alone in the house. During the film I discovered that I was scared twice when the murdered child suddenly appeared before the old man. The rest of the film I must admit did not hire me; I thought the pace of the film was slow. Limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusions, after watching the film, lasted too long. I feel that it could have been more of a relationship, a spooky encounter, with a child and an old man. Alone in the woods at night insecure in their minds can lead to some creepy situations, children are always scary as ghosts, see Dark Water.
