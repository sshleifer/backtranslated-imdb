I'm not a big fan of Stooges's slapstick, but I think their history is interesting. I recently tried to check things from every Stooge era, but it looks like an opportunity to see Joe's shorts do not come easy; This is the only one I've ever seen. Some say that Joeer's short trousers quality problems are not really Joe's fault, and I doubt that this is the case. Joe as a performer is far from being the worst. What is most troubling to me is highlighted in yet another comment: pitting other guys against the third violates the entire comedy team / Stooges Ethos. Perhaps Joe's style was perceived by those who were in charge of not fitting it exactly - although there were no real conflicts between him and others - and that was their way of doing it. <br /> <br> What about the titles of this and some other late Stooges short trousers? Definitely there is a lack of creativity; Is such a thing a cause or effect of the market of the Shores dried up?
