As other reviewers have noticed that the film is dying in the last half an hour. However, before that she suffers from the predictability and incredible performance of Kate Capshaw, who apparently never found her character and destroyed every scene in her. Conneri is fine as well as Fishbourne, but most of the scenes are manipulated due to the effect, not the truth that covers the whole with the feeling of unreality. And the end is simply bizarre. The film makers obviously knew when they put together this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin peppers to have Thanksgiving dinner, so they made up for an additional "dramatic" rating. Every little jump is followed by a crescendo of the orchestration, to the point where it becomes ridiculous. If you want an example of a bad film about the league, this is the one you will see, otherwise skip it.
