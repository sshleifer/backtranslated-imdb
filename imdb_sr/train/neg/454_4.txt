Generally, through a movie that boasts a strong vote and some clever dialogue and, of course, Dean Martin songs. The problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between him and Cher and they are a central love story. Cher almost made up for her reaction to Cage's accent and beyond controlling the controlling language. The cage simply does not fit into its role. He tries everything he can imagine and finds himself as an actor, not a real person, and this is what is needed in a love story. Cage had the same performance problems in other roles that require more Jimmy Stevart characters. Cage continues to take on these roles, perhaps because he loves such films, but his own energy as an actor is not lending to them, even though he has become better at it with repeated attempts. He should leave these roles to less interesting actors who would fully devote themselves to the film and spend his energy and significant talent more than winning roles and films in which his crazy interesting self can be.
