Question: How does a bourgeois director treat a subject such as immigration? Answer: Turning into a story about existential alienation. Yes, we returned in the early nineties right after the collapse of the eastern bloc and subsequent floods of immigrants in the European Union, and which is a better way to deal with the topic than to film a film about an essentially alienated middle class journalist, an egregiously alienated higher-class politician, his egregiously alienated rich woman, and so on. , immigrants seek political asylum in an unnamed Greek village near the borders. In this way I assume that Angelopulos can show a certain social awareness while dealing with the existential problems of the upper class. To be honest, the scene in which a top military officer curses his fate as he sent his daughter to London to study is enough to recover. In any case, it can not be so bad Angelopulos is a master of film art, is it? Wrong. At this point, when his manners begin to become too artificial, in some way like a filtered image in Photoshop. His usual tricks appear: faded windows, blurry lights, strange wedding, walking along the coast and people with yellow coats. Also Mastroianni breaks the new terrain for most performance ever. Avoid real. Go for his early films.
