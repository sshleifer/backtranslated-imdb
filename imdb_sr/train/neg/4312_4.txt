This acts as a satire during the women's rights movement. Of course, this does not mean that COACH (film) is a wonderful experience. It is located in the same vein as FASTBREAK (which was better but still pitiful) and is essentially a standard pause. What I think is this movie is not interesting is simply to recognize. Anyone who serves time away from a normal job by training a bunch of crazy people who earn money for a sudden victory is wasting. You can get the same feeling after watching this. A nice attempt to expose the opposite sex to the duty of a man, but I was expecting better things.
