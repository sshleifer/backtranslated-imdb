I'm glad to read so many negative comments about the Tritter plot. Everyone I talk to is the same thing. They love Hus's crude nature and intelligence, but they do not really like the avarice of this sequel. He is accustomed to the true nature of the hospital story and is angry with all the police. It must have more caring nature instead of being vindictive for everyone in the hospital. It also appears that there are many controversial legal aspects of what Tritter actually is doing. He himself can not freeze accounts and has the authority to prevent doctors from writing prescriptions for patients. A lot of aversion that shows and hurts ill patients in a hospital is not a good story to show. I voted for this episode horribly not because of the story itself, but when you insert a piece of Tritor it turns me off and the rest of the action is hurt, People say they hate to watch stories anymore. Please change it. Take out Tritter.
