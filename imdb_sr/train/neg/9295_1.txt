I was very surprised how bad this movie was. Beautiful cinema and beautiful landscapes can only bring the movie so far. I was hoping to re-launch Hero, but this is a lot, much worse. This film is the reason why kung fu movies had a bad reputation. There are no convincing characters (even in the cartoon kung fu movies, these characters are funny), practically without complications and funny stories. This film is so boring and frustrating as it reminds you of trying to play the game with children. Every time you think your stupid battle makes sense, they invented another funny craft that does not make sense ("Ah ha, you just think you caught me with your super powers and 10,000 rai cannons, but I ate my vitamins covered with plutonium and Teflon, so your guns do not work and I'm invulnerable for your super power ... tap the tap without turning infinitely PLUS one. ") Children can continue with this madness, because they do not care about everyone listening because they are having fun. However, for VIEVER, especially for adult viewers, this long movie is worse than the fight with bad gas. SPOILERS AHEAD Note for kung fu filmmakers, (a) if you have a knife in your if you are not on PCP, in that case your kung fu is not strong, (b) if you fall back repeatedly to The back, which has a knife in itself, will hurt more and do more damage, unless it is a false support, (c) when a knife strikes your heart, you die, especially in ancient China where there is no keiser Permanente behind the corner, (d) Fighting kung fu does not last for hours while 3 feet of snow falls, and (e) sometimes it's worth explaining your characters and their motivations. In any case, go again to watch Hero, because at least within its little world it is understandable.
