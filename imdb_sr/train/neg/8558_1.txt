This film was absolutely horrible, it's even unpleasant to call me a movie. It's a typical "mumblecore" movie, with a nuisance and a bunch of uncontrollable twenty and a few times that stumbles around trying to "figure things out." I tried to give a chance to a mumblecore, but let's be honest, it's just awful. I am not synchronized with the cinema, I appreciate Dogme95 movies, Idioterne is one of my favorite films. So, I do not mind if the movie is cheap, as long as there is some (SVAKA) substance. Everything in this movie is terrible, acting, writing (or everything was improvised?), direction, but MOST of everything, above all, working with the camera was just plain and simple nonsense. The camera was never logical, there was no consistency. I have to admit that I'm the type I've heard that this film is naked, so I thought to myself that even if she was terrible at least naked (yes, I know, I'm a jerk). Well thanks to the crappi camera, you will never be able to see anything, and the things you see, DO ME - DO NOT WANT TO SEE. This film made me want to vomit at many levels. Dialogue made me want to vomit, working on the camera made me vomit, but mostly the idea that this film was praised by some legitimate critics. , now that I want to vomit more than anything.
