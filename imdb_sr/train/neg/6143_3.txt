This is a really weird movie ... First, we have an ex-US gymnast who tries to turn the actor (or something like that), and this seems to be the only role he has ever received (which I already know) for a good reason. Although he is well enough to remove the role of holding a certain interest, it is a fairly mild and even effect. Secondly, we have the MOST sound effects ever used in the movie !!! I'm not kidding. Only because of this, the film is extremely comical, but in this uncomfortable way. And thirdly, while we have a generally decent actors team (including the hot hot fish!), Not really such a bad story, and some cool visuals; dialogue, fighting scenarios involving gymnastics (hilarious!), and general execution of complications are poor. This film would be brighter as a network TV movie (bad Fok was not around 1985). It's one of those films that are simply bad, but you can not resist watching and even enjoying it when you get used to it, especially now that it's found the perfect eternal house on the television and cable television.
