There are some nice shots in this movie, capturing some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact cinema is probably the best advantage. But this is essentially more than a TV movie, and although it has a lot of conspiracy, which makes it very interesting watching, there are no titles and key developments in Spanish, so Spanish speakers will remain a little lost . I had it as a Christmas present, because it is a family trait to work through actor's films that were gifted to us, and Matthev Mconaughei was great in the film "A Time to Kill" and "Nevton Bois" I so expressed that I want to see more of his work. However, although on a DVD box it says that Matthev Mconaugheia's film and uses it as a marketing trick, it has several rows on the screen. in very few minutes at the end of the film, it's essentially extra and it does not really illuminate the screen while on it, so I hardly admire, But it's not worth it from that point of view. Still, Patrick McGav is excellent, though very easy on the eye, and his character is so nice, polite and caring, a true saint. It would be well written in ROM. So, for the true brilliance of Mcconaughey from those I've seen, I would recommend "Time to Kill", "The Nevton Bois" "Frailti", "How to Lose a Boy in 10 Days", "Edtv" and "Amistad" and avoid too much "Larger Than Life" and "Angels in the Outfield" unless you feel like a children's movie or you are children around because none of them point to his talent, but they are pretty entertaining movies for children, again MM is really nothing more than a supporting artist with only a few lines. As for Scorpion Springit is not a bad movie, but it's not even the screen stealing.
