Well, what I can say about this movie is that it's great to see so many Asian faces. What I did not like in the movie was that there was a lot of stereotypes about what the typical racial characters would do in their role. An Asian woman without self-confidence who has to play someone else to make progress, a white man who is in love with Asian culture and decides to leave her white world for a yellow country and a driver of black taxis. In addition, the placement of all cocks, Shanghai and donuts was too obvious. The story itself was fun, but how much I thought the story would be revealed. Then again, when watching romantic comedies, you can not expect much, but again I would like to be surprised at least once. Parents are the best part of the movie.
