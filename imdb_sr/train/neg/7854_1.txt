Wow, this is the worst movie ever. The only reason I applied for the IMDb was that I could complain about this movie. I never got out of the theater or stopped the DVD, but I almost stopped this (and I should have). but I watched him all the way just to drop me off with an absolutely terrible ending. If this is all that Craven can produce its time is long worse. I've never seen the first one, and I will never look after that. horrible acting with a terrible plot. Hey, it looks like someone shines a mirror with us, let's check it out. and sadly, when this movie came to DVD, it was forever checked on the blockbuster. so I feel bad for all the people who saw this trash.
