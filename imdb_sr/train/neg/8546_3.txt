Very unbelievable, incredible and unrelated Spanish production ... well, let me see how close I am to it. The film begins with a woman who killed one of the cats killed by a young girl. Then ask his lover to take her somewhere to rest. He calls the job and demands that he loses his vacation time and says he will pay for it. What this relates to is the speculation at the end of the film, because the guy, a dark photographer, spies the beautiful Patti Shepard, the queen of Spanish horror films, seems to be taking her bikini for a moment to be able to paint, she asks She went to lunch and then to your task on Mount Witches - for reasons we never knew before. Before they leave, Patti must stand by the house and loudly, "eerily" repeats the echo in the ears of our hero. Again, this never explains. The film continues with these two who stop at the inn, go to the mountain and finally understand why the mountain is called the Witch Mountain. You know, there are several aspects of this film that make it better than bad movie. There is some atmosphere, some of the actors are really quite good (especially the deaf and inferior), the tracks are at least adequate, and the climax - although it does not make any sense at all - is well choreographed (literally) with witches in white breasts and long black hair . It just does not make any sense, and that's a big slanderer for me. I could watch the movie ten more times and I do not know more than I did after the first look. That's a big problem. The Witch Mountain is an unusual movie from a long string of cheap, atmospheric European horror films that have covered that decade. If you can get more than that from me, it's better for you.
