As far as B-films are concerned, SCARECROV is one of those that is so bad that it becomes incredibly boring. A lonely loser of a high school student who is constantly picked up by a colleague and rejected by girls, ends up on his garbage mother in a trailer that has sex with a drunk peasant. Then he runs the child into the nearby field of corn and kills him. Apparently, the child's soul was transferred to a scarecrow, which then circumvented the killers who tortured him and the teachers. This scarecrow, apart from having one line for each of its victims, can also make the Matrix Flips through the air and kill people on the pavements in the middle of the day. Also, why always looked like a rotten body? Just as two unnecessary sequels that followed, is not worth the laugh.
