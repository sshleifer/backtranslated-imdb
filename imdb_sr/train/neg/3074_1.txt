Even for cocaine laced 1980 this is pathetic. I do not understand why someone would want to spend celluloids, time, effort, money and brain cells for the audience to do such a nonsense. If you're going to make a comedy, let it be funny. If you want to record trash like this, keep it for yourself. If you want to post it like a joke like this: NO! I mean, was that a joke? Somebody tell me this is a joke. Please.
