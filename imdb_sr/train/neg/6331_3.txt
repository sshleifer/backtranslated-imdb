Mr. Mike was probably the most reckless comedian of all time, so I was interested to see what he would do with a total creative control of the film. Unfortunately, this is unnoticed, but not because jokes are not ridiculous - some (I will not say the majority) of them, and in fact, Mr. Mike has done a good job by translating his mentally unbalanced screed into visual jokes. The trouble is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, what's your name) so divine, the film is unbearable. Some clothes called "PKO Productions" get a production loan, but they do not seem to be produced at all; it seems that Mike stole one of the SNL cameras and did the whole thing for one afternoon. I understand that Mike's goal was to torture the audience, but even deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to really see, hear or understand whatever it is that should be shocking. However, the DVD is not a total loss: it includes praise for O'Donoghue by Bill Murrai and three "Mr Mike's Least Loveed Bedtime Stories" from the SNL. In addition, the section of the movie "cat for swimming" is a great scene that you can catch watching if you want to scare someone. 3/10
