Here's a perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea. It is not a problem? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and its execution lack any real substance. You should grab you from the very beginning, then pull out a little of your emotions, get interested and invest in characters. This movie does not have what it takes to fly and fly, and here's why. First of all, you do not care about the characters because they are not presented in the way people can relate, I do not think this is Superman or a mission impossible here, it's a presumption that these are normal people put in a stressful situation. They are not convinced of the way they operate and interact. Example: Jeffrey Combs as chewing gum police is a chewing gum, frowned and intense all the time is not the way to go here. I mean, what is it? It looks like it's on the toilet or something. I loved him in the re-animator and the way he played an intense / neurotic, unnoticed medical genius was real money. But not because of this, he is trying too hard to compensate him so intensely and on the edge, but still in a mild neurotic way, it's not natural, I'm surprised he did not move the fork during the shooting. The film is basically about life support, it hardly has a pulse and it waited for me to not come.
