Are you kidding on my account ?! A show that accentuates someone who opens cans and meal envelopes? How talented are you to do it? MAY be able to cook, but NOT displayed in this half-hearted stomach. I know that Martha-Stevart-esquire is an empire. Like Varren Buffett, but I can not see it with a fake typing, opening corn cans and Alpoa. She has a nephew named ... Bricer. Bricer? Stop talking about someone who's stupid. More time is spent on "scapes" than on real kitchen. Who has so much time?! Silicone should be on your spatula, not on TV. This show should be on Cartoon Network, NE Food Network.
