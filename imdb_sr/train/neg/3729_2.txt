First, I saw this film when I was 7 years old at Christian Scholl I attended. Needless to say I was scared. Not because it was scary, but because it's content. I was 7 years old. In any case, the cinema was pretty bad and the acting was messy. It's very bad considering that I was only 7 years old and that I remember it. The only thing that is still haunting me is this terrible song "I wish we were all ready" where the choir ends with "... you are left". I would not suggest you see this. I'll probably just because of a nostalgic reason. Besides, I'm sure the remake is much better. The best part of this film, however, must be when everyone "disappears"; free cars are collapsing, mowers running alone ... pretty funny.
