I picked up TRAN SCAN from the library and brought it home. We thought about going east and thinking that it would give us an impression. The movie was a total waste of time, if I went to buy it, I would call it TRAN SCAM when I saw it cost $ 49. The DVD lasted for 8 minutes and showed a ride on a slide. throughout Canada, while my stomach was sick as they moved up and down and around the bend with the movie at high speed. There were a lot of recordings they probably made and you think they could have made a better product. If I did this project, I would give more videos, paused on the road signs to give people the knowledge of where they are and stay in places where I can see the landscape. To make this kind of film should take 60 to 90 minutes. Oh yes, the case said that he was in stereo, the whole movie was a crazy sound from the speedy sound of the car, but at least he could add music to it. If you want a good movie in Canada, The Railroadder / National Film Board of Canada starring Buster Keaton (one of the last films he filmed) in this comic movie Buster Keaton enters the New Scotland Railway and travels to British Columbia
