I really wanted to love this movie, but so much was stolen / borrowed from another job - some indebtedness is painfully attacking. A comment by the New York Times has indicated that their singing frog is terribly reminiscent of the one in the famous cartoon Varner Brothers ('Hello, my grandmother, hello my dear', hello my ragtime gal ... '). But I challenge anyone to watch the animated film Fok / Blue Ski Robots (2005) and does not find a funny similarity in: acts - a young inventor who grows up, and an innovative corporation distributes all great inventions. Citiscap - Extremely similar camera angles include very similar futuristic urban environments. Robots ... Robots robots robot robots have a very similar design as with robots, and both films use everything it looks like in a sharp contradiction with a disgusting quote from Disney in the end , which implies that the company is a constant innovator who never looks back (also contradicting their entire 90s catalog of films that were fairly clones of each other, with some minor settings for storytelling and ethnicity). and instead they constantly send objects and sounds that fly in our direction, even though we do not have a range of attention for anything less. The Zlikovac is really well designed and brilliantly animated, and the pleasure is to watch. Much of the rest of the film seems to be overwhelmed. Some of the landscapes look like CGIs from the mid-90s. The movie actually opens with the classic Mickey Mouse shortly. By the end of this cartoon, we recall that Disney never had much interest in innovation or a good story - it seems to think that simply getting something on the big screen is sufficient proof of their virtue.
