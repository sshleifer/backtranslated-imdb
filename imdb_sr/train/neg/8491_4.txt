Despite some casual original touches, such as "virtual sets" that provide the backdrop for Victorian interiors with Ada Lovelace and her circle, this film does not satisfy even the end of the disappointment. The newcomer Francesca Faridani seems to be talented, but loses as Emma, ​​a character that is reduced to nothing more than watching the monitor in the middle of a movie watching Ladi Ada tells autobiography. 'Imagination of Ada' briefly in summer when Lada Ada (Tilda Svinton) appears; the camera retains itself on facial expressions, manirism, and even makes it seem transparent or invisible at the moment, arranging in scenes to dramatize Emmi's "virtual" display of her work. it was worth the effort, but this film, unfortunately, makes Lash Ada a hash of life, but also a modern computer scientist (and her widely drawn, negligent boyfriend).
