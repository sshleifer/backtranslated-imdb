Honestly, I can not believe what brings entertainment now. Death (and the passing of death), violence, sexual hint, adults who threaten children, rudeness, abuse of alcohol by minors, drug theft, dysfunctional parents, babysitter from hell, stereotypical jokes about Afroamericans, policemen and fat people in the middle of the night - it sounds like a movie for kids - NO !!! Add to that both dark and frightening elements - a dead woman who owns and turns into a house and keeps her beloved husband inmates in the interior for more than 20 years, and also terrorizes the entire neighborhood - how sweet for children. PARENTS - is that what you want your children to watch - is that what you want to teach them about life?! This film is too frightening for young children, and I'm afraid that teenagers may be living some of this film script today - why are they rubbing it on their faces? As for the adult audience - you will not consider it scary or fun - just boring, fictitious and predictable. And the characters are simply wrong - parents who do not know, police in ignorance, stupid and boring friends, nasty and manipulative babisitters, and drunkards / drunk women. What a great material for children - does it really sound like a movie for children? Even computer animation and good work with the voice are not enough to take advantage of this horrible movie. Save Your Money, Save Time and Save Your Children's Minds - Leave Ice Age, Monsters Inc., Incredibles, Shrek, A Bug's Life - Any one of them is much better than this horrible movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis - a shame for both of you making such a catastrophe and then charging it as a movie for children / family !!
