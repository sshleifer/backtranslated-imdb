This movie seemed to be better than it was finished. The cinema was good, the acting sounded, the dialogue was not too cruel ... but then it's about twenty minutes in that long scene with the Doctor you know that it's actually a patient in asylum that pretends to be Doctor Odatle going just south. On top of that, the demon is about the funniest look from the time Godzilla looked in the Curse of the Demon. There are some weird demon fans wearing masks that look like exploding teens since the beginning of Logan's race. Eventually, cinema could not save this film. Despite fairly solid performances by actors, the story simply does not go anywhere. I think "Hellbored" would be a better title for this.
