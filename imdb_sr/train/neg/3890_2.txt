A really unpleasant film. While the special effects of Rick Baker are quite impressive (if you turn your stomach), he has no other buying options. Like many 70s movies, it leaves you feeling like you need a long shower, and you rub the mucus from you. The characters are equally unpleasant, and the plot makes no sense.
