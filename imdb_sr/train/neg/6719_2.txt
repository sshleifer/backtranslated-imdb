This is a great idea for a movie, but, unfortunately, it does not seem like an excellent movie. What starts as a sweet and almost stupid romantic comedy about Fluffer in love with his Fluffers spirals out of control in a bizarre combination of genres and real paprika, with liberal loans from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE, SHOVGIRLS, FRISK and even curious "Dash" of 400 BLOVS is thrown to an end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring, but after all, this smooth, well-produced movie does not contribute to anything. However, actors are all working with material and have a few good laughs in the fun world of gay pornography. <br /> <br />
