I am a great fan of Western, but this ... um, what a stink! I think that what almost turned me off immediately from the bat, was insignificant. I think I could write a better dialogue than this when I was in the eighth grade. And poor actors! Given this horrible dialogue, none of them came to anything except funny. Really, I'm not kidding. Some of this is a bit better than what you would get in Ed Vood. The biggest tragedy is Sterling Haiden. He was probably a "big" star in this movie that would, if I called her B-Western, blame praise. This may be what should be called B-minus west. Drink Sterling Haiden, who appeared at other times together with Joan Cravford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra, and other great talents. In order for him to appear in the vehicle, this poor must be something he tried to push for the rest of his life. For a week and their faces are greasy. I know that in the old west the guys were not always well prepared, but for a man this is a movie that makes you just want to go 'EVVVV!' Really, this is a silly western. Denver Pyle also had to live this time, especially after playing in so many westerns. Bad, bad movie.
