I would like to give this film a zero, but it was not an option !! This movie is bullshit !!! Women can not work. I should have known that he would suck when I saw Bobbie Brovna. Nobody in my house could not believe that I did not change the channel after the first 15 minutes. The idea of ​​black females like rifles in the western days is ridiculous. It's not just a racial thing, it's half. The combination of these two things is ridiculous. And I'm sorry that some people in the film are not bad actors / actresses, but the film was horrible. was not credible as a movie. It can be 'fun' for a certain group of people, but I'm not in that group. lol. and using a great line from a brilliant, brilliant movie ... "that's all I have to say about it."
