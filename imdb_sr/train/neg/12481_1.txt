This story of a sword and sorceress about the stunning brutal and insensitive "hero" that destroys the evil king is worthless in almost every detail. Operation is terrible of the leading backing roles. The horrible, meanhearted joy that the director shows is that the blood-sparing hero is absolutely disgusting; nor is he redeemed by any justice to his goal, because he is as bad as the people he fights. The editing of Z-movie is abundant, including the scene in which the character "dies" from the sting of a sword that has apparently missed out completely! Lana Clarkson, who mostly paraded around naked throughout the film. As a man of 20 men, I will not pretend that the female meat on the screen does not attract me. But the treatment of their characters is so degrading and sexual scenes so irreconcilable and voluptuous that I could not enjoy even this aspect of the film. light-hearted, face-to-face (the sequel is better in this regard), but DEATHSTALKER seems to take himself completely seriously as a heroic fantasy. No way! Avoid at all costs! Ratings: 1/2 from ****.
