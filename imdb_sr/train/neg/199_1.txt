This is a horrible movie, an awful scenario, a bad direction and a meaningless ending. Also, there are bad performances, besides Clanci Brovn, who is criminally insufficiently used here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was a purgatory - you've done it to get enough bad karma of the movie to really see the good even lower. The film represents a father and a son who seem as if they can not possibly be. A part of male lead is not well written and seems to be non-critical in this role. You can see a parcel of one mile. The actions of a female leader and the action of her brother, a policeman, also make no sense. So, the big action on its side at the end of the movie makes no sense.
