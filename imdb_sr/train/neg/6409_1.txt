I just saw this movie yesterday ... I can not believe reviews on this site. Those who give it more than one star must be Buffy fanatics. Well, I'm Buffy's first-class lover, but I know the shit when I see him. At each level, this film is terrible. Technically, most of the time you do not know where you are in this movie, even within a single scene, without any reason, jumping POV like crazy. There is no logic in cinematic terms. It is emotionally gloomy and trying to be a psychological thriller when it's just confusing. Throwing unpleasant red throats in a movie is a cheap way to convey the "atmosphere". I lost patience with him a long time before the last act, but I had too much fun with my friends working MST3K riffs to turn it off. Since leaving Buffy, SMG has had two successful films, even if the list of "Scooby Doo" in your resume can be counted. Gellar is a good actress, but she (or her agent) can not find the vehicle for her. И г. Shepard, if you have problems with paying a mortgage, I'll send you a couple of dollars if you promise you will no longer appear in a movie like this one! (Also, the property of Patsi Cline should sue for defamation!)
