How this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me. This is a terrible clich√© movie with the worst acting one of these actors ever did. I'm really surprised that many of these A stars will agree with this infertile movie. Worse still, the fact is that nearly 100 million people are here in the country. It turns out, however, that big stars can withdraw money, even if the film is horrible. I was so sorry for everyone who participated in this nutritious fest. Billy Cristal tried the best he could, and it seemed that the rest of the stars walked through the movements. Whatever you do, do not fall to the great actor because no one could save it.
