I've seen a lot of movies and rarely to evaluate film "1", but this film was out of fear. The acting was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying. Usually when watching scary movies I think it's DUMB when characters hear noise at home / forest / school / etc. And then shouts: "Hello, is there anybody there?" - but at least they are convincing when they do it. This movie can not even understand that right. This is a movie that will make other B-horror movies like Venom and Fog look like a masterpiece that rewards academy. I always watch open-minded films and I can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and to write this comment so anyone else who thinks watching this movie will rethink. THAT IS GOOD!
