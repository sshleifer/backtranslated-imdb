Frankly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I expected a small series of cartoons with lots of fun (but exaggerated and exaggerated) Bush's joke. Obviously I should have lowered my expectations even further. Writing was absolutely pathetic. In addition to Chenei-Chicken-Eating jokes, and some giggles-a little stitch, it was really boring and unfunny. The animation was as sophisticated as a thirteen-year-old Flash project. It's embarrassing that Macromedia's product is used for this, because it's capable of much more. I do not like so much Bush, and I enjoy Bush-jokes as much as the next guy, but this was only half an hour of blow to the president with some painful non-funny moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did much more with That Mi Bush. Make yourself a service, skip "Lil 'Bush" and go buy a copy of the short-lived comedy "It's My Bush". You will thank me.
