This film is so bad and worsens in every imaginable way. It's not just a bad act and script, nor is it a chromium and a perverted moment that is spent on watching it. What this movie really puts in my shameful hall is an obvious struggle for writers and producers to work with the film to try to make it funny. The actress who replaced the descendant of Jean Renoa is old and learned a lesson in the first film, adding a new girlfriend to marry. Almost all of the original add-ons and gags are coming back, but this time I want to get my eyes out of the sockets because it's the loss of a perfectly good movie. Torturing constant cuts and footage in any scene of this movie can bring the viewer into violent spirals. This second film takes a successful original and pulls it out of its suitcase and puts out a corpse in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its heritage but also our intelligence. This film, unlike the spruce of goose, could not fly because it had no complication with the directors who were returning for the 'necklace'. There is no script because it is obviously written and added everyday. No attention on the camera or footage. Poor lighting and special effects done for this. This film would not even go on for a student film in the basic film 101. As this bunch was breaking, nobody knows. It was a huge loss investment and no one seemed to have the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our troubles. This movie has one good part ... its ending! This film is my # 1 worst movie of all time, finally "Hovard The Duck" is no longer a goose.
