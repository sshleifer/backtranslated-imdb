This "movie" is such a bad business! It seems that nothing is trying to be realistic. The plot is weak, the actors are poor, the actors are wondering as in the first year of production, trying very hard to act without any chance from the beginning. What a flop! What a waste of time, money and effort for all interested, including the audience. Well, like in every thriller, here are the killings, corpses, and blood. Imagine someone who committed a knife killing 5 minutes ago, and he came out calm and smiling, not to mention that it was clean as a whistle, as if the throat engagement was done by a virtual agent. Also, this murder should have been done by a tiny fragile woman on a strong man, and she cut his throat! Did she kindly ask him to bend for her? Much more nonsense of the same kind is happening and leaves the audience wondering if it meant a joke that just turned out to be bad. Continuity is another major problem, for example: eager hungry groom lying in bed, waiting for his virgin-bride to leave the bathroom and after a long while sleeping (!?!). The next scene opens when a young couple enters the reception, looking for directions for landscape landscapes! NO WAY FOR LAST NIGHTS ??? Loss of time even for writing about this low-low "movie".
