It's simply said, the worst movie I've ever seen. It ranges from 2+ hours, and hi art was completely wrong. My friends and I rented it, because we thought it would be a poor 300. You know, laugh and laugh. Not. There is nothing funny in this movie, just pain. Then, the film begins, and they speak some sort of different language. We think, 'Oh, that's just the beginning.' But no, then the film is falling and becomes more like a super boring book that you had to read in elementary school, where nothing literally happens for hours, and the scene of the rival's battle with the two children who fight at the playground. Omit Cinematographi, and this film belongs to the trash compactor. Such films will lead to the world we see in Vall-E, which was, by the way, a good movie.
