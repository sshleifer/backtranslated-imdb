To be honest, I did not like the "Executive Decision" - which was an obvious template - a lot, but compared to this piece of shit, it looks like a masterpiece of art. Not only are People moving in the movie (the term actors would be an insult to all other actors) should attend more hours of acting, the guy who builds the environment did not even see the plane from afar. It's so funny that the ship 747 is only 3 years old, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogicality (for example, use sleeping gas, then do not use it, and then use it), which finally lowered my rating to the bottom. You can have fun in reorganize the sock drawer or punch the hole in your knees and fill it with milk.
