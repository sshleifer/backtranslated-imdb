After a rather successful MASTI that was better Inder Kumar returned with a comedy PIAARE MOHAN based on the Hollywood film. where Kader and Anupam play the blind and the deaf This movie is a boring exercise The film has jokes about such nonsense that you do not feel like you laugh like a head Snehala Dabia stuck in the back a horse and all those types of comedies that we are not laughing at now, but mocking. The film starts in a clich√© manner, and some scenes are funny, but such moments do not It's been a long time before the story moves in To this half, even comedy becomes boring. The direction of Indera Kumar is a bad music is fine, one song stands out and I LOVE THIS MY ANGEL Vivek Horribly in comical scenes, his moment is very bad and okay is in serious scenes. For some reason she continues to work on comedy and destroys her career. Snehal Dabbi is fine
