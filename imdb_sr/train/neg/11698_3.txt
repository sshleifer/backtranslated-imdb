This move reminded me of Tales from Cript Keeper. The same idea that people get what they deserve. I think that's always the story of the crypt. The same goes for bad behavior. Very bad acting. I enjoyed the film knowing that most people do not like and I did not expect much. Whenever I watch Stephen King's film I do not expect much because all of his films are horrific in comparison with the genius of his novels. I read The Shining and Carrie and these were great books. I love how Carrie played like a true story, and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories, and so on. It was so good. But I noticed that both novels were not like movies. The endings were very different from film versions. From these two novels, I assume that all his novels have changed greatly and that the endings are always messy. The end of Thinner is the worst. So Cheesi. I want to read the book to find the right end. I suggest to everyone who intends to read Stephen King's novels to watch his films before you look at him, to compare them. And so you will be very pleased with the book. I intend to do this with all of his novels that were filmed in films. I'm sure that if they were filmed, they were really good books ... and the script was horribly wrong.
