Interesting? Hard. The "scientific evidence" that the film provides for its point (which is essentially Jewish cancer) is so stupid and lame, it's almost funny (if we did not know what happened in that period). Important? Nah. I can not imagine that the Germans (even in that terrible time) would love or believe this film. Compare it with Riefenstahl Triumf des Villens. It was a movie I was impressed with. This is just funny trash. The best part is the scene from M (one of my favorite favorites) where (gay, as the announcer so eloquently reminds us) Lorre plays the child -Molester and killer. In the eyes of these filmmakers, only a corrupted mind can do it. Uh huh. I did not know that M Hitler's favorite movie, right? No, it's just plain stupid. Even because of his Nazi genre. 2/10.
