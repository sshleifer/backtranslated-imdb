This film captures a thin line between satire and stupidity. While a bridged bridge system can promote a marriage fund, it certainly can not promote the winning bridge so that the satire did not work for me. However, there were some things that I liked, especially when it was a big bridge between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk at the end of the film. It's treated as if it's a championship boxing. Not only is the competition arena engraved in a square space like a boxing ring, there is a judge who hovers between the contestants, and Roscoe Carnes broadcasts a continuous chat on events. At one point it even lists "One ... Two ... Three ... Four ..." as if the offer of four diamonds was a fake event. People were glued to their radio devices for everything, which was a common event for the championship boxing match. This bug really worked well. Unfortunately, few actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the predicted satire. Paul Lukas does not have much sense in comedy and is wrong; lovely Loretta Young and the usual comic book Frank McHugh did not get enough good lines; Glenda Farrell has a beautiful comic reversal like a forgotten blonde at the beginning of the film, but after that she practically disappears. What a loss of talent!
