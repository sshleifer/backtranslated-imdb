Generally, I found that if you do not hear about the movie before you see it on DVD, there is probably a good reason for it. I did not even hear about this film until I was in Blockbuster the other day and saw him on the shelf. Since all the good films have already been leased (the ones I wanted to see, anyway), I thought I would give this clip. In fact, it's not much different from other movies in the genre, such as The Singles Vard or RM. If you're in these movies, you'll probably enjoy this. However, if you are not a Mormon, this film will not appeal to you. There is no way to avoid an openly religious (mormon) message that is in it, and sometimes it appears as a scapular and cheesy. After all, if you do not belong to Mormon demographics, it's probably better to look at something else. But, in the film there were some very funny moments, but I did not think it was enough to save the movie.
