Six different pairs. Six different love stories. Six different angles of love. Eighty-eight audience numbers in the cinema. Watching eighty different pieces of silver screen. I sit somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie. All stories do not have interconnections, but somewhere below the line Nikhil Advani tries to show some relationship between them. I tried to find out a few lines that I could write as an overview, but I did not find anything to write at the end of 3 hours and 15 minutes. The film is a bad copy of the Hollywood blockbuster LOVE ACTULII. My suggestion. Do not watch a movie if you really want to watch a good movie.
