Video quality is terrible. Sound quality is pathetic. The acting is terrible. Dialogue is painful. Lighting is sad. Editing is funny. I could continue, but it would be meaningless. Snitch'd is the third amateur video that is transmitted as a feature film. This is best left to collect dust in a video store.
