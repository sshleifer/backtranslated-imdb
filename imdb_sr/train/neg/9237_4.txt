Stalker is right! The girl sees the guy, the girl wants a guy, the girl invents the usual way to get into it, the girl will not leave him alone, the girl pretends to be patient, the girl can not stop talking about him, the girl pretends to love another guy ( or two), he does not pay attention to her because she is boring, girl STILL will not leave him alone. Played properly, Drake's character could have been charming, but she's totally, totally uncompromising in the quest for Career Grant's career, her girl-in-cahoot is boring, and unfortunately, Drake's attempt to play, "charmingly hot" disturbing madness. "Grant himself, as usual, is fine for Caria, but he is the closest to what I've ever seen from him. The direction is vague and the dialogue is just mutinous." Screvball comedy is it's very difficult to do it well, and when it fails, like in this fake kundaku of attempts, it just stinks. Worse yet, Drake uses the whole film to the needs of Valium and the ban on the admission.It destroys every humor in this dryer than the relic of the mummy dust.
