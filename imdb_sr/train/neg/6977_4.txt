I read all the critic reviews and I was impressed by the imagination of those who loved this film. I can not say I recommended a lot. Leonard Cohen's sound record is not only overly difficult, it's boring. The movie looks authentic enough, but something has to happen to it to work, and nothing special is done: lethal plot (not a real problem for me), little character, nothing thematic. Just moving away. Cimin's "Heavenly Gate" has some moments of real wonder and a movie that I would watch again. For the brilliant reconstruction of the West, HBO's Deadvood is much better than McCabe.
