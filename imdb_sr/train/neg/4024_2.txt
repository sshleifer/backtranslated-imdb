This movie is simply terrible. Poor John Savage had to go down so low to be in another movie. He is a rare type of vampire who needs to help a lady who looks like washed and thrown into the street of a whore who is a dancer in a local strip club. It was accidentally tasted by a drop of blood from another dancer who was by chance one of those rare vampires who pulled out on the floor of the locker room. Savageu then awards the short leader of this rare vampire breed, which looks like a cross between a punk rock from the 80's and one of Olsen twins with violet hair. This movie gets crazy with Savage rapping and dancing with a tattooed spider on the head, also one of the few. He quotes Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante, and I just had to laugh. This only becomes a redicula. And then the toughest special effects that Corri could find was the throwing of their organs and the extraction from the mouth. And you can say that this is all you need to fake. Her son does not know what to do with the new identity of her mother and becomes more pests than the object of tranquility. I enjoy a good movie about vampires, believe me, but I just hate this. Even the photo stinks, blurs and shuts down with the camera this way, and try to make it look like the vampires move quickly so the camera can keep pace, and then the camera turns everything in the bright scene of Savage in search of the son of Corriere until he sees himself . Avoid this!
