This 2003 year made for a TV film is shown, of course, on the female channel. As a man, why am I trying to watch this at all? I do not know, but I need to look at my head. And the director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed of giving people an injustice as he does. He takes away all the power and conviction that a man could do by getting a few boring women to him. Number one is Joice Hiser as a woman. I could not wait to drop it. Her revenge was stupid and stupid and very confusing for most of the film. Another femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz, the coolest person you'd ever like to meet. Her appearance did not guarantee that our leading man went to this monkey over her and that her acting was so obvious that only the fool could have missed it. Definitely a loser. Temba Lok was pretty good, but slow to the excitement of the whore that seduces her husband, again playing as a losing guy, David DeLiz. Rounding out our losers is Anthony Denison as a boss who has a bit of work but frowns upon our hero. Steven Jenkins as our hero, or to say the victim, was not so good. At first I thought he was only a bad actor, but later I believed him. He never pulled a piece off the ground and was repeating it. Although I was as angry as the two women pulled out. People, watch out for this channel that slips men and women away even with murder. LMN is a channel. Watch out for. Note: Since I watched this for the second time by mistake, I am convinced of my initial thoughts. Especially with writer / director, Simon Gornik. I still believe that he embarrassed the male species and that he should be a horse. The only saving grace in this film is Tembi Locke who has no chance to show off his talent with the horrible acting of Jenkins, Hyser, Hiltz and DeLuise around her. Plus a stupid complication that only aggravates the situation. Down with Gornick's film and his empty stars in it. Please do not show this banal again.
