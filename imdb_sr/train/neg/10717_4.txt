I give this generous four of ten stars, dots or markers, or something like that. There were a total of two really funny scenes in this movie. All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fei and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) moved quite well. and "soundtrack" is generous. In any case, two really funny scenes included Amy P. She's really very hilarious in an animal way. She is a blend of this jumper jumping on the SNL and Lucille Ball. I hope (Ami P and Tina Fei) just admit that they did it for money, because if they do it, she gave birth to parodies Sarah Palin, then I think we can say that, it was worth returning the black guy back to the role of a servant, who really is there to help you become more human. Blah. 4 out of 10 as I said he was generous. But no more, girls, okay? Oh, I almost forgot. The mother in the "Two and a Half Men" is in this film, and she had some sort of plastic surgery, so her mouth now looks like a 30-year-old mouth, so every scene she's in, like I'm trying to rearrange her face, or to put it in my head, or just to answer the question: "No. Wait, Wait, did she have a plastic surgery?" Because as a viewer, you really do not want it to have a plastic surgery.
