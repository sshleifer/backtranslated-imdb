Columbo films have been going downhill for years, this year it may have come to the bottom. Peter Falk gives the same non-inspiring performance and comes as creepy in this movie. As is customary in this series, crime protocol protocols are unheard of, so there is always a lack of conviction. Brenda Vaccaro chews the landscape and pulls the faces of the pantomime, and Andrew Stephens is a rather incalculable female man. (His weakness, however, was a rush!) The scenario was by numbers and its delivery. They should never have brought Columbo in the nineties; they just left us with one or two happy memories of smart complications, better scenarios and sharp characterization.
