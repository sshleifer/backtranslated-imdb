Carnosaur 3: Primal Species (1996) D: Jonathan Vinfrei. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terry J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why do you even try to look at this movie? Another stupid dinosaur film in which top secret military men uncover these deadly (and very false) prehistoric monsters that run around killing people bloody. The original was bad enough, the continuation was even worse. This is somewhere between, although it is not related to any of the previous CARNOSAUR films. RATING: 2 out of 10. Rated by R for graphic violence and blood, horrible pictures and curses.
