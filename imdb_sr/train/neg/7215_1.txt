This movie was a stupid piece of shit. Bad all. Why are we who we love Western films sentenced nine out of ten times when we rent westerns? It seems that if you do not see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner, or Tom Selleck on the cover, it's not worth a fuck. For the most part, the main action of the Siloh Falls took place in 1892, and revolving models from the 1860s were used. Even the shooting was bad - in one scene, the marshal dispersed six guns around nine times and could not hit any of the three great men who were only twenty meters away. I had to shut him down after 15 minutes of this madness. Perhaps those who took part in this movie could take some lessons in the Sunset Carson School of Acting.
