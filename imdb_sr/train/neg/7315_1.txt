OK, let's go to the point. We have five recently completed faculties (must have graduated in F words) who go out to weekend camping. They encounter someone who needs help, but instead of helping him, they decide to burn him. Nice crowd of people. Then some of them begin to get sick - it must be something in the water in the cabin they are in. However, the neighbors seem to be fine. Oh well, when things start to get really bad, they lock up their comrades instead of getting help (try your neighbor). Some locals do not like them. They jump one at high speed through the forest for many miles, until the truck breaks down. About ten minutes later, he appeared in the cabin (how he could find and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery). Another type of brain surgeon in the cabin understands that something is wrong so that he is hiding in the cave to overthrow this blow. Then he decides to return the next day to the cabin, believing it to be a sort of sanctuary. He was dizzy with the relief of surviving (he must have thought it was a 24-hour error). Unfortunately, some not so kind police officers meet him. The other couple decides to have sex while a bite eating meat is doing their own magic, and then women realize that they need to shave their legs (getting a lot of affected skin with a shaving cream). Anyway, understand. Nothing makes any sense here. This is five people I do not want to be friends with. I cheered on the bacteria that ate meat. Other characters were also presented, which were also a bit entertaining, but also quite different. Here, 90 minutes of good life has been lost.
