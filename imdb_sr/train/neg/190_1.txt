I always felt that a good movie should have a plot. This particular film was missing one time, and I think it would be more effective with the plot. It was even worse due to the fact that it seemed to last forever; I was impatient to finally end. However, I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes; It was four hours. Not only was there complication, but the film lacked a significant conflict. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I said it was until I saw "Fast and Furious." So, do not think this is my opinion from someone who needs nothing but action. Today I actually hate most of the action movies; Only this film is on the other side of the spectrum. There is not much in this film. However, the scenery and costumes were good.
