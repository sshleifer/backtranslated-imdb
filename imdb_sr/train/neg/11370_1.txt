This video contains an overwhelming way for Americans to confuse and manipulate Islam. It is a shame that the people who did this really believe that the American people are so stupid that they believe in it, perhaps as an American citizen, every person must protest against this kind of shit. If you want to know the truth about Islam, do not let anyone tell you ... KURAN PUBLIC! you can read it yourself and decide whether what they say is true or false ... Video uses many audiovisual strategies aimed at manipulating and connecting things that are not even connected. Music used in some places prepares the public to hate what they see, even if they do not understand what is happening there. They use images that are lost from their original content. To finish the comment, I would like to make a reflection ... Do not you think you can do the same movie with every religion in Warlord?
