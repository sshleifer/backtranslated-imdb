I used to think that movies require complications, or some other way to take care of the story or anything that happens. This film showed me that you really do not have to have anything like that. I could easily summarize it simply. But, IMDb wants me to have more lines. It was nice. not convincingly nor least. The way the characters speak in the movie makes you think it was supposed to happen for a few days, but there is no time and I'm pretty sure it all happens in an hour. If you want to have fun, buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before returning. It would be much better to use your time. Time you will never return. Jurassic Park 3 is pulled out better than this movie.
