Excellent CGI effects and genuine Oscar-worthy Gary Sinise as por. Day. Tom Hanks is a trick pony in this movie, as he won the best Oscar actor that year over Morgan Freeman was a crime. This film is a shocking love letter to the baby boom generation, with barely hidden right-wing prejudices, starting from Forrest's service in Vietnam to the "resolution" with Jenni Kraj. With these words, however, it's extremely fun and an American movie through and through it. I have found certain parts of this film extremely offensive, Zemeckis removes this film almost to the level of the Gump itself. . Maybe that was the goal he tried to make. Watch this movie and ask yourself: "What does Robert Zemeckis say about what makes a good American?" It seems that the forest made the "right" choice and was in the "right place at the right time" for the past 45 years. Those who mistake the vision of the director seem to pay a great price. Did Zemeckis say that idiocy is disguised as innocent and na√Øve patriotic, even American quality?
