That's "F.B.I." starring Reed Hadlei, with guest guests! The film begins with a random (appropriate?) Otmicom, which leads to one thing, and the other - which does not actually indicate the main story, which is "Great House, USA". Prison story. The story is very incredible, at the very least. It's like TV shows, just "bulliers" (at that time). OR - Actor is a trip! Imagine this: Ralph Meeker was sent to prison; His cells are the following criminals: Broderick Cravford, Lon Chanei Jr., Charles Bronson (reading "Muscle" magazine!) and Villyam Talman (reading "Detective Journal!"). Sincerely! You should know that the early scene reveals what happens to the "missing" boy, responding to the final "voice". If you do not want to have this hang-up, do not miss the opening of the scene between "Iceman" and the boy (Peter Votrian behaves well as a runaway asthmatician). *** Big House, USA (1955) Howard V.
