This must be the safest, dumbest, hottest movie of the monsters of all time. It's a complete joke that has appeared in theaters. This is like watching a monster from Loch Ness in rural America. This film deserves to be thrown into the toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, I'm ashamed of you. People involved in this moronic pile of rubbish must be lobotomized. Wait! Maybe I give them too much credit. I'm sure they were lobotomized before shooting. How else can you explain the complete and pure stupidity that contains this bucket of shit. Do not lose even a minute of your life watching this. Do not even waste time sending comments.
