I consider myself a documentary under the title Quick, inexpensive and out of control pretty interesting documentaries. The documentary contained four "mini" documentaries on four interesting men. Each of these people was extremely involved in their work, demonstrating pure love and enjoyment for their work. . They were interesting for about five minutes, after which they became annoying and lasted too long. Still, the video was shot in a very creative way. I really enjoyed the movie of one thing with a voice that is covered by others. He played great and also coincided with music.
