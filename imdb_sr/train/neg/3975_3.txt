First seen on December 7, 2002. - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Steve Purcell): Typical Mari Kate & Ashley tariff with a few more kisses. It looks like the girls are pretty tired of these things and it will be interesting what will happen to them if they ever decide to separate and go there. In this episode of their adventure, they are interns in Rome for a fashion designer who puts them right in the post office to find out what to do (I guess ..). In addition to typical flirts with boys, there is nothing but a Roman script up to about three times in the movie when it is finally revealed why they were fired, then re-engaged, then re-fired and then re-employed. This is definitely made by people who do not understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation. Perhaps the real world will be their next adventure (if any). Even my children did not care about this boring 'adventure' in the imaginary. Let's see that they have only a few years to legal adults. We'll see what happens then.
