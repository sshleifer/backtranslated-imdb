I do not know why this behavior was tolerated in the film business! This film is short (at the very least)! This is a group of 5-7 year old babies who carry large needle diapers, behave like adults (and too many). However, it is interesting because it is a good example that "good old days" may not have been so good! (Thanks to God now we have laws against this kind of material!) <Br /> <br /> {This is one short of "Shirlei Temple Festival"}
