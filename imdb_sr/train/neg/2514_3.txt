I loved Devaere in the Noir series. His talent was trivialized in "The Valtzers" aka "Going Places". Okay, that's a couple of guys who roam the conventions in absurd and inaccurate ways; Many people find that such behavior is fun. It was a boring, senseless exercise designed to shock. On Biler's face, on the face behind the camera, I'm in a hurry. The Noir series was a valid expression of personal freedom and disgusted behavior. From the first moment we see how Patric Dewar sneaks into an abandoned plot, we get the idea of ​​a wonderfully beautiful anti-hero with which we will spend the next couple of hours. When we see him drooling an unhappy middlewoman with his friend Depardieu in "Going Places," we have a fair warning that the two hours spent with these guys will be exhausting. I have a problem to even "3" for this boring distraction.
