In a deleted post from the second IMDb user, it was pointed out that anyone who could see the "Medusa Touch" should be warned on a scene that resplendently resembles the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York. But I hope that anyone who reads this will consider this warning. In spite of an interesting pedigree (producer Elliott Kastner produced "Harper" and "The Long Goodbie", co-producer Arnon Milchan co-produced "LA Confidential" nominated for the Oscars, and screenwriter John Briley won Oscars for "Gandhi") and an international actor, I discovered "Medusa Touch" to be a heavy hand, unwittingly laughing rebellions. It was a poorly directed, terribly written and acting mess. He tried to exploit the genre of tele-kinetic thrillers in the 1970s. The film fails in many points. Can you please consider "Carrie" and the underrated "The Fury" (both directed by Brian DePalma). They were two fun and exciting thrillers who dealt with the same topic.
