EXTREMITIES Image Ratio: 1.85: 1 Sound Format: Mono Woman converts tables to a potential rapist when she sets up an attack in her home, and forced is to decide whether to kill him or inform the police, in which case he could be released and again attacked. Exploitation fans who might expect another rough 'n'. the finished fantasy of DANA WOMAN (1978) rape will almost certainly be disappointed with extremes. True, the character Farrah Favcett was subjected to two unpleasant long attacks before he took advantage of his attacker (suitably slim James Russo), but the scriptwriter Villiam Mastrosimone and director Robert M. Young take these unpleasant scenes until now revealing the dilemma informing the moral core of this production. Would their final decision be kept in court? Perhaps ... On the basis of the theater performance that, as reported, left the actors of beat and bruise after each performance, the film does not attempt to open the story and instead relies on a limited environment for the main action. Acing and technical credits are fine, although Favcett's overly suppressed performance will not play effectively to viewers who can rely on it to provide the exit for their bitter indignation.
