This film has a beautiful landscape. Unfortunately there is no complication. There must be a conflict to make a plot. He did not have this film. He spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failing to ever do any activity in her. The image strives to be artistic, but does not pay attention to the basics of telling the story. If you love the Montana landscape and fly fishing, you will find some value in this movie just do not expect the story. It's gone.
