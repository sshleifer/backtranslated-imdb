** HAVE BEEN SPOILERS ** The government has continued to develop the UniversalSoldier program, now called UniSol. Soldiers are now stronger and can take more damage than before. However, the government has reduced the number of employees, the project is threatened, and the supercomputer at the center of everything feels threatened, and takes steps to ensure its own security. He activates and controls the UniSols and starts to fail. The only one who can stop them is Deverauk (Van Damme). This film is about one thing. Choreography of the fight. The story is bad and it is quickly drowning in all the battles. Whatever happens, and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately, for this movie it's not fun to watch a fight in which you know that one part of it is indestructible. You are usually quite sure that the hero will win, but you still want to feel the fighting between two slightly equal fighters. Not where someone is indestructible and can not lose. Then the fighting becomes only a means of stretching time. Wait till the last fight when Deverauk miraculously finds a way to defeat his invincible enemies. To further reduce my thinking, the desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how scarce women are. Well, there are not many of them, because the characters are the majority of men (although there is at least one UniSol woman), but almost every woman is unnecessarily shown at least once with a bra. Women's water with this, but we also go through a strip club (that we do not use any computer) with much more naked women. These moments do not give anything for the story and only are there to try to satisfy a male audience who is in love with adolescents. No more no less. Well, maybe less ... 2/10
