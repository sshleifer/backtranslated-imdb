My, how powerful they are. Kim Basinger is a great actress, but she was definitely in the hunt when she took over the role. This film is bad for one reason, especially: in the logic. It looks like one of those films that would be passable with all its holes if it appeared in the '80s and' 90s, but in 2008 it seems to be really stupid. This is the worst thriller I've ever seen and I've seen The Bone Collector and Twisted. Details from the story Della (Kim Basinger) is just getting out of shopping at a shopping mall and abusing a band of robbers killing a policeman who came to her for help. Since then, these idiotic fools have been persecuted through the abandoned street and they are released one by one with a toolbox full of tools. As I said, this movie skips the logic at every step and with the exception of Kim Basinger, the acting is made for TV bad. Damn, this pseudo thriller was made for TV bad. The way he kills each of these politically correct robbers (1 Caucasian, 1 Latin American, 1 Asian, and an African American who all come together to catch a Caucasian woman. Do not you love America?) He's ridiculous. The way she killed the Hispanic guy hystally laughed me. The sexual scene with the main hooligan was so much in the left field that it shook your head shyly. I recommend this only to fans of bad films and to anyone else. Anyone else, especially fans of Kim Basinger, would not have a good possession of this movie. You do not want to see the actress you respect in the movie this bad now? Of course not. You are warned.
