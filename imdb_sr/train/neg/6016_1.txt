This film, which is published directly on the video, should be marked with a warning label that is dangerous to human health and can subject the viewer to boredom. This is another thinly concealed, evangelizing "enthralling" religious film with good guys (believers) who suddenly disappeared and the bad guys (unbelievers) left behind. This is an interesting concept, especially because we see that it happens on a flight operated by an unbeliever who has a sinful affair with a stewardess on board (it is superfluous to say that the sinner does not disappear!). Unfortunately, since all pilots were unbelievers, the plane did not collapse or the film would be mercifully completed. Although this could have been interesting without heavy religious observation, in general, a full movie makes one clutter, the acting is horrible, and apparently computer-generated simulations look very fake. This is another film shot in Canada that allegedly represents New York. Spare me ... I'll just read the Bible.
