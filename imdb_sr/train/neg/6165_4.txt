Allen goes to the country (where she hates to go in real life) and has a weekend with her friends - what are the usual successful types of middle-class belliging that appear in many of his films. I usually find something for fun in Voody Allen's comedies, but here it really falls on the face. It seems that even the one-liners have left him. It's really not a plot (bits and pieces of cod by Shakespeare) - but it seems that Allen uses the location to provide semi-mystical air, which just makes the thing even more meaningless and half-witted. It simply does not work at any level and only has a huge borehole. The best thing about this movie (other than the credits that come to the end) is that bad criticism make it wake up and realize that simply throwing a slapdash of scenarios and throwing your friends into it does not mean fun.
