That's what critics have said about death, when it's not honest. Of course, "CHAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are literally the same film, only with variations in uncertainty. But I found "CHAOS" more enjoyable because it was fast as a kind of stupid film "Svordfish". The reason this film is more popular is that this film was released in America, and "Chaos" was broadcast worldwide at film festivals and foreign theaters, but there are still no distributors in the United Kingdom and the United States. It's true that this movie honors classic movies like DOG DAI AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, but that does not mean it's a nice movie to watch. Take care if nothing else is on TV, but you will probably get bored after some time.
