I spent nearly two hours watching the movie I thought, with all the good actors in it, it would be worth watching. I could not believe when the film was over and I had no idea what happened ... I was crazy because I could use that time to do something else .... I tried to figure it all out really did not have a clue. Thanks to those who understood it and explained .... right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything !! Who was the lady in the film with a dark hair that we saw several times while we were leaving? How did the first lady know that her husband was cheating? At the end of the film, Kate said she would eventually discover the truth. Does that mean that we will be subject to the ultimate game 2?
