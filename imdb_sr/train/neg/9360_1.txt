My score for this shit: 1/10 1 for technical only. Everything else is very bad. Another movie that does not make sense. Obviously, creating a good movie or TV script is an almost impossible mission. While it's easy to understand why politicians never tell the truth, they are among the biggest liars on the planet, it's hard to understand how to make movies so pathetic. We need to believe that taking people for morons. Perhaps this was the reason for believing, because 99% of the movies are bullshit. Because they are stupid and funny and very bad scenarios. When you look at the price you give to the Oscars, we better understand why we continue to make movies funnier than others. And it is strange enough that there has always been money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. If you still want to listen to this with ** t, press the super Fast Forward button (at least 20Ks).
