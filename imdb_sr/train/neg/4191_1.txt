I saw a lot of horror in my time, all were absurdly bad, but no one reached the depths to which this piece of garbage is descending. This film made me angry and angry as I watched him while I was trying to turn my head exactly what it was about. Now, after I saw it, I realized - in a way - what is happening and why, but the film is too confusing to be comfortable when you watch it. Yes, there are common scenes of unscrupulous violence, one-liners that show the mind-blowing insight of his characters ("The highway belongs to me ... ME!"), And enough nudity to get enough of us from "plotting", but you will leave this film feeling alone and use it, like a puppy that is no longer desirable and stays in the box next to the road. Blech.
