First, the CGI in this film was horrible. I watched her during the marathon of bad movies on the SciFi Channel. When the owner of the park died, it is probably one of the worst examples of CGI I've ever seen. Even the Night of the Living Dead had a better animation. Still, the film had no complication. Why were they special on that island? Well, it's not mentioned in the movie. And why would people constantly come to the cat's area? Does not make sense. One thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting. In "B made for TV movie", the acting was very good. Parri Shen was particularly prominent. If you do not have absolutely nothing on Saturday, watch this movie. Maybe it's good for some unforgettable quotes.
