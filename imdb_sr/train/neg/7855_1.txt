I could not believe my eyes when I was watching this movie. There is no point in blood or violence. Unlike other horrifying films that were worse and meaningful for this movie, it's just blood, blood, and killing one after the other. This movie is not interesting at all, it does not have a meaningful story or story, nor does it have intelligence in it. The blood looks very fake and this movie makes no sense at all. Do not waste time with that. It's just an hour or two of insane violence. There are many bloody scenes that are not scary, but they are just disgusting. This is probably the worst horror movie I've ever seen from all the horror movies I've ever seen.
