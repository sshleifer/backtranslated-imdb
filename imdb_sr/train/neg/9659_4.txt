After watching this movie, I'm sincerely disappointed - not for actors, stories or directors - I was disappointed with these movie ads. Trailers said that the battalion "chose the third exit". except that they surrender or die (Polish information even misunderstood that they had the choice to be killed by their own artillery or German weapons, even misrepresented the title as "wrongly installed battalion"). This shot the right place and bought a movie. The disappointment began when I realized that the third way was to sit down and count the dead bodies, then sit and count the dead bodies ... Then I started to think "hey, this story can not be so simple ... I bet this smart officer will find some cunning way to save what's left of his troops. " Well, they did not just sit and wait for something to happen. I was too. The story was based on real events from the First World War, so writers could not use their imagination much, but I even thought that this film does not really provoke, and even a little bored. And as I wrote in the first place - it's not a mistake for actors, writers or directors - their marketing people have raised my expectations high above the level that this movie can handle.
