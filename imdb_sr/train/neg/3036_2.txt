This film was absolutely horrible! I can not figure out how this movie got into production. Nothing against the acting movie, of course, it's all the fault of the writing team. You take an old average plot - let's get out of poverty and the poor - or STEP in this case. But this lacks any form of real complication - or at least one for whom it would cost anyone. With actors who speak Canadian language in what should be the American environment - this film falls very flat. In a positive way, the direction was pretty good and the cinema was quite decent. It seems that the production budget was very generous. My only request is for this team to leave the letter and find the real scenarios that will help them to transfer the words to the film. Net result - How it moves is How it is shit.
