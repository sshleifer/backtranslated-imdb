I agree that although this Melville story may be unfiltered, this is not even a credible attempt. Moving the story into the 20th century only offends the intent and nature of the original story; Perhaps you may have managed to move her to England, but that must be a period. Even our narrator of the story - the owner - says in his memory, goes even further, sometime around 1800. At the end of the 19th century, a strange disobedient worker would be dismissed without thinking. And the 20th century? Come on! Give me a cut outline !!! Even around 1800, such behavior did not work well, considering the end. And the movie ends? I do not know what that was, because I did not watch the entire travesty - I had to stop. This was like setting up "Streetcar Named Desire" in Elizabethan England.
