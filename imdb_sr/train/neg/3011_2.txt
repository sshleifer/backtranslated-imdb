I was very excited to see this film, expecting a visual trip about the relationship of artistic beauty and nature, which contains types of wisdom like "River and tide". However, I did not get it. Instead, I get a rather uninspired film about how human industry is bad for nature. This is an obviously unusual claim. The photographer looks conflicted about the aesthetic qualities of his paintings and the alleged "ethical" duty that workers who occasionally populate images along the periphery must have. And honestly, the pictures were not so impressive at all. According to this "artist," the scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful. In every way, stupid movie. For people who want to feel better in their ecological consciousness ... but not for those who want to think about the complexity of the issues that surround it.
