The bottom of the burette, the nonimaginative and practically unexpected remake of ROAD VARRIOR. This film follows the exact plot as a Philippine film STRIKER and is far worse! Bad acting, dialogue, effects, duplication, pacing, action sequence ... The list goes on and on. Italy has literally made dozens of Rip-off Road Varrior in the early 80's, some good, some bad. This is by far the worst, there's no competition. Not only is the mood of the film completely gloomy and miserable, the experience of sitting through this is boring and half-bored. There was a 1 (one) fine line for hunting the beginning of a movie, and a cool shot of a man who held a hand grenade explosion. But everything else about this movie seriously stinks! For a real fun after a nuclear movement, find a copy of ENDGAME, AFTER THE NEW YORK, OR FREE OF BRONKS. They are much better than this garbage.
