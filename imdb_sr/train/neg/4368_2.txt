This was released on DVD by Alpha, and only for the hard-core fans of Boris Carloff (as a moi). It's not about horror, but about the drama in which Boris is a scientist who is struggling to kill the husband of a wealthy woman in order to gain wealth to continue his work. But when the victim dies, changes his will and does not leave his wife anything, all hell breaks. the main Mrs. Mona Goe, who is absolutely a breakdown of laughter as a wife who has crossed twice. But continue with a lot of caution.
