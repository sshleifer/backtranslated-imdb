I rented this on a DVD and somehow I felt bad because Davson and Lugats are so serious about that in DVD reviews. That's not exactly a bad movie, but it's one of those films that desperately want to be a deep commentary on human nature without realizing that his story is a practical genre. Plus, there is little simplification on this issue in many ways, and character behavior often burdens the belief. I would say that the movie from which you would get something if you do not have lots of movies / TV / literature / life behind you (to be honest, I even saw almost the same story in a comic book with horror). Otherwise, his attitude was made more and more skillfully. And this leads to a big problem, which is that there really is not much interest in the film, except for the point. It ends up as a pretty mild movie that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and tempting, and that it will not pay off.
