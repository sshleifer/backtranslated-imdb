Let's start by saying that "JAVANI DIVANI" is just a pathetic movie. I agree with the last person who said "I missed the joy." lol. Jokes were terrible. The performances were average. Something was bad in the movie. Emraan deserved something better. All that Celina JAITLEI did was reveal. Hrishitta bhatt was OK. And Emmaan hashmi was fine. MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a desperate guy who wants to become famous. so she uses RADHA and pretends to love her, just because her father is a music director and can help him to become famous (because his father respects everything his daughter says). One day, MANN and his friends go to GOA to have fun. There he meets ROMU (CELINA JAITLEI) and completely falls on her look and tries to flirt with her BLA BLA BLA. Then, that night ROMA can not open the door to your room, and MANN decides to help her. Seeing that he can not, ROMA goes to ask for help. As she disappeared, MANN was able to open the door and decided to come in and sit on the bed BLA BLA BLA. ROMA is coming and have one night. However, in this one night stand ROMA falls in love with him. That morning they noticed the don don (MAHESH) who sees it all. Don loves ROMA and could not bear what he saw. He orders them to marry and be scared, MANN complies with the order and Merri's ROM. Then marriage news ends in the papers. MANN later learned that he loved ROMA after making a video together. Now he is trapped between love and glory. BLAH BLAH BLAH. The film is terrible. The songs "SINI NE SINI NE" are fantastic, the remix version is even better. "DIL DIVANA" is also great. The title song is also great. Guys, avoid watching this movie.
