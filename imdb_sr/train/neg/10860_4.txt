This was a disappointing film for me. He came to me through a package in a box called "Classic Film Noir", which was a gift from someone who knows that I usually enjoy movies in that style (I insist that noir style, not a genre). I do not think it's a noir movie at all. It seems that these days there is a tendency for every black and white B film, made from 1947 to 1955, to be labeled and sold as noir, and the label does not always answer. There are persecuted male protagonists, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and most of the film takes place indoors. These are just the only noir elements I could see. There's no pervading paranoia, or any real reason why we should be sympathetic to Ed Cullen. Jane Viatt was overburdened and unconvincing as femme fatale. I do not want to spoil this movie for potential viewers. However, I would be interested to hear about what other film-makers have to say about it.
