Reading all these positive reviews, I find myself confused. How come that many enjoyed what I consider to be a poor adaptation of my other favorite romance, Jane Austen? There are many movie problems, which have already been mentioned in several reviews; Simply put, it's hammed-up, over-acted, chintzi messing from opening a loan to a delayed ending. worthy of them, the worst is Paltrow. I very enjoyed her performance in some roles, but here she is disgusting - she is self-aware, nasal, down and completely separate from her characters and those around her. Extremely disappointing effort - although even the perfect Emma could not preserve this film.
