Great cast. Great acting. An unpredictable story for the first half of an hour or so. I really wanted to know what would happen to each of these elusive characters, and how their seemingly different lives would intertwine. But when the writers removed the glue to start linking the players, they misused the super glue and brought the movie to a standstill in the last two hours. I always thought it would be better, but only worsened. I do not believe in reviews. This is a waste of time. Think about it - Tom Cruise has become ugly - why? Beautiful Hunki bartender wearing shoulder straps - why? I know it had to do with the plot, but without them, at least, would be an attractive member to remember.
