I'm sorry, guys, I already wrote my opinion on this film, but today it was the first day I looked at some other critics. There are many people who agree with me, but what is scary is that there are some people who really love this movie. I do not like to write bad reviews or criticize the opinions of other people, but I think it is fair to warn anyone who could argue about whether or not to see this film. This is not a good movie. I really love movies and watch only about everything, but this film has reached an incredibly short list of movies I watched and I was happy to go halfway. If you're really incredibly tempted, watch the trailer ... it's a mistake I made because the entire movie is essentially a trailer ... there's no surprise after that, just a shocking bad dialogue that wastes time. I love Michael Vartan in Alias ​​and I hate to criticize him, but I think it's my duty to stop other people spending their lives on a movie like this !!
