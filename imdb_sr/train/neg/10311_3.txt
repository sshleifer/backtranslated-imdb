SPOILER ALERT In this generic and forgetful action movie, Lorenzo Lamas runs his usual stupid guy / handsome boy, and his future real life, ek Kathleen Kinmont, is the ass of Hot Chicken Alec. OJ Simpson is a detective, visiting him since then disappearing a genius public figure. Translation: cable TV charger. There is not enough skin to qualify as Guilti Pleasure. The script has some open holes. Best / Worst Moment: In a non-compliant scene, OJ's partner expresses his aversion to the morgue. OJ replies that some bodies are quite hot, or the words in that sense. This unclear reference to necrophilia is insulting enough; but in the light of the murders committed shortly after the film was released, it's really horrifying, and therefore fun in an unintentional, horrible way. I was so surprised that I smiled until my champagne came out of my nose. Now it's a pleasure. BC
