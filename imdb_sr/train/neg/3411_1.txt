Mix exotic tropical locations, scarves in scarce clothes, explosions, clumsy clones Dudley Do-Right, starring Martin Sheen, few martial arts and sexy villains (Traci Lor .... Hey, sorry ... Seek ELIZABETH Lords) and you think you'll be at a party. Not like that! This is a gloomy TV movie, and although he likes to promote himself as "Charlie's Angel", it's not nearly as good as the original series, and even not a nasty, irreversibly stupid, recent C.A. movies. This horror is best described as the Third Class Andi Sidaris film. Nowhere is it as fun as Andy's "Hard Ticket To Havaii", although some of the fighting scenes are decent enough. Girls spend too much time on posing and trying to look exaggerated, and after a while it gets bored. There are better genres that this is there. Oh ieah, and "babes" are not as hot as they like to think they are. Terrible music ... when it's there.
