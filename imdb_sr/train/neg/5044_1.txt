I was looking forward to watching this film after reading a positive review at the New York Times. In addition, I am also Shanghai, so there was more than a passing interest in the topic. However, after I watched it, I was extremely disappointed. The film tempo was extremely slow and monotonous. The director has long been in certain scenes. There was no passion or chemistry among lovers. It was hardly a dialogue. Dialogue was very needed to offset the lack of action. At the end of the film, you have not felt any compassion for the characters. This film was missing in everything. The scenario was weak, the performance was bad, and there was no editing. The director tried to mimic certain movie styles noir, but failed. A good movie is one in which your attention is drawn, maintained, and successfully completed without the feeling that time has passed. This film felt like it would never end. Do not spend money on this movie.
