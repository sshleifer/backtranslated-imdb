The mood of this film is pretty good and records a good feeling of the 80's with some good performance. However ..... The script runs a mill with the exception of a few comedic moments and turns out to be a strange place where I expect it was intended to be nervous. The characters are completely above dramatized and incredible and full of right-wing clich√©s written by the scenario writer, probably watching the panoramic documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is that this movie has no real story. This marks all the real "artistic" boxes, but nothing actually happens, and in the end you are wondering what the point is. Very disappointing
