I finally thought someone would justify the classic H.G. Vells, not the second version set in the wrong place or era, but firmly grounded on the book. Well, it definitely follows the book very closely, and that's the only plus for this mess. This is a long 180 min (yes 3 hours), the book is only about 150 pages. If Timothy Hines had the courage to come here and say "if you can do better ..." I would say "yes, I could" and I never used a video camera or was in any type or a drama school in my life. I paid good money to shift this shit to UK from the US, I do not make the same mistake as I did.
