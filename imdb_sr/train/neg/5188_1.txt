TV pilots, do not you like them? Kuinn Martin tried this after being successful in a bunch of other TV detective films, but this does not go anywhere except in the MST domain where he belongs. Roi Thinnes is a diamond head who receives orders from Aunt Marie to find a super spy Lovejoi, I mean the Tree. Zulu and Tso-Tsing are here due to ethnic comical recovery, not much. Wood is shit like a bad guy in spite of all his disguises, which makes him look exactly the same as usual. There are more unnatural clothing fibers than you can imagine (it takes in the 1970s) and the performance itself is so anti-climatic. Why did not he go to the series? You realized, he's pretty attacked. Again it's fun for MST, but not much else !!
