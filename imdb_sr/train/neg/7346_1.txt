I feel like I've just watched a snuff movie ... great acting, tense, amazing and terrible thing! Two hours of litany of perversions in the most basic and comprehensive sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, extortion, incest, corruption, live burial and abuse, abuse, abuse. No redemption. And I was having fun. I could not stop watching. What is this about me, about the people who create and act in such things, and to the world that has become so insensitive that finally real snuff films will be the norm. And I'm neither puritan nor humorous, I'm not trying to hide from the existence of darkness, and I definitely did not lead a protected life, but I'm ashamed of myself. And I'm sorry to see my British relatives pulling sewage materials in the way my tribe does it. It does not have to be comfortable, but does it have to be true in submissive sadism?
