I hated this film so much that I remember it clearly. It's not even funny. Any film that relies on non-binding sexual jokes and humor for racism does not deserve money that it costs to make it. In the first half an hour, Rob Schneider drinks a box of inflamed milk. All I could imagine is "he deserves it, he made such a bad movie." Do not waste time and money on this.
