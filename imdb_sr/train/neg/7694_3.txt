If you are not twelve, this movie really does not pay off. It's obviously a low budget movie with B actors and a genre like a fantasy that sometimes requires intensive CGI work that's not good. I knew it would be bad when I rent it. I enjoy laughing bad films. I did not know how bad it was. This is tolerable until after 2 hours it starts to burn. Combat styles go between a normal fight that respects the laws of physics and wire struggles. There is no real explanation for the transition. There is a plot, but once again, it's obviously a children's movie. It seems that there are explicit moral lessons on the days that are being transmitted, such as Sesame Street or something like that. It is tolerable. But much better if you are, say, nine.
