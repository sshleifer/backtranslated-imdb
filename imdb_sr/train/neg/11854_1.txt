For my life, I can not understand good reviews about this piece of shit. It was meaningless. Matthev Modine was terribly wrong as a leading female man. Gina Gershon, well, others said that, but I will repeat, why stupid accent? Totally unnecessary. And her acting was just bad. I do not know if she was thrown out of accent, or what. There was no chemistry between the two. And the girl in which Modine was in love, suddenly pushed her half-salad into her mouth and acted stupidly? Where did this come from? I think we should have pity on her while we saw her marriage with a radocholar begin to disintegrate, but honestly, I do not care for any of these people.
