A slightly awkward spy mystery with a predictable plan for the dangers of the Second World War. The mystery is whether or not Jane Graistone (Nancy Coleman) has amnesia. Best actor is Raimond Massei as dr. Ingersoll, a good doctor turned into evil. He is the boss of a spy ring who is trying to get information from Jane amnesia, encrypted information related to related activities. Will he say? Can he remember? Moroni Olson (like Mr. Goodwin) is convincing as Massey's accomplice. The role played by John Garfield (as Dr. Levis) is nothing more than a catastrophic one. It seems so bad that casting is considered one of the worst in film history. It's sad that such a talented actor is drawn into a role that does not match his talents. The film is worth a glance, despite half the spy and semi-gangster film and despite the parade of stereotyped characters. It's easy to forget this, amnesia is not needed.
