"Children like these" could have been a decent movie, given the topic. But, instead, it has become an under-weekly TV movie of the week, without much. The act is stagnating, the action is predictable and the route does not exist. For a better movie about the same topic, try the excellent "Le Huitieme Jour", a movie that really care for people with Dovn syndrome. In "Kids Like This" they are only used as an excuse for pay sentimentality. Pretti appalling. 1/10
