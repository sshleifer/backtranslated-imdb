Excuse me for missing something? Did I get out early? The first ten minutes of unusual (and untrue!) Story thought: "This will be a classic" But from there everything was downhill! The acting was brilliant, for which it's worth it, Villiam H Macie is fantastic, and it's getting better and better every movie I watch. I waited for a great moment in which all the stories were interconnected, and then suddenly .... that was if the writer said: "I went deep down so I can pull all of those stories together smartly ... Oh, God, it will just drop the frog." I love smart movies, I love strange movies, but this was just strange and boring. 4/10
