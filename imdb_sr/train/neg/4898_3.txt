Vaivard Cloud is a frustrating movie for watching. Incredibly enigmatic, treats every shot as an artwork. The impression is that the composition of each shot is designed and prepared with a certain degree of exceptional care that borders with obsession; Expressing how much cinema has progressed since the first films appeared in the nineteenth century and imitated their construction, the camera is rarely moved here? except during the camp and colorful music numbers. The ambient noise is reduced to a minimum and the word is scarcely pronounced. This unusual but effective device forces the audience to focus its attention only on visual stimuli, so that even as the story progresses at the foot of the crab, we feel immersed. Unfortunately, at least for me, this immersion starts to fade somewhere around the mark of an hour. I started to feel like the film causes me to continue watching, as I get harder until the minute draws, so the act of watching has become a battle of will. To content this film was not as sexually, it would undoubtedly be even more blurry for Western audiences. As it is, there are abundant female nudity and sexual abuse on an unconscious (or perhaps dead) woman who is so disgusting, while she can talk about the degradation that pornography is subjected to by men and women (users and used), he is so exaggerated in the way he chooses its point to effectively make it ineffective. Of course, the worst and most exciting participants in the explosion in available pornographic content will look for this movie for the wrong reasons and watch it with its sticky finger on a quick remote. For all his problems, the film has definitely stayed, and the more you think about it, the more meaningful it makes some aspects. Ironically, for a film in which so little happens, the viewer is likely to be proportionally rewarded by watching another or even the third time. But for me, however, once was enough?
