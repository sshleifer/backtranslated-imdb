The act that has disappeared and stinked due to irreconcilable differences in opinion was condemning the desolation with one side of the pro-life, and the second destroyer of the demonic seed. The horror was left out and replaced by the total boring effect that probably meant to be horrifying, but instead showed a sick dose of faith that was laughing until death, despite the title itself. Being a fan of the Masters of Horror from the beginning, this ridiculous plot with its dirty looks broke up like a spindle old rocking chair after sitting. I'm looking at this episode as if it was thrown together from the very beginning, I never really go anywhere else but to see it through what is worth and get rid of it when it finally came to the "end" ..
