Deadli Vake is the perfect movie for film students ... to learn how to NOT shoot a movie! Let's see ... what did the crew ruin in this movie? The worst music The worst montage The worst script The LARGEST DIRECTIVE The worst acting The worst choreography The worst cinema The worst ad Worst setting The worst setting The worst setting The weakest setting Worst setting The worst setting The worst setting The worst setting The worst setting The worst setting The worst setting The worst setting The worst setting The worst setting Worst setting Worst setting Worst setting Worst setting Worst setting Worst post Worst item to item Worst Worst Worst item item item Worst Worst Worst item item item Worst Worst Worst setting item. ... it would still be terrible. All scenes are gloomy (lighting people calling it "black"), often the music party drowned in curved dialogues, which was fine because no one ever uttered two whole sentences without long pauses for the effect. "The evil" robot was hilarious ... what was that? Jazz dance? Oh ... I guess it should have been tactical or something. I'm sure she's got a fear in the heart ... of the poor editors. And, how are you making so many shots? It is not possible. Garbage is garbage, no matter how you connect it. How has anyone ever managed to go through the dailies? The bottom line is - I could not bear to watch more than 15-minute segments, it was so bad ... but I saw the whole thing (with pauses of the lot) just to see if it had anything at all what good parts. NOPE! NO ONE! Perfect example of how not to make a movie ... must be seen for every serious student of the film !!!
