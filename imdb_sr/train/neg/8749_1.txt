A terrific film as everyone said. What made me laugh was the humorous performance of Scott McNealy, who awarded the award to one of the killed programmers in front of the Wall of the logo of the SUN. McNeali is the executive director of SUN Microsystem, a company that is practically defined by its hatred of Microsoft. They were critical in filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft. So, were they stupid enough to think that this bad movie would add fuel to that fire? I do not see a public record of the involvement of the SUN, but it's clear that the creators of this film know Scott McNeali. An interesting mystery.
