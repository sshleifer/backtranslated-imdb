I loved the original story, had very high expectations of the movie (especially because Barker talked about it in interviews), finally saw him and what to say? It was a total MESS! The director was everywhere, the acting was terrible, the visuals and choreography were only flat, empty and completely unnecessary (what happens to generic music video techniques such as speed forward-slow and meaningless? It was not necessary in this movie and cheaper vibration in some stupid MTV Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo video spot). While some of the killings are pretty cool and brutal, some are just funny (the first murder of a Japanese girl was hilarious and Ted Reyi's death was just stupidly funny). He just runs all over the place with zero tension and tension, completely distancing himself from the original story, and then returning to it in a finale that only feels until then that he is screwed up even more. I was not given any explanation, I think I knew what was going on only when I read the story, but for people who were not even more confusing, as sometimes I did not even know where it was going and what it was trying to do - all the time unfolded on a crazy tangent. My God, I really wanted to like this movie as a great fan of Barker's work and I liked the story because it has a huge potential for shooting a movie, hell, I even enjoyed some of Kitamura's films as fun romps, but this film just echoed from amateurism and stupidity from the beginning to the end - I did not care for anyone or anything, the whole thing rushed and the real source broke down, turning it into something completely different. It was permitted that was bad, and Vinnie Jones played a great ass, but everything else was everywhere, more than disappointing. Gutted
