This film is sucked. The act was exhausted, the script was sucked, and the film was completely sucked. There were two themes in the film that were not developed and the viewer had to work a little to find out what was going on. I do not say it should be written, but you suddenly discover that things are happening and that you are told that you have the slightest clue about what they are. Examples: <br /> <br /> Negative heroin comments on the hero. The audience never showed how he knew about the boy at all and how he was related to her fateful death. The viewer has minimal exposure and his death. Also, suddenly there appeared a scene with a bunch of guys loading and shooting from the machine gun, and that's all you see before you interrupt other scenes. There is no explanation of what-ever-about guns and people with them. We gave him 3 because we did not feel like we wanted our time back. It was fun to watch a movie while watching a movie, and at least some of us entertained it. ;-)
