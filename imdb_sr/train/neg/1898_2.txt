Remake H.B. Halicki's classic film from the 1970s is simply terrible. Together with Vanishing Point, Gone and 60 Seconds are an essential film about car driving. Remake takes the original and puts it on the head. While Halicki gave us 75% of the chase by car and 25% of supporting drama, in GISS 2000 we get 25% of cars and 75% support drama. Cage like a great man, saves his brother, loves a girl. MTV edits, tits and ass. Save money, rent original. At least Halicki did not live to see his baby (he wrote, produced, directed and acted in the '74' film) degraded in this way.
