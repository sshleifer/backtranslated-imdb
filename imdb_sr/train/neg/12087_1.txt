I've seen all kinds of Hamlets. Kenneth Branagh was the most ambitious, Mel Gibson was quick and to the end, Laurence Olivier was the best - hands down. But now we come to the point that Makimilian Schell takes over Bard. First of all, this is a synchronized version of German TV production by renowned chemist Villiam Shakespeare. But if there is a somewhat slower, poorer, more lethargic and worse version, it has to behave at the level of primary school. Seeing this on MST3K helps, with Mike and robots who are taking good-looking good blows with an old boy, penetrating the depth of black-and-white television, Shakespeare and the wisdom (?) Of the Germans playing the England game and seems to be like Ingmar Bergman refused. Of course, the best parts are MST rifles. The best lines? "I will rid the Great Dane," "I do not think so," take a break, "Meet the Beatles," "Hey, Dad, will you help me with my scientific project," and, my personal favorite, during the party - "Garrison Keillor leaves Germany (IAAAI !!) ". But there's also Schell, who plays Shakespeare's greatest character, just like a doll of department store, just not so expressive. There is no doubt he's a great actor, but here comes Paul Nevman in "Silver Chalice." Have you ever seen it? You GOTTA are watching these two on a double account! In the end, this is one case where it is true that in It's much better just to read the book. At least the book is not named by Richard Montalban. One star only for this "Hamlet"; ten stars, of course, for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> <br /> /> Good night, not so sweet prince.
