We're getting frozen for 15 years, that's unlikely. It's falling in the star ... incredible. Falling in the day when it becomes a supernova and explodes ... funny. Saved by the boat right then ... priceless. No, it's not golden gold Beeblebrook. It is not even the winner of the Parent of the Year Award. After convicting her daughter for two years of females in a deserted spaceship, her mother is encouraged to get drunk and leave alone with the strange man they picked up. This points to their strength in hand-to-hand combat, which makes most of the action of the movie. Fighting accents include, for example, a face-to-face psycho speaking to a woman while blindly pointing the gun behind him to another about six centimeters away, which is necessarily simpatic in the fire line. In the end, a family of three leaves a large-size ship that they plan to use to observe the supernova until the last moment, because it is too slow to avoid a wave of explosion, instead of using a psycho-combat boat filled in a minute with a 1600 pounds of gas fuel from a 0.7 kiloton rocket. You must love these hard science-fiction statistics! As long as Hollivood treats writing as an irrelevant flute, they will continue to make films that are not suitable for running at 3 o'clock in the morning on the Sci Fi channel.
