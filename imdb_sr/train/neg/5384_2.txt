All Hype! What is the better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can not publish their movie through the main distributor? Accordingly, they do it themselves. Otherwise, the movie film does not justify the content in the movie. The story is absent and it could easily be short. The acting is bad, but animation and music are pretty good. Otherwise, do not waste time - do not believe hyper-u! However, if you have the opportunity to watch a movie for free, do it. Then you will not have to spend money. Still, filmmakers do their story well and create cliffs with their mini-series. Otherwise, they are one of the miracles that never hit.
