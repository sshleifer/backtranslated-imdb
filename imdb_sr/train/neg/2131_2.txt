I wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist (as this film is published), but this one has failed me. For me, the plot was a bit confusing to follow and quickly lost interest. I'm sorry that John Kuzak, Joan Kusak, Ben Kissley, Marisa Tomei and Hilary Duff joined in this film. I will remain a fan of all of them, but only time can cure my feelings for this. The only thing I can say positively about the film is that Hillary played the Ionic character so well that I did not even recognize Hillary; I needed several scenes to understand that it was her. Fortunately, I rented it for $ 1 via Red Bok; If I paid to see him on the big screen, I would really be embarrassed !!
