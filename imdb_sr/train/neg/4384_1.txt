The fact that someone really spent money on such a bad script is beyond me. This must be one of the worst movies, in addition to the "Haunted Highway" I've ever seen. BAD actors, and a really bad story. There are no normal reactions to any of the events in this movie, and even though Halloween is the night, normal people would have greater reactions when they saw that their father had been killed, not to mention that they had been thrown out, people with tapes covering their respiratory tract , can not breathe (in a room with at least 50 people I could add) and a person dressed as Satan who pulls dead people out of his house, even an 8-year-old will see the difference between a doll and a person. Not to mention the fact that no one can be so naive and foolish to believe in the reality of Satan and Jesus' appearance on the same day as the boy does. When I was 8, I had more brain than that. But, it's really stupid that everyone else looks as if they fall to this no-frills look, also, without question. The question in the whole movie is, is it truly Satan, or is it some crazy man who kills people whenever he feels so? Well, he has human hands, hands, built and everything else, so I guess he should be in the movie, otherwise they did it a bad job hiding him. Then, with that person who was a man and all this, he was able to kill the old woman, the man and his mistress, 5 (!!) policemen (all with weapons and training and assumption), and several other people. .... and apparently everyone was just standing there and waiting for him, or what? The whole concept and way of telling stories is absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen, and I would never recommend it. anyone loses 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to watch this whole shit.
