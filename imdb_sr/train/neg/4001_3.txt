After I heard so much about the Cracker series of the 1990s, but I did not see them, I was eagerly waiting. Surely the combination of Jimmy McGovern and Robbie Coltrane could not make a mistake. How I made a mistake! Polemics, supported by frequent, repetitive and violent flashbacks, were irresistible. The production was trying to be super-modern, but the flashes and even the childish irritated. Robbie Coltrane spent two hours sleeping in unexplained and incredible "insights," and the police were portrayed as one-dimensional messy idiots. As a result, the tension never built up and the scene that follows to the end (without the details of fear of spoilers) was such a funny piece of television drama I've been watching for a long time. > No, I do not want to see them anymore, but I'll be back on 1990's DVDs to see if they're in the right place for their reputation.
