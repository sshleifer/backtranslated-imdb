What was the purpose of this film? What was the action? I do not know. Shak can not work, people do not know how to direct, and I'm Kazaam! The raging spirit? Come on. Maybe Eminem or Linkin Park will be in a movie like this one. I remember seeing this only to kill time. I did not care. I only remember thinking: "Who put Shaka in this movie?" The whole story also looked stupid. It does not make any sense. I guess the unrealized morale of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and everything can happen. I can not comment much more, because this film is so awesome that nothing is worth commenting on. "I want" this film to disappear.
