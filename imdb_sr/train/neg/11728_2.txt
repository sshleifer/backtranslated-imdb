Previously they enjoyed Vesle Snipes in several stocks and I expected much more, even with 5.8 IMDb, the movie does not manage to entertain and even though the story is lean and non-original, the action is unfortunately thinner and goes on to emulate the "worst-case scenario" of playing "strong" feelings followed by some bad acting ... Do not waste your time this movie is not fun, if you want to cry, it may still be enough, although your tears will be cries for seeing Vesely Snipes in a tragic action movie comedy comedy ... I give this 2/10 it really was awful, if you want to see it a decent movie go to see a shooter or rent it, its good things this movie is not.
