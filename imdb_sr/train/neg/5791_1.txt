As a Native Film professor, I can honestly say that this may be one of the worst movies with Native content I've ever watched. I'd rather get a channel for the root than to look at this movie again. The use of stereotypes, non-creative attempts to use parts of traditional coyote stories and poor camera work has only been exacerbated by the illusion of an unrealistic story and a bad scenario. The writer and director displayed the worst parts of the colonized approach to showing people and communities. If this person is natural, they must return home and apologize to anyone they know are apple and for internalized racism and a bad sense of humor that they have developed. If this person is non-national, they must seriously re-examine their white privileges and ask themselves if they show unexplored, unintentional racism, or if they are deliberately ignorant. My only hope is that domestic actors in this movie have had a good time and at least they have been paid for their efforts. If you want to see good Native movies then check out: Christmas in the clouds, Dancing me outside, Medicine River, PovVov Highway, Smoke Signals ... to mention only some.
