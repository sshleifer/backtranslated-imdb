Well, here we have another film about changing the role. It's worth a look, despite the tiring complication of turning poles. However, this is not. In previous reviews, I think I emphasized the general decline in enjoyment for Haim films that followed in the late 80's. This is one of them. Only one of the girls is about high school student (Corei Haim) who tries to avoid her bully by dressing as a girl and attending another school. He joins a group of fans and makes friends with his fellow cheerleader, Marie (Nicole Eggert). Apparently, he can not keep the barrage too long. I thought this film was an ultimate crap, and it's not even funny. But, according to most reviews, it seems that fans of Alanis Morrisette or teenage queen of sex, Nicole Eggert, are the only ones who would like to watch this. If you are looking for a good Haim function (or a comedy to change the role), do not look any further since 1989. This is about the fact that Haim's career has failed.
