To quote the movie, "It's better not to know it. It's better to forget, best of all to be abandoned." Oh, irony. The story of ghosts with all the technical improvements of a Hollywood horor movie, but a scary bad dialogue after the first quarter of the movie, and you feel like you were preaching from the Beginning. It's as if the cumulative dialogue of writers can be summed up by a bad cop on television and Jerry Springer's broadcast. Perhaps, for a movie like Hitcher, not as a Russian horror movie. The result is that the potentially great environment and some potentially large scenes lose energy and become just silly, not scary or meaningful.
