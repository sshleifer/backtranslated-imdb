Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this film. He's barely in it. Most of the time the screen is dominated by optional jokes. One moving gag is that the character is called Jerk Off. There is also a lot of erection, where the hit line is someone who has an erection. This movie is so fun as the British convincingly. Unfunny jokes. But, besides terrible writing, the movie is also poorly directed and the acting is terrible. Also, this film makes an old bad comedy clich√© that has many famous actors from B-film. Harland Villiams, Gilbert Godfried, Randi Kuaid and Phil La Mar. These are just some of the people who spend more time on the screen than Rodney, although he is the main character. Do not be surprised when you find this movie in a drugstore that sells five dollars. And that's too much.
