I was expecting various Sci-fi and thriller movies this summer, but I was so disappointed with this film. While some people left the film, I decided to stay, just to laugh together with other viewers on the acting, lack of uncertainty, ridiculous end and difficult to follow the story. I found myself almost as confused as the main character in the film. The only quality of the film he bought was a soundtrack. This is one of those old movies that they later complained. In retrospect, I would not even rent this, let alone pay more than $ 5.
