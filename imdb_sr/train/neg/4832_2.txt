I was intrigued to see that the little-seen 2008 movie somehow won the Oscar for the Best Picture in 2009 and so went to see The Hurt Locker. Unfortunately, all I got for the two hours invested was a grim confirmation that this film won awards exclusively for reasons that are not on the screen. The direction and visual style of this movie are some of the weakest ever you will see. when he is not busy yet again, Bourne Identify Hommage with a terrible, annoying "shy" visual display, he shows all the characteristics of a daily second-rate soap opera in terms of healing. The "plot" is sketchy, the features are so well developed as the rejected Beetle Bailey strip comics ideas and dialogue - in cases where the film refuses to be "minimalist" and without apparent reason converts one or two soldiers in real conversations - this is some of the worst ever recorded. Fair enough, actors are doing the best they can in the given circumstances, just not enough to hide how bad the project is. The whole movie has the feeling that it is conceived as some kind of "mockumentary" that they were closed with humor and that they were so redacted that they could take it as a serious drama. If you spend two hours on this movie, they are two hours never Go back, and two hours are lost that you will regret for the rest of your life.
