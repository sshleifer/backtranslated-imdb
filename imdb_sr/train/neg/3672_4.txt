I watched the entire film recognizing the participation of Villiam Hurt, Natascha McElhone and Desiree Nosbusch. I'm glad I had no idea about the presence of Peter Weller. At the end of the film I said, "That was Peter Veller?" Honorable Mr. Veller for outstanding performance. Veller played a great character, and his performance was such that I did not even recognize him. , are subpar. The scenario and the environment were interesting, and Veller was incredible. 4 stars, from possible 10.
