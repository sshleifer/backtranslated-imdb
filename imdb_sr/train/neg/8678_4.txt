After watching "The Bodiguard" last night, I felt compelled to write a review. It could have been a pretty decent movie that there was no terrible work with cameras. It was embarrassing. The corners were wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during the sequence of the fight. In the big plan it was even terrible. The story of Sonny Chiba is hired as a bodyguard to anyone who wants to bring him to the top of the drug. He approached Judy Lee, who is never quite right with Chiba. Lee's involvement in drugs is deeper than Chiba thought, as if the mafia and another gang of criminals were behind her. Given the better direction and editing, I'm sure this would be a classic Kung Foo movie. As it is, it looks more like another action movie with the sixties. It has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Rating: 4 out of 10
