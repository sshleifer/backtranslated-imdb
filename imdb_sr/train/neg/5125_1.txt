As a young pastor I heard good things about this film. Then I looked at him. The act was not the best. That's forgiven. This is a message that is not: Give Jesus your life and everything will change - you will better get caught, create a stunning catch, stop loathing, start making touches, even make a play. All because Jesus is magically turning the terrible weak weak into the athletic athletes. I laughed loudly when the coach quoted a letter to explain to the kicker why he missed the goals on the field. But wait, that's not all. You will get a brand new truck, a $ 6000 raise, and you and your wife in the fight against infertility will suddenly end up in pregnancy - twice. Then you win the national championship because God helps the weak hit of the winning goal at 12 yards more than he ever shot before - and the wind, nothing less - all because "God wanted to do it." Then you will win the national championship next year. None of these good things would have happened if the team did not choose to follow Jesus, their whole heart. Here's what I took from the movie: God can do everything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and all is to make our lives better, easier and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win games. Which Bible is this story? I bet that Saint Stephen wanted to know the keys to such a secure life before he was stoned to death. Someone had to make this film before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for Jesus. That would save them a lot of trouble.
