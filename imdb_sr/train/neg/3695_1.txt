It's not the best of acting movies. The director concentrated on acting glory, not on a good entertainer. It can be a hero himself, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it. But definitely not worth the neutral audience. Music is average. This film was the biggest flop for the actor. Despite the hyper-incarnation of the film, the film collapsed. Do not even think about watching this move even if you want to kill time. Instead, you can watch some cartoons. A good movie lover can not digest this shit for 2 1/2 hours.
