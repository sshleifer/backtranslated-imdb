What an incredible fall for Sean Ellis. You gathered a bunch of your friends at home, everyone who was banging around Sean Ellis's work. You have an unclear idea of ​​conspiracy, there are no spoilers that could kill the party, very high expectations. It's late at night, the perfect atmosphere for a movie of this kind. 15 minutes pass and you begin to tell yourself that it is compulsory to pick up, at 25mins you begin to wonder if you should just go to bed and save this for the second time when you can fully appreciate the expected, not existing subtle touches. Over half an hour you realized that half of your audience who had already been asleep was already sleeping and called the day. A few days later, when you exhaust all other material to watch, go back to this, this time in the middle of the day, hoping that your mood will keep you awake this time. 10 minutes later, you are rapidly progressing in incredible and unnecessarily long interstate crossings and pictures. All other things I'd already give up, but there is a refund of money and his inheritance. But this legacy can only carry you for so long, this is a new level of boring creation of a film, imagine a short story that has expanded to a novel with only descriptions, that is what it is. Honestly throwing out there is not any cinema that leaves you in awe like cashback. There are movies that annoy you, there are movies that lack certain aspects, or they are just messy, unfortunately this is just a waste of time. Final words, go away.
