Make your mind. I personally thought it fun as I received Stevie Wonder's spine. No offense, Mr. Wonder. Maybe it was a comedy, but I realized it was stupid. Not the very first two choices for keeping your children; VÃ©eler (Seann Villiam Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two sellers of energy drinks, ordered to mentor two children from a development center led by Gaile Sweeney (Jane Linch) to prevent prison sentences. One of the unmanaged is Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), fifth mayor, and the other Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a shy young man who plays in the fantasy medieval world. Vheeler and Danny desperately try to give their costs an invaluable inner look on life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is ridiculous with his analogies with a dry spirit. Supports are: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kennei-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Vain.
