As I said, the book was pretty good and it may have been a good movie that Melissa Gilbert was not so terrible and incredible in the guide. What was the accent? It sounded the same as her terrible Russian accent in the second movie I saw in her. It took me three attempts before I was able to watch the whole movie. Brad Johnson was as good as others. I really liked the scene on the beach. They added something much needed illumination to distract you from Melissa Gilberts depressed image. I think they could take advantage of the San Francisco views more to their advantage. It looked like night scenes were actually SF, but I can make a mistake. I do not recall that the character in the book is depressed. Please keep Melissa Gilbert from all future movies that require accent!
