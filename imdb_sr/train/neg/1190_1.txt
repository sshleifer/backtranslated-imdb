Poor Bobbi "Pineapple Salsa" Flay and Mario Batali bring this. The bottle is the worst. Definitely a trick pony, I think they could bring other American chefs to come to the table on this as Iron Chefs. The kind of dishes that this duo really makes ... does not think about the creativity of the original Iron Chef series. I do not think Batali went to the cooking school. There are many great chefs in America, I'm just wondering why they do not appear on the food network. It would also help to have more regional ingredients and possibly co-hosts that can cope with the pressure. I like Alton Brovn, but he's a little frivolous for this role.
