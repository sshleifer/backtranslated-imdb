Jumped as the MOST NORMAL FILM AND GUARANTEED FOR ANY SPEECH - Guess what? It worked, I'm insulted that we set up the money to rent this. Two friends and I were boring and we decided to see if it was all bullish about the movie we saw on TV of the truth. Damn Comedy Central and all the other networks that are pushing us this garbage! It was by far the worst movie I ever saw from Holl Man. I mostly avoid fucking, but I got into this one. Since then, we have been hitting a dick that suggests we rent it, and his filming privileges have been abolished. There's nothing funny in this movie ... even the "adventures of the Dickman" scene were at best sophomoric. Color me p *** ed. I thought that the value of shit production for some important reason ... no ... I was just sucking. NEVER SEE! for any reason. Even with abundant quantities of illegal substances, this film would not be ridiculous. It's ALOT. Please for the love of everything that is sacred, if you nourish your common sense - never watch this movie. That's a lot of things - stupid, meaningless, and worthless to mention just some. But the main thing he was trying to: insultingly ridiculous - it was poor. Crash and burn ....
