Do you want to know the secret of filming a movie movie at the fitness center? Just insert a movie with lovely ladies in super-tight clothes for training and ask them to fall and melt on the floor as if they were in a gentleman's club. That's what the creators of this terrible film made, and that little trick kept me in the eye until the end. This is the worst slasher movie I've ever seen, but every time I was ready to switch the channel, I would add another scene with the girls for exercise and I would stay. As a slasher movie, Killer Vorkout fails in each category. As a showcase for the beautiful girls they work, it's a success. A strong recommendation to avoid, unless you think that half of the movie is a big T & A shov.
