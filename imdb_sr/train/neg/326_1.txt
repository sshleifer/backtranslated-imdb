This early Adam Sandler movie could be compared to his life as a comic strip in the same period of 1989. The constant recognition of his character for his hidden genius and frustration in connection with humorous material seems to come more from Sandler than the script. The film is nothing compared to his film hit, such as Big Daddy or even banal Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler has not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and fun way when this film is made, similar to his character. Most of the "jokes" of the film come from Sandler who talks to herself, usually because of her unrecognized comic talent and herself because she is too ugly and can not get women. It's hard to watch a film because it's not treated as a real movie. Sandler talks to the camera and viewers throughout the film, often thinking of a small budget or a suspicious film content. The film is extremely inconvenient and unpleasant to watch. I immediately wanted to forget that I saw this film after it was finished, for fear that if it learned more, it would destroy Sandler's career. Pass this in the video, I rent it for free and it was still a waste of time.
