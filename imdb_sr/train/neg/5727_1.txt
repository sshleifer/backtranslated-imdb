I just want to say this is the first review of a movie I've done on the Internet. I felt the need to warn people about this movie because it's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After reading the interview with the director, he says that he respects the constructive criticism, and that's why I will try to avoid hitting the film just because of that and offer my opinion on why I found him so catastrophically horrible. 1. Actors. I know that the budget may not have allowed the big singers, but with Nicholson who worked in the industry for over ten years he certainly knew some of the actors who were the least average. 2. Incredible lame makeup and special effects. Once again, the budget obviously interfered with what was originally conceived, but after many years of recovery, there is no excuse. 3. An obvious similarity with the hostel. While this is not entirely certain, you are trying to cash out the success of the former films. The only problem is that Roth knew where he was going and how to get there ... 4. Music. It's not really creepy, or it does not bother, even disgusting, just embarrassing. 5. Script in general. All dialogue was forced and terrible! Also, the backbone of the theater and the guy who comes to save them were weak and almost like a thought. 6. Editing. VTF. How daring, not in a good way. Nuf said. I would seriously want to hear the director's thoughts about my post (he undoubtedly visits his site on IMDb.) cause friend ... what you thought. Surely, at some point during the shooting or editing, you realized what your Turkish wife had on your trip ... I'm sorry I do not want to be harsh, but you must have more talent than this, I hope that your next feature will be film or a film better, we hope that the practice will progress. But in the meantime, avoid this as a plague. I want my 81 minutes back with interest. (At least I did not pay to watch it.)
