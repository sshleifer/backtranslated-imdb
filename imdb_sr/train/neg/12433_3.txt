I like to keep my criticisms short and simple, but it mostly collects. You can not beat the original two for a variety of reasons, one of which, including Chris Columbus's overhead talent. I can not even believe that these people are considered actors. It's painful to sit and watch. The story was a complete joke about the secret chip and the Russian terrorists on a painstaking task to return it. Terrible, rent one of the original trains and enjoy! The film is not even set for Christmas as original. Home Alone from a great Christmas family comedy movie turned into a joke without any morale or complication!
