When my child asks me to leave the introductory show of this film, I know it's bad. I wanted to get my eyes out. I wanted to break through the screen and hit Mike Miers for sacrificing the last horror he had. This is one of the rare films in my life that I watched and immediately wanted to "relax", only that was possible. Other films are 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both of which are better than this crap in the hat. this blasphemy on Good Seuss's name. Mike Miers I say that I stick to Austin or even to revive Vaines World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrei does not mean that Seuss is a success for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
