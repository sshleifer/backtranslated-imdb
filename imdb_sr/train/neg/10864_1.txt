The reason I wanted to give this film a chance to take 2 hours of my life (actually it was only 35 minutes) was my desire to try to understand and I hope to appreciate Indian cinema. All I ever saw was a few older films about S.Rai. By reviewing the IMDb, I encountered this and after I saw the score of 8.7 I decided that this must be the one that will open the door of the unknown and bring artistic pleasure. Oh, how I made it wrong! The only logical explanation for this score of 8.7 is that most of the 970 people who voted the Indians and their only venture beyond Bollywood production were Adam Sandler films. on IMDb List of 250 Best Movies Over Citizen Cane, Goodfellas of Psicho! I'm really not in a position to review and criticize, because there is simply nothing to be remembered from this painful experience. My only hope is that there are many Hindues who, like me, find this movie as - ordinary stupid, with a lot of kitsch and Syrian music.
