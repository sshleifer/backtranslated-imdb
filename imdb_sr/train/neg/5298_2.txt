I rented this film because I watched a movie section about horror films for those movies that nobody heard and could be a gem. I saw this and, since I was a fan of violence and murder, I got it. He received an EM rating, which means: He is extremely mature. Thinking that this rare and high rating was entirely intended for violence and everything else, I got it. Warning on the box said: Extreme violence, extreme langue and nudity. "Extreme violence" I liked. The film ended with a rather tough movie. He had one or two bloody scenes, but I saw it up in the PG-13 movie. Of course, the amount of bite in the movie is not all that matters, is it? And you have a plot. Well, the plot was boring and nothing special about it. Do not rent it. Telling the truth. I can not imagine how someone could really enjoy it to say: "I'll rent it again." He had moments in which he continued, but I will never see that movie anymore.
