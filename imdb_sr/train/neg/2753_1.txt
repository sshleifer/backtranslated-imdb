First of all, I would like to emphasize that Sam Niel can not be seen anywhere in this film. What a film is without Sam Niel. Has anyone seen the Horizon event? D-Vars had a potential film about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers, but sounds cool, but unfortunately not. No, not Sam Niel, there's no good movie. I recommend you take 5 dollars or more to rent D-Vars and add 10 to five and buy Sam Niel movie - obviously to send this I have to have ten lines of text so that the list of Sam Niel films <br /> <br /> < > -Jurassic park -dead calm -hunt for red-October -event horizon-not jurassic park 3 <br /> <br /> Total D-Vars is a bunch
