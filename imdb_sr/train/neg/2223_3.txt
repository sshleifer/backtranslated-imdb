Trite, ClichÃ© Dialogue and Plotting (the same kind of thing that we've been looking through through 1980s fantasy movies), hockey music, and figure-breakers, this throws out of the race for everything except for the hottest fans. > What saves this garbage film is the wonderful stash of Bakshi's work, the rotoscopy, and the fact that Frank Frazetta has taught animators how to draw like him. This is Fraset ... on the move. Violence is spectacular and artistic direction and animation are unlike any other sword and sorceress movie from that period. I like to watch this with the excluded sound, instead I play a soundtrack for the first Conan movie.
