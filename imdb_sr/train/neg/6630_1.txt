This so-called remake is terrible. I went to see this tonight ... the first day when expectation and exaggeration was too much for me. But in the first half of the hour, we knew this was a disaster. Not only does it coincide with the hype created but also offends the original blockbuster. The script had holes, editing was messy several times. Mohanlal, who is an excellent actor, did a good job. Amitabh was fine. The director wanted to show how bad his character was, but he went a little to the sea, which resulted in him being violent. Ajai, who was particularly hungry in such roles, was also disappointed. We will not even start with a new type of Prashant ... it would not be proud to start a career with something like this. Rajpal Yadav, who was thrown into a few laughs, could not smile at anyone because of the violent humor and loud voice. Nisha Kothari has proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have today. All in all, the RGV, which I thought was one of the most talented and most indulgent directors of India, had a failure. He accepted such a great challenge and responsibility to process what is known as the best Hindi movie ever and make a mess.
