I was honest with Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. I watched the entire movie with my family and some friends. I have no idea what the film is about. After many discussions, we all agreed that this is not one of their best efforts. It does not stick together. It's too turbulent, and there's little comedy. I am disappointed. It could have been much better. I waited for months to see this film based on notebooks. to see all the films of Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. It was a bad way to spend the evening.
