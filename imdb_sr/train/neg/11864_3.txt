Characters in depth are less ripping. You saw all the characters in other films, I promise. the script tries to be sharp and disgusting, but unsuccessfully falls. throws himself into a hangover that encounters a superbad comedy, but the jokes are far from the left field, completely forced, and almost completely destroyed after they were cracked. hot woman is old and has no personality, only a few early thirty blue girls with a few wise donkeys who do not wear underwear and wear jokes that are less than lovable. the attraction between Molly (Hot Chickens) and Kirk (Doric Love Interest) barely communicates. an attraction in which his full platonic connection can not be found until the awkward and predictable kiss of the safety belt appears. In this, they are in full contact, and this is simply incredible. the main focus of this film is not a relationship, but an unsuccessful attempt to create a rude super-bad movie with a semi-attractive complication. I could compare it with a hangover, in my forced nature. I will not get into it. I could continue, but that's pointless. just do not pay to see this movie.
