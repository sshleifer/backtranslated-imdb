What I hate about this performance is how poorly written traces are written. These women do not have self-esteem or dignity. All the complications are dropped on the guys. Talent Amande Bines is completely lost. She was brilliant at "All That" and on her shov. Why would they write to her and Jenny Gart as rude, ruthless, desperate, men who were hurrying, "old-maidens" are out of me. whenever his cartoon character Poochie is not on the screen, "Everyone should ask, where is Poochie?". Everyone is talking about some sort of whining, and then they're bouncing on a guy. Sometimes they change him, and the guy tapped instead. Then they come back together or fall apart at the end. Two women are either shallow, stupid or addicted to sex. The only word I can imagine is "shit."
