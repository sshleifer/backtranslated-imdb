Until I claim that I am any expert in marine life, I must say that anyone with a little intelligence could not buy that idea of ​​a kit (and even about a mother!) Who has the notion of revenge because he was the witness of his dead partner who had a forced abortion of people! I really think! This is basically an entire plot. Richard Harris must have been very difficult for the roles to accept this trash. This is a movie that's so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it, you would feel like you were looking for money back.
