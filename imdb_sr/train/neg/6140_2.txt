This movie is hilarious. The problem is that it's not a comedy. One classic scene includes Kurt Thomas who is just about to find a horse in the middle of the village square (which is used to break bad guys.) The second is the "lunatic village". It's a shame that this movie was not made to be a farce, or it may have got a better rating.
