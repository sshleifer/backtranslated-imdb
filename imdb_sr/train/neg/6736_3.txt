There are no film achievements here, but this is not an important issue. How is it trying to be a competent film about the date - and starry vehicle? The formula requires a sweet female who leads la Rian or Aniston - a check; there is a built-in TV audience! Add thick heads, submissive men, usually including the problem of an ex-boyfriend / fianc√© - check it out. Make a parcel that maximizes the bank of the stars. So far, so good. What is male consistency from? He must pass out all the women in the film and the audience (and gay flight guards) immediately. But ... he can not be so brazen to threaten the male audience, and he can not overshadow the star. Roll Camera ... The problem is what Messing thinks she's still in sitcom ... she has only one presentation: like a wide-eyed mop who made a career. A capable actress could have pulled him out after the love scene, where things got into the soap immediately. You can not help feeling well for Mulronei ... you can read it on his face to see through all of this. He received all respect for life. This time, he is one of them on the warning tape, and nobody can understand what to do because he entertained the house.
