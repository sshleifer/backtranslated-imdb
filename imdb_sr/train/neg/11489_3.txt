In the United States, very few films about Rome were made that were not set up at the time of Julius Caesar or shortly thereafter. Hollywood swordfish and sandalwood epics generally have a Christian theme, making it difficult to enter early Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and came across some resistance to Hollywood because there was no Jesus there). It is interesting to see at least one painting that does not just happen before Caesar and Christ, but it was set up when Rome was just one of the many on the Italian peninsula, and it just replaced the hated king. Tarkuin formed the Republic. However, this is not a historical film; it is a peal, and although the production values ​​are not bottom of the bottom, the action and characterization are cardboard. I can only imagine the dialogue in Italian, but with the wooden English dublin, it's very camping. At first I got some good laughs. I have not seen much of this genre's films, missing most of Herkul's films in the sixties. It's fun, but as the film continues, it gets a bit boring. One thing is certain: if I saw this movie when I was ten, I would love to. In those years, I went to everything with the Romans and swords. So at least this film brought some memories from childhood.
