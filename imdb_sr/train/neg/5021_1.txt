This is one of the worst movies I've seen for a long time. The story was boring, the dialogue was terrible and an actor's chimney. I'm not sure if this film was a result of the homework project of the film school, but it certainly played as one. It is not even particularly successful in its central idea to try to appear as one continuous taking. Horizontal containers for the camera are a cheap and unoriginal way to hide cuts.
