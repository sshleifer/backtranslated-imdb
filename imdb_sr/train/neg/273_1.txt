The sign of the classic movie is old as a fine black wine. This film is not Cabarnet and certainly not Casablanca. I agree with other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that stirs us in the night performances, and the dialogue is stiff and inappropriate. But let's look at the obsolete topic of the movie. With the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom. Since Vatch on the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman was exposed as a Bideneskue plagiarism with his so-called true story "Julia" from his book "Pentimento". As one of the most arrogant abundance of Western apologists to the USSR, it is obvious that her theme in the play and film was to encourage America to action to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism from the fascists who just proved their military superiority in Spain. As one reviewer rightly noticed, this is not an American premiere and film, because Lillian went to her grave a communist American. This film chronicles this notorious nonsense of intellectual elites that at that time formed the American left, just as the full Moon to the Left of Dnevnik Kos and Michael Moore bought theories of conspiracy and once again gave help and consolation to those who would destroy America.
