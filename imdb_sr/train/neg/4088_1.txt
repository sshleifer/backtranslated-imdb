This was a turning point in my film watching life. I went to see this in the theater when it came out. I was completely amazed at how bad it was. These films make you wonder if you have invested money and who owe your service - a very, very great service. Special effects are absolutely first grade, because they could be made in each class. Play rubber rods on the wires without trying to hide strings, arrows that look like they are drawn on the movie and look like a shape of an arrow you would find on a street sign and a funny story. Ed Vood made masterpieces compared to "Conquest". Every student of the film should see this thing only to know the very definition of a bad movie.
