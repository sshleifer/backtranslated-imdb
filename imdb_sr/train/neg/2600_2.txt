Here we have a movie that fails in almost every way the film can collapse. A terrible scenario, a bad actor, amateur director, funny special effects ... it's just a horrible movie. Not to mention the fact that when you get to the end you will realize that the whole thing makes no sense. Having spent the entire film wondering what is happening here when things finally explain, you realize that the story was built on a basis that is absurdly impossible. In one of those disgusting "criminals explains a whole lot of movies", we were told that our criminal did something that simply can not be done and that makes no sense. Oh, and after that, we see that there is some sort of monster. I'm sure that Drew Barrimore would have liked to pretend that this film never happened. If for some ungodly reason you're ever tempted to sit down and watch this movie, I can suggest that you shake that time in the head of the wall for 104 minutes. It would prove to be a much more pleasant experience than sitting through this garbage.
