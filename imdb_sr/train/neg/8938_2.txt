I still can not believe how bad this movie was. If I were not a massochist, I do not know if I would survive watching. It looks like it cost about $ 1,000, but it was not the money that crashed them. The acting was terrible - not only bad, third-grade students could read the lines better. Secondly, the only other reason for watching this type of film is skin, and this was really missing in this movie. We do not even see more attractive coats in the shirt. Ah, well, better luck next time eh?
