The earlier part of the film was pretty pleasant, but eventually it became banal. Although Turturro is an actor he likes most, his Luzhin often resembled a bad impression of a rainy man, and showing the genius as a semi -authent man was embarrassing. All in all, it seems as though this film is trying to become difficult and ends up in a pompous manner despite mostly fine performances.
