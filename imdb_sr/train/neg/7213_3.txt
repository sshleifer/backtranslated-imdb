Although I certainly believe Ekorcist is a classic of horror, I must admit that I do not consider him as high as many other horror fans. As a consequence, I did not see many The Ecocist scammers, and if Ekorcismo is something to pass, I will have to say that this is a good thing because this movie is boring as hell and it certainly is not worth spending ninety minutes! Honestly to other exorcists, this is often considered one of the worst, so it may not be the best place for me. It is not hard to guess what will be the plot: basically this is the same as that of the Ekorcist and sees the girl obsessed with the demonic spirit (which is by chance the spirit of her dead father). Village peasants are invited to exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this one is played by Paula Naschia, which is actually the best thing in the movie. The ecorcism was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the derivative of Spanish Gialla 'The Killer Vore Gloves'. I did not see any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that originality was not one of his strong sides. I can not say many good things about the film itself; it is mostly retreating and the scene of exorcism is not worth waiting. I certainly do not recommend it!
