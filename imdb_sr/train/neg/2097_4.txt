I expected much better than the Battlestar Galactica franchise. A very boring predecessor of the main series. After the first 30 minutes, I waited for it to end. The characters talk a lot about religion, computers, programming, retaliation, etc. ... There are gangsters, types of mafia, who perform hits. However, Caprica does not have an original series action to make up for slower parts. Allow me to give you some helpful tips when watching movies: As a general rule, if there's a lot of excessive explosive titulation, then you know that the movie will be stupid. Caprica has a lot of things. The director / writer usually tries to compensate for his poor abilities by inserting a few naked bodies. It never works and everything it does is humiliating (very) young actors and I'm sorry for them. Directors / writers who do this should be banned for work. If you want to be boring hour and a half, surely rent Caprica. There is (free) pornography on 'Net if you really want to see naked body. Otherwise, go on, there is nothing to see here.
