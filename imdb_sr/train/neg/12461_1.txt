Contrary to most other comments on "Siriani" on the IMDb website, me and my family have found watching this movie on DVD at home completely wasting time and space. In short, this was a film based on a script whose writer was far clever. Instead of trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear way, it was assumed that the continuous casting was generally unclear and difficult to connect with each other 30-second vignettes of different stories from a dozen "storylines" to the audience made for a great and clear viewing. No, sir, it's not. What makes a great watch is total clarity, precision, complications and stories - and characterization - that have the beginning, the middle and the end. This type of film presentation - the related Smoke Sum Experience in a Chinese restaurant - is extremely pretentious and unintelligent. Thanks to God for TV and DVD presentations of Hollywood and British film noirs from the 1940s and 1950s whose writers, directors and actors knew the value of a clear storytelling, diction, and acting which is something meant. This is a DVD that this family will no longer experience.
