Now, I am not a film critic, but I really hated "September 11th". This film was generally poor. With the exception of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarrito's segment, which was the most effective and direct on the topic, short films were at best boring, and in the worst attack. The worst in my mind was the pretentious segment of Ioussef Chahin, in which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers with US soldiers, even went so far as to suggest suicide bombers fight for a bigger goal. The segment was completely shut out and, given Chahin's lack of any powers, wasting time and patience. On paper, it was a good idea for eleven different directors from different countries to make a film with their views on tragedy, but it was in practice unsuccessful.
