Warning: this movie tells a lot of love stories without any coherence. The only intent of this film seems to show love in many different ways. Each story has only a few minutes, so there is no character development and almost no complication. Just a sketch of ideas about complication. The writer tried to build milestones aimed at surprise the viewer. However, it simply did not work because you did not know which characters were earlier or these "jokes" were just stupid. This is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart. Ten times. Or even more, I do not know, and I do not care.
