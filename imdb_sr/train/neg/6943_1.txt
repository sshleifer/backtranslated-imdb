This film is deeply idiotic. A man wants a vengeance for a crime - but when he gets revenge - there is a video camera that constantly watched him. Which man with the brain cell in his head would sit there and do it so long in front of the video camera? Just the fact that this script could never have happened except with someone who could not be dressed I destroyed it - but it became dumb! I think script writers have some serious habits that cook their brain cells and make them lacking holes in which you can drive an armored tanks battalion PLOT: a man seeking a vengeance for his death loved ones, but in the middle of the plot, something goes completely wrong, and then it happens unexpectedly. Only those people who wrote this story were not so stupid to write completely unrealistic conspiracies that could never have happened in this way. The writers I say - look for help for your serious mental problem.
