Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) who is under investigation for possible interference in the event of a loss of money. When robbing banks and hostages against their will of the thief (Master Cliff Owen) and his team, the detective is in charge of forcing the thief to surrender? his only attempt to prove that he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter the powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with her secrets and intentions, who sent her to recover the object from the safe stored in the bank, and you have quite three problems. Unfortunately, you get all this in the movie, and in the end nothing gets paid off. Denzel Washington is the most interesting in an inefficient and unwavering self-centered performance. The only rescue grace for the film is its competent actresses Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, which are much better than the film itself. In fact, Jodie Foster offers the most incredible and high-caliber performance against the guys as a merciless, disgusting criminal. Owen Owen was not given much to do except for litter and posing, but the depth of his presence and his accomplished acting skills are more than complementing his underdeveloped role. It's weird that so much talent is spent on this movie of little influence or interest. You have to ask yourself what the director Spike Lee was thinking as he made this film. The most problematic aspect of the Inner Man, however, is how much unjustified praise he received. For a movie that seemed to have all the pre-summer hits, this one is falling terribly flat.
