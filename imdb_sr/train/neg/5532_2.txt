Revolt Zombies is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's pretty far in the list. When an expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover a zombie trick after the First World War, one of the members decides to use knowledge for its evil ambitions. And it works, at least in the beginning. Some love triangle complicates the story. This was really a boring film, with a terrible acting that made it difficult to say who the zombies are and who is not. The dialogue was a bit better and the plot was incredible (not a zombie part, but parts related to "romance"). And while I'm not a student or a cinematographer, it seems that the camera's work did not help the movie either. Although I've seen several movies that are even worse, it's unlikely that anyone will be happy with it. It's bad, not in such a bad, so bad way.
