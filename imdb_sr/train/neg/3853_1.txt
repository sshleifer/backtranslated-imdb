I think Jason Lee has a huge potential, but this is NOT a vehicle trying to break through as a star. The action is terrible, the comedy is terrible. I laughed twice, I mean for relief, because in retrospect, they were quite jokes. I found myself scared for the future of Fletch, and I had to remember that the film was wrong, not Lee. photos on this site to understand this, instead of this movie. Save time. 1 star.
