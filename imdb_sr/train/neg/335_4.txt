Michael Jackson has claimed to have a place for a top figure in the GOLD CHILDREN, and because he loves children. That did not work out (and why?), So instead we have Eddie Murphy to save the world by rescuing "Kid Midas". I would strongly recommend to all future scriptwriters to study in detail the acting dialogue in this strange fantasy - an adventure comedy that is one step closer to ISHTAR. What Murphy says or does is most like, but do not misunderstand about his extraordinary comical talent; he does not belong to this film, and it's the same for DR. DOLITTLE! Violence and characters combined reasons for labeling it as a cult classic classic, and that would not make any sense as Hollywood and film fanatics continued to invest in it. Speaking of visuals, they were incredibly well-drawn during President Ronald Reagan's presidency. Murphy is far better at arriving in the US and 48 HRS, but this stagnant movie is not my touch of golden honey for sweet crispy taste.
