Ah, a movie about sex and up. Too bad they do not do it anymore (unless you live in Japan). But if everything turns out, it's not a bad thing. The film consists essentially of two wonderful vampires collecting the "dunes" along the village road, leading them home to their castle, having crazy sex with them, and then eating them (except for the first victim, whom they retain for no special reason). Things are complicated when a woman who campaigns with her husband becomes too curious about those mysterious women she constantly sees. From here it gets really ugly. By the end, the two vampires are in such a blood-hungry desire to eat whatever is in their sight, and they succeed in letting their captured victim escape. Oops, so much for this secret existence. The fact that the two vampires do not mind to take off and deceive each other is the only thing that this movie is going to do. Otherwise, it's a bloody, confusing confusion (why is their grave so far from their trap?), Visible only for the scarce few minutes of playing the vampire. The only thing I came out of this movie were two valuable advice: the shooting of lesbians will not kill them; they will only turn them into vampires, not pick up whores along the village road; they are probably vampires. Besides, it really was not worth my time.
