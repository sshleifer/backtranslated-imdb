The great ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is a bad movie in every way. The scenario, the gloomy tempo, the lack of depth in any character, pointless sub-plans, terrible acting, unnecessary climax makes it the worst movie I've ever seen. I did not find anything nice, pleasant or intellectually stimulating in any way. I suppose filmmakers thought they were doing something smart and dark, with their crazy lighting, long lasting silences and an unclear classic soundtrack. If so, they are completely gone. I was just bored, and I wish I had never seen him. Avoid at all costs.
