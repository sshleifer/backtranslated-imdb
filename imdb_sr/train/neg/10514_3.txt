The action was very thin, although the idea of ​​naked, sexy, eating siren is good. The film seemed to be mingled with one meaningless scene to the other, with too little nuddie / splatter / lesbians in licking their mouths between. The characters were wooden and one-dimensional. The ending made no sense. Considering that it had Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson in it, you would expect a decent plot and decent special effects. Some of the effects were pretty good, but there were too few of them. Blow points refer to occasional flashes of blossom and bush, of course, and of course at lesbian moments.

The film had many elements that are involved in making the first horoscope, but they are badly performed or used too scarce.
