Although the beginning points to "All Quiet" on the Western Front, this stupid and superficial version of war falls far from its much better contemporary. This shows the most amusing war ever to take place, with the first hour and half dedicated to romance and good times. Record it (in one frame). A sniper on a tree? Kill him before he kills him. Enemy soldiers in the forest? Do not worry, they are happy to surrender. Ho-hum. Young, tense, predictable ... <br /> <br />
