If you like to see the living animals that are dressed, their heads are broken, my dog's throats are watching over them, then this is for you! But if you're a little normal and you do not need to see real recordings of animal cruelty, upload this. This film tries to shock the viewer, and that's for sure. With animal sniffing at the beginning, and killing the baby in the movie (at least fake) that was enough to exclude him. I've seen films like this before shows slaughtering videos (BTK film) and such recordings should not be allowed in the horror movie. We look up and horror because we know only make-up and special effects, so we should not watch a movie and see the real killing of animals, it's not what we rented a movie. If anything, there should be a large warning sign that is placed on these types of garbage films, so people would not be surprised. As a very brave fan, this turned my stomach away. The entire movie and the team must have a verified head.
