a movie that tries to be far smarter than its producers are capable of producing. the film turns through the "surprises" of insignificant complications in an desperate attempt to address the audience, while "punching" a plot of "plots" with blurred scenes they thought would help them. James Belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt and just sleeping through the movie. the same goes for other "actors". the plot is pretty stupid and sticky. while there is no such crime in it, but in the end, huge complications become very tedious and boring. However, the film succeeds in generating interest in the middle. Everything is worth the lazy clock on a really boring day, but do not be upset if you miss this one. Pretty lame 4!
