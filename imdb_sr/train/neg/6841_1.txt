I hear rumors about the upcoming "Leonardo Nimoi demonstrates the Blu-ray Disc". With the advancement over the past 25 years, from Steadi-cam to CGI, it will be interesting to see if the franchise can be strengthened again. I just hope that it will help to remove the bad taste that was left in my mouth by the entire Fiasco Magnavision demonstration. And that ... "Leonard Nimoi demonstrates Betamak VCR" was a great milestone in the history of the party. After the trial, "Leonardo Nimoi demonstrates a compact tape" and a completely flattering "Leonardo Nimoia demonstrates the 8-ribbon strip", who would have expected such a magnificent cinema? I'm crying now, I'm just thinking about it.
