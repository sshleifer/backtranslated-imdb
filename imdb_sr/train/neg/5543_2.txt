Seriously, I absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity, but last night I watched this for the first time and easily got into my heel all the time. Was it supposed to be because of a love story or zombie? This film was so bad that, after being gracious, everything I could do to laugh about how real it was really funny was. Fortunately, I'm too anal to turn off the movie without looking at the whole thing or I could not boast to watch this all the way in one sitting! I like to think that something positive can be said about anything in life, so in accordance with this theory, I will admit the most positive material of this film, it was very short for a full-length movie.
