It was a disappointing film about the horror of a young girl and her nightmares. For a movie about a horror or a "thriller" and a hyper-thing, it's too loud. There are only a few tense moments here, and not anywhere that should be for the film of this genre. Even those "tense" scenes were not many. The music made them more dramatic than they are. There are many symbols here, so elitist critics have labeled this "horror movie thinking people". Well, if you think about it, I'm sure the same conclusion will come to you as I am - losing money in the video rental store. and generally bad treatment. Vastly overstated and certainly not what is being advertised.
