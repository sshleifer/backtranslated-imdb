Special holidays for festive holidays, as well as original Frosts, should be richly produced with quality music and a healthy but carefree story. They should have a touch of mystical magic holidays. In essence, they should look, sound and feel ... well, "special" and should have a decent and appropriate subtext for a holiday. So when I'm in the television video legend Frosti Snovman. ads, I got my kids (6 and 8) who filled up for it by telling them the story of the original Frosty and passionately talking about how much I enjoyed as a child. While my wife and children had been hanging out on the couch to watch a movie, the expectations were high, but 10 minutes later my children were yelling, and my wife and I gave each other a "look" and turned their eyes. After 35 minutes, my children actually asked to go to bed - I guess they had a lot of senseless language and meaningless, unrelated segments. Actually, I was embarrassed by their (and my) disappointment with this film. Unfortunately, the Legend of Frost Snowman is more like a bad episode of rather unusual parents with a crisis that is worse than normal. Sponge Bob is a classic holiday movie. Do not misunderstand me ... these shows are fine and I love them as much as the next guy, but when I watch "Good Parents" or "Sponge Bob", my low expectations (for the central, of-color, zero sub-text, um numbing episode ) are always happy. We chose some good books and spend the rest of the evening together reading. Much better choice than the unpleasantly bad Legends of Frost Snovman.
