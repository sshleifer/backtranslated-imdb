This so-called "documentary" is trying to say that the US has falsified landing on the Moon. Year right. All those who really studied the case know otherwise. First of all: definitely there is evidence. When the astronauts were on the Moon, they returned MOST STONES from the Moon - for geological studies. They have spread to hundreds of laboratories around the world that tested them. And they all concluded that they came from the same planet, not from the earth: because the internal isotopes of the basic elements are different from those on Earth, but similar to those who calculate that they are on the Moon. И.Е. The conspiracy theorists never do anything to study: they only take what fits into their theory and ignore the rest. Another inaccurate claim from them is that their wind was in the hangar where they fired on landing on the Moon, the IE flag was moving. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it with his hand, so he moved. And what proves it: well, if the conspiracy theorists even studied the video, they would see that the flag NEVER move after the astronaut allowed it, I.E. The conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, they can not study the subject properly, or they only study it until they get what they came for, so that they can lie and make profit from it (IE). One claim says that it can not be recorded on the Moon, because all the shadows come from different places because there are different sources of light, artificial lighting from the studio. Once again the conspiracy theorists wronged (as usual), the same would happen in the land of the wilderness at night, without the source of light. But I doubt that conspiracy theorists have ever been outside of their grandmothers' baskets more than how long the Star Treck convention is held. They just see what they want to see. So, they make all these lies to look important - that's a fact.
