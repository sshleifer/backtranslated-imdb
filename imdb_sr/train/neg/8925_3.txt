I never liked a movie about Miri, I appreciate that she pushed the Hollywood Envelope at the time. Naturally, the costume of Miss Velch has become an icon, although I have to ask myself if many people who recognize the picture really saw the film and knew what it was about - I watched Miru FMC a few years ago. Earlier, he did not think it was much better. There is a segment about it in comic strip comics about Sekploitation Cinema, in which it was given the right recognition for putting such big stars into what was then unexpected. However, IMHO, the film is too bitter to be charming, too stupid to be involved, and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform, engage, or entertain ---
