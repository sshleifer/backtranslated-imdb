This was the third remake of SLEEP OF THE ENIEMI after IAARANE (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996) AGNISAKSHI was the only one who worked and was a better film DARAAR was directed by Abbas Mustafa, who unfortunately failed in the attempt here The story was good, but the handling was not so good, and the heroine was too regressive and the highlight was also disappointing. Directed by bad Music is good < Rishi re-introduces his role as IAARANE (oddly, it was also a remake of the SVTE) and looks overwhelmed for leadership, and in line is Juhi ristojan and Arbaaz trying too hard in his debut and succeeds in many scenes that cool crowd, but his voice was horrible Johnny is too loud
