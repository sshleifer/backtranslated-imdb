I saw this movie some day in the classroom of the film school, and I did not see Almodovar film before, but I expected it to be good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a pointless movie with just a few laughs mixed with two hours of pure boredom. High heels are just a collection of random scenes that may have worked in their own separate films, but they do not collect together in any meaningful whole. <br /> Or I thought so. Then, the next day, my film professor spent the entire length of his teaching explaining all the hidden details of the film, such as the mural with the display of stereotypical dancing flamenco in the background of the drag kueen scene some kind of comment on the lack of identity Spain as a nation developed under the fascist rule. It's obvious that the whole movie is full of smart little visual tricks and such references. Great, but you know what? It's still a bad movie. It takes more than the depth and complexity to make a good movie - you still need to give the audience the reason to continue to pay attention, something that the viewer will want to really care about for all the subtle tricks. High heels give us strange, out-of-the-rhythm characters, but keep them in generally worldly situations recycled from other films, and Almodovar does not seem to use them to make any point. What is the significance of, for example, the discovery of Hitchcock's surprise, which happens at the end of the film? Why is that there? Just to surprise us? There is a funny scene that has to do with broadcasting news. And that's it, it's the only fun moment. The rest of the film is just meaningless movie references and visual signs that obviously exist only to show how clever Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my film professor says, it takes more than self-indulgent trick to make the film good.
