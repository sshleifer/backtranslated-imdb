If you have enough time to lose ... it's okay. It is moving at a good pace, but in order for this film to turn off, it should be a little longer with a little more background for the guard. The act is fine. Mariana Klaveno as a nanny does the best job and is the most reliable. Villiam R. Moses played a pretty good job as a husband. Gail O'Grady, as husband had a weak part, and the reasons for her return to work were not developed. The ending is kinda silly. Like most of these movies ... there are interesting parts ... but it's all about leaving you wondering why you spent time.
