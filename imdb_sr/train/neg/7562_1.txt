I did not see the original, but I just wanted to leave a quick note to anyone who came this far: Vicker Man is the worst movie I've ever seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I would like to invite the theater to give me the money or give me time to warn me that I can not see it. From me and the landscape of the island was wonderful. Sorry, that's it. Here comes the jeers. The action of the movie is only moving forward, because other characters will not give Cage any direct answers - and he accepts it !!! How can it last more than an hour of my time (much less days in the movie) is beyond me. Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. Leaving the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill in the library. How could anyone read this script and think: "Yes, people should pay $ 11 to see this suspicious display of what the movie should look like" is beyond me. Or even rent it on a DVD.
