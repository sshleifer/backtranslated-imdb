"Earth of Abundance" is not a movie. It is a tombstone to the director's career of German director Vime Venders. Many felt it at the Million Dollar Hotel, and now the "Land of Abundance" is perfectly clear; Not only did Venders lose him but he turned into a bad director, creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes. It could be said that "the time you lose it" comes for every director, but the Venders Case is extreme. As if he completely forgot everything he knew about the cinema and started again - only to get unfavorable results. In a few words, this movie does not deserve your time.
