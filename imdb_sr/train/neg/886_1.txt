A few years ago, the same people who created Paris, J'TAIME., Which was imperfect but very comfortable (my rating was 7), created this piece of garbage on New York. In Paris, I love you (J'taime) created a feeling for Paris and was made in many parts of the beautiful Paris. In this current film I did not recognize New York, I did not feel I was in the city of my birth. New York has 5th, I have not seen a scene in Bronco, or Kueensu, there is one scene in Brooklyn, (Brighton Beach), I've seen no scenes at Times Square or Greenwich Village / No Scenes beautiful hotels or theaters. It plays a big role, most performers did not even have stereotypes, they were the lowest-quality caricatures. Only a few funny moments are of course sexual nature or pretty offensive to many fine New Yorkers that we all know and love .. Several movies nominated for a 'razzie' award were much better . Ratings: * (of 4) 20 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (Out of 10) On my way of thinking I think the title should have been <br /> < br> NEV IORK, I hate you.
