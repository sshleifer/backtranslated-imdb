Probably the only thing that brought me a movie to four for me is the fact that I love Peter Falk. One of the world's greatest portraits of clumsy incompetence. . . yet he is one of the only anchors that prevents this from becoming a chaotic disaster. Like Pops Romano, he provides a respectable blend of gangster charm and real man with a manic glupost of Chris Kattan. The respectable performances are offered by Richard Roundtree as boss, Vinessa Shav, a talented FBI agent who refuses the head of the glass ceiling, and Fred Vard as Falck Advisor and Benedict Arnold. It has some great features and, in the hands of young Steve Martin or Chevi Chase, could prove to be a great comedy vehicle. Kattan, who seems to admire Ernest or Pee Vee Herman, only gives a mess. Unfortunately, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who show his brothers unsuitable, are both far from proven ability. There are some very funny scenes, but they are too small and separated too boring. What I really miss is what always attracted me to Leslie Neilsen's films. There is no "second level" of witty riding through slapstick. There are no cultural references that only adults receive. . There is no double entry. . It's just nonsense. And, by the way, this does not mean that I recommend it to your 9 year old, because I hope they have a better taste and less fascination with some of their body parts and their functions.
