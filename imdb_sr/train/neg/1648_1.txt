Personally, while I am able to appreciate truly good movies, I also have a strange ability to enjoy the funniest shit. You know, the time you want to just sit and watch some terrible action movie to kill time. This is the only movie I remember that I actually turned off in the middle, and I have absolutely no intention of coming back to finish it. The action was so fictitious and predictable that I called what the next scene would be easy (and I'm usually not very good at this). The actors were terrible, I saw better acting in high school. Even the cuts of the scene were bad, the flow was wrong. This movie is like a parody that has been forgotten funny.
