When employees in an old theater find an old movie, they decide to show him at the midnight projection of the Night of the Dead, assuming it's the old tape for review. Unfortunately, it's actually an old Nazi experiment of mind control that turns audiences into the hordes of mindless zombies in blending. I can not understand the hatred for this movie. It is an independent independent production with many camps, but does not deserve "1.1" here on the IMDb. That's so funny. It is obvious that the film's authors have reasonable knowledge and love of old horror films, and they have created a fun gift that is sprinkled with references and honors to various of them. It has a feeling like the Nights of Living Dead (in many ways, very similar), Evil Dead 2 and Armi of Darkness, and various others. I liked the explanation that zombies, although they really hypnotized to think that zombies actually came to have the physical attributes of living dead - perhaps incredible, but I appreciate the efforts of the writers to explain it. The effects were worse for the budget, the acting was fine, and the story was fun. I liked it.
