Assuming it will not end in a show that can be recorded directly on the video, I must say that it will cancel this title at all costs. Unless you have bored good, well-made films, that is. Last night I saw it at AFI Dallas, and I left with another 20 minutes, simply because I no longer had any concerns (about plot, not about insulting the director ... it's embarrassing). When you can spot only five minutes in a movie (a window is broken, a window is broken before any shot is fired ... and then the window breaks up with the first shot), things will be bad. Let's just say this is just an indication of things that come ... unfortunately. I will spare you all the details, but this is a sub-pair in every way, even a half-stupid acting Michael Madsen is disappointing when you expect a half-assed acting from him. A scene of rape ... Christ! "Shut up and take" should never be used at the scene of rape. EVER. 3/10
