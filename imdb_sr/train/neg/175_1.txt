I watched the Cabin next to the lake this afternoon in the US. Given that this film was made for television, it was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, tonight I deal with broadcasting and I was extremely disappointed. I knew that I would not love a movie, but I did not expect to confuse the use of DV (digital video). The film would have been tolerable if there were no opposing digital recordings that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot to be linked to these footage, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: NEXT CAN SPOILER !!!!) Open end in the cabin next to the lake was acceptable, but the open end of the extension is ridiculous. I can only anticipate the return of the return to the cabin at the lake that watches whether the film is shown against anything, but the advertisement is 4 o'clock in the morning.
