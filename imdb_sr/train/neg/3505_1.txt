Comedy Central has the habit of recording great programs on time - Chappelle's Shov, The Daili Shov, Colbert Report, and then there are those who some people like or hate - Stella, dr. Katz. Then there are some performances that have their defenders, but they are just terrible - Mencia, and now, Sarah Silverman. Report) but it can be terrible (Mind of Mencia). No one should be shocked to think that this is the other one. This performance is a parody of comedy and society, a program that is so absurd that it is lost in its absurdity and is simply not ridiculous. Women's fingers have been made comedy many times since it is not something that is commonplace. We do not need 25 minutes. When the criminal is disarmed with kueef, he simply loses his appeal - we saw him in Jai and Silent Bob Strike back, except that women were warmer and the whole scene was more absurd, making it a better one. But the best comparison of this show was with Stella, except that Stella was more subtle, which made the absurd comedy funny. It was better to act, and I suppose, a bit more than a fantastic realistic view. Perhaps the fact is that some of the criticisms are so negative (I am very skeptical of critical acclaim, but I do not dispute the reaction of fans) to this show is the amount of advertising on it, the very disgusting commercials through many programs far outstrips the advertising of others program. Many people are wondering why Sarah Silverman has a career, and others are still outraged when better emissions are canceled. This show was never meant to go past the unknown pilot phase. The return to Norm showed much more promise, but this performance does so. As far as critics are concerned, many things are universally proclaimed, and their status is enormous. The last thing I checked is Britney Spears. Take this comparison as much as you want, because somebody will without a doubt accuse me of being psychotic on the IMDb because I do not like this show.
