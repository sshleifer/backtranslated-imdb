Forest is not only your daily standard cannibal food, but also an interesting mix of supernatural elements. The story is about two pairs coming out into the woods for camping. Cave habitat, cannibal foresters and the spirits of his dead wife and two children are soon terrorizing them. There's something you do not see every slasher. Director Don Jones receives "A" for the effort, although the film falls to almost every level, the acting is simply average except for Jeanette Kelli, who plays the dead husband of the foresters (Michael Brodi aka Gary Kent). /> The film opens with a couple of nice shots of a couple walking through the valley and the forest. Too late they realize that someone is chasing them. Both are sent in a typical package. Our killer uses a reliable hunting knife throughout the film, except for the time of memory when he implements a manual saw, fork and a beveled blade of a saw to send the lover of his cheater. the movie simply does not work with him. I thought it was pretty boring simply by dumb acting. 4/10
