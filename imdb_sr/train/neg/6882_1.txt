I hated the way Ms. Perez portrayed the Puerto Rican people! We are not all ghettoes - and we speak Spanish - not Puerto Rican! I can not talk about the uneducated people you've come across. But our language is intact, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is economically better than any other Caribbean island! I'm glad that, like Cuba, the Dominican Republic or Haiti, we are free from American influence? Free in real poverty, not in the US as a poverty standard. We are not victims, we are resistant, humble, honest and intelligent people. Our origins include strong African roots, but not black roots - I have nothing in common with black Americans 9. T Mlk was a great hero, a real revolutionary - an honest man who saw the day when we all were free. Che Guevarra helped Castro create Cuba today, is it the reason why Cuban hazards risk their lives to come to America - because Che has made such a better place for them? You had a great, great, great idea, but you politicized it too much. We have so many things that we can be proud of as people - do not disgrace our people by sacrificing us. I'm not Nuiorican and maybe I can not share your opinion. I am a Puerto Rican, I speak Spanish, I am not a victim and I managed to accomplish many of my goals in America. If there is another part in the future - less politics of more history, more stories about triumph - there are many. Damaris Maldonado
