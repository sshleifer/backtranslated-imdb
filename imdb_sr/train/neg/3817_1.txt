Seriously. This is one of the dumbest family shows of all time. Plot - family without mother and 3 "dad" raised by 3 girls in San Francisco, California. Characters - Neat freak Danni, cartoon likes Joei, hair obsessed with Jesse, spoiled brother Michelle, stupid DJ and almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this show really want to hate characters, right? Therefore, I think that nobody should watch this show. I just laughed for a few moments in the series, and I think that instead of a deadly injection, all criminals should be forced to watch this show, torture far worse than anything else. 1.5 10 or: D
