The last reviewer was very generous. Quiet as the first movie, but I can not say I enjoy this. The start is tolerable, but it goes downhill fast. I just do not see Jon Bon Jovi as a "vampire hunter," and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor frightening. Many scenes just do not make sense. I mean, every normal person would suspect something happens when a weird woman suddenly appears out of nowhere to seduce you, let alone an experienced hunter. Why can Una communicate with Jova? Nothing ever explains in this movie, you would not mind being fun, but that was too much. This must be one of the worst vampire movies I've ever seen.
