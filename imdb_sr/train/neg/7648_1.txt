It is considered that a way to expose every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male domination, however logical, is "logic". However, there is no gray zone in the story and theme of the film, and a woman who should be called a film antagonist is a "villainous story". Under no circumstances could she be justified. Women's sexuality is just a hyper in this case and has nothing to do with actuality. This is an issue of the extreme kind. In the end, the man spent his resources and time in the rapturous raising of another man. Above all, the weakest arguments raised by the three 'freed' female characters at its peak is pathetic. Women's sexual needs are not an excuse for committing adultery and are constantly betraying a husband, and even worse, there are no other children. So, in essence, his life is lost. In some societies where justice still prevails, such situations lead to the execution of unjust.
