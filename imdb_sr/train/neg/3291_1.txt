First of all, I'm not a fan of Ducks, but after this film, the series looked like Law and Order. The worst thing was casting Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reinolds is not Boss Hogg, and even worse is M.C. Gainey like Roscoe, If they ever watched the show, Roscoe was not a heavy policeman. There was more Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie. The film is full of common mistakes, cars are torn apart and continue as if nothing had happened. The worst example of this is when the general joins Billy Prickett, and the general has encountered the hill, apparently slowing down to almost stopping, but continues to win the race.
