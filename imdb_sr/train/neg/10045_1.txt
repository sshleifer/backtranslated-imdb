The whole world has said that Tashan will be a good movie with great pleasure, but this is not the case. Vijay Krishna Acharia made a serious mistake to take it as an actress Kareen Kapoor. She was unbearable throughout the film. Her look at the guy is not very good. Even the movie about the movie makes no sense at all. Everyone said that Indian Kuetin Taratino Vijay, but not Kuetin at all. Tales by Anil Kapoor were involved in this stupid film. Anil is a big caliber actor and this film is not. Akshai Kumar was also the victim of this film because everything Saif is. Style and Phoormol are not very good in this movie, I was disappointed
