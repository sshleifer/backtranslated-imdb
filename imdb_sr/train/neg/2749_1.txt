This film was so badly written. The characters did not have depth. They should never have taken a film about this. My 11-year-old son could have written a better script than Hiung-rae Shim then. The only actor who did not suck was a zoo keeper. He was the only funny and convincing one of many. I love movies and I'm trying to give them the benefit of suspicion, but this one was up on my lame list under number 2. Number 1 For those of you who thought that This is a good movie, you need brain surgery. Most creatures in the movie were not even dragons ... so why did they call D-rat?
