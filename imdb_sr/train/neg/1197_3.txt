They really can not become stupid of this film dealing with 3 losers who are trying to capture the spirit of the university during the annual spring celebrations in many of our higher learning schools. The problem is that these losers are trying to do it 15 years after the end of college years when someone is in charge of overseeing the daughter of a senator woman who is ready to be the next vice-president. The daughter is just not popular, but of course she comes from all this. Girls go through drunken fury, exotic dancing and other absolute nonsense. Really can not be much worse than this horrible movie.
