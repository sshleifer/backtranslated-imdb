I've seen this movie a long time ago, and I have no desire to ever see it again. family and always does not seem to have enough money. It all changes when a bank robber crosses Preston's bicycle and gives him an empty check as compensation. Preston uses a check to withdraw a million dollars from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him a check). Preston then buys a villa and says to work as an assistant to a mysterious and wealthy supporter named Mr. Macintosh (named after your computer). After that, he just gets out of money. On paper, this sounds like a great idea. However, on the screen, it's one of the most expensive movies I've ever seen. First of all, it's too incredible. I know that some parts of the movie should be amazing, but I draw a line with a twelve-year-old boy who comes out with a thirty-year-old woman, who is in charge of the little wealth of an imaginary person. Also, this was a shallow film with a poor acting, predictable drawing and characters that are less than unforgettable. The characters were either chewy, over the top, boring, or undeveloped. But "Juice" was a funny character. If you are looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this one.
