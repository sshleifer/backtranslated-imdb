Poorly written script without nice characters. As for comedy, I forgot to laugh. It's about 2 thoughtful friends who are scampering to get in bed with them (without sex scenes) and another friend (who is semi-discreetly weird) who sometimes deceives, but is generally considered to be the type who rules. Three friends meet together and fall on the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow this is done without any kind of romance. Three guys stop being friends, because they went out with her separately. She spoiled them from their friendship because they fooled women. - Bad movie
