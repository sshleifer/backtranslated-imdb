Hi, This is my first post in the IMDb, although I use it as a reference for a long time. That's why I would greet you all. The fact that the Greek will inevitably affect my judgment, I hope I will not be upset. I spent 2 years of my life (all we Greeks did), analyzing the Omirus Epos (and not Homers as you can see everywhere), rhyme on the rim. If I remember correctly, it is Iliad (Ilijada) in the 8th grade and Odyssey (Odyssey) in the 9th grade. Varner Troy, it was a great disappointment for me and my Greek colleagues around the campus (I teach in the UK). The Iliad epos is one of the best literary works ever made. It was made by the Greek poet Omirus for 400 years after the actual war. The historians put the Trojan war around 1200 BC before the new era, and the real cause of the war was not Helen's beauty but the strategically key position of Troy. It is said that it can now be understood that Omirus epos does not represent actual events (as it is not historically true), but this was never the goal of this work. Reading this huge song, one can find himself wondering about the definitions of honor, love, anger, hatred, heroism, discipline, loyalty, and so on. The longest conversations between the warriors before the battle were the best part and the most basic. None of them were detected in 'Troy' Varner's Troy was really cheap for my eyes, and other intellectuals of England's Finnish and German colleagues from me. It's a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way, the perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster (computer graphics worked the whole job), and yet it's the best work of Wolfgang Petersen. I conclude that you better take care of something else. I would give Troi 2 out of 10. It's really a B-movie. Cheers Alek
