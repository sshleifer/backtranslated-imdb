What can you say about this movie? It was not terrible, but it was not good! Two days earlier I was watching Lillies and it was one of the best Gai movies I've ever seen. So this was not the best time to watch a central gay movie. It was not bad enough to exclude, but there were some bad moments and some terrible stereotypes. That was not good either. Would you recommend this movie? No, you waste your time and money. I do not understand why such films are made and who finances them. Spend your time Watching Noah's Arc on the Logo instead. I think this is the place where this film was trying to go, but it never got there.
