This is probably the worst movie ever made solely because it is associated with Roger Corman's name. I could understand that in his early years when he had lower budgets, but there is no excuse for this today. I am a pervert from "B" of the film, and from the perspective of certain people, all the changes I like put aside "ordinary viewers", but to my word on this, Vampire Club makes the top of my list of the best of the worst Worth imaginable, the music is completely inaccurate, the sound effects are simply not effective, and finally, Mr.Savage does not seem to know that he is at all in a vampire movie that is bad because he had a "not bad" career above everything. Let me find out if I will deal with this case sharply when I do not like the film I forgot on the good side.
