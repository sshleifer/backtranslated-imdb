I watched the film "The Flock" for casting Gere and Danes, and because the synopsis of the story sounded interesting. This was one of the LARGEST movies I've seen for a long time (and I've seen some turkeys.) I never published online, but this film was so horrible that I had to do it myself. I guess the problems begin to start with a script that was so amateur that it's incredible. The story has zero sense, and the dialogue is so foolish to torment. Poor Gere, he deserves much better. As far as Gera / Danes is on the screen, because of horrible writing, there is not even a single character in a minute. I bet that Gera wants to buy a negative, is such a thing possible. It's a shame that it's so hard to lose talent, not to mention the desire to get back 2 hours back. (I know what you mean. How do I really feel?)
