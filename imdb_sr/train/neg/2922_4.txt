Take young, beautiful people, put them in an exotic locality, stick to a few bad guys, let the two main characters find romance after a few difficult breathing scenes, create the darkest complications, and then build a happy end for all (of course, except for the three or four killed) This is the classic (and successful) format of Harlequin Romance. It's not very good, but it's not even bad, like most small yellow pocket books. And the location in Budapest is particularly interesting, even if they did not use the beautiful old railway station (designed by Gustave Eifel) or have shown the famous city thermal baths.
