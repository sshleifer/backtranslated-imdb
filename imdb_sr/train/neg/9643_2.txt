Below average movie with bad music considering movie-based ??? Simple Script & Direction with full error. Salman Khan was in his usual acting work. Ajai's performance worsened over time, and his appearance, especially his styles like Rock Star, was pathetic. Asin was just an exhibit. All in all, I felt like I spent money in the cinema. Salman Khan remains immature as 10 years ago in relation to Aamir Khan. There were many songs in the movie all boring except "Man Ko Ati". The most important song that impressed the British music sponsor was impressive. "Khanabadosh" can be easily understood by the English music sponsor. The second film I saw last week was "Vake Up Sid", which was a simple, slow love story with good direction and acting despite average music
