... this mini does not improve with age. I've seen this and its sequel when it was originally broadcast, and like many others. At the beginning of 2002, I borrowed novels for VOV and V and R and I was even more impressed. Then I decided that I had to see again and invested $ 200 plus on DVD sets. I again watched him mines in painful details and realized that I did things backwards - I needed to buy novels and borrow DVDs. I do not believe this is unusually wrong? Read the novels and see for yourself. Do not you think this is dated? Set it up for someone who is not old enough to see him broadcast and watch the reaction you receive (warning - the reactions of such people range from a horror view to a laugh in the stomach). This Mini - Dan Curtis was chosen by Ali MacGrav and Robert Mitchum. Iikes !! The quality of production, the musical scoring, the dialogue - a great story transformed into a soap opera in the late 70's, which was overly ambitious by the producer / director. This thing was dated the moment it was finished. These two minuses were great when they broadcast the original and those who saw them then, pulling a nostalgic series that reminds us of the younger days. IMO - this mini almost does not fulfill its reputation and seriously disappoints.
