Simply not the quality I expected of Morris (I like Brass Eie and Blue Jam). This is very similar to a bad student film. What worries me, in all this is WHY WAS BAD BEHAVIOR? Morris goes with Ain Rand in much of his work (Nathan Barlei), yet with this work he urges the back of the talented and tells us that it is raining! I just hope that he chose a topic that I would like to solve (the humanity of terrorism - Four Lions) that he will not succeed, spending the opportunity to make a statement about this farce of mainstream ignorance and thoughts about this emotional and highly intertwined phenomenon.
