Of all the movies I've seen, this one, Rage, must be one of the worst. The direction, the LOGIC, the continuity, the changes in plot scripts and the dialogue forced me to get rid of the pain. "How could anyone think something so shit"? Gary Busei is known for his "B" films, but this is a secure "V" movie. (V = waste). Take, for example, about twenty FBIs and local police officers surround a house with a jeep trailer. Within the Jeep, the MA and "confused" is why all the cops. In a few seconds, a large pistol is struck, MA is killed instantly. Police officers go to a jeep with Gary and a company that explodes them. Police officers fall as dominoes, and Gary's jeep rides in circles and does not hit even one bullet. MA was killed and Garry seems to have not noticed - damn that guy is tough. It was a miracle, not since when the six had 300 bullets, it was such a miracle.
