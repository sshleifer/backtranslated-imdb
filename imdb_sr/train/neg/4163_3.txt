I see where several people who participated in this debacle have written reviews to share their side of the story, and I thought that what they wrote helped to understand it. The fact that they basically come up with an excuse - rewriting, budget constraints, production formats, etc. - simply emphasizes how bad this movie is. And my critiques in panga are not personally directed, but simply a warning that this does not make a cut. It is visible, but barely so. In every corner there are planning holes, the dialogue borders with the funny, and the ending is telegraphed miles away. A modestly interesting feature of the hologram, interacting with the reconstruction team, drowned in a silly dialogue, like the one who makes a meal in the middle of what should be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Will you ruin us some Hamburger Helper Salli, between our killing of these automated carpet cleaners? Obviously, this elite team equipped with the latest gummy and red plastic tubular armor has no access to the MRE. When they enter the last rooms, they treat the place as a four-star motel rather than a deadly meeting area. The reason for encounter with the scary Top is that you can not kill yourself. Still, before just one scene, the hero left the case to do just that. Huh? Vivian Voo was attractive and handed the best actor to the movie. But that does not say much.
