I rented this film about 4-5 years ago and immediately I was disappointed. I wanted to see flash movie, but I ended up with faecal eyes for the eyes. The act was similar to watching the dry grass. I saw better acting in a softcore movie ... The idea that a crazy killer comes from nowhere confused me. How was this movie about horror? The film's value was at best ridiculous. There was no fear. It looked like a high school student got a new video camera for Christmas. The plot was everywhere, if it exists. If you are bored in looking for a bad horror movie rental, skip this one. There are many better b-films.
