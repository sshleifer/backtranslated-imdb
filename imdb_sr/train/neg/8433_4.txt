Pere is an idiot, but he is aware of it and acts as a consequence. His life is completely boring and does not know how to change it. When his last friend, Nicco, dies. He feels completely empty and decides to get drunk. When she returns home, she collapses with a girl who puts ads. Although ignoring him, he falls in love and begins to follow, obsessive. The beginning of the movie is a bit slow and for most people it can be boring. However, as the action starts, it's a little better (not much! Perhaps the best part of 5 minutes of sex (almost 30 different scenes about it) that you can see in the middle of the movie is not good for eroticism, but for the funny and unexpected it's a scene. The film is based on absurd situations (idiot, as the film says), which have something interesting, I like Ventura Pons, but I must admit that this is not one of his best films (maybe his worst!), He knows It works better.
