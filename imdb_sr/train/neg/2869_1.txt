The story goes like this, Netflik is too late to send me my DVDs so I went to an analogous rental site known as "Blockbuster Video". Really bad. They have 150 copies of the latest chrome films for your viewing pleasure, but I never want to see them. I saw BTK Killer on the shelf, all because of my loneliness. I like to watch movies based on serial killers. It's just a part of humanity that I will never understand, so I want to see such things. Anyway, I put this DVD in and out of the first second, it's bullshit. I'm sitting there with my bf. and we are like, "what's this shit?" Unstable operation of the camera, terrible acting, - the first scene in which a woman is killed, asks if she would rather merely chatter instead of her, then rattle her into the throat. I'm really wondering if the director has a hard time for this shit. There is nothing decent in this "movie." All I have to say to the director is "do you have a weird tripod?" Every shot was brutally unstable. Music was terrible. It's like they decided to make a movie one day. They probably gathered people from ValMart to appear and "work" for them. Just terrible. If you make a movie like this, then directing your hobby - NOT what you should do - you could not get to DVD renal exits for movie lovers like me. Better leave home for your friends when you have fun and running interesting things to have fun. Then kick out your BTK movie and say, "Do you want to see this shitty movie I did once?"
