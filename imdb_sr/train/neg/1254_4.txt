I saw and loved the original movie, and I expected more than a remake of this. GOOD: Effects and makeup are good. There were no complaints about the result and the pictures, they were adequate, and the performances were fine (Tim Roth was excellent, the other principals were fine, and a few "supporters" went well with extremely limited roles). The action scenes were exciting and entertaining. Bad: A go from the city of the monkey was terrible. The characters go round, and then suddenly somewhere in the middle of the city there are tunnels for escape. In addition, which escape route leads through the bedroom of everyone? The story is reduced to include as much action as possible. I love the action scene, but the original movie had more meat and deserved more respect. Finally, the ending was completely meaningless as shown. Without seeing the inevitable continuation, there is no justification for it. <br /> <br />
