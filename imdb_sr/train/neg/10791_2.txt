A horrible movie. If there is one Turkish film, you should not look at it in 2006, it should be Banio. What a waste of time. Apart from a few cheap laughter, this film does not achieve anything, hope, zilch, nil. Dialogue is cheap, and sex clich√©s are everywhere. The director should watch more films before attempting to direct his films. Women with a red head show examples of what the actress should not do. If you are interested in learning how to act, it is a perfect example of a bad acting. The only good thing I can say about a movie is, wait, wait, I can not say anything about it. I must have really loved writing about it so much. Jeez!
