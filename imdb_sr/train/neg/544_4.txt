PROS: Akshai Kumara performance (Is it me or this guy always manages to overcome AB in my films together?). Some moving scenes in the second half. CONS: The whole first hour (jokes were the least words). Every scene with Rajpal Yadav. The main nonsense in making AB decisions. Allow me to clarify this, he believes that the brutal insulting of his son's soul in every possible way (which will probably destroy their relationship that is irreversible) is the better way for him to order Akshay finally to assume some responsibility then actually tells him the truth? VTF? He thinks that Akshay is too soft to bear on the fact that his old father will soon die of cancer, but thinks he will make it more violent? Am I the only one who can not see the logic here? It's easily the biggest drawback of the movie. - Akshai becomes a stuntman. LMAO !! We were told that he graduated from college every year and had an MBA degree. But when the time comes to support himself, and his pregnant wife, he becomes a stuntman. LOL !! How do you actually apply for a normal job in the field? Or Heck, anywhere else where ur life is not in danger? This is incredibly stupid writing. <br /> <br /> - End. I hate this kind of melodramatic shit. Everything was pushed down our throat to pity AB's character, which I could not. The whole thing reminded me too much of the KHNH Heart (which I hate). This "please regret the guy with the disease" shit started its course. I felt more like shooting than sympathy for an old man. That's why I could not watch the last 20 minutes, and so I had to accelerate. the whole thing. Bottomline: The Vakt is too stupid to be called a good movie. Her apparent director, Vipul Shah, focused on emotionally fragile chicks and old men who could take care less about the story that actually makes sense. Give them decent images, fantastic equipment, lots of scenes filled with glycerine and some star, and will happily be put together like this.
