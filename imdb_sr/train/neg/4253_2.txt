This must be one of the worst of the vampires ever begun by men. How can it be turned into an enchanting story? Apparently not such a difficult task ... First of all, the conditio sine kua non of any vampire movie is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, these are missing all these things. Too many lights - places! My God, why was it on behalf of Christ / Jude? Every time Dracula came, he was devoured by the light (in the script to keep him weak, for the record: only weak) There was only one scene that made it almost worth watching, near the end of the film ( beautiful dance scene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first, the Judin band was originally genuine, but this one is not very good, in any way. I hope that the third will sign a vampire signature that I like so much in other classics like Herzog Nosferatu, Coppolin Dracula or even Interview with a vampire.
