Worst comedy Bob Hope ever (and this includes heavy competition). Nada, on an island with sailors, is accustomed to dreaming of being in a bath with a geisha who "manages his ship". Someone certainly turned this Hope-hacker through the cliff because there are Phillis Diller and Gin Lollobrigid on it, and there's still no laugh or excitement. Where is Bing Crosby when you really need it?
