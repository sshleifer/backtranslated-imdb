An anemic comedy-drama, unhappy, apparently rushed off the affair with Cher as a homemade housewife who is slowly engaging with a murderer hired to kill her husband. Chazz Palminteri, as a talk-hired gun, adjusted the script from his own drama, with stagnant settings and dialogue that quickly dragged around the eye and ear. The darkness of the darkness hangs over the entire project, and the director Paul Mazurski can not pull Cher out of his constant funk (she is voluntary). Despite all the top talent (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), "Faith" is a fake, without any substance in the story and characters that rarely come to life. * 1/2 of ****
