The theme that this latest adman-movieman tries to discover in his debut (ad) is a fairly ancient topic of discussion of almost every cultural standard - timeless romance (dash). However, research (and exploitation for Desi auds) is quite short as the usual preference for 'pepper, spice and sugar' along with the usual masala blend of b / g scores, dialogues, dancing, drama, etc. Not much in there. In the first 40 minutes of film the kitchen is repeated at least 8-9 times. Further repetition follows through the film (after all, the main hero is the chef). But there lies the problem in it - no story! Huh, no wonder. Someone forgot to write a script. Amitabh puts in Chechnya Jiada (more) an amount of excessive activity. Really when will this guy ever stop? How many 60 people are moving around, even when they tease them nubila 30-something? Timeless mind, but surely, what about the non-old body? And the only one? Sorry baby ?! Reasonably good acting by Paras Raval, who has the only reasonable role in the film. The director lacks any sense of realism that could be caught in his newly discovered discovery of a hot new idea. Nowhere did we get to know the real problems or problems that such a couple can face, except that we are actually getting married, which is just an initial obstacle. The sub-plot of a small child with cancer (the first love of a boy) does not go anywhere and regardless of the small amount of brutality that would otherwise inspire the presentation would quickly kill itself along with the character of the girl. In any case, a nice try, but not yet.
