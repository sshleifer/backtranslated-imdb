The fact that music did not like me is a very personal opinion, and historical inaccuracies are not. I understand that it is an opera, not a documentary, but some important aspects are missing, especially if other people falsely comment on it. Abbas Abbas was the main organizer of this operation, which was set up and reorganized due to discovery on board, in order to free 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons, one of which is Samir Kuntar, a repulsive terrorist whose story can be Find in the search for "klinghoffer samir kuntar" on google. Abbas Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, even if he never took Achille Lauro. Ben Laden never touched the planes that hit the VTC, right? *** Possible spoilers The film almost justifies the actions and reactions of the terrorists. because of the horrors they could live, always emphasizing and exaggerating how many Israelis did to hurt them. However, they never show the injury Palestinians have ever caused to Israelis. The film uses (pretty terrible !!!) images from the horrors of Saber and Chatile, and nothing is said, underlining the general belief that Israel was the one who was responsible, without ever mentioning that it was a Syrian-Lebanese army that led The acting was generally very bad, but I suppose that can be expected from opera singers? On the other hand, I'm shocked that a person can say terrorists to kill the hostage because the hostage tried to provoke 400 innocent hostages against armed terrorists, and added that this person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of Zionism . Imagine how much his wife was insensitive, spitting on the terrorists who killed her husband and threw his body into the sea. I hope that no one in the world is as cruel as she (vink vink)
