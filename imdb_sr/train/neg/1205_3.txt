What is this? Canadian producer of zombies I have never heard of before. The funeralman works on the body of a recently deceased young man. This allows for an extended flashback that shows how the guy came in there. Basically, he and his friends went to the graveyard on Friday, 13th, and raised the dead thanks to his stupid chanting. Move to the morgue where our dead body returns to life and kills the mortal and the owner (who draws eyes). Final VTF? the bullet has the owner of the funeral home in a flat jacket and screams: "I'm not crazy!" It is astounding to have its eyeballs. Running just 58 minutes, this is definitely one oddity in cinema zombies. She feels much longer, but put me in some kind of trance where I could not stop watching. The film also has one of those "if you see this picture, turn from the screen" to gags. This is the image of an old man who gets sick in the theater (prophetic?) And when it appears (only twice), blood begins to flow. The scenes are pretty damned for a period of time. There is a large gutter in which the zombie cuts the girl's right hand with a shovel, but - when he pulls the false hand into the frame to get up - that's the left hand.
