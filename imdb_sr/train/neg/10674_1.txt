This is one of the worst movies I've been watching for years. Apart from Cuba and Angie, acting is actually embarrassing. Was not Archer sometimes a decent actress? What happened to her? The action is decent, but totally unbelievable. Make-up is so bad that it's worth it. I mean, who's thinking about makeup in a contemporary feature film at all? Someone should tell make up an artist and a DOP that you should not see it. The end is a great disappointment - modeled after "and then they realized that it was all a dream." You'd better stare at the space for 2 hours.
