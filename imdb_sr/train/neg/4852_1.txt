I saw this movie once, and I thought it was okay. Then my friends at work said, "Watch it again, it's better." Well, I did. And to my surprise, the second time was BEST! There's a limit on the word, so I'll start the ball. - The bombardment was so stupid. Why would, for God's sake, wait for anyone to launch an explosion ??? None of the characters here are at all cute. Not the first time, not even the other. -Oh, and the last time I checked, the car does not explode from one shot, nor can a fire extinguisher be extinguished ... did the viewers over 3/10 watch the movie? - The camera is so scary that I can barely say what's happening. This starting scene with the robot took off my stomach, the rest of the movie was not much better. - Sniper scene. Brothers McManus (from "The Boondock Saints") turned their eyes, it was so stupid. First, why did the guy plant his gun where one person fired? Moreover, why would he spend so much time in cleaning bullets, reloading, planning, and not being hit when there was so much chaos around him? -SAS types of RUNNING instead of staying and struggling? Huh ????? Are soldiers ... gay ... ??? I did not want to sound homophobic, but honestly, that scene was so funny. - Too long for your own good, but too short for the amount of material tucked into it. Bigelow seems to think that the more action he is, the better. It seems to be wrong - the film is full of redundant action scenes that have thrown you away to distract you from the lack of central complication. I know that the Vatchman is longer for 163 minutes, but at least this film has not been withdrawn. This film, on the other hand, works, and for this, it feels longer. The only good thing was Renner, which was at best satisfactory. But do yourself a favor, just skip this, and do not argue.
