This movie is so bad that it's good - in an unintentionally fun way. I could not stop watching it, I was so laughing! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except that it's not a parody. Alekandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, the wife of a repressed preacher who hardly falls for Luke (Corei Sevier), a hunt and a mysterious wanderer, whom we finally learned in prison; The only thing Sevier is guilty about is bad behavior! Keep in mind that it's not worse than other actors. You have the feeling that the actors have no idea that they are in a really horrible movie; they play it. Everything about the movie is bad: acting, script, love scenes, pacing, storytelling, music selection. Climate scenes are so ridiculous - the first shooting in the church, then Luk's last words to Emily - I wrapped myself up with laughter. Apparently, Luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison, and we got to see quite a bit of his naked torso. It's probably the peak of the movie.
