The overheated action of "Bonjour tristesse" was taken from the first juvenile novel by Francoise Sagan, who became a bestseller, although God knows why. For teenagers who want to get rid of a potential step-parent, they may have some attraction. Do not indulge in the fact that David Niven plays the father of Pablo and Deborah Kerr, the stepfather's perspective. Unfortunately, too much rests on the fragile shoulders of Jean Seberge. She is beautiful and easily fills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that it can hit the post, but it can not work. Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in Ota Preminger's movie. Joan - Seberg - she knows she was incapable of carrying a movie. This film, also Preminger, fulfills the "promise" of the first one. It was her second film; Now she was 20. What did Preminger mean? Can Niven and Kerr make up for Seber's lack of acting capacity? No chance? Saber's character is at the heart of the story and, quite although persuasive, although perhaps physically 17, he can not satisfy the emotional demands of that role. I do not know if she has ever become a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later paintings. But anyone who thinks this film is better than a central taste check. In spite of Niven and Kerr, this remains a story of juveniles who in a minor manner performed a beautiful young girl who needed lessons for acting.
