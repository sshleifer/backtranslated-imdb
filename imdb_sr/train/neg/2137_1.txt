Even the first 10 minutes of this film were terrible. It's hard to believe that anyone other than John Cusack would invest in it. With a series of anti-war / anti-war films that have already been destroyed at the box office, it's almost unthinkable that any studio of any kind wants to connect with this scenario. At first, it might have seemed like some kind of politically motivated derivation of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack (s) again. But only about 90 seconds in the movie, it becomes obvious that this is an attempt without talent DR STRANGELOVA. I must say that I do not know if Cusack is healthy enough so that I can even watch one more thing that is playing again, unless someone else guarantees it. Cusack seems so irreparably damaged by his hatred of George Bush and the war in Iraq that is ready to commit suicide in his career. Tom Cruise was never close to being so far. Not even close.
