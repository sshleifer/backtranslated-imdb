Murder by numbers is one of those films that are expected to be made for TV, but not. Since the only actor is Bullock (although Michael Pitt seems to be heading for bigger and better things), it's not a big surprise that this film quickly disappears from memory to be replaced with more important things. Like ... remembering locking the front door when you get out. Or returning clothes when you get out of the shower. Bullock plays Cassie Maiveather, a policeman with personal problems (not all of them). Together with her new partner (wet Ben Chaplin) she was invited to investigate the murder of a young woman. Nothing unusual there except that the cops are a couple of teenagers who think they were planning and executing a perfect killing. As the investigation continues, there is a battle of will between Cassie and the main suspect Richie Haivood (Ryan Gosling). The problem with the mutilation is that these two traces are hopeless. Bullock, although it is very nice to watch, is so convincing in the role of a sharp cynical policeman as Rodney Dangerfield (in fact, it would be better!). Chaplin, for his sins, is a complete non-entity and I am sorry that he has to put this film on his CV in his attempt to break into Hollivood. At least Gosling and Pitt, as cunningly mocking suspects, are releasing themselves appropriately. It is as if the bad trails were not bad enough, a story that would send everyone to sleep and a highly predictable (but illogical) ending the filming of this film in the head before it has the chance to run. There is absolutely nothing that could happen in the "Numbering Murder", even the foolish headlines of the Bullock scene would not have been used. Well, just a bit, but it's still not enough to preserve it. Notorious, predictable and superfluous - this is a movie that will not move the genre of the cops forward. As Cassie probably said about her next case, there's nothing to be seen here. Get moving, keep moving ...
