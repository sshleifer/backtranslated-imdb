Hey, if you have a little more than an hour to kill and find the color to be too exciting, I would suggest it. If you accidentally love cheap b-movies like me, it's good for giggling! In addition, I would not suggest you rent it, I would wait for it to come to the hole, say around 4am on the free access channel of your cable / satellite supplier. The band that worked on this soundtrack was on the way after about two years after this film, and they did not sound equally bad for the two reviews I could find on them. So, once again, it's good if your grass grows much more fun, but it's good to watch if you want to see how not to film a low-budget movie.
