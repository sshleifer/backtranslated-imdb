Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch the camera again. If he does, he should be arrested on the spot ... at least for a minute stealing. Anyone who pays even ten cents for renting any of his garbage should file a lawsuit and make up for it. This was my first look at "work" ... and that will be my last. Ed Vood looks very good to me now. When I return this shit to the video store, I will personally seek to remove it from the shelf. An active gay cinematographer, I was angry and angry that he would be allowed to distribute and pack something similar to this distorted, extremely untalented man-child, with a little handsome boy on the cover page (Jamie Brett Gabel, who, fortunately, has no other active credits in IMDb) and an interesting synopsis on the back that is used as a bait, and then place it as a "movie" rental. Believe me, this has no place on any stand; It's just not a movie in any sense of the word. Slanderous, irresponsible garbage like this can only be detrimental to the efforts involved in promoting and supporting gay cinema (hell, gai rights in general!) For those who are tempted to rent this because of the covers, you will be disappointed. Gabel is not so flattered to watch a movie as it is on the cover, and it appears once or twice without a T-shirt - that's it. Instead, domestic Mroavich inflicts on us his disgusting, sorrowful nudity for the boy. This "thing" that was "compiled" is a reversed vanity project for Mraovich. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch (who, as far as I understand, are putting similar smelly rubbish) are terrible. Mraovich deliberately presents himself as a complete non-talent (in all fields), desperately seeking to catch any "losing" attention he can for himself. He should be sorry.
