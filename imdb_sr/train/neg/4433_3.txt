I really wanted to like this film much more than I did. This is because I love the bummer side of the comedy - especially the strange ones that completely surprise you. However, even though this was often surprising, it was almost never pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park that almost every social norm was violated until the only ones left to protest were not too sick to be ridiculous. For example, after investigating adultery, drug abuse (almost every kind - from pot, heroin, speed to sniffing glue), prostitution, S & M, suicides, murders, etc., the film came to a ridiculous topic of pedophilia. Mom encouraged a son (who looked around for 12 years) to sleep with his neighbors. In fact, at one point in the film she gives this boy a dentist instead of paying for dental work! Funny ?! You must be joking. This film goes too far and enters the "black hole of comedy". What should be the next, cancer or rectal tumors?
