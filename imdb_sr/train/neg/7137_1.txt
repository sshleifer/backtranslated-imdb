The cars in this movie are great. The acting in this movie is terrible. Scenes and driving scenes do not make much sense and are equally bad. If you really bother movies where someone changes and suddenly goes faster, save yourself trouble and money. Good movie for fans? Well, there's a section where they make a mistake and they're called a NASCAR driver as a Rally driver. If you can not tell the difference, go watch, you have an explosion. It really comes down to that, in this movie there really are really nice cars, they are terribly driven and completely unrealistic. The acting is terrible mainly because of extremely bad complications. If you want to see hot girls, turn on mtv or vh1 instead. I'm disappointed that such nice cars will be presented in such a bad movie. If the class of cars were similar to that in the movie, they should race with rusty bikes.
