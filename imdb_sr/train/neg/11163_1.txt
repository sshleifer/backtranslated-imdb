We liked the Rock and Jack Black school. We could not wait to see this movie. It was the only time in my movie that the movie was so bad that I wanted to go out. And my husband hated it. The only funny things were in the trailers. My husband and I wanted to stand in front of the cinema and tell people to save their money. Writing was terrible. He had every terrible stereotype about Latin American people who should be completely offended. The film was not so long, but it seemed to us as eternity. People in the theater were so restless and quiet that it was like looking at dry colors. My husband remained because I was sure there might be some redemption parts, but there was no one. Save money and your time.
