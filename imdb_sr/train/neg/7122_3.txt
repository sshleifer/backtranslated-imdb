"The Screaming Skull" opens with a warning and offer for free funeral services if you die watching it - Now there's a hook! The story itself has a rather interesting premise for a terrible momentum: a bored husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, and then tries to convince her that she will go crazy with penetrating sounds, mysterious typing and skulls that appear at inappropriate times. Add the formula of a sufficiently creepy gardener who still nurtures a memory of his first woman to whom he was dedicated. Perhaps only that fifty did not have the technology to pull some of the scenes needed to hide this film, the techniques used here look fancy and everyday. But again, when I first saw the "House on the Faulty Hill" as a 9-year-old, he gave me heebie jeebies in the same way that I'm sure this film did for young viewers of the same era. Do not misunderstand me, the movie is not terrible, it just looks tedious sometimes. But there is a great atmospheric tension in the generally large but uninhabited Vhitlock House, and the gardens and the pool are a nice touch. For me, the best-played scene included Eric Hudson, maniacally maneuvering in the lake, trying to reach the hidden skull, he just hits right into clothes and all that, in contrast to a mentally handicapped garden (director Alec Nicol in a double spirit) role). That's why you ask yourself who was a real joker. In his good way, perhaps the most shocking thing in the movie: how about the neat roadster that Witlock first entered - the gable door 1958! At least it made me jump from the seat!
