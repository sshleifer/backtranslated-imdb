"Loonatics Unleashed" is the worst thing that can happen to the classic characters created by Chuck Jones. "Looni Tunes" have many spin-offs and various versions, some were good, others not much. But "Loonatics" is the worst. . There were no similarities with the original characters and the stories were boring and badly made. The new design is ugly and animation is pathetic. This broadcast just does not work. This terrible loss of animation is a total failure and it should not be anything more than a bad joke. Lame! Zero stars
