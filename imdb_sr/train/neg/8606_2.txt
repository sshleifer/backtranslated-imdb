I love the killer Movie Insects that are fun to watch, I had to watch this movie because it was one of my favorite horor books Shaun Hutson. I met him and I want to hear like this movie was awesome as he said that after he said I was still dying to see how bad it was. Zaplet: People die mysteriously and disgustingly, and no one has a clue. Only medical worker Mike Brady has a possible solution, but his theory of killer snails is laughed at by the authorities. Only when the number of bodies starts to rise and the expert for brooms from England begins to sniff whether it starts to look as though Mike had a real idea anyway. This movie as the most recognizable movie you ever see! The guns in this movie are quick (then normal) and seem to quickly redirect scenes! This film is not like a book at all, the book is ten times terrible, ten times bleeding and had a lot more stories! I did not like it at all! As a big fan of snails, books and other books called Fertile Soil! Both books are great. Read the book, then watch the movie, maybe you like it, and then I too.
