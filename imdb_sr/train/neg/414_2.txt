If you enter this film, you know that this movie has six lab technicians in a closed laboratory with an invisible maniac. So immediately guess who will live and who will die. Surviving at the end are exactly those of whom you expect to be, so there are no points to screw up the action. And if you're not sure whether this is a B-movie or a film that just happens in a lab with an interesting story, Villiam Devane plays the role: the current status of B-movie. Film initially promises. In the laboratory we are introduced to an invisible gorilla that is becoming more and more violent. Oooh, shit. The best scene in the entire movie is when the lab team makes a visible gorilla again. Great special effects. The same thing when Bacon made invisible. There are a few naked breasts, a really silly dirty joke and enough indecent cursing to make this movie a R-rating that really does not need For the thriller there were actually no surprises, except when Shue makes it MacGiver in the freezer, what's more "Vhaaaa"? OK, there is a surprise. Then Caine (Bacon) returns to the lift shaft for the last time. It was a surprise, but just because you shout on TV, 'Noooo! You're already dead! Finish the movie! Speaking of TV broadcasting, that's all I've been doing for the last 25 minutes. "Put glasses for f # @% ing!" Instead of putting their infrared glasses so that they can see it, they try every other trick in the book (fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems ...). The story really lost at the end. But the special effects were good; that's the only reason I give it 2/10.
