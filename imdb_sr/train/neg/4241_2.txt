Yes, Madsen's character - while talking to a woman from a TV station - is right: LAPD is corrupt, violent and racist police. And this film does not change anything about it. All right, here are good policemen, moral cops, even black, a Christian, a martyr. But this is a fairy tale, admit it. Reality is not like that. And most importantly for action fans: Shoot is boring. It's just shooting, recording, and recording. Nothing more. Play Counter Strike, then you will at least have something to do. The only morality of this film is: LAPD is now good. No more bad policemen in it. If you like uncritical, euphemistic advertising for the police and military service, watch this movie. It's the longest commercial I've ever seen. (2 points for camera and editing).
