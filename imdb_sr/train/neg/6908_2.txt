This series had the potential, but I guess its budget would not allow it to see this potential. An interesting setting, which does not differ from the "lost", falls after the first episode. The entire sequence, 6 episodes, could make a convincing 90-minute movie, but the creators decided to pull it out. Many scenes were unbearably slow and long, without moving the action forward. The music was very boring and did not work at all. There were several characters we were worried about because their characters did not grow during the time frame - well, it grew a bit. The end was terrible as the rest of the series. The only honor here is the artistic costumes and costumes, they created an interesting appearance, a shame that the writer and director had no predictions to do something interesting with that element
