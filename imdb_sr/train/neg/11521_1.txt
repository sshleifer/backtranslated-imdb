This movie is really one of the worst pieces of garbage ever. It's really surprising that something terrible can do. But if you can handle an um-numbing plot, character development, and direction, you can get a kick from a soundtrack that's so terrible it's funny. The film begins terribly and quickly becomes unremarkable. Someone should give someone who is involved in this movie some kind of comfort because their career was probably destroyed due to participation in this movie. If you end up watching this movie or have already seen it (I feel your pain) then these words came too late. For all the others, either at any price or you realize that the movie is so bad that it will spend 2 hours of your life. Then you can at least clean it or something while you watch it.
