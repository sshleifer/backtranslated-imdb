Asked how I would define the word "shallow", I would answer "Watch the production of Jerry Bruckheimer". Asked how I would define the phrase "Spent Potential" I would answer "Watch Jerry Bruckheimer's Production". Bruckheimer's productions are almost always sure that they are boxing hits, but they almost always get a critical critique from critics. From the top of my head, I can only imagine THE OFFICED AND THE GIRLS and BLACK HAVK DOVN to get a lot of critical approval. CRIMSON TIDE also received some praiseworthy criticism from critics, which is certainly one of the best Bruckheimer films that unfortunately does not speak much. The problem I had was the scenario that sets the story: the Russians fight against the Chechen and the conflict spreads throughout Russia, which leads to the ultranationalist Rus taking over the nuclear missile base and closing the West if they interfere. Perhaps the end of the Cold War had everything to do with it, but I realized it was very unconvincing. They do not help with some mistakes in geography such as the French carrier Foch in Med (would not Foch be better positioned in the Black Sea?) Or that the exhibition film consists of well-known footage of conflicts from the Balkans, the first Gulf War, even Vietnam. Once again, my adjective "Very Inconvenient" got into my mind. The story improves somewhat when the story is told - The will of the will in connection with the command between the submarine commander and his number two - begins. Director Toni Scott does everything in his power, but the problem still lies in an inconclusive scenario. The worst thing is that if it was done in the mid-1980s when the VV3 was a realistic option - Probability - this film would scare me, but after the end of the Cold War there was a danger of a nuclear war, which means that CRIMSON TIDE has little impact.
