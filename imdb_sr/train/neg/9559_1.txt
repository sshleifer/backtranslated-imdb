I will try to use words to describe it ... I saw the original, which was good in my own way, but then I should have been afraid of the sequel. And I was "scared" when I picked this up, but now that I've seen it, I must say it's even worse than I thought. Why are these movies still getting the money, they're still turning me around. Let's start with the actors, they're not very good, but it must be said, some turn their heads so simply awful. But what an actor can do with a script like this one. It is an attempt to be a copy of the original only this time when the places have changed, any form of the story has disappeared, and any attempt to get to something that has not been done before will collapse. In a futile attempt to update it, they are trying to make it exciting, using the whole theme of 'Big Brother', but it has been exhausted for a long time and offers nothing else to filling between the beginning and the end. An attempt was made to keep the film by making a tonal reference to the original from '83, but it simply ended up so it was simply funny and sometimes a bit sad. In conclusion, if you do not have anything, and I do not mean anything, do ... go watch, or play a frisbee ... with a DVD ... yourself. You will be offered the same amount of fun .. I promise
