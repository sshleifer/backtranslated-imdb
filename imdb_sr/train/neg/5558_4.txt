I do not have too much time here, I just want to say Darkman 3 is awesome. I have all three on DVD, I added them to my DVD movie collection. Darkman is there with the best, such as Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Die Hard, you understand the point. There are not too many good horrors, trillers there. Thank you very much for the whole crew, and we prepared to give us the Darkman trilogy. By the way, if you are wondering how I came to this DVD. I purchased it online, however, it is region 4, as you know that most of the American DVD players in the region are 1. If you have Sony Plaistation 2, you have the best DVD player, because it is a player in all regions. Simply go to setup, and then select the desired region setting (1-9).
