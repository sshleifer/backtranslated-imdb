apparently has some talent, Maria Bello is always big. but this is only a gloomy waste of time, portraying each character as someone who is despised and exploited so that someone can make a movie from an 'interesting' story. Well, I hope they got him out of their systems. Unfortunately for the audience, there is no insight, no sensitivity, no context, and there really is no humanity. What would be all right, except that there is no humor, no horror, no context, and nothing constructive to say about the story he is trying to say. Bad things happen, sit and watch it, you do not care, so what? In 99% of cases, the words "based on a true story" represent an unintentional warning to the audience. this means that the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated with some of the events they have heard about, and they just throw them on the screen and expect a 'real' story so that the audience can feel something without the film's authors having to do anything. I hope they have great fun in filming this movie. It smells like ice.
