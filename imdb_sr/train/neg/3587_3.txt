How can I from Joe Don Baker (like Bufford Pusser in the first continuation) to Bo Svenson (like Bufford Pusser in the second sequel). Why did they do it for? Just because Bo Svenon looks more like Bufford Pusser should still have not changed him because the first sequel was Joe Don Baker like Bufford Pusser and that's one of the things I wanted to see in the second sequel. I would give this film 7 out of 10 and I would give him 1 out of 10 if the story had nothing to do with Bufford Pusser's life, but he did it and why I gave this movie 3 out 10. <br /> I strongly suggest that anyone who plans to watch this cheese suggest that you do not watch the first sequel.
