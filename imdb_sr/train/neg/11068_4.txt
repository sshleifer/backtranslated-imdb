Dahmer, a young confused man. Dahmer, a confusing movie. However, I had several beers while I was watching a movie, but that does not explain why this film was boring to me. the beginning and the end, the only thing that made sense in the film was to explain the text at the beginning and at the very end of the film. Between things that would be a film, they are just boring pictures and a waste of time. We never see real killings, everything is just a bunch of insinuations. Sometimes you even get the feeling that Dahmer dreams of the whole thing, but you know it's not, because it's based on a true story, and that actually happened, at least in most cases. But what happened? It's not easy to say. I do not encourage people to spend time on this movie. I <br /> I did not like either a little and I felt cheated when I suddenly finished. <br /> <br /> * / *****
