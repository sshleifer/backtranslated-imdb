What a boring film! All in all, it was basically only Nana Patekar who won the daughter-in-law Karizo Kapoor while she was trying to escape from the village with her son. Can anyone say BORING ??? The concept was not bad, but it was badly performed. Canadian sites and some of the countryside scenes are beautifully recorded. However, the total cinema was short. The story could be great, but the movie just retreated. There is only so much nonsense that a person can take, let alone three damn hours. The best part of the whole movie was the song "Ishk Fireplace", which was only five minutes. Besides, this movie was a shit.
