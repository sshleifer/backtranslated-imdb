I do not think that any Van Damme film will ever win the Universal Soldier, but you never know. This film was good, but not as good as the first one. VD returns Luka and has to fight again. He's trying to be funny here, but he might be worth a mockery. VD has a kid this time from Ally V., he showed his picture well. VD and Goldberg had good fights. It was the end of the first, but not so good. VD makes its best career move, as always - HELIKOPTER KICK. Although the final ending should have been longer. In any case, it's worth a look, but it will never outperform the original.
