After watching this movie I was so upset that I lost 2 hours of my life. It's 2 hours. I'll never return. Ugh. When you start this you may think "This is really good!" But be sure that the first impressions do not mean anything. I was so excited about this film all the way to the dumbest end I've ever seen. This film is simply pathetic. The acting is bullish, the story is just not original and there is nothing special about it except that it's THE BEST FILM OF THIS !!! DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!! WARNING !! DUMBEST MOVIE EVER YOU WILL BE SORRY IF YOU LEAVE 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS !!! 1/10
