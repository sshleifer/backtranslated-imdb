This movie blows - let's get it straight away. Within this bunch of shit there are several scenes for the scene, but nobody can use the cockroach. Colin Farrell looks like Brad Pitt at "12 Monkeys" and works in a similar way. I usually hate Colin because he is a general fairy, but it's okay in this movie. There were two lines in this film: a kid casting stones through the windshields of moving vehicles, and the other on a woman with mustache. Let's face it - this film has no strange idea of ​​what it wanted to say or where it wants. Character story lines are interlaced at some levels, but they do not deserve to be included in the script. The whole thing is weak and meaningless, and there is also an occasional OK scene. But overall - do not worry if you do not like so many Irish accents that you can look at the core and that everyone who sounds like an elf Luckie Charms - an American fetish who catapulted some really shitty films - is rescuing.
