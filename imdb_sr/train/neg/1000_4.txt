The Descent action, if it can actually be called a parcel, has two important events. One at the beginning - one at the end. These events together make up perhaps 5% of the total movie time. All (and I mean everything) among other things is basically the desperate attempt of the director to fill in the record. I love disturbing movies, I love dark movies and I do not bother with exciting scenes - but if you expect to sit in 60 minutes of foggy / dark (literally) scenes with NO story, there's more. Rosario Davson, one of my favorite actresses is completely lost here. And no, it does not get off, even in the NC-17 version, which I've seen. If you have a few hours to throw and want to watch "Descent", take it instead - you'll probably have more interesting dreams.
