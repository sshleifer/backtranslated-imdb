Fantastic Mr. Fok is a comedy based on the classic book of Roald Dahl. All of Anderson keeps and honors a short book of the same name on a big screen in a full movie. As I respect what Anderson did, an incredibly talented man, it seemed that the film was lost in its spiritual spirit. Anderson seems to have left the story behind him knowing that he is a talented man, and if it were a bad movie, that would be his first bad movie. Just like when you go to school and you have the first bad day, this is Anderson's first bad day in filming, so I'll easily let him go. I admit that it was smart and nice, and the animation is beautiful, but the film is becoming increasingly difficult to enter, leaving the story behind and having random footage of random things. The characters are also good. Jason Schwarzman votes to Mr. George Cloonei, a smart son, Ash, and particularly interesting. The film fails to the level of horror, but it is getting closer and closer. I'm sure Ves Anderson will be back on track with another incredible movie when and where he decides to make another movie, but for now I'm sorry, Ves Anderson, this was your big disappointment.
