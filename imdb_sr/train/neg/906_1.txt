Yes, this movie brought me to real horror when I realized that I paid for and spent more than an hour of my life trying to watch it. The bald only gives me the impression that I am a psycho-hero actor, and the girl is the worst actress I've ever seen. Believe me if you appreciate your time to avoid this movie, I understand that the movie requires money to create, and some movies do not have that money, but it's not a justification for stupid plot and bad acting. I always support independent films, when they deserve support, but such films make a bad name for this kind of movie. I'm still traumatized. I will not believe any more in a nice mask.
