This movie could be a decent B-movie if the 3/4 film is not so focused on sex scene. I mean, he's addicted to sex, and I'm sure a lot more happens with addicts about sex outside sex on a permanent basis. Michael Des Barres did a good job considering everything he had to do, which was not much. At one time or another, a man would have to laugh, because his character was so poor. Nastassja Kinski was right in her role as a concerned sex therapist, although she could do more, but I did not suggest her having sex. The person most excelling in this film was Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as a woman who loves and cares. There is something about the beauty inside and out that I like very much. She played this role and while you were watching the movie, you began to feel bad about her. The "Sexual Addiction Diary", while not an Oscar or a modern classic according to any standards, is pretty informative and does a real job showing you how personal demons can take over and destroy things in your life that you feel are very important.
