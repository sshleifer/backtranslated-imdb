I watched that almost nothing knows about it, except for the brief description I read here. After watching it, I will first say that the director promises, but looks like an amateur, then I looked at other things he did to see whether it was his first or the second film, but no, he did it on House on Haunted Hill Fear Dot Com. Somehow he missed the sign on both films and the same was with this. The story was pretty scary, can one just fall in love with a girl because she is beautiful but has a child's mind? I gave her 3 because some of the pictures I used to enjoy at the end, but in general, this movie is pretty awesome.
