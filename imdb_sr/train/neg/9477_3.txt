This had to be one of the brightest Wrestlemanian ever and only 2 matches. Hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley, also Vince Mcmahon vs. Shaun Michaels. The main event between Price and Triple H was a complete rinse and to be honest, I almost fell asleep, it was so useless. complete joke. If you are a really great fan of VVE and you missed the first days of VVF and Vrestlemanias 17 and 19 you will probably love this. But I discovered that this Vrestlemania left a lot to wish.
