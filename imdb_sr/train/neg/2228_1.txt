This movie is weak, Bok-cover says it's the toughest gang in east LA and that's really Santa Ana, James Cahill behaves like a queen in a closet that takes away all the hard guys in the Chlo group. It's fake, boring, pointless and rude, I tried to get my money from the video store this movie was so bad. It was also at the homo-erotic peak away from what video-flank proclaimed. James Cahill should perform in Gai Porno. James is in every scene, he can not behave in order to save his life. In the film is Eva Longoria who is hot, but James can not even get in with her !!!!!!!!! Sometimes I felt like I was watching Gai Porn and I was excluded from the whole movie. James obviously wants to be with men, and then pretends to gay wishes to beat gang members over and over again and again. His skills in martial arts were at least minimal, some real members of the gang would take him and his bad skills and take away a new one.
