I remember I like this show when I was a kid. I thought the helicopter was the best thing I saw. It was ultra-high tech at that time. He could refuse enemy fire, make all kinds of acrobatics in the air, and download almost everything in his own way. Now I come back and watch it today and I'm surprised how bad this episode really is. Members of the actors are hardly tempting, there are a lot of nasty moments, and the scene of the fight is incredibly fake. Almost every end has the same shit with a helicopter that is obviously re-used with grainy low-quality images. Many recordings emerge from the time of the Vietnam War. Airvolf has basically the same theme as the Knight Rider, except that the vehicle is to combat the crime that a helicopter was chosen instead of a car. After watching several episodes, I found myself quite boring. Still, I love music on the topic.
