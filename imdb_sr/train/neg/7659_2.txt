Alone In The Dark is a bad movie and tied to Deuce Bigalov for the worst movie of the year. I wish it was ALL that I had to say, but of course the IMDb predicted the number of words and all that. I'm in two minds about what a bad movie is bad type of bad movie. Low budget like the Red Zone of Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a huge budget shame like Gigli, Superbabies or this guff. You see movies such as Monster A Go Go and Manos, because the director has no idea. Such films are because the director is a stupid idiot who just does not care about his audience. It's more shocking when you consider it to be Uwe Boll (the main creator of this shocking shit and has some real garbage under the belt) has created something that only happens once in the blue month. A really terrible bad horor. Everything about this is a mess. Cheesi CGI, bad shop, crazy random videos and horrible soundtrack. Sam in the dark is an awesome movie to watch absolutely no one. Voo hoo! Reviev over. Give me a bud, turn to 2006 and I will never talk about it anymore. Do not watch this movie.
