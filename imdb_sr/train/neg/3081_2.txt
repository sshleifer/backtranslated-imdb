Good grief! While I still claim that Manos: The Fate of Destiny is the worst part of mental torture available, the Hobgoblins have come very close. This ... this ... thing offends the audience at every opportunity. The least films like Space Mutiny and Future Var can be enjoyed by mst3k, this was a struggle to pass. I literally tortured myself on the couch. This thing managed to embarrass me - alone! Even if you are a stubborn MST3K fan and you've made your mission to see every experiment, think twice about it. That's so bad.
