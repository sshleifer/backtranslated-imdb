I gave up trying to figure out which version I was watching. Copyright in the end point to 1983. And although this is not an important part of my objection to this film, I will say that watching the film was obviously made during the Aquarian Age (including long hippie chickens and disgusting cars), but with Sinter music from the 1980s it's disturbing . Extremely disturbing. My main remark is HOW WE ARE FILMMAKERS BURI CUTE-AS-A-BUTTON PAMELY FRANKLIN ALIVE. HOV DARE THEI. Seriously, she is a fan and a thing, but in two films I've seen - this crapfest and otherwise the perfect Legend of Hell House - they're killing her. > I want to meet the film industry. Pamela Franklin has clearly withdrawn from the business, but if she ever decides to do another movie, and some damn directors are trying to kill her, I'll ask him if he will get out. PAMELA FRANKLIN AND FURTHER FROM IT. I AM KUIT CROSS. THE KING HAS BEEN REMEMBERED. For fans of B-movie looking for coffee, it could be much worse than this. On the plus side, this is not a film that involves satanism in a peripheral and cautious manner - this film is a hardcore Satanic movie. Satanic Ceremonies, Buffets, Hallucinations, Absurdly Pac Attack - What else can you ask for? This great thing is almost destroyed by the confusing synthetic soundtrack of the 1980s, which is not adapted to the film as it is possible. Soundtrack reminded me of something you would hear on an equalizer. It's really bad. They also made Pamela Franklin crush her charming English accent, which was also a rather rude, if not a cruel beast (against the viewer), as can be found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I say we have the right to hear that Pamela Franklin speaks with her voice. Who's with me? I could forgive everything else about this movie if they do not abuse Pamela Franklin. And so I lowered my glove, gentlemen - EVERYONE THAT IS PRESENTED WITH THE FRANKLIN'S FRUIT. Even on the Fictional Context. GOOD DAY, SIRS.
