'Omen 4: The Avakening' was made for the television sequel to the original film 'Omen'. Instead of Satan owning the body of a young boy, he possesses the body of a little girl who has been adopted by rich parents, who is abused at school and who ultimately refuses to make those who make it wrong. It seems that the film is struggling with any horror factor, and many events that are happening are simply stupid, not particularly intimidating, and it's hard to believe that this girl is Satan, even with all the events that surround her. I just did not think this film was very tense or intimidating, especially compared to the original.
