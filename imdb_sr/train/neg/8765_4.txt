I've seen this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas Day. A short summary of this film MUST BE REMOVED. JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this film and did not do any of these jobs well. . Apparently based on the facts, from this film you get a hint of the difficulties that the Indian army had in re-occupying the area of ​​Pakistani soldiers - who took a high position. But instead of telling what must have been a convincing and heroic story, all that this film does is that the Indian army looks ridiculous and stupid, which I know is not true. I watched this film with an almost entirely Indian audience, which was very patriotic and obviously wanted to like this movie, but they also laughed at scenes that were not meant to be funny. It gave the impression that Mr. Dutta does not know anything about how the army is doing and uses bad war films for reference. The result is a script that is meaningless and repetitive. The acting of most directors was not great, but given the script they got, it's hard for me to criticize them too much. As far as support is concerned, all I can say is that I hope they were amateurs. The editing was also pretty bad. It was quite difficult to keep track of what was going on for a long time, and music would suddenly end up changing the scene. Good things: The cinema was pretty good, although it was slightly hurt The fact that the movie did not look right in color (the color balance often varied considerably within the scenes). Also, several songs that were in the movie were pretty pleasant - at least for the first half of a dozen verses. Unfortunately, they went much longer than they needed. The worst crime? This mess is the FOUR TIME OF DUGA. It is enough that a good editor could almost squeeze a good movie from 1.5 to 2 hours from what was filmed. Unfortunately, a good editor did not work on this movie.
