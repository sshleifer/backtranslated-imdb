I love movies, and I'll watch any movie to the end, just to give him a chance. Finally I can say that I found a movie that I can not look through until the end. The act was awfully stagnant and monotone, CGI looks like a computer geek who did it in your mother's basement with minimal software, and ..... long scenes just ... walk !!!! And this movie is THREE SATA DUGA !!! I did not even manage 15 minutes until I redirected the DVD. Alien scenes are very short. Um, instead of calling it "War of the Worlds", we name the "Long Distance War". That costs $ 5 million! What is the money being spent on, a dramatic opening song? Oh, but on a positive note, one scene you need to watch is when aliens start killing people. It's hilarious, not because people are dying, but because when they turn to the skeletons, they continue to flick for 20 seconds after that. stole movies without action, here is one DVD collection for you. But I did not write this to you, I wrote this for billions of billions of other people who would hate this movie. It's not worth your time or money I know it's a book, but the book is not that long, and I'm a complete worm / nerd / nerter / anything, but why? Just get the version of Steven Spielberg, it's not very good, but it's 10 times better than this! I give this GREAT, FAT ZERO of 10.
