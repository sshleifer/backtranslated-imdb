Ironically, Doctor Seuss's story that highlights the non-commercialization of Christmas should be one of the most developed, most sought-after and most successful blockbusters of the holiday season. The general essence of Ron Howard's adaptation is that Grinch's struggle against Christmas comes from early childhood and that those who are themselves caught up in the materialism of the season, except for Cindy Lou Woo (well-played by Tailor Momsen). This film produces a fierce, ambitious attempt to capture the screams and feelings of Seuss' story, but the end result is a film that lurk and is never quite full of an emotional blow to the animated version of Chuck Jones. Jim Carrey is worthy of attention in his performance as Devilish Grinch, but whether it's a dialogue, pacing, or redundant tales of a cloak at the initial shop, the transformation from a bitter poor into a joyful charity simply does not light up convincingly. There are several wonderful visual effects, and make-up work is incredible, but besides technical triumphs, one or two elements are missing. Concatenation? Soul? /> Or maybe Jones made an initial adaptation too well in his 25-minute cartoon which Hovard misses in a three-hour film. Howard, Carey and crew are very capable and talented, but what appears to be a winning combination is only weak and collapses in their final product. If you need to look at the featured version, rent it on a video with Jones's animated version and you can see the bigger the glitzier is not always better. I give this film three cans of Vho-Hash from five.
