This movie is so stupid that it just goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous. I wanted to watch "Darkness Falls" and I think it's a movie. Man, what a mistake! I was as quick as I could, yet I could not solve the boring moments. I just envy people who are paid to play or work on this movie. They actually got the money for this shit. Is not that amazing? I mean, in this film, a man is killed and cuts in a wooden mill for small bloody pieces and a few moments later, the mother and the kid talk calmly at the table because nothing happened and drank coffee. Please! Come on! Who gives money for such films? Oh, and "tooth fairy" was poor. It was not scary at all, and it was obvious that it was a boring stuntman wearing a badly made makeup.
