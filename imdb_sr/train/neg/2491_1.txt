Maiden Voiage is exactly that. I would like to say right away that I watched 5 minutes of this before I could no longer bear it. As already stated in another commentary, this film does not fall into the whole thing "it's so bad is good," but it's just bad. The acting is terrible, SFF is poor, and the story is stupid and stupid. Even the drinking utensils, "bag watchers" and the like, seem to hold their weapons like water pistols. How low your expectations are, you will still be disappointed.
