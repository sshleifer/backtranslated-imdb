The Honei, Shrunk the Kids franchise was a huge thing and not to mention a very famous one. I loved Meda, I lowered the children when I was young. It was an original story and she had such an exciting plot! The sets were so incredible and the actors seemed to enjoy the company of others. Now, honey, I blew the kid pretty stupid, so I think they wanted to go back to the story they all loved. on vacation leave your husbands with your children. But when Vaine's favorite object is endangered by rubbish, he wants to gather it and keep it, but he and his brother are bothered. But when women return after they forget to give their medicines to their son, they get caught in the machine, leaving the children alone in the house! , it was just a family movie that I think some might get a kick. Original Honey, Shrunk the Kids is the best, I think we could all agree. The third was not so bad, I would recommend it at least through Honeys, and the Blev Up the Kid movie, it was at least a bit more fun. 4/10
