Unfortunately, more falls than climbs. The action was pretty decent. I mean, nothing unusual, but she had a story, unlike other modern horrors. Another good thing is an actor. I'm not saying that the acting was good, because it was not, but every actor / actress was hot and attractive. One of the things is that the film becomes exciting after the first 40 years. minutes. The rest was pretty boring. Another fall (or you can consider it if you want it) is an overstated nakedness. All four girls were in the toples for a few minutes, and all the boys showed their ass for a long time. It's not that I'm against nudity, but this was a horror movie, not 'The Dreamers'. Unless you are very desperate to watch someone like to take off your swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl without a naked speculation, or you are a thick fan of Debbie Rochon, but this is a movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, go away.
