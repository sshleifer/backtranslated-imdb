"Fantasy" from 1979 was very atmospheric, creepy, scary and very original, with only one word, cult. The first sequel from 1988 was bloody, witty, full of action and very funny. However, after the first sequel, the creator of "Fantasy" Don Coscarelli obviously had no new ideas. "Phantasm III - Lord Of The Dead" in 1994 is certainly not a complete failure, it is even quite fun, but there is no more originality, and desperate attempts to bring something new, sometimes tiring, which makes it quite disappointing in relation to its predecessors. - SPOILERS - Just at the beginning, we introduced the secret behind the mysterious sentinel sphere (flying silver balls that suck the brain) were discovered. Since then, the number of unnecessary and boring new characters (such as Tim, a small "Home Alone" style that's great in shooting, Rocka, a heavy and super cool ninja-rocking black fish with crew). The film also has its own features - Reggie Bannister is once again very cool as a guitar on horses, which plays Reggie. Angus Scrimm is still quite as angry as the High Man, but the fact that the High Man speaks much more in this film makes him lost by some of his abominations. Mike's character again plays A. Michael Baldwin (replaced by James LeGros in the second part), which, in my opinion, does not make a big difference. Blood also holds a movie that is interesting enough to watch, but it's still disappointing, especially because attempts to make up for the lack of ideas are bore very quickly. All in all, "Phantasm III" "is an acceptable time, but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors." Fans of the first two "Phantasm" films can try, but I recommend that your expectations are not too high.
