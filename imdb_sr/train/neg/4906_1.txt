Well, I do not know where to start. Obviously this was made for a TV movie, so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by the overall direction of the second hour, but everything that was before or after it looked like a picture by the number of movies. .. I would go even deeper, but this film does not deserve it. Rating: D + (IMDB rating 3/10)
