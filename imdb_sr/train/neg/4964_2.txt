This film is a farce! The names are grossly misinterpreted, and the plot is distorted and bumped into something unrecognizable by any literary enthusiast. And they have the chance to give Beovulf the edge of a funny cannon / crossbow. Beowulf does not need such weapons! In the poem, he grands Grendel's hand with his bare hands! And I can not believe that the screenwriters did such a thing. The way Grendel is shown is impressive. This and the actors are the only positive points of this characteristic. My English teacher would go crazy if he saw this disgust. Unless you are a tireless fan of the Beovulf epic song, avoid this film at all costs. Even then, I would not recommend it.
