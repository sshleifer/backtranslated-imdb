This is a truly insignificant clone of "LOCK STOCK" with star cast and horrible scenario. I have no idea why so many British actors have applied for this garbage, they must have been bribed. The sword of the match will last for forever and forever, and if I did not pay good money for it, I would exclude it after 10 minutes. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, that honor is truly a pathetic used film (I use the term 'loose') 'GUMMO' (I feel like I sue the so-called 'directors' for the lost hour and a half of my life), but this garbage He's almost down there with him. Definitely one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. These things remind Hollywood that they do not have a monopoly on really horrible movies.
