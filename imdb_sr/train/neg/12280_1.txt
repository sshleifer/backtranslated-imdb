I saw one of the shows in Denver and I was never less impressed. The word "vagina" says it all. Part of the body. There is nothing shocking here. I could tell my doctor: "My left hand is slightly injured after tennis" or "My vagina gets sick after riding a bike" with equal or more social comments. It can be "Tricep Monologues" for all the fun or radical comments I've heard. The monologues were boring, but delivered with drama, the themes were obsolete, and I was bored and annoyed alternately. Once I think I laughed, but obviously it was not when I needed it. This is certainly not a hit. Oh, and spoilers: it was LESBIAN! - Oh, wait, maybe not, think about it. And an inappropriate fund! I Crack Mama! It's covered.
