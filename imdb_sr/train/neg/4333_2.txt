The quotes: theurgist: Anione with I.K. over 50 would watch this film what it is, intelligent and well-run over the modern day, not have a blockbuster actor or a huge budget, but it's still very well made and it made me knit all the time. IK over 50 you say ... what most means you have I.K. less than 50 .. his name is CARLITOS VAI: Rise to pover !!! which means that there should be something to do with the first to do it. All and everything is ok if you ... CHANGE THE ADDRESS AND NO PERSON IS READED CARLITO BRIGANTE !!! Ps is not commenting on a movie if you do not know anything about movies. but I guess it's I.K. below 50, you will not know what the hell I'm yelling ... Mir!
