JMS and guys can give a pass to this because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget, but the movie is still a sub-pair. Do not misunderstand me, the B5 series is by far the best TV series ever, but if I watched this movie, I would not order a series. I do not like O'Hara as an actor, the costumes are stupid, and there are tons of clich√©s. The same can be said for most of the first season (with the exception of Babylon Skuared and Survivors); Bruce instantly lit the series and this was an incredible spectacle. If you are a fan of B5 and have not seen this movie, take a look at it. If you're not a fan of B5, do not ... watch the series.
