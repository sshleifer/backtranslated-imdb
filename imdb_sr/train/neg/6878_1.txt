I'm a Puerto Rican and this is one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen. You see people on it are meaningless. They do not know much about Puerto Rico and his culture. They claim that the Puerto Rican people are from Puerto Rican descendants, but they probably know less than others who are not from there. You can see them while they say that they themselves contradict themselves. If you want to see the real, and I mean, the real documentary from Puerto Rico, then you have to see "Mi Puerto Rico". It's a serious, real documentary. Not like this piece of garbage. Rosie Perez based this documentary on her own. I thought it should be about Puerto Rican people. I kept repeating it, I did not know. Well, that's the only thing they got right to this so-called documentary. I hate to see such a piece of garbage that is used with the name of the island. This reduces standards.
