One of the most prolific directors who worked in the area of ​​low-budget, bloodthirsty criminals. His films are full of clumsy mountains, funny acting, boring sub-plot and sad dialogue. Unfortunately, this film is almost without blood. You do not really see murder, except with shadows and a few shards of blood. The speed is lethargic and the action is rather uninteresting. competent, but the lack of upset and mutilation left me disappointed. Generous 4 out of 10.You're Worrying: Do not Miss Monson's movie with the equally weak Andi Milligan's "Legacy of Blood".
