This barely watching movie was a little temptation to pass. None of the segments are good, but at least the first was slightly fun, and the middle is somewhat imaginative. The final was just brutal, and after he passed through two poor comedies, the third was really sick to watch. Even with the low standards of the national film about the lamp, this looked particularly boring and unhappy.
