Okay, another movie I bought and Joe Svatman. OK, this is not the worst movie I've been reviewing this week, but it's still sucked by roiali. We had a lot of fun watching this shit. Monster Jigsaw is a mish of all these dysfunctional ideas for students, you just know that ur is in trouble when someone is equipped with buzz and shotguns, the movie was not as bloody as we hoped, I mean death is a heart attack. Again I think that acting shit, the suspicion of actors has to be a porn star and one enter into her underwear for any reason. Absolutely the worst part is the end, it leaves it open for a little Jigsaw 2 but it never happens to face it. My ratings: Sneaky 4/100 mocking (how much we had fun) 73/100 acting 8/100 mostly 12/100
