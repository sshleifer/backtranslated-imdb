This film is extremely boring, tells the story of the owner of the gas station and her life. Nothing exciting is ever happening. The director really "kept the reality" and feels like a camera that follows a woman around her while she lives her life. I had to watch other director's films for the class, the others were not boring. This movie is also viewed as a task ... it's better to be bored with a good score !! All in all, if it's not necessary, do not watch the movie. But do not reject the other films of this director, because they are not so bad ... and do not reject other films about Africa, they are usually good, especially when the Western director is doing it.
