This show is just boring! I'm sorry for the actors who tried to be funny (especially Bob Saget), the song of laughter attempts to conceal sad jokes, and the song "Avvv" appears in most unnecessary times. Excessive dramatic children are no exception, especially Olsen's twins. Also, this show is a cliché town. If you were to search for a cliché word, you would read "Full House". Each story has a "life lesson" to be learned at the end. Slow speech makes it all the better, and even has the ability to make the most capable child suddenly realize the goodness of GASP, which is not possible in real life. I do not know how anyone could watch this show without a bad pronunciation of the characters' behavior or a trail of laughter. I find myself shouting on television saying, "THAT IS NOT ENOUGH / ONE / SLAVE" If life is really such, the world would fall apart.
