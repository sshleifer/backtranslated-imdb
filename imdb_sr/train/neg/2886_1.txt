Terrible, terrible, terrible do not spend money to rent this movie. It's like a small budget for a TV Canadian movie. Absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen and there were many others. This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in a DVD plaier or VCR. : ~ (Is it possible to write ten lines? The act was terrible, it did not have absolutely no flow, I saw it made for a TV movie on the BTK killer and was much better (compared to this one), sure what will happen in production of this film, but if we were to educate or tell us the story of the BTK killers who missed the mile, it seemed to be more animal rights ads.
