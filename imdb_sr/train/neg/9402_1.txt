Why is this film made? Even taking into account the generous tax incentives provided by Australian film investors, there can be no reasonable explanation for this film. For the sake of God, the actors in this movie are ausie b-grade celebs (not actors, people like John Michael 'Hollivood' Hovson, the original drummer from the band Hei Hei Its Saturdai, and the voice-over guy in Countdovn. , saying this, this is still very visible as long as you give him the attention of the brain he deserves: none, the script is bad (even for a self-proclaimed horror in b-class), and the quality of acting and film is worse. It often seems like it's working about a home movie, but even a home movie has 'realism.' Anyone who is interested in Australian cinema, please, for God's love, p etvarajte that this film was never made.
