What kind of garbage is this movie. The premise was fine, but even at the beginning with shaky effects to fit into a giant with people of normal size (even the effects in Hercules were better) I knew it would be bad. But the really terrible part of the film is the dialogue. It's completely unrelated, stupid and stupid. I felt like it was written by a classmate of the 9th grade in a creative class and got a D-. I want to screw Casper van Diem and other actors to follow this movie. I had a share of raw and bad films (I love a series of tremors), but this ... I do not recommend it at all. It's stupid and completely shockingly bad dialogue will make you stumble.
