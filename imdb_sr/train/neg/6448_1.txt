Creature It's a real word for this movie. Or maybe it's called an unfamiliar movie. This movie is a shit from the beginning. It has a really stupid "conspiracy", a really pathetic "acting", and so "special effects". Some 30-year-old "post-teenagers" are trapped in a forest with a crazy, rubberized, rubber outfit that is endlessly lurking around. What you get with this movie is a bunch of conversations and a precious little action. You have girls walking through the woods saying, then you have boys (with heavy mascara) who walk through the woods talking. The whole thing is so boring! Only the creature is rarely seen during most of the film. When the displayed image is distorted to conceal the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit, and the movement shows that it is a suit, therefore, it is a reason for blurring and distorting the image. This is not a good movie IN ANYTHING of words and those who have praised here are most likely people who are buried from the street to "starve" in this truly amazing film! Skip this for sure!
