Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. When Hollivood has ever made a successful film that attacked the Republicans? Why they do not learn. Dick chicks are not. These leftists live in their own elite balloon that cooperates with each other; unconscious fact that most of America is much more correct than they are. Best Hollywood productions are not partisan and are rarely political. Cheney was bad. I thought Cussack could have better movies. It was not funny.
