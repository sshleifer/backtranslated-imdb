Nicole Eggert is listed as the star of this, despite the fact that Micheal Dorn & Stacey Keach is a much larger star than her. In essence, this is a little shift to the movie "Alien lands on Earth". Eggert plays a girl who complains about aliens that the army is pursuing and takes to escape in her very sexy mask. A little nudity and partial nudity, a meaningless sexual scene, all by the way. The film goes through several obvious sets and a joke about displaying photos. I pretty much liked the Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn was taken over and he got a really cool scene of death. It was pretty obvious that Stacey Keach would be taken over and that the film had had quite a bad ending, it would be nice to show how talented Alien went to Eggert.
