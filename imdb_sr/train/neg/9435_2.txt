I've never heard of this before the owner of the local local rental DVD mentioned me; Since it was a horrible film from the 1980s, and the notorious difference in being banned in the United Kingdom, I decided to check it out. The film proved to be a boring, amateur and ugly ride; Sound recording is so poor that the dialogue is incomprehensible half the time, while acting gives the new meaning of the word inept! Worse still, the film follows the terribly tired formula of three teenagers involved in an accident and are sheltered by a dysfunctional family living in a remote environment. Soon one of the girls goes to seek help and is never heard anymore; Another, which is still casual, is quickly removed (after most of the time is forgotten). The main heroine is the one who communicates most with the three people of the house: the harp of the biblical mother (the sign of a terrible transformation), her suppressed (and persistent) daughter, and his strange brother who occasionally appears on the scene to be afraid of sleepy female guests. Often, recalling memories of a dinner table from a mother who hates a man (as a means to fill the gloomy, not to talk about an unoriginal, secondary story) and who are always evolving into a sparing mother-daughter, a movie there's one in the sleeve - the curling finish is unexpected because it's genius, but a little helps to remove the bad taste that the film leaves in the mouth through the lumpiness of everything as broken up) or the inevitable feeling that we lost 80 minutes of our time ...
