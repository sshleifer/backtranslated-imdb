The Jewish movie Purple Butterfly casts a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against Japanese forces in the war-torn Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziii) and her former lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) are on the opposite sides of the conflict after a random meeting. I agree with the reviewer from Paris. The film replaces the intricate, semi-historical conflict for the plot, not giving the audience just one reason to worry about the characters or their causes. A sudden change in time does not help things because it looks completely unjustified and meaningless. I usually do not bother dark films, but the absence of light, disturbing bone shooting, and generally poor movie shooting techniques make this movie more difficult to watch and interest. from Georgia that this film "has a chaotic style of editing and claustrophobic cinema", but I do not think it helps the movie. The background of the film is one of the most powerful events of the 20th century, and I do not believe that you can do it with any kind of justice by editing it as if it was a movie from Michael Bai movie. Too many melodramatic moments do not contribute to its visibility. Actors are all conveniently melancholy. Zhang Ziii once again shows that he has a very limited spectrum of acting as long as the entire film is done by doing what makes it best to work in all of her films, thinking and looking generally upset. Nevertheless, at least she adds some sort of diversity to this role by dealing with chains and dealing with the worst love scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. watching him come from the director of Suzhou He. 2/10
