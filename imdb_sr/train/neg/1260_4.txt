Yes, CHUNKI, this is the nickname with which Donna Reeds's romantic performance is played by Tom Drake! So let's make it clear straight away. From her first role in THE GET-AVAI (1941), also her last, DALLAS (1984-1985), Ms. Reed could not be described as CHUNKI. Not this attractive and slim actress. Whose roles in M.G.M. They rarely met their talents. Ms. Reed is supported by actors of competent visual actors, who, unfortunately, have to clutter through this alleged comedy 'screws'. Clearly M.G.M. was beyond their depth of production of this kind of film. The type is better produced in COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even UNIVERSAL. Ernst Lubitsch's "touch" and the humor of Preston Sturges could not save this film. Conventional romantic comedy that had all the signs of effort from the pre-war (World War II). light day. It fits into the "safe zone" of Louis B. Maiera in a fun family. A form that could not be confronted with the post-war challenges of 'DeHavilland Decisions', the loss of their theater chains, television and contributed to the decline of M.G.M. Luckily for Donna Reed, her best days are ahead of her, culminating in FROM HERE TO ETERNITI (1953), and her Oscar Prize for Best Supporting Actress.
