My husband and I discovered that this film is very shocking. It started well, but it quickly became incredible and funny. Most of the acting was poor, with the exception of a little girl, Abbie, which was really great. In addition, the dialogue was predictable and chrome - especially Gideon, Angel. Likewise, without giving anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she almost appears silent. At first we thought it was "shock", but then we realized it was just a horrible scenario. We love almost all Hallmark films and their heart-warming stories, but this film does not rise to the occasion of being one. There are so many big ones - do not waste time with this horrible movie.
