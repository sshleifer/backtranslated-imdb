Steven Seagal's films have never been an Oscar material, but with each issue they worsen and worsen. This starts with Seagal who picked up the FBI because he killed several people in self-defense. the active army was thus saved from prison to save the stolen "Stealth" plane that will use the clich√© "evil English criminal" Hollivood so obsessed with these days. Just enough to say that the movie is a horrible dialogue that is almost always delivered with an abundant addition of cheese and a lack of acting talent. The story is not interesting and there are parts that absolutely do not make sense and do not add anything in the story, the characters of the film as a whole, such as the 'lesbian' interaction between the two main females in the gypsum that is pure for titration to get viewers, neither the subtitle is confusing, because it does not make sense why this happened when it was not necessary. In short, a terrible script with poor dialogue, delivered by actors who are not subordinate, boring and sometimes poorly choreographed action scenes, and irrelevant portions that only serve to achieve almost impossible and even worse film. Save 98 minutes of life and give this flaw, even if you are Seagal's most overwhelming fan.
