This movie was bad. Bad acting, bad directing, bad writing. But it was not bad in a fun way. It was bad in a boring way. I was looking at Surface to Air because I thought it could be a laugh. It was not. Do not make the mistake I made. There are many more pleasant ways to spend an hour and a half, such as looking at dry colors or reading a dictionary. Seriously.
