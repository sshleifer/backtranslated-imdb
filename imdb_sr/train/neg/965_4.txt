I liked this movie first. It seemed to me to be a good comedy with some stupid moments. Costume designer Albert Volsky gave everything he did !!! Same as the beautiful set decorator Robert R. Benton - this man really had a very good taste !!! But script writers were extremely disappointed. The best place would be a scene on the ladder, but instead, they decided that the father and his daughter were together. I do not like the ending. The father becomes the boy of his daughter and his ex-wife knows about it and is in line. It would be fine if, for example, script writers would say that there is now a different soul in the body, but they did not do it, they only lost memories. The actors were good, they were really funny. Cibill Shepherd was charming, Robert Dovnei Jr. he was very fun in the dance scene :))) ... But some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cibill Shepherd after her husband's death, waited for her for 23 years (it's been a long time!), She was true to him, loved no one but him, and when she met him and she was there Following the scene with her friend Philip Traine (Rian O'Neal), she was very easily betrayed by a man she had longed for so many years! It would be a good movie, if not end and some human psychology.
