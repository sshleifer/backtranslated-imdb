This movie is truly incredible. I've seen so many cheap trash films, especially a lot of 'Full Moon' Pictures, but 'Dollman' is really hard. So much is getting closer: a funny story, actors always on the edge of parody and special effects! How long can I talk about them! It's a really bad movie, but one of the funniest. If you are a fan of bad films to laugh, you must see it. And do not miss Dollman vs. Demonic Toys'. It's really fun and worse.
