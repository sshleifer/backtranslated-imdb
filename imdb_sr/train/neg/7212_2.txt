Why every horror director wants to imitate the "Exorcist" is a complete mystery to me because the "classic" of Villiam Friedkin is a highly overrated film and, in my opinion, not so tense or shocking. Nevertheless, here is another clear separation, this time of Spanish, which shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl who is obsessed with pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschi (whom I must admit to be pretty hot) plays the honorable priest approaching John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior has changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. At first, the priest does not believe in it, but when his body is discovered with a distorted neck, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more prominent ... "Exorcism" is not only unoriginal, it is also an unbearably boring film! Here Naschi and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to create a religious themed exploit film full of shocks and up, and yet the result is a dashing and complete bloodless drama that will almost cloud you! The last twenty minutes contains some atmospheric moments, although very stupid, and there are plenty of stylishly recorded female nudes and sleeves. The absolute lack of a budget is not a real excuse because Paul Naschi has already proven that he has enough imagination to make up for the lack of money. This is just a horrible movie, the end of the story. The second European "The Ecorcist" rip-off is "Antihrist" and "Beiond the Door" and they are shit as well!
