*** SPOILER ALERT *** I love Team Roth, indeed, and he does his best with an incredible role. I see this as a movie that might look good as a script, but it's tangled, unlikely, and eventually stupid. I saw a fake death that came a mile away. Rene Z. is working with the signed work, as well as Patricia Arquette. A detective whose name I can not remember (the one who is not Chris Penn) is a great sweat over the actor. You see, if you're not smart enough to distinguish a movie that's so smart you can not track it, and so confusing you can not understand it. You see him if you like the horns on cameras that make you sick of the sea. Look if you like to watch Tim Roth working with an awkward script. Look at him if he comes late at night for free. Otherwise, rent Usual Suspects.
