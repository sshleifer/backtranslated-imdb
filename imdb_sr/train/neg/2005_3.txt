It's not that I'm really surprised ... movies are never as good as the books from which they originate. I was looking forward to watching this movie because this is one of my favorite books, although I knew it would probably be a shit. I was hoping that I would be pleasantly surprised. However, they deviated too much from the book's story, and the film version did not show how much that house was really terrible. And the ending was different. Lara Flinn Boile looked awful because of some bad mischief cosmetic surgery. The act was at best incomparable at best. Perhaps, if the theatrical version were made so that they should not stay so much in Lifetime as "made for a TV movie," it would be a better movie. If you've seen this movie, I recommend you read the book and read it. I doubt that you will be disappointed and hope that you will enjoy as much as I do whenever I read it.
