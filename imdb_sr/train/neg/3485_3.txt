This film was absurd. There were some funny things. It goes straight to bin movies in my memory where I think, "Hmm ..... that movie had a few funny parts, but overall, quite funny complication (or lack)." /> I thought that it looked like Ben tried too hard to be a funny guy. And I did not understand how he was a multimillionaire and still such an idiot. Anyway, I like Ben Affleck. He says some shit, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I loved Jersey Girl, I did not think Gigli was guilty of anything. I guess it's kind of like a kid that's sorry for you just can not fix it. My advice would be to avoid this movie. This did not really develop into a trick, and Catherine O'Hara and Jimmy G. they were not used as well as they could have been. They deserved better. All in all, this film is NOT A Home Alone, it's not a Christmas story, it's not a Christmas holiday or any other classic. Forever Forgettable.
