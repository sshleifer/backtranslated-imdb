It's not just my judgment about this movie, but most of what has been written about it. Do not misunderstand me here, I am not a total philistine, I did not hate the movie because it was not enough as a 'police academy 9' or anything, I enjoy more than my big part of the high head or the art of things, I swear. 'Magnolia' is poor, and I'm sincerely confused why it seems to be so praised. Long winding, self-inflicted, meaningless nonsense from beginning to end, there is so little that it might be what people like in the movie. There are some high caliber actors who are honest enough and no one turns into an average or worse performance. Moreover, my wife (a self-proclaimed Tom Cruise hater) told me that his career was the best performance away. But the plot is so completely inconceivable, bridging between the stories of several loosely connected characters in such a snail's rhythm that even when important life-changing events appear, they seem so senseless and uninteresting that you are asking for someone to blow up or something like that. It does not help that none of the characters can easily identify or sympathize with it (but I did not mean it, but I do not like most people). They all play their fairly unbridled life stories to a great extent, demonstrating their characteristic disadvantages and emotions in ever so intricate details and performing their deep and meaningful connections to the nth degree with many impudent monologues along the way. Iadda iadda iadda. Soundtrack is so awesome, with such an irritating quality that it has so far been thought to be unique to Alanis Morisette's music. All in all, it was so pleasant for three hours that I was forced to watch the 'Friends' episode multiple times while occasionally pushing into the ribs of an unhappy nanny. Few with frogs is good.
