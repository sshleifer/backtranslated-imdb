The charming boy and his mother move to the center of a city, cats and death are soon followed by them. That's about it. I admit I'm a little frightened of the cats after I saw this movie. But seriously, despite the many things that are wrong in this movie, and believe me that there's a lot to get around, it's an overall enjoyable viewing experience. The characters are more like caricature here with only their basic instincts to rely on. It seems that fear, greed, lust or anger of pride is all that motivates these people. Although it can be argued that this seeming failure, in reality, serves to testify the story. The supernational assumption and the fact that it is a script by Stephen King (not that I have anything specific against Mr. King) are pretty well supported by some interesting FX work, make-up and quite suitable music. The absolute gem of this film is no doubt Alice Krige, starring Marie Brady, a mother from another world. much in this case), trying to fit in and camp in the camp above the upper little horor of precious stones that must be in the collection of any horor fans.
