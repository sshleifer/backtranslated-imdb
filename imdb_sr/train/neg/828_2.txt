Let's see. In the "Second Place" final we learned that there is no hospital and that every thing is in the head of an autistic child. "Nevhart" ended by telling us that it was all a dream. And "Roseanne" ended by telling us that it all happened in her mind. Very creative. "It was more embarrassing, yes, it was just a TV show and it was not a reality at all. Only when you get into a big movie or TV show you end up at least wanting to believe that it's all" real. " It's about the reality it shows on the screen.This type of finale of the series has already been made twice and it was an old hat, frustrating and it's just not fun to watch.At now "Nevhart" is a dream?

Roseanne gave me the feeling that I was cheated after being so loyal to the fan.
