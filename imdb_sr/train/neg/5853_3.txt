IMMORTALIZER was, uh, interesting. That certainly did not kill me for an hour and a half, but it did not impress me. A group of children was abducted in the alley with mutant mutants (in a scene with the least convincing head in the head that had broken the sound effect) and taken to a gem in the suburbs. Dr. Divine and his team perform brain transplantation for his rich old patients in order to be able to have young bodies again. Hey, this was quietly redecorated with a big budget a few years later like FREEJACK! Who knew when you transplanted the old man's brain into another body that their new voice would sound like their old voice? With all these stories about the pineal glands and the use of glossy green serum, you can almost see the visions of FROM BEIOND and RE-ANIMATOR dance in the producers' heads. But production literally does not have the courage to do it. I never understood why, when someone makes a movie with a terrible horror, they do not pack it on the edge of the frame. The acting is terribly terrible, and the only good performance comes from Clarke Lindsley as assistant dr. Price. He has a wonderful, wicked laugh. The only other thing to keep in mind in the IMMORTALIZER is that it contains many old people who are doing their own acrobatics. Seriously, most actors take serious problems for the elderly.
