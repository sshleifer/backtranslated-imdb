I read the book for a long time and I do not remember specifically, but I remember that I enjoyed it. Since I was home sick on the couch, it looked like a good idea and Hey !! It's a life movie. The film is filled with actors and actresses of class B. Female actress is precisely from Housewife House. I've never watched the show, but there are many commercials for the show and I get the essence. Is there nothing more original? Of course, but not to life. Males are pretty feminized and acting, but girls have to have husbands, I suppose. with a man, for her life, and what does she do? He hits him in testicles. What else? Women like it, but let me tell you something to the girls ... It's not as easy as it always is. Not everything was bad. I got a fever of a few or two, so I have to count someone into it.
