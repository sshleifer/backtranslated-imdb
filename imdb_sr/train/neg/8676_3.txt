Avoid the version in the US. It's with extra American footage and the worst sync you've ever heard of by New York amateurs. Recording is so bad that it sounds like Misteri Science Theater 3000. I think a black man from Bronck does Chibin's voice. I could not watch the whole movie so badly. Instead of this american version, watch Chibin other giants such as Streetfighter or Karate Varriors.
