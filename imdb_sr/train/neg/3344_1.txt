I should mention this by saying that I am Dolph Lundgren's fan. A man turns out to be some of the funniest clich√©s that can be imagined, and Prison is probably my personal favorite. * Spojler * although there is no such thing as Dolph spoiler because the scripts are so absurd to start: the scene of a run with a handicapped child carrying a pistol opposite the guy on Harley with a gun, through a high machine school hallway and a kid wins? A good game, Oscar goes to Prison. Dolph, if you read this, thank you for laughing, old friend. In Brief: An incredible movie that is a guaranteed laugh. I recommend inviting some friends for this and forcing them to go through it. Hilarious.
