This movie has tried to be too many things at once: the thrill of political satire, the Hollywood blockbuster, the gloomy romantic comedy, the promotion of family values ​​... the list continues and continues. He accidentally fell on all of them, but there was enough interest not to stop him completely. <br /> Although I appreciate the spirit of VAR, INC. clumsy effort, especially when his goals will be reflected that will reflect the lack of serious criticism, and not just the bad writing, direction and production of this particular film. There is a Criticism of War Corporatization. But entertainment in this way diminishes the true crime of what is happening. It reminds me of THREE KINGS, which also trivializes the real reason for concern.
