It really shows that hyper is not everything. It shows that the stupid actor is abhishek and gets only movies about his father and his wife. Amitabh as always is solid. Ajai Devgan as always is shy and useless and the new guy is a joke. The main lady is such a loss of an actor. Such a pathetic film by such a respected director and such a large industry. With movies as such, I reduced the number of Bollywood films I watch. RGV has been making very shy movies for some time already. It's time to get different players. Hrithek anion? Bollivood needs Madhuri and Kajol. Every other leading lady is a half-gentle woman who wants to be. Pffffft.
