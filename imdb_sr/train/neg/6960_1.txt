After watching the first 20m Blanche (I apologize that I could not take it anymore), now I confirmed that it was not. Basically, this "film" is an insult to the real French actors who take part in this fascinating piece of garbage. It starts from a concept that is successfully used in French comedies ("Deuk heures moins le kuart avant Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs" ...): a historical film with anachronistic tone / dialogues. This can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and "fine" direction, avoiding a scary "heavy comedy" stigma. comedy, turns into a horror movie. The horror of the cinemas that want to be confused and shocked by the fine actors such as Decaune, Zem or Rochefort struggling in the midst of this brilliant Burlesque kitschy oath of the farce.
