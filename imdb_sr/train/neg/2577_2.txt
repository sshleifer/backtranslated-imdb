This story had a different angle that intrigued me, enough to buy previously viewed VHS-invisible. It was a mistake. In what could have been a very nice story - about poorly mutilated people in the hospital and their various personalities - they quickly turned into a very profane soap opera with similar characters. /> We have a "Bloss" (Villiam Forsithe) a stereotypical racist white person who says f-word every other sentence and so he despised not to give him a name in the movie. He is very fun for the environment. Then, there is "Raimond Hill" (Veslei Snipes), a woman who speaks fast. Snipes must have liked these quick arrogant roles because he played in several of them, as in the "Wit Men Can't Jump". There is a cute Helen Hunt playing Anne, that wonderful, caring person who has a charismatic affair with the main character in the movie "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). It is heartbreaking, I feel good. Only my heart melts watching these good people. But, if you are one of those who like to lick the characters that are shown in the bad people in this bad movie ..... maybe you really like this! Add a dose of Hollywood political correctness and that! What else could anyone do?
