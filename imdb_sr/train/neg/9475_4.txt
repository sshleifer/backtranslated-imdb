She was beautifully photographed and skillfully behaved, but writing is very untrustworthy. There are scenes of such incredible that there is no joy in watching. The fact that a young lover has a twin brother, for example, is so fictitious that I was loudly groaning. And the "bond of emotion-bulb" looks the same. But I do not know. If you have a few glasses of wine and you feel like relaxing with something nice looking with a few flabby comic scenes, this is a pretty good movie. No more effort is needed by the viewer. But the Italian film, especially the Italian comedy, is usually much, much better than this.
