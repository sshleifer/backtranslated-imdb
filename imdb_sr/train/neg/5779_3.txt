I saw this movie a few days ago ... what was that? I love movies with Brian O'Halloran, they are fun and entertaining. When I saw the name of this title and genre, I thought great, this could be very good ... some parody for slashers or some other movie ... but ... then I read the review and thought it might be good anyway ... but it was not ... My opinion: if similar movies look like a documentary, with a bit of comedy, try with some Moor movies or an alien autopsy, they're really about something. this was empty. And put a comedy to the title ... without comment ... really bad joke
