"Cement" is a bad movie about a bad cow (Penn) with a bad attitude and a bad mood that has a bad guy in a bad way to his cajon in quick drying of concrete. While we wait for the cement to dry, and the film to discover what is happening, we occasionally retreat back without rhyme or reason, so that we can watch events that lead to cement matter. The boring film so far, "Cement", suffers from a lack of story, clumsy execution, and the most common mistakes of a movie film; there is no reason to worry. At best, the killer during the time needed potatoes. (D +)
