I'm only interested in two things: I waited for Owen Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones to die. This was basically one female show. Catherine Zeta Jones was there just to provide sweets. Liam Neeson was completely lost in this film. Like Jones, he did not play any role. The film was Lili Tailor (Ransom, Ready to Vear). She was the only one who had any real role in this shabby scenario of David Self. OK, it was his first one and he got off the Road to Perdition. I do not know what was the problem of the director of Jan de Bont. He did a great job with Speed ​​and Tvister. He really fell to work here. Perhaps he still recovered from the Speed ​​2: Cruise Control disaster. I should thank my lucky stars for Wild West West, otherwise it would be the worst picture of 1999. Avoid at all costs.
