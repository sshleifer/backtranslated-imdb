Budget, decent actors ... who knew these things were important. Do not waste time on this piece of garbage. The effects are bullshit. The act is bullshit. The only thing that could have done this was even a tough little T & A, which was lost in the first 20 minutes. It was as if they only found 7 people on the planet who never cursed before. Hats off! If you want to see a guy in a bad suit, just go back and see the old graduation photos. The only way to make the Bigfoot movie good is to have a big budget and some actors who have not come from the Frogballs Communiti Theater.
