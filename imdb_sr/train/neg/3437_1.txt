Yesterday I saw this movie. I must admit, it was not my cup of tea. Although it should have been a horror movie of this kind. But as I watched this, I was thinking ... "This movie makes no sense at all." Where is this man in the dark coat? Where were the two guys when they left the girls behind? Where did the shark come from? All these elements in this film are somehow not summed up. I felt like these directors spent so much time and money on a movie that was so inevitable. I've seen many good horror movies in my time, but this is one of the worst horror freaks I've ever seen. At the end of the film, I told myself I would not watch it anymore. I am so joking in this movie that I decided to drop it! Count me on this one! 0 of 10!
