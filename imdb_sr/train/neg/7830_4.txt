So far, Nightmares and Dreamscapes have been unusual and disappointing. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, may not have offered much in the way of revolutionary narrative or real fears, but at least he was well-focused, tense, and visually interesting, with solid acting Villiam Hurt and with very impressive special effects of mini-series. However, the other story in the series was terrible, not in a good way. The scenario is bad, requiring the shallow, undesirable protagonists to behave illogically in order to shuffle the plot, and the characters endlessly wander for the purpose of an unnecessary, unnecessary exposition. The acting is overworked and unpredictable, and I felt much more empathy for a cold-blooded killer in the first story than for a bride in the other. The director used a million tricks to try to narrate a silly, but with amateur acting and writing, the end result looks like a project of the first year of a film school, launches with a camera for himself, and a little into conspiracy or tension. If the rest of the series continues like this, I will be very disappointed. I look forward to continuing Villyama H. Mats and I hope to get a decent director and screenwriter for his segment. So far, the quality is too inconsistent to be predicted in both directions.
