I rent this horrible movie. The worst I've ever seen. I believe that the first class could do a better job. The worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen some bad ones. Nothing terrible except I paid 1.50 to rent it, and it was too much for 1.49. The acting is horrible, the characters are burning and the film is just a piece of garbage. Scenes in a hunting lodge are so low a budget to make a captured picture B as an Oscar candidate. All I can say is that if you want to spend a good evening and a bit of money, rent this horrible movie. I'd rather watch the clown's killers out of the universe while sitting in the razor buns, but sitting across this flop again
