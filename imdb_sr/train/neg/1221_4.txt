I remember the days in which Kim Basinger was just a nice face that adorned movies with typical characters of stupid Blondie, a romantic interest or a girl in danger. an excellent LA Confidential film, and I do not think I was the only one who was surprised by her solid performance. However, after that moment, her career did not follow the ideal path. to participate in moderately prestigious films (such as People I Know or Door on the Floor), but we have never seen it on a significant figure. and not only that her character is not too tasty, but that the movie is really disgusting. The script from this movie can not be hollow and basic. This film is full of clich√©s and generic villains. The work of the director Susan Montford is really catastrophic for many reasons, but mostly because the film never gets a good rhythm and tone. I do not recommend it while she was at all. This film makes the main sin boring.
