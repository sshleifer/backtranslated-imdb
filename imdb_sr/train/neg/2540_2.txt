I thought I saw this movie twice. Then I read all the other reviews and they did not fit well. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this city to study the alleged events. I still feel confident that this is the film I saw, despite the differences in the reviews. So I'm going back to my review: If you like the occasional 'B' movie, like me, then the return to Boggi Creek movie is for you! Whether it's setting a sleep timer, and nodding to your favorite movie bomb, or just hanging out with your friends. Boggi Creek, a button to turn off the sound, and you have a fun night improvisation. Watch it! Is the legend true? I think we could find out, along with not so great actors. Will there be a malfunction on the equipment at the key moments of the movie? Does our blond, male, young hero have hair on his chest? Will the extremely high tech Technicolor last a whole movie? You will have to look to find out yourself.
