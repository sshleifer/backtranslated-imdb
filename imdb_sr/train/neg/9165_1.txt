There are no spoilers in this review because everything is already shown in the movie. I'm trying to be balanced in my review because I firmly support local movies, but I can not help but support the reaction against this movie. It's a slow, boring and bordering with meaningless. Even "almost pretty and convincing moments" were immediately undermined by painful clich√©s and bad acting. Vernetta Lopez and Vong Li Lin, which I usually love, were only passable in this film. It seemed as though the director was trying to make melodramatic TV soap opera, and then she took it and decided to put it on the big screen. The breakthrough years should come with the rating of RA (Rated Avful), but this did not change my faith in local movies. There will be more good movies, until more of these films are created.
