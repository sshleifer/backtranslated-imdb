I do not like much to direct Sean Penn, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The film does not have a core, it is colored by some kind of peasant, anti-authoritarian tveeness, which in all honesty tends to most of Pen's work, and his latest work is even more than before. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn seem to produce such a fundamentally banal product, supposedly in some loyalty of honesty, but ultimately, for the most part, celebrated pro wrestling games and moralism, almost if Hallmark's cards developed a series congratulations of Hellfire angels, and made me long for the days of liberation, which is a good movie. The acting Vigga Mortensen is much, much more convincing than that funny Eastern Promise, what he did with Cronenberg, and that's all. The film is dead insignificant, and it seems to be an exercise, a set of techniques, more than a story. Honor for Charles Bronson, however, who proves that he can act. And I wanted more of Sandi Dennis's character. Bad 3 out of 10 for this Indian shit.
