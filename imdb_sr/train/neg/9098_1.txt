There is a reason why certain movies go straight to the video and of course the obvious reason is that if it is too dysfunctional for a theater audience, then it is played on the video. Of course, that would not be fair to movies that are good, yet they are released directly to the video. This is no exception, although the movie has good actors or at least actors with the potential: Amy Adams (nominated for an Oscar and talented actress), Robin Dunne, who deserves a better or at least a better agent, and Sarah Thompson, who deserves the role of leaving teen melodrama. The film is also misdirected: this film takes place before the cruel intentions, and therefore this film is actually bored and quite stupid. This was a loss of his really film that is at the same level as soft pornography and pai-per-masturbation films. Fortunately for the actors, I hope they will be able to erase this from their summary. So if you want to see something wrong, but you do not have the courage to buy pornography, then rent this movie as a starter.
