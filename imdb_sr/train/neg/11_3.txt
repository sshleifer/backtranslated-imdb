If you look at the Corei Large information here on the IMDb, there seems to be a movie called "Reload" in production (since June '08), featuring a character named Sebastian Cole. how such a shitty film ever made a sequel ... and secondly, was not Sebastian killed at the end of "Loaded"? I watched it in the early morning hours when I was fighting against insomnia, and so I went in and out while he was on it. I'm sure I missed some plots, but overall, it seemed really bad. The great performance was (for me) one of the strongest parts of the film. I'm also a little surprised to all the people who comment on the beautiful girls, since I thought that the actress who plays Brooke is beautiful, but not exceptional.
