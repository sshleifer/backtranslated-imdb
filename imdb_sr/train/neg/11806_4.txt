It was hard to watch this movie and be completely fair and objective because I am a great fan of the original 1944 movie. This is for me and many others one of the biggest movie knives ever recorded. Realizing that it was just a shortened movie made for TV and that most people had destroyed it, I did not expect much, but you can not compare this with the movie from '44. The scene after the scene, I found that I was comparing what I was looking at, and remembering how it happened with Fred MacMurrai, Barbara Stanvick, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now I watched those famous actors who played their famous roles replaced by Richard Crane, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. but it does not correspond to the original from 1944. The two main areas in which this TV movie was not so good (1) lacked electricity between the two waters; and (2) it was only 90 minutes, rushed to the story with little time to develop plot, characters and chemistry between these tracks. Crenna and Eggar were straight, and they simply could not get along with MacMurrai and Stanvick as "Valter Neff" and "Phillis Dietrichson", respectively. like "Barton Keies" and "Edward Norton." Cob was great as Kays and Robert Weber as Norton, the head of the insurance company. It was also a bit interesting to change the time frame, so that houses, cars, telephones, dictation machines, etc. It was in the early 1970s instead of the mid-40s. Otherwise, the story was very similar, it just rushed. However, one view was enough and I will happily return to the original version for the rest of my views on this classic story and film.
