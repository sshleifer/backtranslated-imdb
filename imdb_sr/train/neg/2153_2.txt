3-D in "The Man Who Was not" means DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This incompetent comedy contains poor 3-D effects that make 3-D effects in "Javs 3", "Amitiville 3" and "Fridai the 13th Part 3". Not to mention the film is dark to the extreme. This was one of the many 1983 films that had pop-off-screen effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambour were captured in this mess, but at least they did not kill their careers. Tambour continued to star in HBO's "The Larri Sanders Shov" and Ron Hovard's "Hov the Grinch Stole Christmas" office, while Guttenberg followed this flop with "Police Academy" and "Cocoon". What are they in those projects instead of them here in "The Man Who Was not." If you do, you will regret it. 1/2 * (out of four)
