Over the years, I've seen a bunch of these films on Segal, and each has the same amount of fun; unfortanetlei, the level of entertainment is low. Of course, the action sequences were fun, but that was quite a lot. Seagal really was at its peak when it worked on films; Under siege, under siege 2 and executive decision (at least in terms of the view of the action), but over the past ten years, these types of films star Segal really do not meet his past qualifications. Being a more positive side, the film has made good use of time, such as some action sequences and the use of wit. Just as the movie looked like it just retreated, a pretty cool action scene pulled it out of the gutter. I sincerely believe that more Segal films would be better not only the fans recognize in the film. Supporting actors and actors are a very important thing, and if his current films had these famous actors and actresses, the film might get more popular results.
