The cutting cut, which I saw, was very long for this kind of film. Almost two hours is too long. If you have a choice, definitely go for a non-directing cut. The main film is almost not concerned at all, the film consists of the main part of several scenes of murder, which are related, but the feeling is that they are shown only to make the film full of violence. The connection was not discovered until the other part and the lack of context did not bother much before I was there. As a horror movie does not work. You will never get the necessary feeling for the characters because of the central acting and general mood (the character is presented, 15 minutes later the character is dead). This picture of a strong side lies in the sprinkling part.
