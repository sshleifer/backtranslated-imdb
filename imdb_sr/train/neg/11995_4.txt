I was so excited and excited about watching this movie when the promotions first came out in November! It looked great and songs! I was pretty disappointed when I went to watch it! This is a movie that connects 6 couples. There are more than 12 people! A huge amount of stars worked on this movie. I think the director, Nikhil Advani, did not manage the situation well and did not have to have many people in this film because it would make it easier for him. Compared to Nikhil's directorial debut 'Kal Ho Naa Ho', 'Salaam-e-Ishk' is far behind. I think Nikhil should have a smaller star. I think the best factors for this movie are the song! The songs are excellent and I think that all the songs are great, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loi has done a great job and did excellent jobs over the years. I think the rating of this movie can be increased due to great songs! One thing I disappointed was that the director was not supposed to include nudity in this film that is being done by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. I found this extremely rude by looking at this with my family! Although, some might consider it a comedy, it's not something you would like to see with your parents! I think that they were the best actors in Salman and Priyank All in all, I think that's a fine movie!
