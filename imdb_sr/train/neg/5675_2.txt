He is sentenced to death, but he does not die on the electric chair, even after being shocked three times. . Seed goes out and goes to people who put him in his living suitcase. He recorded the worst director in the world (Uwe Boll), "Seed" is nothing but a snuff film about trying to stretch the envelope of a decent society and fails in any aspect of the story. And he said this was based on true events, because if a person survives an electric chair after being shocked three times, it will be released. This is an urban legend and it would never have happened. Similar to Bol's other abominations ("Alone in the Dark" for one), "Seed" is extremely terrible.
