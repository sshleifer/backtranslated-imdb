The film was based on the original novel of the 1950s. Journalist Colin McInnes wrote a set of three "London novels": "Absolute Beginners", "Peaks Cities" and "Lord of Love and Justice". I read all three. The first two are great. Last, perhaps an experiment that did not turn out. But McInnes's work is highly valued; and with the right. This musical is the ultimate nightmare of the novelist - to see the fruits of one's mind turned into a brilliant, bad acting, sleepy, one-dimensional apology of a movie that says it deals with the spirit of London from the 1950s and does nothing like it. Thank God that Colin McInnes was not alive to see it.
