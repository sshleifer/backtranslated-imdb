Given the boundaries of this film (Full Movie in One Environment - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 actors) should have been much better made. If you have restrictions on making a movie, how is the lighting so bad? And the actors were terrible, they talked their hair under the act in the clerks, except that it was a pleasant movie, this did not have any content. Well, he tried, but really does not work. Try to make self-referencing in a few pieces, but the lines were so poorly delivered by the actors that it was just bad. And the main character is Neal, what a pathetic loser. It's clear that a total of 10 people made this film and everyone knew each other, and that was probably the real rock band they had, but unfortunately these people really have no idea how horrible they are. This was done in 2005, but everyone looks so naive that he only likes the pre-grunge era. Fortunately, I did not pay to see this (Starz on Demand delivers it again!) The title "The Possessed" is not Studio 666, it does not matter what you do with the title, it can not help. This could be a much better made movie - there is no excuse for this bad movie recording when you have the obvious limited parameters that filmmakers had when they did it, working within those boundaries you should do things you can control and things can do the best you can . Instead, they realized that the center would be good enough. And that music video, which was bad, I quickly crossed it. So, 2/10 is fair, if you're in the whole b-movie shit, I guess you'll go and see this.
