When I saw this film, I could not believe it with my own eyes. Where are these hilarious creatures, garbage bags with large teeth, should really be daunting? Or where they thought they had a good laugh (I sincerely hope). If you watch carefully, you can even see the strings that operate them (you better drag them over the screen). The whole thing was rather funny than scary, and I was having a good time watching the movie because I was stunned by his total inability to have only one good part. It's a great joke from the beginning to the end and I believe that this movie belongs to a new category: such an incredible smile will laugh from start to finish. (I will not even try to comment on the acting or any other thing)
