I bought this movie for 1 euro, not knowing what it is about. I thought, "hmmm, a movie called mutilation must be, if not very funny, at least filled up". It was not funny. It was disturbing. Very disturbing. And I do not mind disturbing the movies, but this simply did not mean anything, except that child abuse is not a good thing. hmmm ... The quality of the pictures was terrible. The acting ... there was no acting. Only a fcker-fcker that has broken for more than 90 minutes. This is probably the material for the Sikkon instinct. Do not look at this. It's not worth your time. It's scary. I wish I never bought this. They should discredit the type that made this
