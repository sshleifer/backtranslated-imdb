My original preview of this movie was simply the word sh * t written 2000 times. Although this was a very accurate critique, I thought that my review should be a bit more descriptive. Starting with the main actress; her expression does not change once in this movie; she does not show fear, happiness or depression. Her body language skills mainly focused on turning her eyes left and right and it seemed as if Jack did not know. She's an insensitive shell that I suppose she had too much botox. Her lack of face expression through the film outperforms, however, the sad affair with the main actor who seems to be nothing and takes them to the beach and fall in love with a couple of hours of encounter. The main actor, whose hair needs more attention than he was, was at best central and did not make me feel like he was really in danger. , story and inaccuracy in the shop. I've seen buffer ads with more structure than this movie. There are no characters in development, they seem to say and do things that I would never believe a real person would be. This film would not be bad if I tried to be deliberately bullshit, snakes on the plane, but it worked so hard to be a serious action blow that I could not even laugh. I believe that now I have a brain tumor from watching this film and thinking about all the different ways in which I could use that budget and cG to create something far superior. If I bought this on a DVD, I would smash the DVD to pieces, burn it and dissolve it in hydrochloric acid. Do not watch this movie!
