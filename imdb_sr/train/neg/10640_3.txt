From an insatiable title to straight-acting acting, Curdled is a very inimitable movie. The film got some fans thanks to the fact that Quentin Tarantino's name was attached to him, and stupid and unkempt nodding Rodriguez / Tarantino "From dawn to dawn". These things, however, do not make a great movie, and this is more than obvious through 'Curdled'. The film suffers from an obvious lack of ideas and is trying to conceal it from murders that need to be modern and events that should be disturbing. Mexican music that follows many of the sequences in the movie was obviously supposed to be cool, but very quickly became bored; especially in addition to being the main character Mexican, does not fit into the tone of the film. The action of the movie is typically unusual and follows a gorehound which, due to its obsession with terrible murders, takes up a job in a company that cleans the scene of the murders. Sounds boring and it is. Villiam Baldwin is the only 'name' on the list of actors, and even he does not leave the impression. He was not given anything to do in the film, despite talking to his victims and standing around trying to look threatening, it's pretty in vain. Angela Jones, or rather; a Pulp Fiction taxi driver, takes on the leading role as a young woman obsessed with murder, and it's always clear that her role with Pulp Fiction won her this role, not her acting ability. Maybe she was good enough in her small role in Tarantino's masterpiece, but she has no talent to lead the film itself. It seems lost and insane for most of the film, and if there was no Latin accent; you would not convince the audience that the freak is on any level. A piece of care has been crushed, which can not be forgotten a hundred percent. Such films often receive praise for invention or black comedic antiquity; but this does not work at all levels. Whether you are a Tarantino fan, a fan of Villy Baldwin, a horror fan or a movie admirer; This is one that needs to be missed.
