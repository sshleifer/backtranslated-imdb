This film essentially deals with inspector Gadget, Dr. Clav, who, after many years, returned to the now quiet city of Metropolis. Clav's plan is to envelop Gadget forever using a newer "cooler" criminal who will help destroy Gadget's popularity. Unfortunately, the film failed, the series was great, but it was revived nearly 20 years later with tragic results. Without the voice of Don Adams as Inspector Gadget, he simply does not interrupt; Dr. Clav is not only visually less scary, but sounds more like a wrestler with a cold than his original frightening self. It is permitted to be a children's movie, but the plot is so painfully weak (disregard the sky by mentioning the animation) that fades in relation to the original series. Someone decided to keep Penny updated to accelerate for two decades, now she has some quasi-punk rebellious style of clothing and does not play half the role she had in the TV series. Gadgetmobile talks, as well as the angle of the corner that focuses on the entire car. Maybe I'm just a kid who liked the play that grew up, but I thought that the live version was better than I can stand, but now they leave and spring this full watering of a quality TV series on us. That's more than I can.
