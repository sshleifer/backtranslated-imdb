An interesting movie about the current event that took place during the Civil War in Vermont. It kept my attention to the end and I do not regret that I looked at it. I never read any incident about these attacks, so I was curious to see if the rebels withdrew. I enjoy historical films from that period. My main appeal is in Confederate uniforms. They look too good !!! The act was sometimes stiff. I love an old man who eats mashed potatoes because he did not have teeth. The wounded soldier who was playing with the dog was a bit strange. All in all, it was a film of descent.
