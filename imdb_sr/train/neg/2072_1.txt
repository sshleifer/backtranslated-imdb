I rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie. I realized that you can not really make a mistake with the Ek Girlfriend concept of super power. ... but the film was confused and meaningless ... The writer seemed to persistently throw the trash at every step. a lot of toiletry humor and sexual situations that only a teenager can love. This is not a fun romantic comedy they advertised. You could not take a child to see him, and it would be unpleasant for you to see the date. If the writer could make a basic story about a high concept and clean it - the movie could have a chance to fight. Serious time loss. B
