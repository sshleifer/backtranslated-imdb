Given his popularity, I found this film a great disappointment. Maybe I've been expecting too much from this movie. After all, it's one of the most famous films of martial arts from the 1970s, but I could never understand why. The story is uninteresting. It is also a very spoken movie with sporadic action sequences. My biggest problem in the movie was that the story does not offer a character that could serve me because the target hero is an idiot. Chang has no sense in style and is unable to hide the vast imperfections that are in the narrative. I know this should not be high art, but I found the film boring. It's definitely not the best example of this very beloved genre. My status is gone. I recommend you skip it.
