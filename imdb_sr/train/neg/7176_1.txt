I have nothing more to say, but it was terrible. I can not imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this humiliating mess. And if some actors do not want people to question their sexuality, then they might have to refrain from making more of these movies. At least one was seen and left me curious. Just my opinion. SHUDDER to think what's going on and get cut out of the movie. SHUDDER wondered what went through the minds of actors who made this film. Tremble to think about the process of thinking and voyeurism that took place in the head of the director. As I said before his humiliating disorder. It's not even funny. As Ebert said for the Caligula movie with Malcolm McDowell, it's not a good movie, it's not a good story and it's not even good pornography. IEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
