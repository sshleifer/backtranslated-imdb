Bill (Buddi Rogers) sent his uncle (Richard Tucker) to New York City to experience life before he inherits $ 25 million. His uncle paid three women Jackui (Kathrin Cravford), Makine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard) to follow him and ensure that he does not fall into the gold diggers. One such Lady Cleo (Geneva Mitchell) appears on the scene to disapprove of women. We follow the story as the girls are offered more money to appear on the show instead of their next role they have agreed to spend three months for Bill at New York, while Bill meets Cleo and another woman. In the end, love is in the air for Bill and one more ............. Quality picture and sound quality are bad in this movie. The story is interwoven with music numbers, but the songs are bad and Kathryn Cravford has a terrible voice. Rogers is not that good. It's nice enough, but it really comes alive when playing drums or trombones. There is a very irritating figure playing taxi drivers (Roscoe Karns) and the film is just boring.
