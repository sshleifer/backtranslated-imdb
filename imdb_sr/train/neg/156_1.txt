Zu Varriors was definitely supposed to be an animated series, because as a movie he looks at an old anime on the acid. The film is just starting out, and people just fly around fighting metal wings and other stupid weapons while this princess is not sacrificing for this princess god or an angel outside of me, but soon this flying bad guy will come and kill a duck a guy with broken wings fights with some other mystical God / demon / wizard. The plot line is either missing or difficult to follow, you must be crazy intelligent to get this movie. we have a very bad choreographer Uve Boll as a combat scene complete with terrible martial arts on the mountain or the like. Even the images are weird, some might say they are stunning and colorful, but I will say that the blurred and sour journey is like (yes, that's the word!). I watched him synchronize with subtitles, and they were both equally bad and hard to understand ... who I did not understand kidding at all. watched an episode of 30 anime from the 1980s and completely missed the story as it started or as I began to read the series 5 series on number 4 because I had no idea how this thing started where it went or in order to end up lost I can honestly say that this was one of the worst film experiences ever since I watched Inu-Iash in Episode 134 drunk ... yes, it's so you do not know what the hell is going on. The brain is trying to understand this.
