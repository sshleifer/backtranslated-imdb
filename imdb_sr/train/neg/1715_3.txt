Although it contains facts that are not widely reported, this is not very true. They took a lot of freedom in rearranging events, excluding people, and using sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the 1930s. It was more than just Bonnie, Clide, and V.D. in the gang at different times, and these people had as much to do with the facts as those involved. Buck and Blanche went to convince Clide to go much earlier than a shootout, and in fact she was re-entered into crime. Some of the events that were shown during daylight were in fact going on at night. Bonnie's wound was much more serious and never frozen. It was so bad that someone had to wear it until he had healed it, and even then it was stiff and stiff. Clyde was also hacked because he severed his thumb in jail. I know, be picky, and that was a TV movie, but even without these factual mistakes in this "true story", the movie moves too fast from event to event and encounters more like a few separate recordings of their lives. I would recommend that you read the book or look at the documentary if you want to come closer to the truth.
