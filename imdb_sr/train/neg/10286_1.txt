Sugar Sugar and Bobbi Lee kidnapped the men once when they were buying out and returning to a lonely island that girls reluctantly tell robbers that they were the last to visit when they were ten and have wealth. All this just makes a movie that is largely a long movie about girls who first visited the island and later fight with a cannibalistic family. I claim that I started to feel bad about the poor Hank Vorden who really earned much much better. As far as I do not like "Barracuda" (it's on the same DVD), I must admit that this movie makes one look like Citizen Kane. Eie Candi: one pair of suckers (they may belong to Kirsten Baker) My Rating: F Dark Ski DVD Ektras: Vintage Classifieds for Various drive-in food; and trailers for "Bonnie's Kids" (characteristic nudity), "The Centerfold Girls", "Part-time Vife" (characteristic of nudity), "Psichic Killer", "Eaten Alive". DVD also comes with "Barracuda" from 1978.
