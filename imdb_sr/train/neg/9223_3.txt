From the capital of the world of nepotism comes another rubbish in a noble wrap. "CK" talks about the poor, unrelated story of a story that is little more than a bunch of stupid caricatures, a baby and real Davis running around trying to make a stupid sci-fi movie. I can not imagine the reason someone would want to spend time with this ridiculous attempt to shoot a movie. (D)
