Kevin Klein and Meg Ryan are in the class of actors I am always interested in seeing, despite comments. I always thought that Ms. Ryan was a charming and successful actress in almost all roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth watching. I say "almost" and "almost" to a large extent because of First, Meg Rian does not play a sympathetic character, she plays a bad will that starts running on the nerves shortly after the opening of the loan and does not give up as long as a few days later. However, Kevin Kline's character is even more boring and less sympathetic. So, even if you normally like these two actors, I recommend that you give this movie a pass.
