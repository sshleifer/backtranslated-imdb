Pretty average scifi movie. The action was more or less obvious from the very beginning. Although the acting was pretty good, writing was very clich√©, using ideas taken from many films. they circled. They find a capsule on the boat, which was accidentally broken at that moment. After 2 or 3 minutes when a man in the floor wakes up, you realize that he is a complete madman. Something that totally avoids the 3-in-1 exploration ship crew ... After that, any other movie that involves a psychotic lunatic who terrorizes innocent victims gets torn off, I generally think that speed 2 was a better research I do not consider good film. It's not a good movie, pull out aliens and watch it again. <br /> <br />
