It seems that the standard procedure for Swedish films is to start by drawing credibility out of the window and continuing to the end of the process. Ranarna is another great example of a movie that makes little sense. Banks in Stockholm are robbing highly efficient military-style bandits. Two policemen are beginning to investigate a case that soon becomes more complicated than at first glance. As usual in the Swedish movie, the actors consist mainly of the same people that you have seen over and over again. Mikael Persbrandt must be in every Swedish film for the last few years! But that's fine, I guess, because Persbrandt is one of the few who has solid results (as it usually does). Problems with this film are mostly about the story itself. First of all, robberies are mostly felt as a background. This is more about a young policeman struggling to prove himself in the male world (as though it had not been done a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of Sophia Helin). Also, there is an extremely incredible plot around the end, which seems just as probable as the landing of aliens. But still, I think it was a very nice touch, since I was halfway at that time. It spiced up a little bit of stuff (and actually saved the rating from the fall). In the end, the main problem is the same thing as most other Swedish films of this kind. Simply, action and uncertainty do not meet the standards that we are accustomed to using from other films of this type (mainly Hollivood). It looks cheap and pretty bad in comparison. In my opinion, Swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on plot and acting, and forget to try to make "Hollywood Hollywood action" as they do now. Because this becomes another effort of the Swedish film industry. I estimate it 3/10.
