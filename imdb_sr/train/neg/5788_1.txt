OK, the company of Agrama (dealing with some dubious deal with former Italian Prime Minister Silvi Berlusconi) produced a horrible mish-mash of g. Carla Maceka. What is that terrible mish-mash I'm talking about? Well, Macek took three totally unrelated Japanese science fiction animated series (namely, Macross, Southern Cross and Mosquito), added the TON dialogue - firmly believing that the American audience was too stupid to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence, much for violent content, he added a metaphysical mumbo jumbo, calling him using some of the worst loud actors on this side of acting hell (Singing Rebecca was - and still is - unbearable and total outrage, especially compared to Ms. Marie Iijim) ... A results It's a series of 85 episodes with hundreds of continuity problems and planning holes. Of course, the bell was cool to look at (especially those in the "Macross Saga"). ) and parts of the plot that remained undamaged were good. But what was good in Robotech was not the result of Macek's work or "voice talents" he recruited. It was because of effort and effort (dishonest - why? Would I be too brave to accuse HG of plagiarism here?) Japanese creators. Those of us who finally got the right thing and compared the originals with Robotech now want us to never be exposed to Robotech. The naturals are, of course, much better, of course, and make them more rational. Robotech, however, was something worthwhile: it inspired the legendary creator of the anime Leija Matsumoto to launch a campaign to protect Japanese anime creators. intellectual property of such unauthorized and unallocated processing produced by talented people such as Carl Macek.
