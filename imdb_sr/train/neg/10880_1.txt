This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, and I have an appetite for horrible (and good) movies. She could (only) succeed in some kind of adolescent humor, if she spoke consistently in the languages ​​- ROCKI HORROR PICTURE SHOV, which was really very funny. Other films, such as PLAN DEVET FROM OUTER SPACE, manage to be funny until (obviously) trying to be serious. As for acting, it seems that the teenagers who died from the brain seemed to occupy themselves and asked them to recognize the entire production. Compared to them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was one decent interpretation - it was about older ghoul-busting wide on a motorcycle.
