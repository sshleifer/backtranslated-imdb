I'm a great fan of Arnold Vosloo. In the end, I saw him as a star of a recent film, and not just a little, which made me happy. Unfortunately, I entered the film at college and the only thing I can say is that I did not like the film being filmed in an abandoned part of the city and that there is no back-up traffic or sightseeing. I have to say that the actor leaves something that he wants to want, but Arnold is an excellent actor, he has to loan him to a bad direction, and the accompanying leaflet leaves something that you would like. I love Arnold Vosloo, and he made the movie visible. Otherwise, I'd write it like another bad movie. The rape scene was considered brutal and unnecessary, but the actors who fled in the end were pretty good. But the sound effects were pretty bad. The film has some errors (continuity), but they are cautious considering the low-calorie film. All in all, I enjoyed the film because Arnold Vosloo was in it. Jackie
