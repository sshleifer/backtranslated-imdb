If I only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor, enough film for just one shot of each shot, and then I lost all that movie and I had to pick up some money to buy several digital video cassettes and was forced to make a movie that lasted longer from two hours on the French Revolution, and he also did not have sets and my four-year-old autistic son had both the background, and the only actors I could find were people who were not real auditions of that soap opera, and I was forced to not use any music in general fi lmu, and also the zoom function on the camera did not function only once when it accidentally began to zoom in and could not. Stop it, oh, and if I hate my audience, then I can do something like this horrible, yet wrongly hilarious, hell-wasting time. Almost grandiose but totally false backgrounds remind me of some of George Lucas's latest creations, which made him so disappointing, because through the whole movie came the little gleam of hope in the background of my mind that the film would be the highlight of the duel / space laser fight . I do not want to spoil the movie for those who did not see it, but that's not the case. The only thing I can think of is that it has lost more time than watching this movie has written this review. Peace.
