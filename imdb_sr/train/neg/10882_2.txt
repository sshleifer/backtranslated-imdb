This movie is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. From the first scene, I knew it would be an accident. It starts when a seemingly bad girl kills a bunch of nuns in a mission. As it turned out, people in it were obsessed with some random zombie. Well, a few years later, some college students are pulling a joke. The terrible acting goes from stock to head. Things like athletes who shout at him to do things in fairly non-Shalon manner, with the promise of reacting and exaggerating the whole "eager to be a popular role". What really took a cake with this is the ultimate battle. Absolutely terrible special effects with guns. For example, pistols make noise without a flash on the muzzle and vice versa. This is followed by zombies of stop-animation (why move in stop motion is a mystery), music that is poor and about 40 guns coming from nowhere. All in all, this movie is bullshit. Just like many others, you can rent up to 50 cents at the nearest rental site for low-rims films.
