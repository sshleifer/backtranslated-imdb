I think if I went to the first school somewhere deep into the village and asked the English to bring the script, it would make more sense than this. Then I could go to the first year of the drama group and they would rather beat it out of the joker in this movie. This sounds real, but I'm sure they did it like a joke and are completely aware of it (see what I was doing there?) No skills to act or write anything, ever. See this only if you are incredibly drunk, tall or you need a good excuse about why your corrupted body is found with slit joints. Now I will go to my fish bowl and pick up all the cow at the bottom. After that, I will form it in the form of a disc and put it in a DVD plaier, expecting it to produce something better than this trumpet. Actuality - 0/10 plot - LOL / 10 Chest - 9/10
