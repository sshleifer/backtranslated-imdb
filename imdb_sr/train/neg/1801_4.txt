Istanbul is another of those foreign films that Errol Flinn recorded in the last decade of his life, trying to support his family and staying out of trouble with the tax administration. It's a remake of Fred MacMurrai-Ava Gardner from Singapore from ten years ago. Unlike this studio product, Istanbul has the advantage of this excellent location for shooting at the very top of the Golden Horn. But, Errol Flinn, who has grown exponentially in front of the camera in every movie, was too old to no longer play these actions / adventures. His scenes with Cornell Borchers really lack credentials. As for Cornell, she plays Errol's ex-mistress, who through the trauma of rescue from fire now has amnesia. Both do not remember Errol and are now married to Turin Thatcher. But Errol has some disadvantaged people led by Martin Benson and Verner Klemperer who are looking for some diamonds that came to his possession. I have to deal with them too. The best reason to look at Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole singing and playing piano. Most people today do not realize that Kol was a successful jazz pianist, they only regard him as a singer. In fact, he was first pianist, singing was later. Istanbul is a routine action / adventure movie for those who are fans of this type of film.
