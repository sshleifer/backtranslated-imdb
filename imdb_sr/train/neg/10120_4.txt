This film Hitchcock has little similarity with his later films of uncertainty and seems much more like a very old-fashioned story of morality. The young couple receive the inheritance they believe will make them happy. They spend money traveling around the world and living very hedonistic. However, after some time the excitement begins to decline and the couple becomes scattered and meaningless in their existence. However, out of nothing, when they are on a luxury cruise, the boat sinks and they lose everything - and in the end they become much happier at the end because they now value life! What a weird, funny and inappropriate movie! Personally I would like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me poor! The production values ​​are relatively poor compared to later productions - rough film with poor sound quality and pretty amateur acting.
