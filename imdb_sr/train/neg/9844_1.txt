This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm still not sure if it was serious, or just satire. One of those movies used by every stupid who knows how to clit. Arrrrgh. Don Johnson was pretty good at it. But it's usually sucked. More than 10 years ago, I saw him, but he still hurts and will not stop staying in my brain. The last line in the movie really adds up to how stupid it is. I will not destroy it if you want to try fate watching this movie. But I guarantee you a * nghia * moment at the end, with a few in between. If you have nothing better to do, and you like to point out and laugh, then maybe your time is worth it. In addition, if you are forced to go to a meeting with someone you do not really like, suggest that you watch this movie together, and they will probably leave you alone after they see it. I guess that's a fair price.
