One would think that a film about the reconciliation of a young person with his growing homosexuality would be just not boring. Think again. This production should be bottled and sold as a medicine for insomnia, as this is ten times stronger than any sleep aid on the market. Almost as if the film producer * thought about making the film, but he became lazy and decided to launch a series of random (and random) boring images and not return to the scene, insert several real scenes with real acting, pretending to be good lighting it does not matter in the process of creating a film, and it is wrapped under the auspices of the "arthouse" film. It's a kind of shitty product that makes it easier for many traditional creators to launch an indie movie, making the public easier to accept indie movies. You are interested in movies that cover this topic, you would better get involved in some of the great short films that are available on the Logo site or if you rent Get Real. Better yet, read the Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip this long piece of shit.
