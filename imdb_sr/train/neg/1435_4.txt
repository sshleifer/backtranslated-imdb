This film was filmed in the Saskatchewan and Manitoba parks and returned the world's eye to what is left of the "wild west Canada". When Archie began to write his newspaper stories; The thought of the day was to tame the wilderness and convert / absorb the First Nations. Film poses the question and raises the question; why a well-educated, obviously talented Englishman would become an Indian? . It sounds like a famous puppet story. In my opinion, I saw that Archie became my lifestyle "Cigare Store Indian" of very wooden character and was not at all real - very well made Brosnan. He also portrayed a wild Indian on a dance scene for tourists. The punctuality or reality did not come true until he met and married his wife, Annie. Annie pushed Archy in the direction that would bring him to the front row of the English stage, not just like him, but Grey Ovl - the Canadian native of the border of the wild. This is the closest Archi that has become a noble giant prototype. Interpretation of Mr. Directors are well done. I watched documentary films about Graa Ovl and I think this is a good movie on the big screen that is added to my collection. a great moment in the movie. Very beautiful landscape of Canadian lakes and real "gray owl" location. <br /> <br />
