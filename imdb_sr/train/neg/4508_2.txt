Andrew, I could not agree more. My girlfriend is watching this at this moment, and I think this movie is horrible. I quote from my Chinese girl, laughing: "They all do it for a man !?" I feel that these women do not have intensity, they do not make sense to fight between tragedy and identity, and that these people can hardly fight for them. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Ii conquers them, men look duller than admire. I'm sure the Chinese had something similar, but the faces do not match the main one. In any case, the dialogue is so insensitive, so American. If Europeans did this with European Orientalists, they would do a much better job. I must add: it seems that most people who liked the film are American. I'm sorry to say, but no wonder. Everything is written for you, not instinctively, not passionate. I think Chinese actresses are wonderful, but I could not say they were good actors in this movie. Yes, the cinema is great, but really, I do not see how these characters are complex, deep individuals. I'm going to Japan to see the real thing. I'm sure it would be incredible to see.
