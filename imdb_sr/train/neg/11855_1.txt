This is one of those movies that appear on the cable in two afternoons to entertain the boring housewives while baking. The acting is the second rate. Poor Mathev Modine seems to be sleeping throughout the film. And God help Gina Gershon. Her emphasis is too high above the top. It does not sound like a real Englishman. It sounds like a forced and fake, similar to its acting. She should stick to what works best, the lesbian-concert artist who plays in the rock & roll band and has a drug problem. The other characters are no better. They are two-dimensional. empty, silly and silly. How to take care of these people. At one point, Christy Scott Cashman lost to Central Park. Really? Not so difficult to manage Central Park. Just follow any route. Not only did I care about any of the characters, but I hated them too. The only reason I stayed with this movie wreck was Fisher Stevens. Even his brilliant humor could not save this dying fish. Each scene is a typical romantic comedy and nothing can surprise us. The scenario was as horrible as the acting. If you catch this fish, throw it back!
