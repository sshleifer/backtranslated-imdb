This is a dry and sterile feature film at one of the most interesting events in World War II and the history of warfare behind the front line. A bad drama composition is worst when it comes to the film about the plot to kill Hitler. There is no development of character, and the idea that Tom Cruise assumes that playing a high commander who calls into question his deepest thoughts about patriotism and betrayal is completely crazy. I believe Mr. Bin will play better. Generally speaking, the film looks like a clean copy of a good German TV movie "Stauffenberg" from 2004, but it can not come closer to that movie in any aspect of the film. However, the film obviously gets its financial goal with a pub-corn audience that fosters Hollywood fast-blooded and shallow artistic values.
