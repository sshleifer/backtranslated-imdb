The young man comes in a lot of money and immediately begins to live. Unfortunately, a man whose money is really very bad. He wants to get his booty back. When he finds out who has money, he tries to return it. He is constantly hindered by this child who is happy enough not to fall into the hands of the evil man. Sounds familiar, I bet. Very predictable, it's not interesting at all. Do something different, ok guys?
