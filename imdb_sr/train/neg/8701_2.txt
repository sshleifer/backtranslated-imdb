This is probably one of the worst "we want to be low-budget films" in order to earn recognition for the dinosaur genre. The movie is so predictable that you can go, cook dinner, answer the phone or anything, and when you return, you will know exactly what happened. Special effects are so poor to think that Lego bricks were used and that "super fast" dinosaurs were so dumb to make the dog a super viper. The act is over. They work so hard, but behind them there are not enough characters to get into characters and scientists ... Yes, we know exactly what will happen to blondes in glasses. A stereotype has been created for such films. If you want to watch this movie, I suggest you are not in such a serious mood as the actors and the team were obviously. And if you are really real at dinosaurs and you know everything in the world about them, do not look at it, you may break the screen - the facts are so far away.
