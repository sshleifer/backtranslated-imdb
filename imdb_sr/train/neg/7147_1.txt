My favorite part was when the credits started rolling. I wish I could get .0000000000001 out of 10. I really would like to have an hour and thirty minutes back. Do not spend money or time on it. I really could watch the grass grow and feel better after the department. Nadia was really nice and I hope her film did not ruin her career. But she chose to be in it. All in all, she sucked out more than any other film sucked. More than the combination of Kazaam and Glitter. It says something. Do not Do It To Do !!
