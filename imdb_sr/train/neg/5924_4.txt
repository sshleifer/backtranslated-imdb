Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. No one on the boat seemed to notice - maybe it was hair. Regardless, this time she is not a god's container (see the previous episode), but she is a well-known lady with magical powers that allows her to communicate and see Meduzan without madness (standard human response). Unfortunately, the guy he loves most is a few tickets that do not have a full deck and he tries to kill the Medusa ambassador (who, oddly, lives in a small box - this is a bad way to travel). And, unfortunately, Muldair did not hurt himself. What's going on is somehow stupid, and while the episode was the first time I saw her, I was pretty freed. Watching all the men on board that went over Muldaur was pretty stupid, and Spock's acting when he was out of his way was pretty shy. Do yourself a favor - if you have not seen a show before, choose another episode.
