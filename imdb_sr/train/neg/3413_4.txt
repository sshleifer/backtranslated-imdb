First viewed 12/26/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levi): Corni comedi murder mysteries with very little laughter. It seems that the film was based on an earlier Italian film, but it was copied by two pretty popular American writers of romantic comedy. But this one by Charles Shier and Nancy Meiers does not reduce it in comparison with their other efforts. The story is about several American traveling Americans, played by Richard Levis and Sean Ioung, who encounter a lost dog and hope to earn a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the newspaper for the return of the dachsund. When they tried to get him back, they see a hand that comes from the garage door in a marital home, which they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of a woman who should give them money. They cry and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth, they are being revealed as refugees from the crime scene, expecting to be killed. Other characters in the movie meet in the train before and hang out on a gambling resort in Monte Carlo doing various things to get into the story. Other members of the band are actors John Candi, James Belushi, Cibill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. After the police find out about death, they begin to examine the main characters and, of course, they have to work through their crazy lies to understand what really happened. None of the previously mentioned actors can perform this film from their central state despite some funny moments that were mostly provided by the Belushi / Shepherd couple. This is not a horrible movie, it's not that good. There are plenty of average movies out there and this is just one more for a bunch. Try it, you may like it, you probably will not.
