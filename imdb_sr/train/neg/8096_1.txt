Most book adaptations are bad, but this film has omitted the key parts of the story and changed the description and some characters. They rearranged the story and combined the scenes and changed the order. They added to it funny things that never happened in the book and never would have happened. If I had not read the book in advance, it would have been an incredibly boring movie, I do not care about characters like them or I do not like them. Converts characters to jokes. Terrible. Funny. Waste of two hours of my life.
