Many days after I saw the Ada Concept, I am still in awe of any group of people spending so much time to make such a horrible movie. about Adi Lovelock, her colleagues or the product of her efforts. Also, nobody should watch this movie in the hope of entertaining it. As a sci-fi movie, this would undoubtedly be a terrible failure. Somehow, the main character manages to revive the past and communicate with her on his personal computer - with the advice and encouraging words of Timothy Liri. I doubt that anyone could stop his disbelief in order to keep this absolutely absurd. As a dramatic film, this would undoubtedly be a terrible failure. Somehow, the writer / director manages to fill eighty-five minutes with a constant, unnecessary, boring and trivial drama over essentially nothing. I doubt that anybody could feel that all the drama in the movie serves only as an irritating distraction. It's hard to fully express my degree of contempt for the Ada Concept. The circumstances under which I saw it banned me from leaving the theater, but there is no doubt that I could otherwise. I'm still angry that I spent the time that I needed to see. Just so that I can more effectively criticize this film, I want to be more articulate.
