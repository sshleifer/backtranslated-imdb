I could not believe I spent $ 14.00 on this. The only redeeming quality is unheard-up. Synchronization was worse than anything I've ever experienced. It looks like it was shot with a VHS camcorder. I think that every pfennig was spent on special effects, because there was a lot of blood and body parts everywhere. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but I must admit that it was a lot worse that it was not disgusting because the whole movie is so dumb and incredible
