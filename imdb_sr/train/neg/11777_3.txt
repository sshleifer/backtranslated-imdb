Many years ago I saw The Godfather and it made a lasting impression on me, the atmosphere of the movie was the first class, the acting is remembered and the story is a classic. I recently bought the Trilogy and after watching Part 1 I looked again at eagerly looking at Part 2 ...... I was so pleased that I realized early that Part 2 had the proper tracking of the great Godfather movie, again everything was fine perfect and I could not wait to see Kuma III ........ WRONG !, I wish I had stopped at II. The story was not good, it seemed to me as a story made just to have a story, the characters were weak, especially a daughter. Pacin's protégé was a weak character who would live eagerly in Kum 1 or 2. Then scenes like Corleone were embroidered with all the decorations of the Catholic Church with a full chorus, killers on horses riding in the sunset, invisible. helicopter shooting at the meeting (where 'good' escaped and everyone else was killed), daughter and cousin, overtaking pieces of pasta over the board, pathetic cracking on the stairs ... \ t orange juice for diabetes (the man of his intelligence and cunning is not ready for an emergency?) ... NE was not good and with the best will in the world I will not be able to watch it again. But I will look at 1 and 2 many times many years.
