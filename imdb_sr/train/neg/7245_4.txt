I do not care about The Pallbearer, it's not that bad, but it's very slow at that time. As the film continues, it becomes a little more interesting, but nothing brilliant. I really like David Schwimmer and I think he's good here. I'm not a massive fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but sometimes I do not mind and here is good. Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like traces, you may enjoy it.
