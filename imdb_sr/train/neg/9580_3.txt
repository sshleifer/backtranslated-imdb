The former actor and all handsome guy Rob Love starred in a film set in the US high security prison. I had the impression that his character would be popular for the wrong reasons, such as Tobias in the first series of the OZ, but PROXIMITI is not such a film, it is more like a movie "Man on the Run" BEGUNAC. Also, the topic of punishment and justice is raised because James Coburn poses as a spokesperson for a pressure group for victims, but any intelligent discussion about how society should treat criminals is totally ignored as the film degenerates into tired old clich√©s of shooting and hunting cars
