This is one of those topics that can refer to something more than most people, because I hate noise and I have no idea how they are in the big cities, New York especially, how people sleep at all! It amazes me that people can withstand all the noise there these days. The basic action of the movie is that it makes an interesting topic. Too bad what it is. Tim Robbins is decent, but apart from a couple of scenes (especially with the absolute supermodel that looks at Margarita Leiveva) it did not look like it was really there. My biggest hope for this movie is that casting agents will see an absolutely stunning and talented actress, Margarita Levieva. She does not have much work, but the supermodel is beautiful. Even when they try to get her to look at the girls from the neighborhood. It's sad to me that in the world there can be people like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian without skills or talent that can be redeemed, in order to have more fame and success than this talented beauty. I did not care much for this movie, because the script is not very good, but I'm glad to see some new talents. I hope that producers and directors will think about Margarita when they need a beautiful new actress who will have a big budget movie. If I can make Megan Fok a star (she's not that hot, and her acting "talent" is worse than made for a TV show on the Disney Channel) from a single movie, it should be easy for her, as she is adorable and has a talent! I would recommend her to change her last name so that she could pronounce it and make it more marketable. We hope this will make her a career, and if any kind of justice can appear on a big summer movie or two in the next couple of years.
