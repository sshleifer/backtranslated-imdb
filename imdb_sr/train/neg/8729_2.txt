This is a thriller with a good concept, good acting, good photo and good intentions everywhere, but who is confused and unconnected in executions. Garcia plays John Berlin, an LA forensic detective who moved. to a little Californian city at the order of his friend there. Soon he gets involved in an investigation into the unresolved murder which leads to his theorizing about the serial killer in which no one else believes. The famous victim teaches that she is blind, leading to romance with a blind girl - she believed to be a witness - at a nearby school for the blind. Despite the intriguing story, in this movie there were too many quantum leaps and holes planning in which I wondered how hell we were asking: Finish here? or 'how did we find out?' It was confusing and unconnected, despite good behavior, etc. John Malkovich has a small part at the end as F.B.I. an investigator from Berlin. It is not recommended.
