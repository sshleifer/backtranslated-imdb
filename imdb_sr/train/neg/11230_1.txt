In the sixth grade, every teacher I decided to make was a great idea to make this film a curriculum for the whole semester. Each class had something to do with this terrible show. We watched him in English and wrote in magazines as if we were one of the characters. In mathematics, we discussed maps and other sea sharks. In science we talked about whales (which was actually a bit interesting, so this was not a 100% waste of time). The whole day was torture. And not only that, they would subject us to this horror twice a day by watching it in the classroom. I could see if this was a new series or something, but it was '93. I'm still trying to block this.
