I saw this film for the first time in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were simply edited by censorship commissions. But then, in Poland in 2000, I looked at it in its complete form. So what? The plot is incredibly crazy - 2 men survive a genetic disaster and are found on a planet full of feminist strong, flat and fundamentally heavy lady. People are now trying to fight it, followed by a whole lot of extreme stupid clich√©s - sex drive, a constant male desire for sex, feminists who are portrayed as complete idiots (you can agree with them or not, but idiots are certainly not) et cetera. The performance of even the sterile Jerzy Stuhra is wooden and unusually bad - he only pulls casual faces and repeats the spoken phrases like: "I'm in a lift with naked fish and I did not do anything to her!". It was supposed to be a comedy, but it turned out to be an empty farce, full of foreseeable jokes and allusions beneath the waist. Do not waste time on it - this is just bad.
