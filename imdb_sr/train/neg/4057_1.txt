This is an extremely boring film. If you grew up in Vietnam, like me, then you have seen and heard all the film footage and arguments here a hundred times. But what makes this film really boring is the narrative of director Carlton Shervood. Most of the film was shot with Shervood, which speaks directly to the camera about his thinking about this conflict time in the history of our nation. If you are old enough to remember Vietnam, then you get Find something new here. There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerria or new evidence to earn a second documentary on Vietnam. Younger viewers who are interested in the topic should see an excellent George Butler Going Up! The stolen honor obviously should have been the task of John Kerry, but he fails to achieve that goal.
