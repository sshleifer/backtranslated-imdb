I got this movie from a private collector and I was very curious. He had 7.8 in IMDb (only 9 votes) and some external comments were favorable. But I must say that this is a very common and uninteresting giallo. Yes, great cinema, the film is well-directed, but it never thrilled me. It starts well, but even though I'm not bored, the story is so common and things that happen so normally, that I did not really like it. You can laugh. And you can see some tits. But if you like the kind I like (bizarre, surreal, meaningless, bloody, atmospheric, brutal murders ...) you will not appreciate this movie very much. I give him 4 for good direction and assembly, and final crafts, which make the movie fun. But it can be much better.
