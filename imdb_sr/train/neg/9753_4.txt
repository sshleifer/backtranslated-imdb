I am grateful for one thing and one thing - that this woman will be thousands of miles away on a completely different continent !!! Yay!!! This program perfectly described briefly how obsessed Victoria Beckham became with a whore and her family in the media in the name of self-promotion and "Brand fikking Beckham". A few years ago, I used to really like 'Posh and Becks', I still admire David's talent, but I do not respect him anymore. How can you respect someone who pushed his wife's hand through his wife's hand, working him like a puppet. It was clear that Victoria was in the hands of Beckham's premature departure from Manchester United and now the same thing happened in Real Madrid. I hope that Beckham can live with the fact that, although he may earn pounds of kilograms - he sold his soul for the US Buck and will finish his days playing for a team that will fight for improvement from Division 1 in England (no offense to America). - But with Baseball and Basketball you say - football does not work!) In any case - I deviate. It's been years since I saw this over-the-top, completely fake performance of 'Posh' - it was just at the height of its red carpet after Rebecca Loos' debacle, when instead of throwing a red carpet. In David deserved it, desperately caught him by his hand, trying to save a million pounds of money that her marriage had become. Full of this PR stunt was pathetic. Why can not she just go there quietly, support her husband through the biggest mistake in her professional career and keep her head down? When it became so important to feel that moving to America should be covered by this huge fan? Incidentally, I saw David Beckham a documentary last night. At least he kept the tape of grace and humility. Two things his wife could do with learning. Another thing, Victoria - complain that you are constantly being persecuted by Dad. Little hint - stop revealing them about where you are a stupid woman. Happy America !!
