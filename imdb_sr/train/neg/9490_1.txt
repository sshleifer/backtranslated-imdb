This is absolutely and absolutely garbage, a good example of what a BAD movie is, it can not be attractive to anyone, even the b-movie fans. Do not, I repeat, NOT spend the precious time of your life on this piece of garbage. Poor acting, bad directing, a terrible (but I mean really terrible) letter, and a complete lack of idea of ​​what's fun (of any kind). I bought a DVD for $ 3, I swear I could pay someone to take it. Ignition would not be enough for what this film did to me. I like b-movies, toy killers, strange monsters from the lagoon, but this is not even close. Do you know those films that are so bad that they are funny? Not even. Only the old old pathetic.
