he did not know anything about the film or was based on the best-selling book. He tried to suppose from the introductory scenes what would be, best guess, the buried treasure and the list of deaths. It took about 15 minutes when I got bloody suspicion that the movie is crap. I will not bother you about how complicated the plot was, but anyone who has given more than two stars has to work for filmmakers. He had his clothes, shirt and tie arrived at the hospital in jeans and t-shirts. He could not even get the right to continuity. I have a Christian theme, it's hard to miss.
