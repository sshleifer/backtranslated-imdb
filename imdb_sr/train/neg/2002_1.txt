A trembling handheld camera was used, which, in all likelihood, gave the film a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that I began to get a moving illness just from watching. It looked like someone with a cerebral palsy held the camera (without offense it meant that they would suffer from CP, but I do not think you would expect that you will do much as a cameraman!) The work on the camera was so tormented, My wife and I considered her unacceptable and gave up after 10 minutes of torture. I checked out a bit later (it was shown on TV), and it was not better. I suggest you miss this, unless you need to solve any kind of bad drought you may have eaten!
