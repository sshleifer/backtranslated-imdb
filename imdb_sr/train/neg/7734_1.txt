This film is the worst movie I've ever seen. The story is bad - I could not even follow it. The acting is high school. Sound recording is irritating. Attempts to humor are not. Editing is terrible. Credits are even slow - it would be embarrassing for me to associate my name with this loss of film. Do not waste your time even thinking about this attempt to act.
