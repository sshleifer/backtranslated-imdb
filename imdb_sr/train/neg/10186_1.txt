Where's Michael Caine when you need it? I've seen most of the MST3K season, but this rare movie before the 1st season (episode K-20) is one of the worst films ever made. Three "stars", Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, are struggling through the worst series of cinemas ever, delivering lines written by the secret Dick Cheney-style workgroup composed of Ekon and GM lawyers who are trying to reduce funds for mass transit use and research energy efficiency. It seems to be filmed in almost complete darkness, perhaps at Super 8. It makes Logan's Race like the Sistine Chapel film with Shakespeare. I can not imagine looking at it without the comments of Crow and Servo because it is even invisible to it. Clearly, what Hollywood needs is a kind of 401K that prevents the need for actors to download bad films like this, in order to pay healthcare. With my theme of "pollution and driving rights", I expect to see, by the end, Charlie Heston, where he is holding a "cold dead" speech. Lee, I could forgive you for this 1989, but 1981?
