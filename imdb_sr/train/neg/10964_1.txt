I was not lucky to see it at the Sidevalk Film Festival. The pavement as a whole was a disappointment and this film was the last nail in the suitcase. As a godly fan of Levis Carroll's Alice book, I was very excited about the premiere of this film, which only made it much more uncomfortable to watch. I'm usually thrilled with modern negotiations if they are well treated. It is usually interesting to see the parallels between the past and the present within the famous story. Unfortunately, this film was less than modern persuasion and more perversion of pop culture. The matching of the characters of the original seemed juvenile and usually proved terribly boring. Probably did not help even the actors were very good. Most of the performances were ridiculously over the top, which I guess was due to a bad direction or trying to make up for a bad scenario. I did not laugh once during the film. All jokes were outdated references to not-so-current events that would eventually lose their grief. Really, the only highlight of the film was the opening order in which the white rabbit is on the road to meet Alice, but even then the result was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman's work. Also, I would have to say that converting the croquet of the game into a rave dance-off was terrible. It was without a doubt the lowest point of the film. What a joke. You do not see this movie. After his conclusion, I was sincerely angry.
