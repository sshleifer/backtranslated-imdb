Note for all of you who are film writers: Study this movie. If your dialogue is read as a dialog in this movie, please disassemble your script and try again. I did not have great expectations, but I was intrigued by the description that points to the mystery of the Christmas Ornament Factori. The mystery is solved very early and the film becomes a true romance. I almost stopped watching in 5 minutes, 10 minutes and at the first break. My wife, who is a Hallmark & ​​Lifetime fan, gave up on the first break. Forest River is a corporate city - the main business is Aikens Ornaments, which make a variety of holiday decorations. The patriarch of the company recently died, so the future of the company is in question. We will soon meet with Noel, who would rather be on Vall Street than Main Street, and the mysterious Justin, who gets a meeting with Noel after a great snowman blowing sarcasm in Justin's car. When we meet with Alison Aikens, who is paying due attention to the Committee, we have the setting of our story. If you can not pinch all the arches of the story to the first advertisement, you have not seen enough this type of vacation film. Maybe it's a good thing.
