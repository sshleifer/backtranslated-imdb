There are some elements that keep this film out of total disaster, but are overshadowed by bad acting, complications, deus ek machina thieves, stupid dialogs, bad scripts and predictable clichés ... What we have here is a horror movie with a story that does not go anywhere for most of the time. A group of incredible heroes, including a black man who first gets it (yes, that cliché seems to be still alive even in Finland) seems to have trouble trying to get out of a mysteriously empty hospital. There are screaming ghosts (very imaginative), zombies (at one point I thought that at least they did not use zombies, but they came), and the Finnish glam-rock band with demonic makeup on the road. There is also some dumb shift of time, but he does not add anything in the story. The autistic girl and rogue look seem to have a deeper understanding of the situation, but they never say it to the viewer or their confused friends. Their lines consist only of deep life lessons such as "What will happen ..." or "Light can not live in darkness ..." or ominous "I need a red crayon ... a red crayon." So all of these characters (including a worried father and sweet doctor in the nature of trouble) end up working around them dark floors, and from or wrongly to the demons. Sometimes a ghost or a group of zombies appears, and if it seems that the demon-piano keyboard does not seem to notice a group of six people who come to her, waving a lantern and talking, it was just pretending. And apparently this demon can break through the walls without much trouble, but the opening of the elevator door is beyond his ability. In the end even we get "it was all a dream" turn. Or maybe not. Oh, boy, I wish this movie, and the kind that makes time move faster, so everything goes on in just 10 minutes or so ...
