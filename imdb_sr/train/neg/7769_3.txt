A real head from Bill Rebane's film that seemed to worsen in his shop during the eighties. Three millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in the last competition in which the final competitor will be awarded a million dollars provided he does so far. Some of the guests are attracted by a series of sarcastic jokes, while others are dealing with what most adults would do under the circumstances, that is to find yourself at the hotel bar. Most of the scenes are just an excuse that the camera focuses on the various parts of the female body, including the dance number that is the decoration of American Bandart and who encounters geriatric aerobics complete with whores. If there is any hesitation that white people can not dance, this scene takes the last nail into that suitcase. Pay attention to the nipple slip. This continues for about forty-five minutes until Bill Rebane begins to throw a darts on various complications, and whatever hit him, he becomes an inspiration for the next scene, making this vague confusion. It's a game until it's a game. Three old foxes have complete control until they are. The hotel is obsessed with supernatural power until it becomes just a props. They are dead until they are. Even the narrator finally replies that he does not know what the hell happened. I'm forcing everyone to clarify where Rebane did this. The acting is the caliber of a theater evening instead of dinner. Most actors are likely to return to their daily affairs at local Stuckey. I give her a couple of points for the scene where iuppie opens wide the closet, and the skeleton is within the suicide skull. Let's see how he went with the wind! This collection of Chilling Classics really becomes my hole. Bane, take it! Like Rebane! I hate myself.
