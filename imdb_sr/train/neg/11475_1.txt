A movie that makes you throw yourself on a sword. I saw a schlock in my time, but after I looked at a mess, I think I will never be able to watch another movie anymore. May God condemn the souls who did it. Premises - a former soldier silent kid, a type of underwear model (in fact acting) is looking for a girl who sent him a Christmas card while serving in the army. She's settling in with her family, which is the right wing. The family takes him and takes 2 hours of our chick time to see that there is a better catch than her liberal look, French wine drinking, porsche driving, loud conversation with a mobile phone, lazy, city frozen, Jewish fiancÃ©. > Bad - 1d characters, 1d theme. Be above the head of the topic Pro-Militarians. Ed Asner. The interruptions of Good-Commercials were long. Peter Jason. It's over.
