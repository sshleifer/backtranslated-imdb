My grandmother took me and my sister to see this movie when it came out in theaters in 1998, and so we bought tickets, popcorn and soda happily, and went to the theater and sat down to watch the movie. When it's over, the audience did not applaud, I remember hearing a few people saying that they did not like it at all, I did not like it, I thought it was pretty stupid, and it's not worth seeing. Eddie Murphy was hysterical in this, but besides him, the whole movie was bad, I seldom laughed at the parts in this, I also remembered that other people in the theater almost even laughed. And what I thought was bad was that the animals talked, because the animals that speak only exist in cartoons, in live action movies, they are totally whispered! I said that apart from the hysterical turn of Eddie Murphy, which he brings, this film is not worth watching, it's rather stupid. I just said that he was the only funny part of this film, and I also did not see Eddie Marphy in the really "great" "Pluto Our Adventure" movie. This film is not a movie that I really recommend to see, because besides Eddie Murphy, you probably will not like this, especially because there are many animals in it! I will give this movie a rating of 3 stars from a possible 10 stars.
