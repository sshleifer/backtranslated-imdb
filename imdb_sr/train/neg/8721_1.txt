I'm sorry, but this is just miserable. The girl was a brat, they were not pleasant characters, and the plot was sucked. After all, it was not even a gator as the film would like us to believe. If you look at a complete guide to the reptiles you will discover that it is indeed a crocodile, not an alligator. Apparently, they were not hired by an animal expert or would know that it was a crocodile creature. It's a sad excuse for a movie. Especially the place. I almost fell asleep with this.
