Three Stooges - Have Rocket, Vill Travel - 1959 This was the first feature film starring Stooges and it's pretty bad. This makes THREE THROUGH THROUGH THE WORLD IN DAZE (from 1963) look like a masterpiece. Stooges are domari on the rocket site. They climb into the rocket and she goes to Venus. They get to know some things, including the unicode that speaks, and they call it "Uni", which return with them to Earth. "Uni" speaks as an average, pleasant person - "Oh, hello. How are you? Wonderful planet here. I hope you like it.' Funny. Very few drafts and so many scenes just go on and on. Stooges are returning from space and the film is over as much as the story goes, but nobody said that film producers will continue for another 10 minutes at a party where nothing is happening. Stooges leave the party, then the movie is almost over. The peak of the film - the end where Stooges sing a sharp song about his journey. Larry and Curley Joe hit Moe in the face with two pies. Brutal. Another writer mentions fine music. Huh? The only music I've ever noticed is two classic melodies - I'll get a romance and the song goes back again, both playing at the party. And that's really the highlight of the picture - music from Columbia's old films. High sexy blonde was beautiful. Terrible - brand new VHS video store with 99 cents.
