Since there was nothing wrong with acting, etc., writing for this episode is far behind for this series of phantoms or without phantoms. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see a Martian hunter. You have to know that in the midst of the 6th series, no matter what happened, it's not true what's happening and really does not bring anything in the story of the series, except for a reunion with a Martian hunter and losing 30 minutes to do it. Another case of bad writing in the smallville soap opera. I really like shov, but mostly because of acting games and 3 or so good episodes every year, but who ever on the basis of writing that works or uses to work on soaps must be preserved. This is by far the worst. In the first 4 minutes you know that what's going on is fake, and all that's happening is a dream based on Clark's evil obviously caused by the character of the phantom zone and when he wakes up he will win and blaze and the writers will not really have to create a villain who will advance in the story this week. I could have added another criminal to die in the last episode in which he was a Martian hunter and made him flee again or come back and tell Clark that he had forgotten the sunglasses to look closer in this episode and called the day.
