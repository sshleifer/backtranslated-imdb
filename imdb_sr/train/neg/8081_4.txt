One of the demands of science fiction, at least before becoming a satire, is somewhat convincing. I think a bomb against matter could do much more harm than it was intended for. But I'll give it to the physicists who could see the Solar Crisis. It is a crisis that the country faces as the sun torches are completely pulled out of hand. They are approaching Earth, so it becomes unusually hot, as if the whole Earth is the Valley of Death. The answer is an antimatter bomb that the spaceship will have to ship to the sun and explode there. It will turn rockets towards Merkur, provided it is not in direct settlement with the Earth. Who will deliver it, but Captain Tim Matheson and his crew. That's if he can keep his mind at work, not his son, Corin Nemec. Caring for the personal side of family problems is Admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson's father and German grandfather. this crisis is trying to control the world's food supply for survivors. The idea that he may not survive does not enter his thinking. He does everything in his power to sabotage Matheson's mission. Solar crisis looks like a bad combination in 2001, Odyssey in space and travel to the bottom of the sea. It seems Boile takes his sign from Gene Hackman as Lek Luthor in Superman, apparently he is the only one in the acting team who realizes that he is in Turkey and behaves adequately. Right blue and dull. Except Jack Palance's rat dog who finds the German and takes care of him. The key is that the film was directed by that famous Hollywood flop producer, Allen Smithee. The film gets four stars for the actors who took part in the film, and it was time for carving gratitude.
