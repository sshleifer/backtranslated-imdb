The Japanese always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy films. They were always ready to destroy cities with huge plastic monsters coming from space and elsewhere. The problem is that they never had the money to achieve convincing special effects. This film, published in France under the title Les envahisseurs de l'espace, is no exception. His ambition is to show three creatures from a giant octopus to a huge lobster trying to take precedence over humans. It's extremely awkward and funny, but also pretty pleasant. After all, we still love these creatures and these films, are not we?
