> you are warned this is a spoiler! > This movie is so bad that I doubt I can write enough lines. excellent direction recordings are well thought out. actors were very good, especially Richard before tho would like to see more of him. Madeline Kahn and John Houseeman were classics. Dudley Sea blessed him, he could have been better. John Ritter would again like to see him again. In my opinion, this failure is entirely due to the writer's failure. Perhaps the producer could pull the plug when he saw what he was creating. It is a pity that so much money has entered this boiler, if with a small change here and there in my opinion it will be repaired. To make a smile.
