I'm sorry, but this is such a bad movie. Football hooligans are quarreling in a passenger van? Suits? Shades?! Alan apparently had no idea what he was talking about, when he did this, it's far from the truth as it can be obtained. It does not look terrifying, it's terrible or even comes to someone who likes football. And Iethi? What the hell? Suits, shades and seating in a passenger suit are childishly mocking each other with their "time when you get your diaper." Please. And the hedgehog gang sprays the underwear of ICC? I do not see how nobody can seriously grasp this film! 4/10. His biggest inaccuracy in showing the hooliganism crisis of the late eighties that I have ever seen.
