I was not sure how to evaluate this movie, because it was so bad that it was really funny. I am not a fan of Gackt in any way, although it is talented, despite a strange pseudonym that sounds like a cat that craves hair. I always thought that Hide was talented, but Faith is an interesting album. But on the topic of people. This movie is funny. It's so exaggerated and meaningless, it's almost like a parody of supernatural action movies. The film here has almost no plot, except that it's just about vampires with gangster friends. In a way, this film almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, but there were too many ideas, which resulted in a lack of time to pay attention to one of them. Action scenes were funny. Quickly edited, almost difficult to understand, with choreography that is so ridiculously bad. Although Hide looked very elegant during the action scenes, but it's just such a movie. I'm good for action movies, but the action is terribly done. Although the final shot was fine and the climax of this otherwise depressing film. It constantly jumps between genres, which is not a good thing. She wants to be a drama, an action movie, or a horror, or a romance ... what the hell. If this review exasperates you, why? Is it because Gackt and Hide are your love? Do not be fooled, this movie is bad.
