I bought this movie in a cheap bin in Rogers Video Store for $ 2. From time to time I enjoy a good B movie and thought this sounds good. The movie is pretty cliche of the "1970s" and it's pretty rough for it. Unfortunately, the story is difficult to track and does not happen much in the movie. In fact, I shut it down after 45 minutes of watching and concluded that a week later I would watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was. The film has good videos in it, but you have to wait and wait and wait ....... for them. If you are in B movies, it can only be for you, just be warned that the movie is slow and not really really happening, and did I mention a little story ... <br /> <br />
