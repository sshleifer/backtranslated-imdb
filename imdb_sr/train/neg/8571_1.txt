Penn takes time to develop his characters, and we're almost concerned about them. However, there are some real problems in this story, we do not see any real motivation for the evil brother's behavior, and the timeline is fucked up. Apparently set up in 1963, music was in the late 1960s / early 70s. References and dialogue are 70s / 80s. The potential for a strong peak represents himself, and Penn allows him to move away. But even with all these difficulties it's worth watching, but not much.
