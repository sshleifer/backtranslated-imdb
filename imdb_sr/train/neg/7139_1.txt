Redline is the feat of Fast & Furious, without any redemption qualities. It does not have to have a complex plot with more turns and surprises, but it needs something! This is the equivalent of a porn movie, where the story and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and also at the end. Except this is worse, because you do not get your money. Imminent boring, impossible races, and the terrible loss of expensive cars, which almost get negative points for appearing in this movie. Of course, she's hot, but who's so desperate for a woman on the screen? I feel like the director sat with a hat with a full dialogue and clipping, and every time they switched scenes, he shook 8 balls. No serious person competing or not knowing anything about this will not watch this movie and enjoy the scenes of the race.
