Do not waste time with this movie. This is a total thrash in terms of acting, directing, sound editing, soundtrack ... There was such a loss of performance from some very good actors. The film does not justify Paresch Raval, who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in Bollivood. Akshai Kumar, who is also a star in the making, did not do a good job. John Abraham, what's wrong with him? Is that what you call acting? I think you should thank God for having a nice face, otherwise you would have received a Razzie Prize in India if there were any such awards in Bollivood. Asrani was a great talent, but he exaggerated as before. First of all, people in Bollivood can not do something original. In addition, they do not even know how to copy properly. The jokes in the movie were so overwhelming that it was getting sick to sit over them. Priiadarshan may be a star in the south, but is simply not able to make a decent movie on Hindi. Sound editing is astounding shit. I can continue on this issue, but the bottom line is that Bollivood should be a shame to make such a film. What's wrong with you guys? That's why Bollivood is where it is. Did you know that Bollivood makes more movies each year than Hollywood, but most of the movies are out of the country for films like this. I am an Indian and I am completely embarrassed for Bollivood to produce this piece. Films like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were great. These are world-class movies that are timeless ... among the best of this decade. Garam Masala, however, may be one of the worst in this century. Period of time. I give him 1 of 10.
