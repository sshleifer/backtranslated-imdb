A family searching for some of the old landmarks near the road, which included her father's coffee book, encounters an ancient, oronly old fake exhibition by an eccentric one-man man. When their family van breaks after leaving the secondary fair, they are forced to stay in an almost abandoned fishing camp that was the place where a parole break took place a decade ago. There were many movies in the movie. freak 'subgenre of horror, from the beloved' Freaks' Toda Brovning (1932) to the hilarious' Freaked 'Alec Vinter (1993). These are both classics (or soon after, Freaked). 'Side Sho', however, will never be. And if it comes to classical status. . . Well, this will be an obvious trace to the sad state of our genre. From the ridiculously poor opening of a song to a 17-year-old daughter who is obviously older than her natural mother, this film did not have much to do with it. Writing was incomplete, but it was not terrible. . . just boring. The direction was weak, and the rare effects of the freak were quite terrible and incredible. The acting was terrible, and casting was worse. Anyone who believes in the age of two of these teenagers in a camp can not get to know a teenager for a long, long time. There was far enough blood and violence to compensate for the lack of any other quality. . . and when there was little violence, it was not at all good. And, I can not forget to mention the end of combat scenes that, with honesty, are some of the worst I've ever seen in a movie. All in all, this is an easily forgotten and badly made horror movie that deserves to be alone at the bottom of the buckets for the dollar. Final judgment: 2.5 / 10.
