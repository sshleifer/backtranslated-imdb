There were still interesting Polish documentaries on the cultivation of worms, in brail_ !! Competition (worm farming) had a better plot and more interesting characters. I was physically ill after watching this movie. A spouse cheating (I think dougrai_scott_) was a joke in every sense of the word. Poor Jennifer must really work, and what's the accent !!. Locations and random meetings reminded me of a joke in high school and showed the humility of ten-year-olds in cooking classes. It was so bad that I think I would write a sequel entitled "This is not a laxative." Thank you for listening, it was the great weight of my consciousness.
