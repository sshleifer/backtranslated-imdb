Two things that are good in this movie are two unknown personalities. First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in the film, young and compassionate, with the look that even today covers her body, steals. at the very beginning, what is everything in which she is, and that's it. Obviously, it's just starting because her acting has improved her next projects. Secondly, the result of the then-famous composer Christopher (Chris) Iounga is what prevents this stink from getting one star ... yes, I know that one star is no longer a lot, but in the case of this movie, it's much. The rest is just a stupid nonsensical horror couple of students who are trying to clean the bedroom. it should be demolished, one by one pulling away a murderer without knowledge, blah, blah, blah ... we all know where this is going. Take the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga, then turn it off.
