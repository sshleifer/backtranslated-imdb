This documentary is based on biscuits as soon as you put any REAL evidence that integrity slowly sinks in a lot of shit, for example. in the event that there would not be two or more shadows for each object when Apollo 11 would pass through the Allan radiant belt, they spent 30 minutes there, and not 90 minutes there. k rai. I'm seriously dealing with some research to learn what really happened, do not let this bunch of nonsense of the documentary shape your opinion on what really happened
