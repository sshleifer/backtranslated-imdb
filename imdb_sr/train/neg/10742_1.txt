I tried to sit through this bomb not long ago. what a catastrophe. The acting was terrible. There were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell as a lead balloon. I suppose that the modern processing of Hitchcock's original "Sailing Boat". I think Hictcock will rotate the circle in his grave to the very thought of it. movie.it has several semi-big names, but they have not put any effort into their characters. But, you know, to be honest, no one is guilty of it. I mean, I'm pretty sure the script exploded in the first explosion. It's possible that this thing will improve as it goes on. But for me, I'm not willing to spend at least three days to find out. Unless you have at least three days in the weekend on the horizon, avoid this stinker / 1/10
