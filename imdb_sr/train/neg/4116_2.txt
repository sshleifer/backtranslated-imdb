My order of summary should explain everything, but I will take care of it. From the very beginning, this movie looked like excessive soap, and that's all I can comment on. There were several interesting scenes, such as the "Great" that hit the middle of the film, but, wait, what is it? Earthquake * sigh *, wait a minute! It's Dante's top! Well, the parts are slaughtered and slammed. I can not believe this film was bad, "borrowing" scenes from other, much better movies. You wonder what the director thinks the viewers are stupid enough to believe that in the center of LA, ale Dante's summit, there are huge wooded backgrounds of the mountain. and go on the right thing (again, someone from Dante's top coincidentally.) <br />
