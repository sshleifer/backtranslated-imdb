I bought this movie for selling cars, so I did not expect it to be a horror movie at the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eies (1977), but I thought it would still be pretty nice to watch . However, it turned out that it was not at all pleasant, but the acting and general movie were susceptible, such as the ways in which the killers killed their victim and that all the people were killed only by a young blonde. Women. It was a stereotypical horror movie. I say this for the following reasons: 1) Three blondes in danger, most have been killed. 2) One survivor crawls in the dark while being slapped by a killer. 3) Surprise surprise, help comes in the shape of a shotgun! Using three simple points, I saved you two an hour by summing up this bad excuse for a horror movie, so now you're lucky enough not to watch it.
