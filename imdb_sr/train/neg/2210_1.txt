This was a really funny movie. Every 1 in the film was trying to be serious and that's what made this movie so ridiculous. I mean the shark's head on the human body. Can be more fun. Good work Sci-Fi keeps comedy. I never thought movies could be retarded. If they hold it, they will have to rename the sci-fi channel in a comedy channel or something like that. /> Be prepared with a bowl of popcorn and beer or a bottle of alcohol and be ready to laugh again !!!
