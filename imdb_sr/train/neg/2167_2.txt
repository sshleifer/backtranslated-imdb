To Die For (1989) was just another d.t.v. the feature that appeared on the cable ad in the early nineties. The only thing that was noticed in connection with this feature was the last film by Duane Jones. Besides, there's no reason to watch this vampire movie, unless you like pseudo-chickens that are disguised as a horror movie. A tired vampire craves for love and looks for the last streets of L. looking for him. Will he succeed or will the government simply step back as it was the last century? They are so bad to make this look like a classic. I know this is a movie about vampires, but filmmakers could get used to lighting. I do not recommend it because I did not like it. Nuff said?
