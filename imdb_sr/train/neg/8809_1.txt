A bunch of women who can not act to sit, talk, smoke. They have another woman in wheelchairs they hide because she is deformed, and sometimes they kill someone to feed that human flesh that really looks like some kind of ham bought in a store and dressed by sticking with several plastic fingers. We do not see them killing anyone, suddenly on the floor is the body, covered with a bloody blanket. Therefore, I can no longer eat spam lid with a list. Just thinking that spam covered by the list is sufficient to cause the same narcolepsy condition he has made trying to pass through this film. Occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes of the guy who "hunts" them through the torture of a guy whom he tied his chair to the chair. Why he did not catch this guy and how he's connected to the sisters sitting on the couch has never been explained. There are also scenes of some "superhuman" guys who are crazy. He purifies blood and strikes through the wall, but who is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor even tied to the story. No action, no special effects, no story. If you want to watch some boring people talking in a deep way about something while you sit and eat a ham and smoke, then it's 90 minutes from it, because, except for the scene in which a fish clings to the corner of the street and lists random scenes, absolutely Nothing happens. (IAVN) Oh, I almost forgot, you can see them move things, including a deformed sister, when they move into their new apartment. One of the rare moments when they are not sitting on the couch or lying in bed.
