This is the biggest piece of shit ever. They seem to have spent more time, effort and money on making DVDs than on a real movie. I really thought that the DVD was replaced by someone's domestic porn until I recognized one of the actors on the cover. This movie seems to have been made by someone with hundreds of dollars and camcorders and spent half of it on rats. The picture is really clear, but it, along with very unfortunate lighting, cinema, if you can call it, production, acting, if it's actually what they do, and the script, if they did, make this movie worse than old pornography. At least the old porn bar has a point. This looks like some PETA members have gathered and decided to make a really disturbing, senseless PSA on animal rights and feelings. This is not worth the money or time. She has nothing to do with a real BTK serial killer, except the killer's name and the names of some of the victims. The people who made this movie should be pleased that it is not yet free, or it may have come for them only because it has screwed up the film so much.
