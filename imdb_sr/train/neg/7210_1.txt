Once again, Disney manages to make a children's movie that completely ignores his background. The only common thing with this and original Gadget caricatures are the names. The most obvious mistakes are the characters - Penny does not have her book, the brain is reduced from the face to the fantastic background, Dr. Clav is more shov-off than the evil villain, etc. But there are more than that. The horrors begin from the first minutes of the film - A gadget as a protector called John Brovn does not help him identify him as a classical inspector. And at the very beginning, we see Disey's aggressive attempt to turn every story into a love affair between a man and a woman - they introduce Brenda, which only serves to make this film compatible with Disney. Add to this the fact that the "Claw" seen in this movie and the classic Dr. Clav is almost diagonally opposite and you will see that this will not be near the original story. What would help would be a better story to replace - but as you have guessed, and Disney did not succeed in doing so. The whole movie is just a Gadget that stupidly works for silliness and crazy about Brand. As if adding damage to the injuries, Disney introduced the "new" Gadgetmobile - it does not look, function or think like the old Gadgetmobile, it's just a canonical "comic relief" figure. Disney apparently recognized that Gadget was a cartoon comedy, so they made a comedy, but they pulled out all the clever movements that exploded on the head and replaced them with a Gadget that was a moron, Gadgetmobile is a wise ass, and "Clav" is showing up. Someone should tell Disney that the "children's movie" does not mean "a complete lack of any use of the brain". The gadget should be intended for children aged 10-12 ... and not children from 10-12 months like this movie. Whatever this film should be, NIJE, ponovite NE, pravi Inspector Gadget. Because I love the old Gadget, I hate this.
