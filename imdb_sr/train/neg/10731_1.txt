The film is basically a story about the return of a Russian prostitute to a native village for the sisters' / siblings funeral. There are several smaller stories that might actually be more interesting than those taken but not fully explored. The core of the film is funeral, awakening, and later controversy over the future of the community of crowns that make puppets and sell them for the purchase of vodka, but now the artist who put their puppets on the market is missing. Obviously, the film is unregulated. The journey of a prostitute from town to village is a terrible endless ride by train and tramp through the mud. Maybe it should impress us with the enormity of the Russian landscape. Only the village, as it is, settles the legion of widows and one male, the wife of a dead girl. Continuing business with dolls is problematic for everyone involved and in the end it seems impossible. Most of the film is shot with a handheld camera that can cause nausea. Another problem for western viewers is that the subtitles do not include songs and bad guys. Do not go to this movie unless you speak Russian.
