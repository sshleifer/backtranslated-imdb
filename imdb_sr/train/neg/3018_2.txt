What you get when you mix a group of cliches with a non-directional cliches and a group of characters that you did not care about and an unsuccessful attempt to create an attractive visual style and even larger breasts of clichÃ©s and a little sense of humor. and really a big budget? Why, you get one of the most adorable films ever made! I mean, of course, to Domino. Here are some things people could say during watching this movie: "Ooh, vow, the story is said out of order, it's not done a million times before. And a lot more vigorous than in this film. "Vov, look at all the flashing lights and grain texture of the film and elaborate. The director is trying so hard to make things look artificial and to establish a visual style, but it's bad that none of these the effects do not add anything to the movie or make sense with the scenes in which they are, and it's also bad that most of them come up irritating! "I heard t sharing the dialogue in about twenty thousand movies before! "I saw this scene in about thirty thousand movies before!" "And this one!" "Uh, did not they find out this "plot" half an hour ago, which should be surprising? "If this film should have been showing the" hard chicken "that goes around and breaks the ass ... when it does not do much ? "" I can not believe how this dialogue is irrelevant. "> How long has this been?" I feel like I've been watching it for more than four hours. "" I have no idea what just happened, but I do not feel particularly motivated to I'm trying to figure it out. "" Is this done? "" I want my money back. "Songs in this music background they feel so bad here. "It's ironic that all the curses that use actually diminish the influence of each one." UGH. "<br /> <br /> And, in the end: "Maybe I'll have to break my friendship with the person who recommended me this movie." <Br /> <br> /> In summary, this film is a failure in almost every aspect.If your house is in flames and this movie is played in the only non-flammable room, you should seriously consider burning it alive. <Br /> <br /> < > (If I sound bitter, it's because I just spent over two hours watching this movie and, uh, I did not enjoy it.)
