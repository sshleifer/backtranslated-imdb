Matt Cordell came back from the dead for the third round, although I'm not sure that at this time he cares about it, besides fans of MANICA COP. Cordel, who died in the latest film, was re-animated with a voodoo, and now he was on the trail of several criminals who took part in the shooting of a fellow officer whom Cordell likes very much. I missed part of this low-budget fast-start of the nineties, but it was a pleasure to see Cordella destroy the body count in different, terrible ways. The problem is that the entire movie is pretty static, and Cordell is simply not Jason or Freddy. Interest is rapidly decreasing, even with that master B-film master Robert Forster as a doctor who ends up with his brain. Keep the first movie in the series, which is funny and scary and exciting, all at the same time.
