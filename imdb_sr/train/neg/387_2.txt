It should be wondered whether at any time in the production of this film there was a script that made sense. Was the rough cutting last for 3 hours and was it decorated in a non-coherent disorder that survives? Why would anyone finance this mess? I will say that Tom Vlaschiha is a good young man and to do what he can in a dialogue and dramatic (?) Situations given to him. But signs come and go without obvious reason, continuity is nonexistent, and acting, cinema and direction are (until decent) amateur. No one is sleeping is an unfortunate choice of title, because it will probably prove untrue if someone tries to really watch this movie.
