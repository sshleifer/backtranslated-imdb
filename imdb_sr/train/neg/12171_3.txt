As a lover in the slasher movie, I will usually calm myself to watch every movie that crosses my retina, which sometimes makes me more evil than good to my brain, I will say. As the channel flipped through a night, Sleepavai Camp II crossed over me. Of course, I wanted to check it out because I heard about the Sleepaway franchise franchise, but I never saw any of them (for shame, I know). I note that since I did not see the original, my criticism probably should not be taken too seriously, because perhaps what I think is wrong is completely intended for the design of the franchise. Now I suppose the franchise Sleepavai Campa itself is a joke for itself. Damn, even the name comes as a deliberate joke. Sleep avai camp? It's a good party. I can appreciate the film because I wanted to make something for a clean campers' terrible value, but that's about as much as I can. The acting in this movie made actors of the first Friday of the 13th appear to be actors who perform Macbeth. Campi requires bad behavior, but come on. Pamela Springsteen as an evil killer from reality without reality made a better job of killing my interests than killing the whole team. As for comedy, there were several times where I was laughing, but it was a bit and far between. Deaths are so obviously organized and false that you can barely appreciate them. If you are looking for a comedy slasher film with a good camp, I recommend Club Dread. If you surf the channel over this, check and see what's on.
