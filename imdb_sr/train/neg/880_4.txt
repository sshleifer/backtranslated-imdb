Garson Kanin wrote and directed this view of the "modern day" in Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first directing effort since the 1940s! David Janssen is somewhat wrong as the owner of a large casino that reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks troubled as older Jason Bateman). Janssen accesses each scene the same way: defensively, with a chip on the shoulder. Playing this role is cool and relaxed looking too much out of Janssen, who barks on everything like a tormented husband (even chewing Don Rickles and pushing him to pay!). His son, who is not doing well in search of his own identity, comments that young people look at Vegas (giving them another ten years), and his disapproval of his dad's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-reliant secretary, and Edi Villaims has fun as a party at audition. Unfortunately, "Vhere It At" does not have much to do with it except for the current rumblings about ethics between adults and their children, some quick T & A footage and fun-exhausted satirical bits in the world of high gambling - the majority that has been covered so far, ad nauseum. ** from the ****
