Dear God! I waited for this film to "start" ... then I was waiting to buy it ... and when it did not, I just sat there, stunned: 1) it could be so bad, and 2) I only spent a few hours to just nonsense. I believed that Drev could not make this bad from the movie ... and the boy, did I ever lose faith! Do not be tired of this! Drev tried, but the film was poorly written, badly behaved, and only poorly designed! I can not believe the script that this bad has ever received! He had a million chances to really do something with that idea (the word "concept" is too big for this movie to even qualify!) And he still has not left! It's just miserable! Where the other reviewer realized it was not the worst, he was confusing me! Because you believe me, it was worse to cut my wrists before I finish it!
