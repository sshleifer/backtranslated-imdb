This film was terrible. I watched him three times, and not even the whole thing. It's impossible to watch, the story is shitty, depressing and extremely disgusting. I do not write for a spoiler, so if you want to know why it's so disgusting, take a look at it yourself. The only good thing in this film was John Savage, his dialogue at the beginning and some funny parts in the movie. A little kid in this movie is boring, and the whole situation is bullshit. I saw this movie in stores in America, so I assumed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, am I wrong !!!! The acting is terrible, and the nakedness itself is miserable and nasty. The other thing is that Starr Andreef, the second major character, was not in such bad films in the past, in fact, she was in some pretty good movies. Same with John Savage. This movie SUCKS!
