However, Parsifal is not an opera that everyone likes, although it is my favorite, especially Knappertsbusch, in 1951. Siberberg's approach is so static. Whenever music suddenly starts to get up ... Siberberg keeps the head moving at the same pace. The needs for Amfortas and Klingsoro are endless. What happened to the movie montage? The result is physically exhausting to watch. The spectator is never transmitted spiritually. Your impulse is to hurry home and re-record the footage to confirm that Wagner correctly understood, Siberberg was wrong. And this is an adornment of these "smart" reminders of Wagner's anti-semitism - will he ever be a spectator of this film without the prior knowledge of Wagner?
