For this film he was a great actor: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lev Aires - all actors of b-movie. But this film did not use any of them for any advantage, as none of their characters even met on the screen (although Christopher Lee can play against himself in several scenes). Alien motifs in this movie seem to change when the hat drops. First, they just want to fix their ship and go, then turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not letting his wife after they bring them the key part they need. Then, out of nowhere, this "peaceful" race decides to destroy the planet because it causes too much "disease" (although they offer the main hero and his wife a place in society). The biggest part of the film is spent watching a man and a woman driving or walking or standing or sitting at the tables and doing nothing. They almost wanted to finally get out with the rest of the planet, only in the vengeance that bored us to death. Unless you really like Chris Lee or seventy year hunting-budget sci-fi, I'd give this a break. It falls into a narrow range of lost celluloids between Starry Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
