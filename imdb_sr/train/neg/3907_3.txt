I'm glad to rent this movie for one reason: its flaws have led me to want to read Allende's book and get a full story. Pros: The movie is wonderful, the period is shown well and consistently (to my best knowledge), and Merrill and Glenn are doing good jobs. Cons: This is the worst acting thing I've ever seen from Jeremy Irons - I wondered if something was wrong with his mouth. (And I hate the terribly English way of saying "Transito.") Vinona Rider does not do anything convincing except that it looks young and idealistic. Most of the other performances are fine, but so few things lie together in character arches and the development of relationships that I was frustrated and angry at the end. Now I am very curious whether this film is typical for the work of Bill August. Maybe I'll have to leave a few more dollars to rent Smilla Sense of Substance.
