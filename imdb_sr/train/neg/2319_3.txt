A lot of stupid holes in the movie. First we see him looking at his master practicing kung fu, and dying in the middle of his practice. That's fine with me. And then at the end of the movie we see that he uses kung-fu who learned only by looking at his master while he was still a child. Is it possible at all? I do not think like that. This show is exclusive to fans of Jai Chou, and the film lacks depth in terms of character development, cinema styles and the development of the action. Does anyone notice that the captain of the basketball team (he forgot his name) and the idolized player Li Xiao look so similar to each other, to the extent that they thought they were the same person? Long hair, sunny appearance, tall and strong. The two looked like they came out of a mass production plant that was designed to produce products that scream the teen wildly into orgasm. It was not that these two actors had any value to contribute to the movie as a whole for the film industry. The jokes were poor and were not at all funny at all. The scenes related to the 4th masters of Jai Chou who returned to help him in the basketball field, degenerated into a senseless plot when they began to attack their opponents ala Roial Rumble style. Worse still, when the four of the masters beat, the crowd began to cheer and the match continued. That was really VTF? moment. At the end of the show, when she won the match, all thanks to the excellent kung fu skills of Jai Chou. How he got that kung fu skill is a mystery, because the show in some way shows that he acquires skills only by observing his master. The look of his long-lost son seemed a bit too short from the director to finish the film. In short, this is Jai Chou-flick (instead of the usual "chickens"). Look only if Jai Chou is your fan. If you are one of those who taste in movies very much match with those on the list of the top 250 IMDb movies of all time, then this film is not for you.
