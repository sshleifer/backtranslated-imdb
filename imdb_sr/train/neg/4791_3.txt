* Spoliers * do not read further if you have not seen this movie Pick Up After the Depressive "Phantasm II" Completed; A tall man kidnappes Mike, while Reggie and a new kid, Tim, spend most of the rest of the film trying to get him back, and do not end up as slaves on the "Red Planet" of a tall man. This is really silly: the trio of thieves in the bright pink corpse was only for comic relief, and the black karate chick (can not remember her name) was so irritating that I could not wait to see if a tall man was killed her character . This makes him seem to be a Tim's character, who comes late and is eventually a hero, but ... that does not work well. To the very end of this story, Liz is cut off from the killer dwarfs, Mike gets a silver ball embedded in his skull, spheres reach Reggie and dwarfs to bring Tim, and no one else stops the High Man. The bad guy wins - now how is it for a surprise in the end? This was filmed in 1993 and not published until '95. And the ending of this was at the time of the final, and although it was disappointing and anti-climatic, it was also a suitable and convenient ending for these strange little bands. But the fourth is changing this end and does not add anything new but more bad jokes, and even worse and more senseless ending ... 1/2 of ****
