I buy or at least watch every Seagall movie. He came out with a few good films, then went down to poor stories, bad camera work, and walk through the person, and he almost lost me. A few films ago, he remembered how to make a decent movie. Now he forgot again. This film is seriously dark (at any level you want to call). There's a lot of slash & gash here for no apparent purpose, unless it meant a warning against the army. Seagall may have had a stand-in for many of his scenes as it's often too dark to apologize, and someone else's voice was used most of the time. Unfortunately, the only interesting figure was a bad guy who killed his guard in order to escape from prison, and then continued to cause desolation all over the place. Okay, since we put an armed guard in a detention room? In any case, this bad guy was, at least, vivid and very focused. It's much worse if you like that king of things. It seemed to me that the bad guys each time wiped out the same wound. I'm just glad I did not suck blood from my unfortunate victims. I'm going back to my summary. Basically, it's a horror movie disguised as an action movie.Dec 6,2006
