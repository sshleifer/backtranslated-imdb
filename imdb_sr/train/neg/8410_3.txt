This film is flashing and there is no soul. The actors put a lot of passion into the numbers, but these numbers often did not connect with the movie and felt like independent music videos. And no effort has been made to make the numbers sound like they are just in front of you, each sounds like coming from the studio, essentially sucking all the life out of the songs. On the stage all performances were boring and unrealized, especially Hudson, who essentially plays the same angry, "strong" (stubborn and selfish) black woman we had seen before. There was absolutely no depth of her character, nor of any other woman's traces. Although I think the film wants to believe that Hudson's character faces difficulties because of his weight, it's really her refusal to do what is best for the team that brought her in trouble, making the end of the movie totally meaningless. The Hadson Academy Award was a joke, there was no excuse. When she sang, she was emotionally emotionally (although she was often mistakenly set up, but that was the fault of the writer / director), but when she was acting, she did not do anything to fulfill the already subordinate figure. Eddie Murphi's character is the only one with a bow, and he did a good job, but he was not yet an Oscar. The only actor who really did something in the role was Danny Glover, who took a small, relatively unimportant character and did something really out of it. There is nothing here in which teeth could be drowned, without drama or heart, or even laughter. Setting up music numbers was so bad that the movie sometimes seemed to be mocking out instead of being one; the number when Hudson quarreled with other girls is so long that he could go for the Famili Gui skit more. The film has no idea what it is about, and in the last few minutes I felt insulted. It's a big, boring waste of time, and it's really the worst movie I've ever seen in '06, and none of the last year was really great.
