I rented this DVD for two reasons. The acting of big actors and directors, although Robert Altman can be hit or failed. In this case, it was a big mistake. Altman's attempt to create uncertainty fell on his key. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good movie like "Dead Again", I did not think he could contribute to such a party, and I hope he did not ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen into the path of most of the former Oscar winners. At a downward spiral that involves acting in money-feeding films like this one. Duvall was once a great actor in great films, although his best performance was not "Tender Mercies", but "The Great Santini". This film was really a big waste of time. I give him 2 out of 10.
