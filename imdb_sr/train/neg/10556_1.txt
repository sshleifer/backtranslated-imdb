This is a good example of how not to make a movie. There is very little meaningful dialogue, there is no context for events and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confused, obscure viewer; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's comment. abuse of children. This includes some footage of real, terrible acts of violence, including executions during the war. Although working in the context of the film, I think that the ideas behind the film could be presented without resorting to such extreme content. This film is absolutely not for bad or easily offended, and it should not be under any circumstances shown to minors. The peak is anti-climatic in relation to the content of the rest of the film. If you do not listen to a comment while it's happening, you'll probably miss it. The director commented on a video, "Sit and let him talk, without cuts". comment. Although this is not necessarily bad, the director ends up in large numbers and often spends several minutes at the same time complaining about his college, recording conditions, producers, bad movie and a dozen other things. Continuing negativity diminishes what is otherwise a key means of understanding the film. The film was filmed many years ago at 16mm and Super8 film for a period of four years at an extremely low budget. Therefore, image quality and sound are poor. It does not do bad film itself, but worsens a bad movie.
