Susan Swift is an attractive girl, a child of flowers that was transplanted until the 1980s (as young Susan Dei), but she does not have a vocal line for demanding dramatic leadership and tends to squeeze; however, she is pretty cute and has great eyes and a nice smile. In "The Coming" (as he was called when he was briefly released into theaters), Svift could be the reincarnation of Salem's witch. The sound is very low-budget and borrows from many other images that I gave up on it with about 15 minutes to leave. It starts strongly and has some campus appeal. Obviously there are more serious films dealing with Salem's artificial trials deserving to be seen over this; However, as movies go offshore, it's not too scary. Boston sites are definitely a plus, and support is fun. * 1/2 of ****
