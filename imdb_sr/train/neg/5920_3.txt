Unusual? An unusual environment for the American war film, New Zealand. An unusual theme, four sisters and their relationship with US soldiers, one carrying an illegitimate child of a dead son of a senator, another living with seven marines (one by one) before being killed since her return to a prisoner of war for New Zealand's husband. his unforgettable role as Rocka Graziano in the brilliant "Somebody Up There Loves Me". Unusual for two fine "Stars" Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons, leave so little on the movie. /> It's unusual that I could try to write a review of such a bad movie, let him miss you!
