"Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" was one of Charlie's films from 1915. While these groups of films are more suited than their 1914 colleagues, this appears to be slightly below average. A gag with a double vault and a quick happy ending that Charlie wakes from sleep in which he caresses the leading ladies' hair, just to stroke the head of the cloth he used as a quasi-pillow are both classic Chaplin moments. Ironically, both the beginning and the end. The middle is filled with battles with a rival dungeon and breaking the robbery of the bank to win the girl. Mop is probably the greatest physical background of this film, and Charlie uses it as an expert effect regardless of whether it is the intention of his character or not. Charlie's alter-ego patch seems to be doing things he would like, but he could not with his two hands. Interesting things, or it's better.
