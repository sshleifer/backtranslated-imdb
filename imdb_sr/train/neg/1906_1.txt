They played this on the Tvilight Zone marathon on July 4th, and this is, hands down, the worst episode of the Twilight Zone I've ever seen. It's completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone. Although the Tvilight Zone is a fairly uneven series and many episodes have become predictable, this was completely inaccurate. Compare this with legendary episodes such as "Stop in Villoughby" or "Midnight Sun", and you realize there is no comparison. Buster Keaton did what he could with such a terrible material, and frankly, it surprised me that someone from his historical comedy would have fallen to the level of this episode. Although he seemed to give him some effort, YOU HAVE to have the necessary money ... there is no other explanation.
