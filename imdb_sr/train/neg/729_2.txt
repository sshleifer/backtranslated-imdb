Before I started watching the show, I heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting. What a deception, the scripts are so stupid that I'm quite sure that the authors are the son and grandson of Scoobidoo writers. And what about SFX and colors, they are so extreme that it's painful to watch, the colors are not saturated, they are too saturated, as the scripts are overwritten and the display is overrated. This performance is like a bad pie in which a child would only put sugar and butter thinking that these ingredients are the best, they are enough. Unfortunately for this show, the only two ingredients of this show are finally a void and complete lack of credibility.
