- Let me start by saying that I realized that the Invasion of the Star of Creations should have been a parody of sci-fi films from the '50s. I understand that none of this is taken seriously. The problem I have is that none of it works. Parody should be ridiculous, and this is not. Not once did I smash a smile so much during the whole period of my performance. In principle, I have a lot of fun, but I could not find a belt of entertainment at the Invasion of Zvijezda anywhere. - I knew I was in trouble from the very beginning. The two "stars" make their appearance the screen one of the brightest imaginable imaginings - a water hose that they can not control and which both moisture them. These two are like Boveri Bois vannabes. Why would anyone want to write about the act and personality of Beaver Bois is outside of me. After less than a glorious start, the films continue to comic hunting sequences, dance Indians, herbal people, decoder rings and other variegated sloppy parts. It's all just a complete waste of time. - I bought this on a double DVD with the Invasion of bees. This film is the Oscars Award in comparison with the Invasion of the Star.
