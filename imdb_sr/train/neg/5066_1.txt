This is the worst performance. Buntch grew up playing kids without humor. Even Sesame Street is better humor and more affluent than a friend "Friends" can be the worst thing I've ever seen on TV, and I'm sitting in front of a tube watching Friends "simply disagrees with another, modern." Seinfeld's " the self-deception of the pomp that is the trademark of "Frasier." The characters in the "Friends" look designed to refuse them from dirt. The non-intelligent performance is completely without the edges of any kind, and the characters are cartoon caricature, and Writing is somora - although this is deliberate who writers may have to slave to be smaller than their abilities so as not to confuse loyal friends of "Friend".)
