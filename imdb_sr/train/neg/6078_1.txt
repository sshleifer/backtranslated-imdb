I rarely comment on movies, but I read other comments and I can not believe there are people who applaud this celluloid garbage. I know that there are certain people who have their own agenda, but let's take this into account; he behaved badly, shot badly, and the story felt while the director made up while walking together. I will not focus on the sexual aspect of a movie that involves little children because the filmmakers obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience would want them to do. All I can say is that it's a horrible movie, the content is bad and offensive, the production is amateur and I'm glad that today they could not make a film in this way legally today.
