I wanted to love this movie, it's SAV, blah blah blah ripoff, but I love these movies. If he did it well he had all the ingredients to be good, not brilliant, but a good movie .... unfortunately these ingredients have gone! The acting was terrible, and this was first seen when prisoners were introduced to one another with their captives (the hoods were removed), remarks and one liner are just horrible, I know, bad writing ... but this is more than that , there was bad writing combined with bad acting. Two of the prisoners were in a relationship, and they did not even think about it much further in the movie ..... I'm sorry, I even wonder why I'm bothered to review this movie at all. I WILL FINISH WITH PANELS, PANELS AND MORE TABS! DISAPPOINTING!
