This film shows Ben Chaplin as a boring bank employee in England who orders bride from Russia, receives mail from Nicole Kidman and gets more than he asked when, surprisingly, he is not what he looks like. The story is quite predictable, and Chaplin rely too much to become somewhat anonymous. Kidman is actually pretty good in this role, making her character only in this interesting movie. GRADE: C
