Simply put, this is the worst movie of the "Police Academy: Mission to Moscow" (if you liked this movie, you will probably like this movie). What did they mean? Some ideas should remain only that, the idea. The fact that this idea itself could record itself should be a criminal offense. What was so bad about it, I hear you ask. One word ... ALL. Price for rent: $ 4.50 Price in time for viewing: 89 minutes I want to refund money to both!
