I am the wife of a young pastor and we took some young people to see this film. Then we tried to explain to them for an hour. They did not get it and I did not enjoy it. It is based on a concept that has gone through all the three major religions of the world (the Bible code, the Torah codex and the Codex in the Qur'an) and is so questioned that it is ridiculous. This is not a step forward for Christians in art, it's a step forward for those who believe that we check our brain at the door.
