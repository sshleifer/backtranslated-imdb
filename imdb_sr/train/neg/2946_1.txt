I must say that in my childhood I am very proud of the many films I have rented. The exception is Theodore Rek. Talk about a movie about all the cheaters of all time in the biography of any actor. Can you imagine what Vhoopie's dismissed agent had to say to sign up on this shit, "Hei Vhoop, have you ever seen Dinosaurs show up, make a good movie out of it, and you can see Germany!" "After that, this agent had to do much to Star Vars. This film was so bad that I realized that Vhoopie had bought every copy of this film and that it was destroyed. I just wish she could do the same thing in my memory, because my sister still gives a shit to watch this movie. I mean, c'mon, I'll even admit that I watched Mr. Nanny and Kazzam in the cinemas (good reasons that I gave up Hulk Hogan and Shak for some time ), and yet this seems to me the worst of my childhood in the head, and the greatest regret for my life, and that was when is 16. I'm now 24 years old if you want to do mathematics. Whenever I think of my list of the worst movies for all time, I do not even mention this, because as a raped child, I try to push it what ever happened. Fucking Vhoopie, just be happy that people only recognize Eddie and Sister Act 2 as the worst of your luck.
