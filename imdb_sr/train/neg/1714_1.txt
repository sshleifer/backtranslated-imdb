Once again, the film classic has been rendered meaninglessly with predictably disastrous results. The title is fake, as well as everything about this movie. The period is not convincing, and the traces seem too young and too faint to be even criminals. Arthur Penne's film had a style, humor, view, and it was created by talented people. Even if the 1967 version did not exist, it would still be an unnecessary movie. The 1967 version has gone astray, presented the glamorous version of Bonnie and Clide, but it was exciting and innovative for 1967 and had some extraordinary performance that allowed you to take care. This remake from 1992 seems to be drawn from the original film, not from the truth as it is known, and the actors in this version are irresistible, irresistible and not interesting. Be sure to skip this and hope that the version for 2010 will be better. Could it be worse?
