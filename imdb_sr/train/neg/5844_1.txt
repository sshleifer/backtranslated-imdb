This movie is easily one of the worst I've ever seen. And I do not think that in a good way. We wanted to see a horrible horror / trilera, so we chose the one that looked dumbest in the store. Once, the film was all we expected. And more! (or say less?) Actors seem to read their lines from the poster behind the camera. The so-called special effects were created by placing red transparent plastic in front of the camera to create the impression we see through the eyes of the killer rats. A scenario? Even when I started working on the script ... And just when you thought it could not be worse, it turned out that the first part of the movie was an Oscar material compared to the ending. Take it from me, this movie is hilarious if you're in shitty movies of horror, but if you want a good movie, keep looking. This is not for you.
