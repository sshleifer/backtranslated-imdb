Regardless of the merits of the film, it has been poorly explored. As others have pointed out, the film shows locals in Iran who speak Arabic rather than Persian. That's enough to lose credibility for anyone who has the least knowledge of that area or country. The landscape can no longer be different from the real one. Other factual errors: It turned out that the train works in Afghanistan, while in Afghanistan there are no railways. The Turkish ambassador is wearing Fez (red hat), while Turkey is banned in Turkey long before the time in which the film was set. The daughter of the Turkish ambassador is actually dressed as an Indian, and Indian classical music plays in the background in many scenes. I suppose filmmakers wanted to show an exotic woman, and sari is what they decided to do exotic.
