I did not watch the whole movie. I could not watch the whole movie. I paused the DVD after I watched for half an hour and suggested that anyone was thinking to watch herself stopping before she took out a disc from the bag. I love mafia movies and tragic comics, but Corki Romano can only be described as a tragic attempt by mafia comedy. The problem is that Corky Romano is too busy to make the audience laugh, the act as if it's an excuse for Chris Kattana (Corki) moving from one scene to another. Corky himself is completely exaggerated and lacks subtlety or gullibility - all of his strange manners appear to be fictional - Chris Kattan obviously "acts" instead of taking over the role - he refuses you from the story. Each scene is extremely predictable, the 'comic event' that will appear on the set is obvious as soon as each scene is introduced. In comedies such as Mr. Bean, the disaster-induced catastrophes are funny, because you can sympathize with the motivation of characters and the initial event, and the situation in which the character ends is not telegraphic. Corky still gives a sense of intentionally fucking in a desperate attempt to smile from the audience. If Chris did not play such an extraterrestrial character (which has never really interacted with other characters in the film) and whose behavior is completely inexplicable (apart from trying to laugh), and the comedies were not as predictable and stereotyped - all scarves seemed too familiar) this movie could be visible. But it's not. Do not look at it.
