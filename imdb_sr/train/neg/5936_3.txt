This film was a catastrophe from the beginning to the end. Interspersed with the performances of "the next generation of wonderful losers" are interviews with Bon and The Edge, as well as the artists themselves. This leaves little time for the clips of Leonardo Cohen himself, who overcomes all the others in the film with his commanding but gentle presence, wisdom and humor. The rest are too busy trying to be canonized as St. John the Baptist. Leonard or some old-fashioned prophet. Many of the performances are forgetful of over-interpretations (especially Rufus & Martha Vainright) or mild disadvantages. Only Beth Orton and Anthony were standing at a distance from Leonard's own versions using little restrictions. The disturbing small pseudo-avant-garde gestures are spilled over the entire film, such as the omission of red spheres during many concerts and interviews, the shakiness of blurred cameras, the use of digital delays in some comments by Leonard Cohen (making it difficult to work) to hear what is said) and spooky , pretentious low throat under many segments of the interview (try to add gravitas?). For the right thing, look at the Songs from the Life of a Documentary Film produced by the BBC 1988.
