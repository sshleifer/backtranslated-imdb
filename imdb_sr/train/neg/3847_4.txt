There's a lot to do with Helen and none of this is good. Shellei Vinters and Debbie Reinolds play the mothers of the Leopold & Loeb pair, like killers moving from the middle of the west to Hollivood to escape from the past. Reynolds, star Jean Harlow, opens a children's dance studio, and Vinters is her pianist. Soon, Vinters (like Helen) are starting to break. Everything is going on very slowly and although there are moments of real creepiness (nasty phone calls, visit by Timothy Carey), the film is devoid of any real horror. Still, it's still a decent party. Running dives are fine and production values ​​are great. The recording of David Raskin's music, Lucien Ballard's cinema and nominees for Oscar, contribute strongly. With this, PLACE IN SUN and LOLITI on her loan, does anyone work as crazy as Vinters? Director: Curtis Harrington, a master of this kind, is not exactly an A-film exploitation. In addition to Carey, the unusual accompanying composition includes Dennis Veaver, Agnes Moorehead (as Aimee Semple McPherson as Evangelist), Ivette Vickers and Micheal MacLiammoir (Irish Orson Velles) as Hamilton Starr, conveniently named hammi.
