Who did they joke with? It was too much in this movie that was hard to digest. Since when Arjun (Ajai Devgan) unconsciously wants his father's death when he arrives in London with his uncle (played by Om Puri) just to leave him a few minutes later. The only problem with this theory is that anyone who has ever traveled through London Heathrow knows that it would be impossible to get such a fetus, and especially not an Indian. However, film problems do not end, there is a question of two main trails (Salman Khan and Ajai Devgan) who pass as rock stars at the edge of their dreams. I think we saw the success of Susan Boile (a UK woman who made her dreams 50 years later), but that was a rare case. It was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief, because I felt that the throwing of Salman and Ajay was only poorly conceived. You would never throw Madhuri Dikit and Sridevi playing the same roles so why would you force us to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men in their forties) desperately trying to keep their 20? Let's not even talk about the most lonely actress on the screen today, Asin. This is her second film (which I've seen) and she's just hopeless as an actress, so conscious of her looks that she just worries about looking good and a shot for the camera, instead of giving her a good acting performance. It's hard to believe she refused all these other movie roles to play in this hair, and then she was so soft as an actress, that she did not write anything at home. And on top of all this, the movie is just boring. There is nothing special about it, believe me, you will anticipate every clich√© thing that will happen in it.
