I rented it by mistake. I thought, after a brief overview of the box, that this is a story about time travel / science-fantasy story. Instead, it's a "Christian" story, and I suppose it's a typical example. If you are selling the message, you will probably overlook the inconvenience of the action / acting / etc., but it was pretty painful for me. I must admit that I do not mind copying history in this story. She describes the 1890s as a kind of paradise for family values ​​and morals (the character is horrified that 5% of marriages end with divorce!), But she overlooked the very inexorable sides of this "high moral" society (rigid racial, sexual and social discrimination was widespread, for example). And at one point the hero regrets the owner of a clothing store about things that sound not so much from the appeal of some Iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as published in the recent VJJ). I guess you'll like it if you like these things, and that's for sure ...
