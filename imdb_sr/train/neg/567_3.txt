This film is one of the most horrible films ever made. How can Jon Bon Jovi play in the movie? He's a singer, not an actor, what? Does he kill guitar vampires? And what about the terrible plot? Oh, God, this movie is really shit. In the end, the queen of the vampire, played by the eternal vampire Arli Jover (Blade) surrounded by an army of vampires, but when "fantastic" killers come, only 4 vampires remain !! What happened to the other 10-15 vampires? They ran out in the sun ??? And what about the "Big End" when Bon Jovi hits his head with a shotgun? It's really "NO". In "Buffy the Vampire Slaier" in 100 episodes no vampire with SHOTGUN was killed ??? This is really a lack of originality!
