Observing both the King of the Lions and the King of the Lions II and enjoyed both. I thought Lion King 1.5 was worth watching. What a disappointment! Disney must be desperate for the revenue. Especially now that they have lost a job with Picard. floor (or garbage cans) and paste them together to make a quick buckle. Unlike LK I and II, both had strong stories. This film has no story at all. While the characters and animation are always fun to watch, there's simply not enough movie material here. Some of the bits may have been good chargers of another disc on the original offer. Disney - The shame you put this garbage to make quick money! Next time take the time and effort and put our permanent job.
