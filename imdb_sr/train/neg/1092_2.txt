Well, I suppose there are good news about Villyam Vinckler's 2001 work, "Double Avenger," to succeed in uniting three Russa's mummers wonders - Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croik - in a single picture. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tour Satana and Babette Bardot were busy for a week when they recorded this thing ... or they managed to see a copy of the script in advance!) Poor news (although there are many)), that this film - if you can even call it directly recorded on video - complete malfunction, complete abortion, insolence, absolute horror, and indeed one of the worst pictures I've ever seen. Do not look for the weakest superhero ever shot! The plot here, like her, is dealing with Kitten, who gets super powers after breaking up a coccilla plant in South America to cure her breast cancer (oi), and later fought with three megalunged dancers in LA. the joke leaked completely (you should apologize), that ZERO is a real nudity in the movie in general (except for some old photos of Kitten at its peak), and that some shaving creams and papier-mache boulders are the total amount of a special currency. Meier girls here are a little long in the teeth / relaxed in the chest, to be kind, though Sheri Davn Thomas, like a bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!), Sucks, uh, to stand out. Why did I give this minor, unhappy, unsuccessful shame to movie 2 stars instead of 1? To be summarized: Joe Bob Briggs. His commentary in the special features of the DVD that I just watched is absolutely hilarious, especially when he draws about 100 synonyms for the word "breasts" from 1,000+ on his website "Canonical Hooters List". A man is a national treasure, and he manages to upgrade this disc of the disc to the status of the paddle!
