I've been watching horror films since my fifth year, starting with Childs Play. Since then I've seen good horror films and bad, but this is no doubt the DUMBEST movie I've ever seen! The actors did everything they could with the material. The action was just idiotic. Plus, that was all. I can handle a lot of blood, but that was funny! In one of the scenes, the character gets out of the back end and suffocates with his intestines! Plain Stupid! Another problem with this film is that it's boring and probably the slowest movie ever made. The place is just stupid. But again, it goes with the rest! In the end, when a girl escapes from a cannibal / ancestor, she gets help from an old woman. The old lady makes tea, but when she turns to talk to a girl, the girl attacks her! She turned into cannibals! Retarded movie.
