I came to the realization that I am watching Euro horror, especially movies made by cult luminary Jess Franco, that you can not expect a complicated plot. However, Franco went through this film; and despite the surreal atmosphere, and the reputation of the film as one of the best directors - Succubus is unfortunately an awful film. I must admit that I saw an American cut version that lasted about 76 minutes; but unless it was just the logic that was cut out, I'm sure a longer European version is equally boring. The action has something to do with a woman who is looting around; practice S & M and talk garbage, and everything is really boring. No worse, and sex is boring, and much of the time is triggered by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film; I had the difficulty ending it all the way. I have to say that the locations look good and Franco has done his superlative experience well; but the positive elements end up there. Jess Franco is definitely a talented director who made some classic trash films - but it looks like he made for money, and generally I recommend skipping him and seeing some of the more interesting directors.
