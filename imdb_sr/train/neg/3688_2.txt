As usual, I went to watch this movie for A.Rahman. Otherwise, the movie is not good. Raney wanted to finish the film career with this film to be successful. But luckily or unfortunately, the film was a failure. After that, he made a hit with Chandramukhi. I am impatiently waiting for his coming to Sivaji. I read a comment from another user about Rains. I found it interesting because it is also a user from TN. Rhine is an actor who works, I think, from my heart, not from my mind. He is not an actor of a method like Kamal Hasan. I think we need to appreciate Raney for his strong departure at his age. .....
