If there ever was a call to make a bad movie that would reflect how stupid mankind could become, this would take the reward. The plot revolves around biblical prophecies that lie in the hidden messages of the scriptures that encourage a group of thugs to seek complete control over the world. How stupid this writer believes people are actually? The act was bad at best. Casper Van Dien lost his talent in this film. Michael York's work was a fair match for the role, since he was the center of the film and did a good job. This plot was troubling and very disturbing. No gentle or immature mind should not see this film. This is the way in which basic goods and evil plots can be lost. There must have been something censored to get the PG-13 rating, but it was still terrible.
