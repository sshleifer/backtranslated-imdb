When the film was released, it was the biggest hit and soon became a blockbuster. But, frankly, the movie is a funny hour with a complication that magnifies the loser. The film has a Tag-line - "Preach Madhur, Tiaga Amara", which means Love's Sveet, but the sacrifice is immortal. In the film, the hero of the movie (Ganesh) sacrificed his love for the leading lady (Pooja Gandhi), although both of them liked! His justification is the meaning of the mark. This film has influenced many young broken hearts that this attitude "lost as a victim" was considered very imaginary and thus became a cult film, when they could continue with their lives. Ganesh's acting in the movie is amateur, Crass and Childishly stupid. He really looks funny in the song, (Onde Ondu Sari ...) when it should look completely modern and cool. His appearance also does not help the main role. His hairstyle is badly made in most parts of the film. POOJA GANDHI CANT. Her costumes are terrible in film and very inconsistent. A good part of the film is excellent cinema and brilliant music by Mano Murthi, which is actually a real saving film. Also, the songs of Jaiant Kaikini are very well written. Director Iograj Bhat should boast a picturesque presentation of the songs in a tasty manner. In any case, all in all except for the songs, the movie is very plain !!!!!!
