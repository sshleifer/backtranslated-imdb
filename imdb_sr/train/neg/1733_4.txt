SAPS ON THE SEA Image ratio: 1.37: 1 Sound format: Mono Black and white <br /> <br /> <br /> Coming from 'hornophobia', Ollie goes on a 'quiet' excursion by boat, but he and Stan mingle with a runaway convict (Richard Cramer). There is a chaos. This comedy of feature-length feature film - OK-entry, which, no matter what, separates it from the mere imitation of Laurel and Hardy's best work - marked the final collaboration between L & H and producer Hal Roach- a. Episodic in structure, the film culminates with an unforgettable trip to the ocean after the boys are captured as hostages of Criminal Cramer (shooting in a seagull to prove how heavy it is!). Gags are fine, but lacking inspiration, perhaps due to recruiting an actor who became director of Gordon Douglas, who was previously responsible for the first Ollie's solo effort in the era of sound (ZENOBIA, produced in 1939), but whose work here has no measure. of pzazz. Honestly, but nothing special. L & H's regular Charlie Hall and James Finlaison are visiting.
