I've never heard of this film, Adam Sandler, until I saw him on the blockbuster wall. Since I was admirer of Sandaler at that time, I rented him. Honestly, I could only watch about 30 minutes. thereof. It was scary. Do whatever it takes to keep this outside of the public. I sincerely hope that this film will soon go to the OOP, and I hope it remains!
