And I'm a big fan of the low-budget 80's horror films. This is not the worst, but it's not spectacular. The plot line is decent, but it's getting too long. You're through half the movie before you see any zombie action. Murders are not very creative and zombies are not too cunning. I really think this movie would have been better off leaving zombies and just getting into a mafia movie. It can be watched, but I think this movie has stolen at least an hour in my life. I'll give a movie credit for something original. If you really are in B movies of horror, it's worth watching, but if you're not, do not be tortured. But you do not have to tell me about it.
