This movie was the other day on TV, and I did not enjoy it at all. The first George from the jungle was a good comedy, but the sequel ... completely terrible. The new actor and actress who played the main roles was not good at all, they had to have an original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and the original actress (I forgot her name) so this film gets 0 of ten ratings, not a movie you can sit down watching and enjoying it, this is a movie that is turning to another channel or returning it to the store if you hire or buy it. It was good to see the Apea monkey back, but it was not so much fun first, he should have given them a new George as a Georges son who grew up, and still had Bradon and (what's her face) in the movie, it would be Bio I'm a little better than it was.
