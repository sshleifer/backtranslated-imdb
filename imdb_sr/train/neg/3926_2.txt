This Italian movie is essentially a skin soap. The VHS box said it was rated "R", but it was said on the tape itself that it was "Ks". This second has a lot more meaning because the end of the story is near the shock that was shocking. Even in the dark, you could see how the Dutch actress Marishka Detmers performed all the sexes on this guy - and, yes, you could see his penis in his mouth. I read somewhere that this is the first time that the "main actress" did something similar on the screen. She looked beautiful. Unfortunately, the movie is ugly ... it's a waste of time and it's certainly not recommended despite Detmers' appearance.
