This must have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I have to disagree with the other commentator, who said that the special effects are fine. I found them pretty bad: it was simply not realistic and they were so fake that they only distracted them from the real story. Perhaps the distraction is the reason I did not fully understand the story. Archaeologists are looking for a set. They do not try to say which set, or what is so special about it. It also makes it unclear why they are looking for him in California, while the introduction of the film takes place in ancient Egypt. If you are filming a movie that takes place in the desert, take the effort to go to the desert. The beginning - an ancient ceremony - seems to have been filmed in the studio instead of in the desert. The level of action was constant throughout the film, without rising and falling, without climax. The film looked brief, and this is certainly a professional for this movie.
