The French film "Ektension Du Domaine De La Lutte" by the director of the iconoclast film Philippe Harel is based on a book of the same name written by the controversial writer Michel Houellebeck. He also worked on the script of this film. This film was greeted as a dawn of fresh air for French cinema due to its not so common theme of sexual politics and its implications for two stupid IT workers. with his too obvious voice that takes us into the main character. This makes viewers feel like we're looking at a book that's readable. The basic premise of loneliness problems due to chronic sexual drought is fine, but the film comes out of the hands when the hero begins to talk about the crash he and his friend face. Attention: some women watchers can find not only a movie, but even his two heroes like the moronic misogynes.
