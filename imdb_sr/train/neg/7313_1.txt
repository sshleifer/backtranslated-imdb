I spent 5.75 to see this shitty film, so I just want to know a few things: What is the purpose of a dog to split in half at the beginning of the film, the disease has nothing to do How it was pulling Karen into the shed, but completely infecting her room, they could only lock it where it would be safer. > Why would the hermit run through the forest asking strangers to help him if he could only ask his cousin, Mrs. Pig to take him to the hospital? Why not? Is any of the characters trying to get into the city to get help when things get bad, are they all really lazy? Even if Paul threatened a rifle-type guy to oversee his wife, Paul could send Jeff or Bert back to the house to seek help. The girl she likes gets worse. What was the purpose of the box? Why did Jeff return to the cabin after he left when everyone else got infected, he was such a big asshole to go to the first place, would not he just come back home? If the police made all efforts to collect children and burn them to the fire pit, why they threw Paula halfway into the river, it was not necessary for that plot because the water had already been contaminated. Who makes lemonade from river water, this shit has dirt and bugs in it. Why two children did not just use tap water, it was contaminated, so the stupid ending would still work.
