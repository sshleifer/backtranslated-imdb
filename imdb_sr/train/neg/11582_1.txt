I'm glad that most other people do not think about this film here. There are several big names in the actors, but that's it. There is nothing else to recommend, except to note a few beautiful women that you can do in thousands of movies. It seems that all national critics love .... and most of the public can not stand it. Oklahoma accents are so fake that they are ridiculous, and southern racist stereotypes are right from Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing.
