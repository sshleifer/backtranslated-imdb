After Mr. Brosnan entertained him as a performance in "The Tailor of Panama" (which I evaluate 10/10 through the board: casting, acting, script, story, editing, tempo, music, emotional influence, etc.), I was delighted to expect this Movie. I was very disappointed. It's a script that does not read the movie, it's vulgar to be vulgar, bankrupt in every way that the "Tranny of Panama" is rich and satisfying. Blame it for writing and screening the screen. I was sitting in the theater waiting for "a good deal"; never came. I did not even laugh or cry, although a line of dialogue made me smile. Worth $ 7? Hard.
