When Stanvick's husband is killed on the eve of their wedding, she goes back to the hiking house, where she is removed from a cliff and rescues the rich lawyer Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her, which leads to a definite unilateral marriage, conducted on a huge estate in Chicago (which looks like it is surrounded by mountains!). Stanwick is tempted to break Cortez, but ultimately returns to Morgan, in a very dim and unconvincing resolution of the story. , but the scenario is curly and sometimes seems meaningless. I was so ready to enjoy this film, but I was finally disappointed. It's still worth watching for actors, and it's good for anyone who loves movies from the 1930s.
