This film was one of the worst I've ever seen. It is a combination of police drama and comedy about two Hollywood detectives, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, who are investigating the shooting at the hip hop club. The plot is fictitious and has too many side problems. Ford is in search of real estate on the side (Martin Landau is one of his clients), Hartnett runs a yoga school where he pulls chicks in his spare time, the two are under investigation of the interior, Ford fucking ex-girlfriend (Lena) Olin, an IA investigator and she's a psychic who has a radio show, the man who set himself up in the club is a dirty ex-policeman who killed Hartnet's father many years ago. Throwing in compulsory car runs and some lousy attempts of humor, which is the essence of this turkey.
