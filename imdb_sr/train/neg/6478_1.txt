I will say again: this film was totally chrome. Children will like it, but adults ... are suspicious. The whole thing was essentially a re-processing of the original, which was expected, since the first film was quite exploring the whole concept, but did they have to completely rewrite the whole movie? I mean, everything is from the Small Sirena. The worst part is Morgan's "Crazy Nurse Ursula" that appears out of nowhere and threatens Melody, which is ridiculous because Triton is there with his magical trident. Why did not Triton do anything about it? Because she complained that he did not do anything. I could go on, but I will not. The whole thing is a helpless attempt to collect more money in Mermaid and obviously it was thrown together without any thought, because they knew it would be sold. All in all, it's a terrible waste of time.
