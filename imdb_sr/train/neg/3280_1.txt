I will not go and give them my $ 10 and I went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best. At least my children enjoy it and can observe it without worrying about what they see. I have a teenager and she thinks the performances are funny and I'd rather watch the original. And she thinks that Jessica Simpson is a terrible little girl, in fact she thinks she looks more like a slut than her daughters. These shorts might not wear anything at all. And since the American pie had anything to do with the shame of Duchess because they put that nasty line there about sex with the car. That alone should have made a R film rating. The only good thing that can come out of this is a film about reunion with the original. Leave all hope. So, the people who went there and watched the movie will see how it should look
