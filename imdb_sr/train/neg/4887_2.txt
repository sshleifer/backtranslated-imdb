The first movie is pretty good. This is pretty bad. Recycles a lot of footage (including initial credits and ending title) from Criminalli Insane. The new recordings recorded on the video really seem to be badly performed. Scenes lack proper lighting, sound is sometimes almost silent, there are even video clips such as rolling pictures and so on. Ethel kills anyone who shares her living space, often for reasons that concern them with the food they want. At least it's just an addition to the DVD for the first, also includes a movie by the same director of Satan's Black Weddings. It's a shame that does not include movies about a dead sister.
