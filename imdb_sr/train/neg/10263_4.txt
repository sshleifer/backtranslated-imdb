Yes, The Southern Star has a pretty forgotten cover song that was sung by that heavy singer Matt Monro. It largely establishes a tone for this naphunian and quite annoying characteristic, an astounding mischief with George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple in search of a big diamond. Add Harry Andrevs (with a strange accent, no less) hunting for ostrich, tons of wildlife stock, and poorly composed and boring photo of Raoul Coutard, and end with a completely unstoppable riot through the jungle of Senegal.
