I grew up watching and I love LPG. I just recently finished watching the entire ST Voiager series on the DVD, which may have increased my sense of dislike for this episode, because the difference in style and the approach between the two shows could not have been much sharper. The idea may have been good if it was used as an opportunity to further expand Riker's character, which, as it is likely, should be treated at VOI. They could have memories that would be "new" to the audience, not just to show old shows again. The input and output passages between the "memories" and "present" in this episode begin as clich√©s in the beginning, and very quickly become unbearable as the tired pattern carries and continues. At least the worst episode ever.
