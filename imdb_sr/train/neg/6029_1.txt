If you are wondering where many theories of conspiracy and paranoid ideas about the UN, Israel and international relations come from, do not look for further. biblical passage. Instead, this film was made by Cloud Ten Pictures with a political and religious program. As a film, the end result sometimes appears as a clip from the television program (together with family prayers and a slight break through the windows of the church while playing harps). it's hard to believe, but many people believe in these things literally, as shown in the movie. And that might make the movie important. You will probably not find a more concise view of the bizarre views of a significant number of your fellow citizens. So if you see it, look at it as a social / cultural document. If you're media-wise at all, you do not need to be warned about the propaganda and manipulation attempts in the movie.
