Now I've written reviews for several MZ episodes, and this is among the worst. An interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned until the moment the credits turn. If you are looking at things that you would never entertain in real life ("let's check the basement!"), Then this is your show. Except it's not fun or fun - it's just boring. The extent of the virus has never been displayed. I can overlook the fact that it affects only men, because the situation that has arisen is very, very scary. But then things get worse while the daughter allows OBVISNO disrupted dad into the home, and eventually dies in his hands. A woman runs north and enters dozens of situations. Then there appears some sort of spirit or alien, or something that saves (things that make you go HUH?). Or something. Then it is collected for the heat. The end. Terrible. These directors are sending this trips.
