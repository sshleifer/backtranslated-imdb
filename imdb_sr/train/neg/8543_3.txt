I admit, I had to accelerate this badly downloaded DVD after 30 minutes - Nothing was happening, and everyone already described the "plot". But did anyone mention the introductory scene - a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and is stuffed on the grass in the yard! I guess the kid did it, he said it was never explained. Really trippy opening. I wish this was a better written or thought-out movie, because what we have left is if it's pretty stupid and a movie that does not make sense is not a "smart" movie. It's just a bad movie. I would like to see a clean version, and if there were missing images, I would like to see if this would help. Otherwise, this is an unusual little movie that is best if it is quickly transmitted!
