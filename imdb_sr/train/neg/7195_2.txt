Disney repeated it. The company that made "Mr Magoo" and "George of the Jungle" made another film that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based, and does not preserve any spirit of the original. "Inspector Gadget" was one of my favorite cartoons when I was young, and the film about him might have been a dream come true then. Now that this movie exists, I was very disappointed, even angry. First we have characters. The gadget itself has gadgets that made it so entertaining in the original cartoon (with well-done special effects that accompany them), and he even has the naivety of the original Gadget, but is now more competent than him is expected to resolve the crime while Penny and Brain only look. /> Penny has little work; while she played the main role in the cartoon, revealed the crime and stopped it, and occasionally she was also given MAD agents, now she is simply introduced, and then forgotten, although at least she sneaks in Clav's base. Clav is a movie version of Dr. Clava, who was a rather violent, rude man wearing metal gloves and sitting on a chair, a face hidden from view, caressing his cat and overseeing various crimes. Now he's just a man with a claw, without a mystery behind the character. Brain and crazy cat exist in the movie, but they are pretty insignificant. Even small pieces of cartoons have not been spared in this shelter. The famous term "Vovsers!" mysteriously changed to "Vovser", and Gadget's Gadgetmobile now looks different and talks. Everywhere there are even products. Why is "Yahoo!" is advertised on the character? Why does Gadgetmobile have buttons for M & M or Skittles? Cartoon lovers will hate him, others will probably find a movie below the vapor, and when everything is said and done, this film is another attempt. to make some quick money from another old show.
