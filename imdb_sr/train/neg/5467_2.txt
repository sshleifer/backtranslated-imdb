What to say about this movie. It's about a bunch of good students who have bad medication and turn into delinquent students selling more bad drugs to people. Two of these people have negative effects, while one turns into a vicious type of vendetta and his girlfriend raises a creature that grows in the basement of the school. It's about everything that exists and they stretch for 84 minutes. This film is pretty bad and should be locked forever. Although this is not fair, some people love Trombone movies and can watch them if they want. Troma films for me are the worst movies out there. I was just looking at this from morbid curiosity.
