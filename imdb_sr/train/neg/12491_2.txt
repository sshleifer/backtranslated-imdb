Hm. While enjoying the film that drives holes, you emphasize terrible acting, primitive (at best) special effects (which prompted me to watch this movie three times over the past six years), and Severed is among the worst ever seen. I'm never sure who the protagonists are, all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen on the scene of the murder on the dance floor. All in all, I do not like the movie, because it is only pleasant for the first 30 minutes, there is a confusion of confusing dialogue and images that fail to pass on a logical conclusion (which I can not remember anyway)).
