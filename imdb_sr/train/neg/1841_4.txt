This can be seen in many different ways. This movie is bullshit, its good or simply weird. The third probably best explains this film. It has strange topics and has a strange plot. So, who would, besides Christopher Valken, play in this regard no matter how bad, average, or how good he could be. I always liked Jack Black, so you know what you will get out of it, but that's not bad. Christopher Valken is always outside the wall. It's always pleasing to watch no matter how bad the movie is. Comedy is a little funny. It of course means that it has its moments (though very little), but it can be found a little above the top, which makes me feel like the film is desperate for laughter, but of course not in a good way. The director was also average. Barry Levinson is a little overstated director and he's really not doing a good job here. It seemed that this film had much more potential and did not do much to get it. Only very average and did not look like much effort was made in making the movie. Writing is the key to good comedy. Apparently this means writing has failed here. At best, it's below average. Since she had her moments, she was not too scary. It's never a good thing to say about a movie. If not for Christopher Valken and this is a stupid funny ending, I would give him a lower grade. He is always a true character in his films. Style is just a strange movie with strange characters that are not going anywhere. It's not terrible, but I would not recommend it because it's a forgotten movie.
