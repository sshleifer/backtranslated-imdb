This film is about British WWF prisoners who escaped from the camp in Germany. I find that "Wooden Horse" is disappointingly dull. The theme could be exciting, tense and adrenaline, but the "Wooden Horse" is told in a very simple way. It is a collection of simple and badly reported events, without suspense and excitement. The first half clearly shows how the prisoners of war dug up the tunnel, but the events are so obvious, with insufficient errors and close shave to point me to the edge. The other half of the film is even worse, they just move from one place to another without any cat and mouse crawling. And can the characters speak a bit less and have more action in the action movie! I'm disappointed with the "Wooden Horse", it lost the potential to be a great movie.
