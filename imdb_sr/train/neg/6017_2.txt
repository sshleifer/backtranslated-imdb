the only pleasant thing in this bumpy movie is to "hit" that location. What will be the landmark in Toronto for that US / international city. Who knew that the antichrist would be Russian? Obviously he can not be American because we need to save the day - oh Buck ... you will tell us the truth ... you will show us the light ... and the way out of the building those nasty antiquities get their way. Five golden raspberries. Vera is not enough to hope she will not make another of these kinds! We do not have to pray.
