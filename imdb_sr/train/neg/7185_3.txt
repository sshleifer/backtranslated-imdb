I was attracted to watching this movie for this action and my desire to watch horror. To my disappointment, this has turned into more than comedy than horror. The acting, dialogue and film flow were very bad. Much did not make sense. For example, there is a party of about 30 people and everyone is scared of one person despite being in a secret location and all are healthy young adults, and the guy who threatens them sounds exhausted. I was constantly thinking, maybe it was a parody of a second movie like Scari Movie, but they tried too hard to make it look awful - an accent on the attempt. Blood and blood are also badly made. I've seen Halloween costumes to look more convincing than this. A man with a cut off his head ... he looked clean - bones, flesh, blood, and even the head were missing. A powerful stroke with an ax on the corpse should turn into something ... it looked like the guy was rocking a bat instead of an ax. Detecting who the main criminal was supposed to be a craft, but contrary to other parts of the story. What happened in this guy's head to turn out like that? If there is a turn, you should at least supplement it by adding mystery and uncertainty.
