CK is incredibly slow, and I'm David Mamet's fan. The film follows a young filmmaker who makes a very Barbarella-esque film. After that, the film started to lose me. Deep and deep? Not really. The Dragonfly movie in the CC has a problem that there is no end. This is largely parallel with the CK, which also has no end (in my opinion). I had pretty big expectations that I just watched Tu Mama Tambien and some other great movies. I also enjoyed the performance of Jason Schwarzman. But it was not easy to get into the movie. If you do not deal with movies from the 60s or slow films that do not go anywhere, skip it. CK feels like a student film. If you want a recently published movie rental film about Donnie Darko, he will not sleep you.
