Good night, Mr. Tom begins in an incredibly extraordinary village in the south of England where the sun always shines. Before we find out how long it is, we hear the radio announcement of the Second World War. Soon the train that blows the clouds brings London refugee children and when the shy little William puts in a reluctant, rude old Tom (for whom you know he will have the heart of gold), our story begins. <br /> <br And what is the burden of sentimental chat. Actually, it's just a formula for a couple of strange couples. Do not write new stories? As I said, the village does not feel any time, and not much more in London, except for the strange old ambulance that rattles around. And there is certainly no indication of the horror of Blitz as the Londoners have conspicuously landed in airborne shelters. Even when the husband of a local teacher was declared missing, it is presumed that he was killed, later returned to life. I found 'Good night, Mr. Tom' cliché and obvious, and the emphasis of John Tava was invented by Ronnie Barker's image Two Ronnie with a straw in his mouth working his "countri bumpkin" accent. By the way, my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that I do not like and watching colleagues-imdb ​​reviewers. in a minority of one. <br /> <br />
