I was very disappointed that I saw this film at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. For 5 years I have been attending this festival and certainly I had the opportunity to see some bad films. However, 'First Bite' has reached a completely new film. Despite being recorded in beautiful locations, with occasional, extraordinary pursuit of phenomenal food, the film distorts too many complications and stiff characters while I practically did not beg for it to end. The main actor, David La Haie, in the entire film failed to show any character development, showing the pompous chef from start to finish. Additional sub-plans, such as eating disorders, have developed so badly and did not fit fully into any context that the film was displaying until that moment. The theme of mysticism was used as a bad attempt to hide a movie that does not achieve anything, does not go anywhere, and completely disappoints.
