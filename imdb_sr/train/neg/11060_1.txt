It could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of the most notorious American serial killers, but unfortunately it is not even approaching. Terrible editing, direction, bad behavior, name. This movie is literally about 10 minutes of action that stretched to 100. The only quality that can be used is Bruce Davidson as a father, but this is not enough to save this stinker. 1 of 10
