When this was published, I thought this was one of the finest films ever made. However, thanks to Martin Scorces and several other filmmakers like him, there was even a worse film, from language to language ... but this is a pretty brutal attack on the ears. Hey, I can take a lot of things, but this has become ridiculous. Only in the first six minutes, I heard half a dozen uses of the Lord's name in vain plus an unlimited number of f-words. I wonder how many people left the theater in 1990? I could not be the only one. It's not surprising that some of the actors were Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. From this film, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing Divine "Stonewall" Jackson in "The Gods and Generals". Lang's role is exactly the opposite: perhaps the worst stinking person in the movie and the character who falls in love with the transvestite until the end of the film. Depressing, gloomy, semi-pornographic, repulsive: these are just some of the adjectives used by people - even some liberal critics - in describing this story, which is even worse in a novel. Of course, some of the famous critics, all the extreme Libs, praised the film. However, they were the only ones. Most of the critics were outraged, as well as almost all the public. It's amazing that everyone can praise such dirt and trash. Believe me, in this film there are no good characters. This is an evil, sick movie: one of the worst in the "modern era". This is, unless you like to watch child abuse, drug abuse, prostitutes in teenage years, on and on - two straight hours nothing but the atrocities and only evil people. No thanks.
