The problem with family drama is that, outside TV channels on channels such as Lifetime, most people do not want to watch them. And those who are watching tend to be sensationalized about actual or current issues or questions in the news (or recent news). Movies that explain or explore human condition are not popular. Especially with a young audience that would be the base of fans of Miss Lohan or a younger audience who aspires to make movies not only popular, but also financially successful for studies. some of the features. Much blamed everything that Lohan's character played (car damage, drug use, etc.) about what her stepfather did to her. Although not unlikely, it is not expected that the audience swallowed. In addition, other aspects, such as giving a young Morman, oral sex, or that she would really be a good assistant veterinarian, who accidentally has something for her mother, etc., All of these elements did not really help this film together. This put more in the element of situational comedy that tried one of their "special dramatic episodes", and then for a fully realized, well-written film. When you watch a DVD and listen to a comment, especially for different alternative ends, you can really see all this is a sharp focus.
