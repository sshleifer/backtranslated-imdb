This is really the most horrible movie I've ever seen. I simply have no idea how one has the courage to publish this. Production standards are terrible. There is no conversion in cinema here. Working on the camera, scripting, acting and sound are incredibly rough. I think there is a plot, but it could have been done in 10 minutes, saving us time to watch it. Hysterical neurotic girls at the center of this section have no credibility. I would invite anyone to avoid spending any time or money on this address. It's really terrible. JDD - December 14, 2008
