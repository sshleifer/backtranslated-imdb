First seen on 8/26/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): It's terrible but sadistic (it makes sense) to show cousin Markuis De Sade performing the same sadistic actions and enjoying what his predecessor is supposed to be. This film Tobe Hooper really does not seem much different from his similar films in the style of Freddie Krueger with the same star (Freddie-Robert Englund) who plays a dual role (Marquis De Sade and his cousin). It seems that he also wants to really fall into Christianity, but then he loses it in the end to my sadness, but leaving an inconsistent feeling to the film. It could have been much worse if there were surpluses in sex and violence, but they are trying to keep it to a minimum despite some disgusting scenes. My last thought is why Hooper would want to make this movie. Obviously it took some time to really split, and then it must be advertised with Hupper's name in the title to hope that it will earn something on his behalf and up. Obviously, this did not work out.
