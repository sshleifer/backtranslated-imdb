There is only one problem with this webpage, you can not give a negative rating. In addition, a friend rated this as a D class movie. I say he was too good. A piece of wood could show more emotion that the actors in this film and the money used to produce this movie can be better used to launch a fire. It's absolutely terrible, 2 hours of life that anyone who endures this untouched bloodshed will never return. After I watched 5 minutes, I and the boys were wondering whether the immersion of massive heavy things would make this more entertaining. Half cartons and bottles of 151 later I finally found some of these G-grade classes that are fun. It's an insult to the whole planet that the director thought anyone could find something useful from this, he should go and buy a rope. And the actors in this movie, I hope you are well paid to be in this joke because I doubt that you will ever work again. In short, I approve 100,000 and 12 points of your license for everyone in this movie.
