A female vampire kills young women and colors with blood. She has an assistant who does not want to be a vampire, so she has to do what she orders or turn into a bloodsucker. After several murders, the assistant gets remorse and falls in love with the homeless. What can I say about this movie? If his pacing was overloaded, he had some strange sound effects (he never sounded so strange) and ambience (I came to the new jazz) and it seemed that the lights were not included in the set. It looks like a "authorial" horror movie with all the solubility inside. The action is completely stupid and as you can guess, a female vampire explains how to kill her even if I do not have to do it; Of course, crosses, light, garlic and sticks do not work. It's not even a funny bad movie. Perhaps with some friends and with lots of beer, it can not have its funny side (to be honest, it's funny for 10 to 15 minutes near the end of the movie). Do not be fooled by the Troma sticker, that's one bad movie they represent.
