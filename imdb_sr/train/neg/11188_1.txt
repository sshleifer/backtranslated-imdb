This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. Period. I actually paid Â£ 3.50 to watch this hot wood film. An incredibly boring, bad acting, horrible script, often incomprehensible and too many scenes that have no relevance to the whole movie (like when the priest Heath Ledger was caught on the wall by the spirit ... which point was the answer to the postcard ... ) I needed to get a medal for holding this movie for the entire duration. I'd rather hit hard in the crotch, but again through this movie. This should be thrown at the bottom of the 100th IMDb. I hope my vote of 1/10 will help in that.
