... for one of the worst Swedish movies ever ... forgive me for being boring. Firstly, I did not see the first (I'm bored of being my reason to watch others before the first one), I hope that the first one is better than this, it was filled with strange scenes and very strange changes in the script , for people who saw it and think it's 4/10 high (believe me that way), but I laughed a few times because it was so bizarre so bad and still laughed at thinking of the punk who came up with this idea, which is the following "Det sjunde inseglet II". Adjustments that are not based on a novel or book do not seem great for a lot, and this is the perfect example of one. I will be honest with you: I smiled a little, I got a couple of decent jokes and humorous humor. But do not buy it, rent it. Just let some other idiot do it or take it over. 4/10 This movie will be remembered and the director is probably already ridiculed ...
