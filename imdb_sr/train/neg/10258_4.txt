The Earth is destined to no longer be thanks to Father Pergada and a bunch of nuns. Christopher Lee (who in the meantime said he was drawn into the fact that his producers, who were told by many big actors in this), is the father of Pergados and the ability to perform his usual serious and frightening routine. Actors are not so bad, although most now withdraw from acting. The movie has terrible sound effects (which are mostly created by pressing keys on an old computer) and sometimes it's funny thinking - it shows the scene of the sky, for example, for what it feels like hours at the same time. Despite this, the story is quite humorous in a world that is doomed to failure and production is adequate. Interestingly, on one scene, Albert Band and wife Jackie appear; Meda Band; Writer Frank Rai Perilli and assistant Charles Band Bennah Burton. Despite my relentless nature, I sincerely wanted to see how it all unfolded and I liked it.
