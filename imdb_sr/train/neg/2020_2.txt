It looks like two films: one is a gloomy, pretentious, long saga about the actor who took over the part that plays; The other is a brilliant social commentary on a divorce in the Middle Ages, which a waitress takes over. Shelley Vinters is as beautiful as a waitress with another job on the side. She throws heavy hints on the need for connections, her massage certificate and the desire to embark on a modeling game. I like to see her shower with a kitchenette behind the curtain, and a horrible seductive dress from the hooked corn that reveals the navel. We know that they are the Oscar for emulating people with disabilities, carrying many prosthetics, or pretending to be crazy. Shakespearean scenes (that go ON and ON) are unpleasant and dated. Likewise, the 'crazy' scenes in which Tony seems disturbed as he listens to his voice. By the way, Anthony John is not aristocratic. In the early scene, he clearly shows that he used to be a choir boy. When quoting his father's advice, he gets into Cockney's emphasis.
