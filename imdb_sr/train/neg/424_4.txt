Yesterday was Planet Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the US and other countries, and I went to see the full-featured film version of Earth by DisneiNature. I suppose, as car manufacturers, Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet. Perhaps they really care about the planet, I do not know, but I do not think that it guarantees a special unit with the word "nature" in it. I know that my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse, and who am I to say my one-year-old personal feelings about Disney? Except for incredible cinema, it was typical Disney's disappointment for me. Previously half a dozen Disney movie trailers, full of Disney clich√©s ("circle of life", "falling in style"), pre-dramatic music, recycled images (Disnei claims "40% new recordings"). I even started to think that the narrative of James Earl Jones was a little bored. I love James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman who works every narrator of the Varner Brothers is starting to be spent. I really think that Disney bought some kind of a BBC nature photo that was so spectacularly made, they thought they would sell themselves if they wiggled some kind of orchestral music and recognizable sound bites on it. showing that predators are chasing and killing animal babies? There were half dozen of such scenes, along with the bleeding young men on the brink to get their throat out. I think Disney should understand that animals have a rich and interesting life outside the struggle for life and death that appeals to action-oriented teenagers that parents have drawn into this movie. I was also aware that Disney stopped talking about the man having anything to do with climate change. Are they so afraid of the small minorities of the deniers that they think it's still a controversial topic? I recommend skipping this and renting DVDs Blue Planet on Netflik. Nature films seem to have been best done by the British at the moment.
