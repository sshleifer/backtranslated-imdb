... and I saw some bad things. I have nothing to say about this movie. The acting is poor by Jennifer Tilly - as expected. Darryl Hannah is doing the job fine, but nothing similar is that she is not able to save this movie. she resorted to a "stupid triad of heroin" to create a fictitious uncertainty. If all Daril Hannah had to hide, she ran out in front of her pursuer. The hospital scene is absurd. Without revealing too much about what is going on for the plot, I think it would be difficult for a bloody tiny woman to carry a pregnant woman out of the hospital without noticing her. Lame. Very poor. Take a little and choose another movie.
