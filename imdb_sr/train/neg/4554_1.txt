Bingo is a game, shit is a name. Rarely when the screen is smashed by such a battered batch of half-conspiracy conspiracy theories, puritanic pruderi and nonsense of the new-age ones. The main story is set up at Viste, a Cristian resort in the Peruvian jungle. Do you think Tolkien Rivendell meets with Star Trek's Baku, where vague followers of the not so mysterious but surprisingly narrow-minded cult of love and peace live. Thanks to the terrible acting and sticky production design (visualization of mysterious "healing energy" of rainbow colors is particularly disgusting), Celestine Prophecy looks and feels like the episode of the "Twilight Zone of the 1980s". Factual errors in terms of church history and nomenclature abound. I can not believe Hector Elizondo agreed to be a part of this. Maybe it was made without his consent, Bovfinger style. May the Lord pity the director, the scriptwriter, the author of the novel, and the poor souls who see the film or read the book.
