An extremely slim 'plot' of Satanic rituals or some such mumbo-jumbo provides hockey excuse to connect large amounts of sexual scenes. True vanilla sex, masturbation, lesbianism, S & M, bestiality, incest and several other sexual proliferations get their time in the spotlight. The problem is that the story is so boring that rampant sexuality becomes pretty tense after some time. Who knew that a film with an intimate encounter with a goat / girl could be so damn boring? So now I have. Eie Candi: Venessa Hidalgo shows everything; Helga Line provides T & A (both shown fairly often); Women's viewers get an occasional penis. My Rating: D + Region 1 DVD Ektras: Trailers for Pick Up, Legend of Eight Samurai, No Answer to Phone, Prime Prime ", and" Sister Street Fighter "(also the same DVD contains another feature film" The Evil Eye ")
