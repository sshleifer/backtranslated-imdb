You know that you are in trouble when your introductory story basically tells who survives. From there everything goes downhill. Unnecessarily, the "Matrix" influenced the operation of the camera in time. It's meaningless video clips. The bangs of old marine captains and wacky seafarers. Ravers who become experienced fighters in a moment's eye. Even zombies are boring. I hoped at least "so bad a good" zombie movie, but this one is "so bad that those involved in its creation are forbidden to ever make a movie again." <br /> <br />
