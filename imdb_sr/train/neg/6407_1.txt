I watched this movie for 45 minutes and counted nine shoes. It was chip every five minutes. Seriously, this film is a living proof that the formula works. If she's not broken, she does not need a fix. A heroine still vulnerable in the streets, reinforced by a former master of martial arts with a heart of gold and a serial killer with 'problems'. Pure magic.
