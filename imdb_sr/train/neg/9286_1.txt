OK, first of all, let me say that I'm still impressed that the action is bullshit, but again its film that continues Steven Segal's film only without Steven Segal omg !!! /> Just random scenes with a low budget really do not make sense, I'm still stunned and I burned 90 mins on this shit! Just renting a Jackie Chan movie or go see VVF more and no and assumes that there is no complication !!! plz plz plz I'm avoiding !! btv best actor who plays there is Bill Goldberg and it says a lot !! And not he does not play well as I said plz to avoid him pfff I still can not believe I lost 90 min and spent 10 min more of this !! :)
