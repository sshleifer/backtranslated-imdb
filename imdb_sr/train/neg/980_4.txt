My first full Heston film. A movie that everyone already knows about the end. "Sci Fi Thriller". Factor of camping. Everything that goes with this movie was injected into my head when I rented it, and this morning when I watched it, it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood I was in (Not wanting to move. Put a player in, hide in the blankets ). And although I tried to figure out what was going to come to an end that would be destroyed forever by pop culture, it simply failed. Everything was everywhere, the connections did not have a spine, the end had no trace. Everything was kinda in some strange way, and the observer has no choice but to leave it partially stunned at the end of it, because even though we all know they are people, these are quick answers about why his people are seriously trying to enjoy the movie for any what besides the stupidity that was thrown out of the window.
