For my first taste of Shakespeare on the stage, I can not believe what these people did for a perfectly good game. - Let's start with a good deal, do not we? - Alan Rickman is fine, although some of his dialogue could have been delivered with more feelings. The rest of the actors had to pull it together. Romeo, Romeo, why are not you dead yet, Romeo? The actor, though not only completely wooden and non-expressive, could not read his lines at all. He was completely out of focus, he had the difficulty even to watch Julia in the face, and absolutely NO grace with the lines he got. Who throws him deserves to be punished. Julia is almost passable, but does not give depth to its character, and it seems completely out of touch with the show. Mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of character for the entirety of his dialogue. Benvolio was impotent and mercilessly exhausted with his lines. I was forced to withstand this semi-finished production of Romeo and Juliet. The act was stiff and the costumes were nothing less than disturbance. I've seen puppet shows in kindergarten with more effort invested in them. I just want to be able to give this movie a zero score.
