They show this on a network. It's bullshit. Although it's not as bad as the B-movies that show on the Sci-Fi network on Saturdays, but still a pretty big bunch of shit. The acting is passable. Action and writing are pretty substandard and pacing is completely slow. Every minute of the film feels like a part of a movie in which things wrap up before the points - not the climax of the film, the scandal. Also, large parts of the head look old for the age range they play. The whole thing is predictable, boring and does not deserve to be watched. Save time. It's not even worth the time to watch it for free.
