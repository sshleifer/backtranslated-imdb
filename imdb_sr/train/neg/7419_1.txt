This film was terrible and offensive to the viewer. Stupid script, bad casting, endless boredom. In the usual Hollywood tradition, the US government is shown as always evil. Communist sympathizers in Hollywood, most of whom are stupid as a stones box, like to imagine lonely crazy Eugene McCarthy as the leader of a huge movement. It is true that at that time he was considered a marginal figure who used legitimate concerns for Soviet communists for political gain. O yes, and the United States brought all those evil Nazis. Like Verner VonBraun, without whom we would not have a space program. He really liked to be an American and became a great advantage for the country. Still, the irony is that fools in Hollivood, uneducated people living fantasy, still believe that the government should run ALL and give us everything we want. And yet, it's the same government that is constantly portrayed as perfect evil in movies like this one.
