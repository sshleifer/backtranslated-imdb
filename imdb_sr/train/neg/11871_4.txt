The act of Gregory Peck was as great as it could have been expected, and the cinema was quite astonishing even when she played directly in a melodramatic "moment". But the rest of the movie was exaggerated and it's hard to watch it, for me anyway. I tried to like it, but I had to make progress in the last thirty minutes. I feel I lost a couple of good hours. If it had not been Gregory Peck, I would not last fifteen minutes. 4/10.
