Here is another blasphemous European story in which they destroy the religion of their country. (These atheistic filmmakers are implacable.) Here we see a brutal explosion of Catholics and / or Catholic clergy (and I am not a Catholic). This is probably because Catholics and religious beliefs generally seem to be extremely weak. One of the main characters is a priest and worries about food rather than anything else. He's only shown as an idiot. No wonder the secular academy loved this film. Also, there is some fraudulent fool who plays a man who has renounced his religion to marry one of the four daughters in the story. The daughters are replaced by a misleading student of "seminars" (who says he studied for six years, but says he is agnostic!). I mean, how much is this blasphemous movie? !!! It is a shame and another great example of the secular progressive fanatism of film business around the world (not just Hollivood).
