Steve McKueen has certainly many loyal fans. He certainly was a charismatic guy, one of the most screenwriting big screens ever. But even McKueen can not save this movie party, shot with what looks like a camera on a bouquet in real locations in St. Luis. robbery of the bank by another gang. There is more than a widespread suggestion that gay relationship takes place between Gay Steve and David Clark. He did not like the other members of the robbery, mainly because of his lack of a criminal biography. Steve also has a friend in Molly McCarthy and she is suspicious of something, especially when she starts to hang out with Crahan Denton and James Ducas, as well as Clarke, all pretty rough figures. That would surely cause my doubts. Great Bank Robbery St. Louis had two directors Charles Guggenheim and John Stike. Guggenheim mainly recorded documentaries, and Stik did nothing of all. One of these two jockeys concluded that Steve's performance was best served by the poor imitation of Marlon Brand. This film can fall as the worst ever made by Steve McKueen. I'm ready to bet that Dick Povell and Four Star Productions have already signed it for Vanted Dead or Alive, because I can not believe they would have seen this. Or you would see something. the public would overlook, apart from dressing for this party.
