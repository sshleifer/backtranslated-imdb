I've already seen bad films, but this time I take away the award "The Worst Movie of Life"! Anthony Hopkins must be completely mentally ill to make his name related to this - anywhere! I will never see a movie with him again in it, direct it, etc.! I can not believe other actors and actresses I liked (in this picture), who came down so low to be part of this disaster! There must be some great medicine there! If I had no shame to be part of such a film, it's beyond me! Save money on this! BIG FLOP from start to finish! Shame on you, Mr. Hopkins! Also, the shame on Christian Slater! I can not believe you put your reputation on this line!
