One newspaper and a news campaign suggested (as well as often) a far more cunning and violent piece than it appeared on the screens that were driving. Claude Brook is actually the Americanization of Claudia Brooke, who has worked for years in films. This is hard to find more; I would like to see it again to compare it with other international horrors that day, but I do not remember the particularly impressed time when. It seems to be a cropped version that came to US theaters and videos. But oh, this leaf ... is still the jewel of my later collection of horror.
