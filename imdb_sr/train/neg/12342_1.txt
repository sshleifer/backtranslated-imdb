Anyone who is familiar with my reviews on the Internet Movie Database will know that they can be occasional bastards. There are many movies that I do not like, for some unthinkable reason, I felt the need for a review. However, if someone is interested in knowing the name of the worst movie I've ever seen, do not look beyond Transylvania 6-5000. Without a doubt, this implies the title of all time. 1 horrible movie. I can not believe I did this from the start of this clowner to the end! It was clear that he should have grabbed the taste of Bruce Young Frankenstein's young man, but where the film was ridiculous of the horror movies, this was desperately strained and erroneously attempted to laugh from an unpleasantly poor material. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Beglee Jr look embarrassed to be here as a couple of journalists in today's Transylvania (perhaps they soon realized they were doomed to failure). During their researches, they appeared against all the main monsters of past favorite horrors, such as vampires, insects and mummies. be guided by their heart to free them from agony of boredom. Indicates a career overtime for everyone involved and proves that when a comedy breaks down in a big way, it results in terrible fun.
