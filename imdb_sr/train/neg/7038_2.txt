Ah, yes, eighties, the time of Reaganomics and Slia, Chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle that fell on the Communists. At that time, I could not believe that films such as RAMBA, MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR (And who can forget the funny RED DAVN?) Earn cash at the box office, they're turgid shaving fest action with a pretty off putting aggressive agenda and they were very bad. TROMA`S VAR is the language in the face that deals with these films, but you have to ask yourself if they really needed a hoax? Of course not . TROMA`S VAR lacks any sophistication - although it makes the point that there is no real difference between the right wing and the left wing - and sometimes it feels more like a z-class movie than sending. Maybe it's?
