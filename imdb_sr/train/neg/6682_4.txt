This comedy is not really funny. It's a romance that plays so much on stereotypes that it does not have any influence. It's a film from the caper so derived - that, even then - there's no bite. Liv is adequate. It's harder to say. However, what is nice is that the players are not familiar. At MGM, that would be Robert Montgomery. The wife of a businessman without time for anything but a job could have been countless actresses. Production values ​​are not terrible. However, there is no real impression. It is a generic cursor. And who wants it?
