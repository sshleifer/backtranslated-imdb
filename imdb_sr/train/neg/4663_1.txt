This movie was really bad. I love war movies and I can usually get out of most movies and find something I like, but this was not one of them. This film did not have the essence and intensity. I understand that the Finns fought and that's great, but the story is badly told. You do not have any real connection with any character and there is no real line of story that you can follow. You just go from one random scene to another, nothing flows to form a story that is trying to convey. If you want a war film that will keep you appealing, and astounding enough without battles, then I would suggest a "Pad" (a German movie of World War II). Or, if you prefer a great story and a lot of action then I would suggest to you the "Brotherhood of War" (Korean War / Korean film). These two films will not let you down as a winter war.
