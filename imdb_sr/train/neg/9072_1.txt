This film has no plot and no focus. Yes, it should be a slap-stick, stupid comedy, but the screenwriters have no idea what the film is about. Even the title does not go with the movie. It should have been called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Vin" or something like that. The characters are not developed and nobody cares for them! The girl's girlfriend (with a show from the '70s) was the only person to watch. She was hilarious and stole every scene she was in. Others have to make sure that their college diplomas are in work because they will need a different acting career.
