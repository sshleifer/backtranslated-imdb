It seems that Salvatores could not decide what to do with this movie: some of them are a very bad thriller (and I say very, very weak), some of them are an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things are tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case, the movie can not keep things together, due to bad, superficial writing, bad acting and too dark, too boring cinema. I would say that Salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other environments, where he could freely watch characters without thinking of conspiracy. All in all, B-movie, hardly worth your money ... Vote: 4/10
