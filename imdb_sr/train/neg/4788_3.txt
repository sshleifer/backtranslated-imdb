In the third appearance of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie continue to jump Tall Man, with the help of the nine-year-old lucky trigger, Black G.I. Jane and the spirit of Mike's late brother (he died in the original fantasy). Number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel, since the up and black comedy is much less inspired and exciting than in Phantasm II. I had the feeling that stress was invested only on Reggie's incompetence as a lover and his talent as a comedian. Humor in the previous film was much more coarse and oppressive, which is better suited to this story. Likewise, the settings are not so silly here, plus the constant presence of the High Man (Agnus Schrim) is not so obvious? It's still a lot worse, but not half as satisfactory this time. Otherwise, beware of serious versions because it shows the most exciting killings outside the screen. The complete series Phantasm is a lifelong accomplishment by Don Coscarellio, who has written and directed four episodes so far, and he is in production. The first is a semi-cult classic, the second is a horror-feast of mountains and violence, and the rest can easily be skipped. ABOUT. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, although James LeGros in Phantasm II much better presented his character.
