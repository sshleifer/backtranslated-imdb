The first time I saw this movie when I was about 10 years old. My mother bought it at our local Kmart because she was on sale for $ 5 on VHS. She thought it would be a beautiful Christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch. This film scared me. You might wonder, how would a movie about Santa Claus scare somebody? The film's action spin around Satan, sending one of his servants, Pitch, to the ground in an attempt to kill Santa Claus and destroy Christmas. Thus, Satan sends a demon from hell to kill Santa Claus. Pitch catches Santa for Christmas Eve in an attempt to capture him on earth when the sun goes out on Christmas, because if Santa does not return to his home in the universe, he turns into dust. Do not misunderstand me, the movie is fun and quite fun, however, the image of demons and devils that dance in the depths of hell (what happens at the beginning of the movie) is simply creepy.
