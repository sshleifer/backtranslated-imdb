ALIEN LOVE (As this film is known in Britain) is a very strange film. I do not think it's a movie about the esoteric art house in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman, I think it's TVM with cursing, sex, some really good T & A, bad scenario and a very retro feel. You can imagine someone like John Hughes who was directing these ten years before, although he would, of course, cut off T & A. Returning to a bad script, one of the problems is that few characters have any kind of motivation, especially Amanda. Why does Connie take the bar? To meet an alien? Do you see what I mean about the retro? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT and many other films from the mid-1980s had this kind of complication with the most defined and more convincing than what is seen here. The story continues to follow a badly defined, unconvincing and illogical path. He said I found ALIEN LOVE visible, not just to show T & A. As sci-fi sex comedy is much better than FLESH GORDON and EARTH GIRLS EASI \ t
