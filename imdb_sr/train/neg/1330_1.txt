There is a reason why Jai Leno will not recognize this film. She is constantly classified in one of the worst films of all time. The acting is terrible, the script lacks direction and the director himself does not seem certain how to take this film. "Friendship film," "action / comedy," "mystery". It seems to be half way, giving up, and just going for a ride. Jai Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated performers. It's a shame that they wasted their time and gifts on this mess of film. Jai Leno and Pat Morita before they joined this, spent years breaking their crafts in the Hollywood Circle. Mr. Morita was already a true star, acting steadily since the mid-sixties as the stars of such cult classic TV and film classics as "Happi Dais" and sad but kind "Mr. And I won the hearts of America with their roles in a powerful film," Midvai " "Karate Kid," and many others. Mr. Leno can be seen on TV shows from the mid-1970s and was a top performer in American comedic clubs, which can be seen on countless TV shows and mainstream films. to be seen with this stupidity.
