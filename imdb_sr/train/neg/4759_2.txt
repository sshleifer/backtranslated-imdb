In the name of Pinter, each knee will bow - especially after his speech on the acceptance of the Nobel Prize for Literature did more than reappear anti-Amaricism in the sixth form. But this is worse; not only is it a tur-de-force of squalor, an excellent example of how to get out of the coast in your decade's reputation, but also a slaughterhouse of top quality. The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of this kind. Yes, it was theater ready-made, and it's easy to see how the central device for working on the screen will work better on the scene than on the screen, but it still works perfectly. This is loyalty to Michael Caine, but let's face it, Caine is not Olivier. Not only can he not fulfill Larry's shoes, he could not even fill the slippers in the bathroom. Properly named Caine is, after all, an extremely average actor, whose only real reference, as well as many British actors, is their longevity in business. He was a good Harry Palmer, great at Get Carter, but that's a lot, comrade! Give this a very wide bed and stick to the premium original. This is more half-pinter.
