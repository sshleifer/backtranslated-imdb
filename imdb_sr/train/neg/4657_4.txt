Remake (and sequels) were the basic means of cinema from the beginning of the media. Nevertheless, it is quite a hit or a failure. If you take what's good from the original and upgrade it and update the key features of the current standards, you can have success. Keep in mind that such films as The Thief of Baghdad (1924/1940) or KING KONG (1933/2005) have succeeded in their attempts. Others like KING KONG (1976) are decaying, poorly. SHORT SESSION (1945) is a template for this film. It's as perfect as it could be on such a topic and we are evaluating IMDb ********** Ten. The story is simple, Love, innocently found accidentally and tragically lost. Why, it happened only for two (2) directors involved at the wrong time. They are presented in a convincing and sensitive way by TREVOR HOVARD and CECILIA JOHNSON. Neither are conventional leading Star material, but quality character actors. See the movie for details. What has gone wrong up now? Film T.V., who has practically rearranged the scene for the scene with the names of actors RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN, should have at least IMDb ****** Sik. Both actors, although they appear to be uninterested, just appear to break through their time and pick up their checks. Neither are involved with their characters or with each other. You do not believe that they are in love or when they are finally separated any great loss for any of them. It should not be and therefore fails in its intention. Sometimes it's better to just leave things alone.
