Thank you to the BBC for this show. Sometimes I suffered from inferiority complexes, I hated going out of the house, talking to new people and having the feeling that people hated me. However, after watching one episode of 4 Non Blondes my happiness began to change. After episode 2, I began to apply for new jobs, wearing fashion clothes and actually I felt talented. When the series ended, I managed the sales department at work, I pounded with a lot of women and I often won the karaoke competition. If you ever have a confidence crisis and do not know where to turn, then go to Poundland and pick up a DVD that is only 99p.
