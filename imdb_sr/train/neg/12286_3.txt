The summary of my cable TV guide made it sound much more interesting than it actually is. "Slaughterhouse Rock" is by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen, the title that was previously held by "Urban Legends: Final Cut". From his introductory scene, I could say that it would be very bad, but it was so boring that I did not care. This film contains a funny acting, especially a guy who is tormented in his dreams, incredible as in incredible complications, and some of the most beautiful songs I've heard, and I live in a period when he loves Britney Spears and Nsinc dominates the airwaves. The biggest problem with "Slaughter Rock" is that it's not funny. One movie would be boring and boring and therefore NOT awesome because it would try to spice some funny single-layer films here and there, but not. We had a tortured friend who was tortured by Gui and tried to be ridiculous, but he found it uncomfortable. And please, tell me, who in this crazy world is crazy and self-sufficient enough to visit a dreadful prison in the middle of the night? No one! If you want to make a horror movie, at least make it convincing. This is all except.
