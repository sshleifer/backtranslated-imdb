The book is so good that at least the opening of this film for television will move you, but then, as it gets more and more away from the book, taking all religion and love and mathematics and putting cotton clips, it becomes boring. Nevertheless, from the comments I have heard, people who have not read the book tend to love it, and if it leads even to the child to read Vrinkle and Time, it will serve their purpose. The most adverse change is that Happy Medium becomes a clone of Mari Poppins' uncle Albert (I like to laugh). Nothing is so stiff as to cause characters on the screen laughing ridiculously in things that are completely optional.
