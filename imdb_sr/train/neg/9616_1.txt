First, I doubted watching DVD boxes and reading it saying that it was a bunch of teenagers who gather on the lake where they will find them or something like that. Any film that has a presumption like this failed, even as a slasher movie, except on the first Friday of 13th. I wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times I just thought it had to be a little better . It's not. I usually think that every movie has something you can take from it. This is nothing. Do yourself a favor and find something constructive in 80 minutes. Like, give yourself paperwork or eat dirt.
