This film was a critical and fiasco boxer in 1957. It was based on a novel that later turned into a show - which collapsed on Broadway. The story is about some naval officers on vacation in San Francisco during the Second World War. They have 4 days of rest at the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The film is a lot of meandering and none of the characters seem real. Cari Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama - but here he plays some sort of dealer on wheels and he does not do it. Tony Curtis or James Garner would be a better choice. Audrey Hepburn was originally ready to play versus Grant, but she had other responsibilities - so she entered Suzy Parker. I think she did a good job, considering all the pressures she was exposed to. Grant couple with Jaine Mansfield in a few short scenes - did not really work. Studio was trying to give her a certain class acting Grant - but the character did not have any substance.
