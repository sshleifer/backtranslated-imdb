The acting in the film is really well made honestly, but the film is so slow and so boring, as soon as everyone is interested, everything slows down. I'm glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a great job, and other actors as I mentioned, but the man ... this is one of the worst drawings I've ever seen. Perhaps the movie in a short film would be good, but in addition, avoid it. This movie has so many fillings that it makes the Tvinkie cake jealous. Never, never, I did not go out on movies, but watching this at home with my family, I came out. Yes, it was so boring. Apparently, my commentary does not have enough lines to set up, so here's a little more filling. I guess I was inspired by the movie I just watched.
