About 4 years ago, this movie I liked. I would watch him again and again and again. But now ... I do not know. Actually, I think this film would be great for the Mystery Science Theater 3000. It has a bunch of heavy-handed actors (Macaulai Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stevart, Vhoopi Goldberg), and a rather poor complication. My favorite part is when Culkin drives his bike and hits the gang and a gang member says, "Hey, Tyler, where are you going? MOON?" Also take care of the classic line, "Do you have a feeling in your fingers?" On the other hand, it is better than the "Good Son."
