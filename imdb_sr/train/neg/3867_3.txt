Oh-the-well-known comic story about the low-quality handsome guy Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up in bed with Becka (Julia Stiles) on the night of his mom's evening, an attractive blond he met just before the night. After lying to his fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair), he is forced to say more and more lies to cover his tracks. I'm sure most of us have witnessed such a story at least once ... on a movie or on TV. The movie is a formulaic and EXTREMELY predictable, with the ending you can see the arrival of a mile away. At least the cast gives some interest and keeps it vatchable. Lee is at the very top, and Stiles is very entertaining in a relaxed comedy role that is different from the very serious roles he usually plays. Becky is a free spirit that seems to change the job as often as other people are changing their clothes. But you know, this is not very well written. At least one question remained unanswered: because what exactly is Rai (Lochlin Munro), Becky's brutal ex-boyfriend, investigated by IA? And I did not like the noise figure to me. (David Koechner), Paul's stepfather; he's a super-nasty moron who started to live so quickly. I prayed that somebody hit him. Add one more debt: a free, uncredited comedy comedy / actor Larry Miller, once again playing grouch (in this case, it is little justified - his character is an ultra-conservative minister). It's not at all good at all, but as usual for me, I give him three out of ten based on only the efforts of the actors.
