I discovered that this is a good movie that will take your time, but not by any chance of any historical value. Cleopatra's reminder reminded me of a cheap soap opera. The ingestion of the facts is ... funny! She was born while feeding her people!?!? Oh please ... The pregnant queen of Egypt (especially these) would not be trying to go from one room to another for that reason! They tried to force her to be a saint for God's sake! And the way they tried to justify her murder of her sister ... without description. Cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time. Her decisions were based on everything except her feelings and morality. She did everything for just two reasons: Power and self-sustainment! She was born in a family where she had to fight for survival, something she did well. Everything that stood in her path was either killed (her brothers and sisters) or deceived (Ceasar and Mark Anthony). \ T So, it was her end ...
