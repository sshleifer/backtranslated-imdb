This movie is horrible. Each line was stolen from 8MM (bar Italian version). If you like trash ... a real trash, try; but beware: this is not "as bad as it is good" type of film. In its cheapness, it can really look like a porn, but, believe me, if you are looking for "snuff", s & m, hardcore, softcore ... or even an ordinary erotic thriller, find something else in the store! I am telling you this because absolutely insincere and unbelievable shooting, acting, plotting, dialogues (the only good lines, as I said earlier, are those that were stolen from 8MM Joel Schumacher!) For a few minutes and the "happy end" is absolutely disgusting! I will give her one star: half for a sudden background image, after the monologue "eye of the victim" (stolen from 8:00) and sex for the sexy bodies of my mother and daughter (who did not manage to keep me awake while I watch this party!)
