As far as HEIST films are concerned, this is quite weak. Continuity is pretty bad, there is not enough continuity of character to really feel like you understand one of the characters. Peter Falk is great, and he is one of the reasons why he is worth watching. Falk has some great lines, like "coming back immediately, buying for some awards" or something like that ... there are some nice scenes, although they are entirely thanks to the efforts of the actors. Direction, scripts, and editing are pretty bad.
