the film was sucked, it was not funny, it was not exciting. They tried to do it so badly that it would be good, but they failed. and thinking that this movie is cool, in addition to the hypers, the only reason this film has succeeded ... The fact that at this moment 50% voted for 10 out of 10 for this film, I find it rather troubling , whether the film has become public or that this voice is unrealistic, which can have many causes, and needs to be addressed. in any case, it's a film that is less than average and has flourished through mouth-to-mouth advertising. His success can only be described as a marketing wonder.
