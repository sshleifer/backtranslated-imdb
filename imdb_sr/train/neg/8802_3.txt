Look, I loved PROPER Anchorman movie, but this was pretty bad. The bad kind of reason you want to be able to take that time back into your life, the kind of bad that you think "what on earth thought this was the first to take," the kind of bad you wanted you took 50 more minutes when you entered the kitchen to take a snack during a movie, the kind of bad that makes the leper look fun, what a bad thing that you think you want to rent a movie Pauli Shore ... Seriously, I can not explain how badly this was. Saying that .... there were some semi-funny laughs, but they are all SO HELL than Anchorman. Of course, they tried to have fun and fun, but the whole subplot that remained outside Anchorman that made it here was really omitted for good reason ... it was not a bit good. Do yourself a favor (or in the US, a service), and do not watch this DVD ... he will blur a good movie that is Anchorman and you do not want to do it. Okay ... now I'm fine.
