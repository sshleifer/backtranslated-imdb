This is the worst documentary from Canada! I'm glad the guys did not record another movie. All they want to do is make a movie and it does not have to be the one who wrote it. They constantly change the script so they fit into the person they throw. I could not get out of the theater fast enough when I saw him at the Toronto Film Festival. Please, never watch this movie.
