Unless the title should be a kind of spoiler for the transformation of a woman (the evil that destroys it for us). Anicase, if this film was not Made-for-TV, it should have been, it's so incredibly low-budget, unproven, subordinate and hit every cliche of the 70's except the disc. No one is cute, and you could be careless about what happens to anyone in this. Extremely forgetful, apart from bad, bad performances.
