A blood donkey is leading a dance - what a ridiculous title it is, so it's completely wrong. It's not surprising that filmmakers tried to deceive us, because this is a horrible movie. The story basically involves the mystery of murder in a castle on a remote island. Very little is happening in this movie. And when something awakens an observer from his dumbness, this is an inevitable comedy in the form of a terrible dialogue of a hopeless group of vocal artists. These guys are so bad that actors who say voices look like a group of idiots on treatment. It's really hard to figure out how bad the act is when you call it deeply. However, artists can not be blamed for the script. It's a tragedy. Inadvertently funny at best, pathetic in the worst case. The story is, at the very least, uneven. Female characters are especially idiotic; People are either creepy or fatigued. The whole enterprise stinks to the pure exploitation of the audience. It does not give away what it promises, and even when the killings (finally) begin to occur, they all happen outside the screen. All we get is a few half-cuts in the head. Several people have said that this movie is giallo. I can not agree less with this opinion. Anyone who enjoys Italian thrillers should give this film a broad connection, because there is nothing exciting about it. It's basically a soft porn movie with a terrible angle. But it's not even erotic. I can not recommend this to anyone.
