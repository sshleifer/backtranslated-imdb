I have a high level of tolerance for shit, so I was pleased with it. It did not disappoint. It seems to be based on the classic Carmilla of Sheridan Le Fan, and is followed by a father and a daughter who is hunting a vampire who, luckily, travels with them. Then we have Santa (or the general, how he likes to call him here) that runs through random zombies. Did I mention that a zombie broke out? The dead are returning to life, but nobody seems too worried. We have zombies of construction workers, military zombies, and even sv. Apparently, Santa Claus is looking for her daughter who has been turned into a vampire. Wait, there's no vampire, the girl is in the nonsense and Carmilla is her sister, or is she? The zombies are back and Santa is crazy. Lesbian sex, I love vampires and I like zombies, but I especially like lesbian sex. Nothing like a simulated cunninghouse to make the juices run. When will we see vampires fighting zombies? Is she a vampire or is she crazy? Or both? Is Carmilla a sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse? More cunningus, you will never have enough cunningus. Here's the wall zombies. Chainsav time !! More lesbian sex then kill zombies and eat vampires. I suppose the zombies have won, or are they? Plot? Who needs a plot when you have lesbian vampires and school zombies? And cunning?
