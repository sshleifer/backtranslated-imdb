This starts bad, what happens to the three women who behave as likeable heroes of secondary schools who sit around giggling with your gin, endless cigarettes and caramel chocolate treat for those who speak the best 'human' story, and then it gets worse - = - spoiler alert = - what Andy's hard to figure that falls on a young organist who was her student when he was 14 years old (she is director of the English school, believe it or not), only to be destroyed due to their bitches -From 'hellish' girls'. ..and then from there, it is in fact unacceptable trap: forgives his 'friend' and has a love child orguljaƒça and three women end up as it began, drinking more gin and blowing up cigarettes bla bla bla. Andy's hard character throws caramel chocolate on the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.
