The only reason I remember is that it was shown a week after the broadcast of the great KUATERMASS series Nigel Kneale. Trailers emphasized that the main character had a disheveled hand who hoped to be like Victor Caroon from the KUATERMASS EXPERIMENT lurking in the streets of London. There is no luck because the game in the race is just a rather roguish trilogy with a trick that a physical disability hero was trying to get to the bottom of the investigation of corrupt horse racing. I suppose that if you are a fan of Dick Francis you can enjoy it, but put it in the context of the late 70's when SVEENEI just finished and PROFESSIONALS are still being produced, there is something missing from the RACING GAME game. One trailer was fitted with a car that drove the other way in a motor mode, if it was a trailer for SVEENEI, you will see Jack Regan take the car and beat the recognition of the slug which made a mild, and the PROFESSIONALS would take the car and take the terrorists inside. I think it's summed up what's wrong with this series
