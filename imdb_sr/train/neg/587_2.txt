This film bravely, if bizarrely, boldly, albeit bizarrely, differs from documentary films "the human body's miracle," which has decided to provoke the disgrace of the viewer. In one scene, the camera closes to a giant 50-foot grain when a teenager pushes out the manure and liquid from it. In the second, the camera is semi-concealed in the swamp from half digested food and gastric acid as parts of salad from paste from esophagus and enter the goo. In the final tour, the camera leads the viewer to a terrific ride through the forest ... hairy hair under the armpit. Unfortunately, I do not do any of this. Check out this movie, if you must, but: take your bag and do not have a salad before.
