To avoid mixing with "Alligator" Levis Teague (1980), which is actually a great movie, this "Il Fiume Del Grande Caimano" is ending exhaustively with the exotic trilogy of Sergio Martino in the late seventies (including fairly "L" Isola degli uomini pesce " not so good "La Montagna part of the cannibale") Scanning the action of the Jigsaw, the script fails to make any uncertainty. The creature is absurd and its victims are simply ignored. The tremendous melody of Stelvia Cipriania poorly illustrates the adventures of these funny tourists one from the very beginning as an obvious reptile's meal. There is no excitement from that, but crazy! And we could think that this poor film was quite funny that the dialogues and the appearance of the native were not so obviously inspired by pure racism. sour feelings that testify to such a patronizing attitude. We could say badly made films and bad currencies, but not such a mentality.
