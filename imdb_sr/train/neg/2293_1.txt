If this series should have been an improvement compared to Batman - Animated Series, I, firstly, think that this has failed. The drawing of a character is bad ... (The woman, for example, looks terrible ...) But what really aroused me was that Batman seemed like some type of weakness who simply can not take care of himself in the fight without the help two, even three assistants. I mean, he's Batman, for God's sake! I know the comics, I know that Nightving and Batgirl should be Batman's allies except Robin, but still ... making Batman say he needs help from them ... What, he can not withstand a few strokes? At BTAS, he could face a dozen adversaries without any problems ... He's old? Come on ... And something else: I really do not think Batman would allow a kid such as Tim Drake to enter the battle soon, without years of hard training. First, it is irresponsible (and Batman is everything, but irresponsible), and second, it's not what happened in comics if we want to stay faithful. with his animation, stories and characters ... It was really a legend about Batman. The Nev Adventures series turned the legend into another Batman movie.
