Rebar is an astronaut who goes to the world's first space mission to Saturn, but of course the film about horror films is getting ugly and he returns to earth as the only survivor. Affected by some bizarre condition that causes it to slowly dissolve and lose its mind, unless it regularly consumes human flesh, it kills what is clearly the only nurse in the hospital and flees to the neighboring city to arrest more victims. /> I loved the premise and the monsters and the above effects are actually quite good, but the space scenes are just glued together from stock NASA recordings and the hospital looks weird like a warehouse. Very bad scripts, little development of character and generally bad behavior prevent them from rising above anything else, not just a central slasher movie with a novel that has a live candle as a killer, and more or less only has its effects to keep your interest . 4 out of 10, exclusively for the hardest fans of monster movies.
