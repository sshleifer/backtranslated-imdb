On the panel discussion I attended after watching this film, the film's authors said that this should not be viewed as a film, but as a provocateur of thought. Well, the only thoughts that were provoked by me were lost in the time of watching the movie. The film coins (documentary style, futuristic ambience) served as an interference to what was to be carefully examined in the debate on abortion. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use the film as a platform for their political views - usually a very boring film that preaches the chorus.
