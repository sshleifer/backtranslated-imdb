The only thing that prevented me from getting back after watching this movie was the fact that they are just actors, not the freak that usually appears in the TV show. This is also the main reason why fans of TV shows will not love the film, but not the only reason. This movie has so much fun value as getting a root canal. It approaches deep depths of bad film creativity, and then it gets worse. I will not waste my time describing this movie in more detail; It's enough to say that I'm sorry for the bad people in the camera who first had to suffer from watching this movie.
