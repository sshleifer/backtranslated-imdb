This did not come to light, but only because it came out in 1994 when they were probably tired of the whole thing in Britain. That's 75% repetition of the Boogeiman, and it would be forbidden for the same reason - whatever it was. At first, I was confused because I thought Annie (Kelly Galindo) might be different Lacey, but she was some kind of trouble because of the psychic visions of a boogeyman similar to that of the first film. The fans will immediately notice that they are not the same person. After seeing the murder in the bathroom, and also seeing the address, Annie, her psychiatrist and student of a pair of psychology that is very similar to the type on romantic novels and advertisements for butter, go to the house and, of course, It's the same bathroom. 24 hours later, the killing takes place as described. Of course, we have no idea who this booby woman is or why she was killed. Then the film is moved to the repetition of the Boogeiman story with some additional footage that we have not seen in the original. It is significant that boogejman is shown as opposed to the original. Unfortunately, some of the good scenes are cut out, but 90% are there. Why repeat this movie? Did they find a tape record? What was the purpose? We will never find out, despite the fact that the psychologist told Annie that she was cured, we all know that the grandmother will never die.
