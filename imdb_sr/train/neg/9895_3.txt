If this book remained faithful to the book, then we can only assume that the author was untrained in history. Mark Antoni never died of injuries received in battles as shown. He died of a coward's death by suicide, and then he asked his slave to do it for him. Rob decided to kill himself. In the real story Mark Anthony was ashamed of the great slave slaves and decided to copy it. But even in the death of Mark Antony was a drunken failure and failed in his own attempted suicide. He shouted for Cleopatra and was taken to her, bleeding. She pulled his litter on the ropes and Mark Antony died a little later. If you want history to not watch this movie. If you want a romantic game, you will probably enjoy it!
