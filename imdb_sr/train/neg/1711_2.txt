Well, I bought the trilogy of Zombie Bloodbath thinking that it would be a foolish bloody party. That's it, no fun. This film is truly foolish, there is no complication or character development, or any story. The main problem with this film is murders and murders. Basically, every murder looks exactly the same. Zombies are tearing someone up. Yes, that's fine, but you need the original killer. I mean, it got miserable, every murder looked exactly the same, shot in the same way. It killed me. I love it up, and the blood in this movie has not done anything for me. It was just boring. There is no story, only the same freaky scene over and over again with another person. And I wanted to love this movie. I like the video footage ... like Redneck Zombies. But I could not afford to kidnap. This film has a good side, but none of them is in the movie. I understand that many "zombies" helped flood and there were more than 100 zombies, which is pretty cool as so many people have been involved and helped in the world. But all in all, this is a horrible movie.
