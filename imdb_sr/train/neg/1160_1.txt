This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a (I think) story of a rebel basketball player, his hard but honest coach, his girlfriend and fellow student (played by Michael Margotta) who has permanent nervous breakdowns. The story goes nowhere, there is no character development, there is nobody to worry about, and appearances, except Bruce Derne as a trainer, are terrible. It's hard to believe how a talent like Jack Nicholson could direct such a horrible movie. Be careful to avoid this turkey.
