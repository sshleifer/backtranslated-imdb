What kind of documentary about a musician fails to include a single artist's track ?! Unlike Raia or countless other music videos, half of the entertainment in the theater (or on the couch) is re-experiencing great songs. Here all the songs are covered with unattractive characters, and these performances fail to catch Cohen's slow, jazz style. More often, the covers are badly singing folk versions. Iuck. Interviews are more or less with other musicians and characters than with Cohen. The film rarely happens when Cohen reads her works (she never sings) - like letters, poems, etc. The film did not really record much of the life story of the artist, nor its development over the years. Great disappointment for the great Cohen.
