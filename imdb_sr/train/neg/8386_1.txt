Separating this film is like shooting a fish in a barrel. It's too easy. That is why I will cause recognition of the positive aspects of the Little Man. First, I'm impressed with special effects. It really seemed as if Marlon Vajans's head was attached to the body of a small person. I never doubted the minute. Second, I loved some unexpected coffee shops. David Alan Grier played the boring singer of the restaurant, and his performances "Havin" Mi Babi "and" Movin 'On Up "were invaluable. John Vitherspoon, who accidentally played Ginger's father in Boomerang in 1992 (if you recall, coordinated "belly mushroom with mushroom jacket) now plays Vanessa's father in The Little Man. That was fun. Besides, this movie is as convincing as white chickens. How stupid it is when even a doctor can not say that this is a 40-year-old man, not a baby? He has a full tooth! How is it possible that no one notices that this is not a baby? is so bad that there is Rob Schneider.And if you are stupid enough to spend $ 8 on this movie, at least do me a favor and DO NOT ALLOW YOUR CHILDREN.This movie is too sexual for small children (a lot of joke and allusions about sex, going, eating, etc.), and I was embarrassed by the parents who brought their children to the projection I had to bear. If you insist on watching an idiot film, the less you save children from pain and suffering.
