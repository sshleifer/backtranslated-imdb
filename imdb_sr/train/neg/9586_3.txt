After a catastrophic revolution, this film was almost the last nail in the Goldcrest case, and therefore the British film industry. The film is an absolute pantalon, full of music from the attempts of jazz revival in the mid-'80s and based on a book and author who was briefly popular at the time and deservedly sank back into the dark. The temple was looking for years trying to find Suzet and designed the 8th Miracle Patsi Kensett to another person who was then popular. As the film emerged from post-production, Jazz revival ended, as well as Kensett's career and the film met a completely insecure film audience. / cheesiest starring ever grace the British silver screen watching it for nearly 20 years, and the movie is a true cringevorthi.
