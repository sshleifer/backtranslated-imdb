Seriously, absolutely NOTHING is not good about this shit. Randolph Scott, a wardrobe homosexual who has lived with his mistress Cari Grant for twelve years, plays the smallest role in his wooden and boring place. At age 57, he was obviously too old for these romantic roles, although not so important here as Gail Russell looks much older than his 31st year and is so ugly for his chronic alcoholism and smoking chains. Lee Marvin plays his usual negative role, but that's not enough to save this garbage. Thank God for not making western ones, they are just obsolete, old racist films that glamorize weapons and murders. 0/10.
