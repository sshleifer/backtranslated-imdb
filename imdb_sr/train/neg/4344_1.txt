If you hit your head with a shovel, write a footprint, you may come closer to the level of intelligence of this movie. There is nothing in this film that has not been done a thousand times in other gangster shifts and is done much better. Those who think that Scarface was some kind of hero to watch or see Goodfellas, Menace II Société or Dead Presidents, and MMM thought "It's Life for Me!" will love this movie. I thought I would give the film a chance, because the room was perfect for the sign. I should have known better after I saw Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combes. Anyone who is above the 4th grade, sees the original with Pacino, a real actor and be satisfied.
