In fact, I felt bad about the actors in this thing. There is no doubt that a high school drama class can do a better job or at least do the job. The actors thought it would be their great chance to work in the film, it certainly is not. In addition to terrible acting, the stories were boring and mostly predictable. It did not make any sense about the remote control. For the bad reason, he had the best premise in the group. I'm in favor of supporting low-budget films and providing real chances for new filmmakers, but this party is a waste of time and an insult observer. I just watched it for some good comments posted here. Must be planted by people with movie links. You can fool people to watch this, but you can not fool them that they like what they saw. I gave him 2 instead of 1 because at least the boxing story tried to warm the heart. He must have failed poorly, but he tried. Book 1 for the worst of the worst. Make yourself a service and skip this dribbling. I wish I had it.
