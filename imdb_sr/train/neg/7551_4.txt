Well, finally, I had to see the remake last night in London, unintentionally hilarious, without sex, and without any real humor. I really do not know where to start, while this strange homage was amusing me, but it did not really start. The act is screaming hammi, no original music, costumes are too "Disney", it's funny "six months later" to insert after Nic Cage burning (which did not come fast enough for me) with Cage in the bear's suit, the audience was pushing for joy as comedy struck various 'bad' on the island. It's such a weird remake that I can not believe I saw it, it reminded me of something that the Comic Strip introduced in the '80s, a bit like their hollywood interpretation of a mining strike, very strange!
