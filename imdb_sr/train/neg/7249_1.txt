This film rivals Plan 9 as one of the stupidest films ever made. Always be concerned when the same person is: 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Writer 5. Stuntman, and 6. Editor. Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink has done all 6 jobs! The IMDb shows that he and his father were Western "stuntmen". Maybe it was a problem. Here's just one example from the film: In the Sheriff's movie, you have to bring the witness to another city for protection. Of course, bad guys find out and wait for them. But what's going on? Good guys ride and kick and hit a tree near them. When the camera shows us bad guys, they all just sit on a diary, chat. What's wrong with this picture! I could continue. Perhaps this movie is conceived as a comedy. If so, it did not do well.
