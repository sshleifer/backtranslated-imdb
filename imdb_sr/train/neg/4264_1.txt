this film has really put me down. it was a great concept that was ruined by a terrible letter. The story did not run and was at best separated at best. There were so many elements of this story that were not explained, or were forced to stand in place without any real thought. elements like a love story could have been expanded to a bit more, and the guns should be written better. The whole main person who grew up needed more about the training he received and less about it. Everyone loves a good "little person who overcomes" the story and this has proven the promise, but with no scripting failure. Although there were pyrotechnics in the final battle, it was brilliant due to the lack of choreography. This made for boring boring hour It could have been so good :(
