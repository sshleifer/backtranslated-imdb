This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I would like to be able to travel backwards and do the following: 1) Find out where the "movie" "War games - dead code" recorded 2) Watch original war games with my current computer knowledge and eye prevention from 1983 . years. 3) break into a Pentagon computer in the 80's with knowledge and perspectives learned and remembered. 4) Repeat the VHOPPER to the NUKE location DEAD CODE minutes before the first day of the recording. event, especially my original viewing "The Dead Code" 6) Take another beer and watch VARS GAMES 7) Be happy to the next bad remake of the GOOD 80's film. Jar Jar was killed. I'm not sure if I had to travel for the future. Maybe I need access to the wormhole.
