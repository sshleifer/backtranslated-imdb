No doubt, this is one of the worst movies I've ever spent on money! It's a plot, is it, I apologize, did I say that there is a plot? The worst moment was when, I can not remember! The best special effect I had to hide under the bed cover is ... I can not even remember it. You knew who the killer was from the very beginning. There was nothing terrible in the whole movie, in fact, the only two unclearly interesting parts were when you saw the little sister, Misty, in the shower, and when you saw Sister Toppan taking it. This movie should be viewed only to get an idea of ​​how to make a horror movie !!!
