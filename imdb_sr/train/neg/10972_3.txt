This was not a Trainspotting or Gui Ritchie movie. It was a great winner. He wanted to be a nervous, nervous laugh, a film that confirms urban life, but that's more a jerk, a mess. It's much easier to imitate something else than creating a true story with real characters. From the very beginning, I did not care more about the characters or about what they were involved in. They always always hit, pissed, or cried each other. Only, there was no substance in what they were doing. The dialogue between the characters should be hip, revealing, instead of appearing banal, and one scene after another is predictable. I know that there are spectators who really love this movie, so they can be wrong.
