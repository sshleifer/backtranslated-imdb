This film has a very simple, but somehow a very bad plot. The whole film is about a girl who sneaks through the gate to another dimension, and then a witch opens again a year later, while a group of friends (including the main actor who has problems overcoming her former girlfriend who is one of the other) camper with her new partner. .. another girl ... that's right, they are lesbians and there is some nudity, of course, for no special reason). Unfortunately, the demon is now following an adult girl. Unfortunately, none of this has ever been explained. Where exactly were they? Where did the demon come from? How did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who the hell has trained her and made gladiator clothes? I think the acting is terrible, but it's hard to say because writing is so bad that there may have been nothing they could do with it. I give him three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were quite fun though they were very cheap. I would not recommend it, it was not bad enough to be ridiculous.
