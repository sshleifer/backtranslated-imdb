Frankly, where can I start! This was a low budget, HORRIBLI acted as a movie, it was so cheesy that everything was shooting us with laughter as it was completely retarded! scenes of fighting for swords were not even fighting swords, they were playing with some plastic swords they bought on the wave-mart and everything they did was just wobbling to try to look like they were struggling !! Me and my family were in favor of a really good action movie one day, so we decided to go to the store and look for one, and there was the movie Savtooth Island. I mean, it looked so great, but when we watched it at home, I practically died after the first scene. Oh and movie action, storyboard, script, etc. from the garbage that I do not even know why the director and producer even lost their time! But if you accidentally come across this movie ... do not get it !!!!!
