I really do not have anything new to add, but I felt like I had to comment on this bag. So here goes: Atrocious. I'm going back through my MST3K DVD collection and I just watched Hobbobline a dozen times. It's really, really painful, but it was next on the list ... You see there's a small kernel of a real movie that's buried under all the shit that's "Hobboblins," but just could not get out. Everything about this movie is the fourth. Story, acting, effects, women, "action scenes", ... ahhhh they forget it. I can watch a piece of shit like "The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z" (so-called "Zaat") over and over again with almost no bad effects (I love it in fact-BTW, it will be on TCM later this month, October 2009); "Hobgoblins" is the whole game of balls. The worst part of everything can be that now about 12 hours after the film is over, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my drugs, and nevertheless arsat "Nev-Vave" mold the music Ami, Red Shorts and Laraine Nevman entertained in the living room is still running through my head. This torment will last for days. Good luck, right?
