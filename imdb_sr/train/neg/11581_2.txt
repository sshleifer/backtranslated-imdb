This is a really horrible movie. The action (like that) is completely incomprehensible. (I think it has something to do with the students, but I'm not quite sure.) Half of the dialogue consists of useless clich√©s. The other half is said by various actors in such incomprehensible imitations of "southern" accents that (fortunately) words can not be recognized. as Marie Tyler Moore was obviously in such difficult financial or personal circumstances as to appear in her. <br /> <br />
