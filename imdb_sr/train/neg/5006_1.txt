Nothing similar to a movie about a group of friends who not only dislike hate each other, but also have little or no disadvantageous qualities that the * audience * likes or sympathizes with any character. There are movies that are so bad that they are good (a la Voodoo or Tod Slaughter movies), and it's simply bad (like 99% of "Uva Bola's" work). This movie is hardly tolerable even if you are a brilliantly talented MSTie riffer (eg Misteri Science Theater 3000). Fortunately, while I am quite talented in that regard (that's how my mind works all the time), for those who are not so naturally talented in MSTie riffing, eventually in this * movie, you'll just want to take off your head, Painfully aware that The film "Tabu" takes you about an hour and twenty minutes so you will never return. Even my MSTie talents barely responded to this slow and tedious waste of time. The most aggressive aspect of this film is that someone * was green lighted and / or funded ... I rented "Taboo" exclusively for the normally talented Amber Benson, which obviously had to be blackmailed in this film. I have another lesser-known movie about her in my rental queue, the reviews I would read better first. Ironically, the best aspect of the film was an impressive labyrinth castle for the inner location.
