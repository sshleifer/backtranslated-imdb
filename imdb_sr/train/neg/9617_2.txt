Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Fretvell) had fun at the lake with her friends when her brother dropped out of the boat and drowned. Rachel's friends think that it's time to stop fighting and blame for something that did not have control. So take a beer and something for chewing and return to the same lake that was in Rachelin's constant nightmares. As expected, bloodshed has already begun when two friends were sprayed before they even went to a party. This movie has a sense of play in a high school where everyone has forgotten their lines and 'hiding' is ... very bad! Writer Marcos Gabriel gave himself a better role as Rachel's boyfriend Leo. Outside Fretwell and Gabriel, there are some pretty nasty actings and a few characters that you'd like to suppress before you 'offed'. Drawing attention to a few more players who had the courage to appear: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Villiams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is a MEMORIAL DAY that you would not miss.
