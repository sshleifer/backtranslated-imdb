What a loss! This movie could really be something decent, but writing, in particular, is bullshit, and the main characters are pretty shallow and uninteresting. Mike Meiers was good, and the historical recreation of the decade of the late 70's was well made, but overall, this film was a great waste of time. Instead, a watch movie, dealing with similar topics and the same basic time frame, is a great NIGHT BOOGIE.
