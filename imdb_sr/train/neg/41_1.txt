How can you say horror movie is terrible? Of course, when you can not stop laughing! The action is well covered by other reviewers, so I will just add a few things to the joy of everything. Some reviews set up a location in South America, others in Africa, I thought. It was on some random island in the Pacific. Where exactly this happens, it seems to be a mystery. The Cannibal tribe is adapted to a few blacks by some black people, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa who hits the drums ... God damn is a big black man with a terrible case of pink eyes. > One of the "happiest" moments in the movie is when "Pablito" finds its partner hanging from a tree covered with what looks like an orange substance I suppose the blood is starting to scream for a few minutes (that's actually funny) and then the head of his partner falls into the ground and "Pablito" takes him a little kick for what I suppose is "shit n 'giggles" and his eyes are actually moving ... But, of course, then the "freak" it's gone when you realize that your eyes have shifted because the movie is just bad ... I did not laugh like this in a long time, and De I recommend this film for Sunday afternoon with your friends and you do not have anything to do ... grab a beer box and start watching this movie, you'll love it! If you are looking for a real horror movie, still ... do not be tormented.
