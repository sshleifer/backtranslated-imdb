This is the most boring junk piece of shit I ever lost a watch of my life. All I can say is thank God for being an hour. More than half of this film is a clip from the original "Criminal Madness". At the very least, I was able to see what emerged from the rare exploitation class, because for some real-worrying reason my video shop had only "Criminalli Insane II" (as it had, "Crazi Fat Ethel II"), . But the rest of this movie is one of the absolute worst domestic video-acting and shooting yards that you'll ever see. Why does my video store have this, not the original? Why are things like this actually end up in video shops? Why do people rent it, and do not immediately burn a copy when they see her horror? Why - AAUUGGHH - Why, God, why? Unless you enjoy watching boring fruits that eat the whole beverage in an unusually slow scene, or say that the fruits that hung from the fence in the stairs are even slower, or the character that snaps later (do not ask) more back pain, or monologues that kill brain cells to give poison tea to their wife, and then complain that the whole story has made tea cool, or mentally retarded soup flies, or just want to see Crazy Fat Ethel dance with a bloody knife in the garden: Do not watch this movie. Repeat: DO NOT watch this movie. Do not rent this movie. If possible, do not walk past the shelf in a video that has a copy of the film setting on it. You can still be saved, but it's too late for me now. . .
