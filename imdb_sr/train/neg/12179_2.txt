It's not even worth watching this cunning spoiler that destroys everything about 'Annie'. The characters look almost diminished because of poorly written stories and poor quality in production. It's very clearly made for TV, but if I find it on TV, I would have rolled it straight. Children in the film do a good job, but adult actors are incredible and so the movie can not really get you. we all love. Johnson, how Annie was sometimes boring and more acting ... you can not convince her that she really is Annie. Character differences continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film. Sadly, this continuation was a total failure.
