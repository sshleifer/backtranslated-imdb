This movie is so bad, you can not even imagine it. The acting is terrible, even worse than in third-class soap operas. It's a shame that this film was the most successful in the past 20 years in Switzerland. Interactions between soldiers did not make any sense. The story could have been taken out of the bravo-photo story, the dialogues were as woody as Woodwind, and the holes were larger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. But today it does not need much to satisfy the audience. Actors were handsome, for example, former Miss Switzerland and the main character was even hanged (voah !!) and there was certainly a lot of drug abuse. It's a really cool man! Especially for 12 and 13 years. The media, however, created an atmosphere in which you were not allowed to discard the film because they manipulated the dynamics of a peer group by saying implicitly that you are stupid if you do not go with other 'sheep' and say. exactly as it was when I was in the army / that's exactly what I will do when I have to go to the army ... for every crude action that has to do with drugs and cold. And do not think I love the army. I was there and I hated him, but this film is worse than cleaning a sticky toilette with a toothbrush (which I had to do because I offended the lieutenant) It is not necessary that each film be sophisticated. Sometimes you just want to have fun for a few hours and forget about the problems and I do not think it's a bad thing. But such films affect teenagers in many ways, showing them a cool lifestyle that is just stupid and turning them into meaningless ignoramuses and egocentric idiots. But since I now, when my opinion is not very popular, now I will be quiet and recommend that you avoid this terrible blow at all costs and to save it! 2/10 <br /> <br /> (I'm sorry, bad English)
