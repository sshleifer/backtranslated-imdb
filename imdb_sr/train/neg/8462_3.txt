"Bullfighter" was created in 2000, but for some reason it was released on video five years later. I wonder why? Could it be: a confusing story, an incomprehensible dialogue by Oliver Martinez, and boring editing? It has to be. I think the plot was Mari (Michelle Forbes) and Jackue (Oliver Martinez) on a mystical journey. Meet many strange characters and avoid some evil. The movie looks great and has lots of style, but there is no content. Most movies, when trying to subtle, do not pay attention to themselves with unanswered plot development, and poor special effects. The most.
