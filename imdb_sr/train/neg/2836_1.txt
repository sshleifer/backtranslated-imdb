I saw this obvious flyer on the video store shelf. And before I got my first VCR, I realized that I baptized him with this little jeweler, and that's bad film making at his best! And it contains a comedy with Donald Trump. Anthony Kuinn is inexplicable in him. And as if Christopher Valken wanted to star in every bad movie in his later years. This film is Countri Bears g. Kuinna. It has lines like: "Shut up and let me fight!" I "Speak a lot sh_it!" And priceless return: "Sorry, it's sh_it, heavy hot sh_it!" ! And he makes a good kung fu kick when he comes out of the role! Chop socki action and T and A excitement! What movie lovers in Schlock can look for more? Oh, and when the image of Mr. Kuynna committed suicide and came back to dealing with Bo as a ghost, he asked why he was killed, not to deal with the disease? He says, "Real men do not eat the bitch." Uh, aaa, yeah. If Bo was a smart cookie, she would call the exorcists right away and there!
