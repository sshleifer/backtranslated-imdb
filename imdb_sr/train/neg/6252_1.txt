Ronald Reagan and a bunch of US soldiers at a camp for prisoners of war in North Korea. They are tortured ... We learn that the North Korean communists are bad people ... We learn that the beards of Americans grow very slowly during the day of torture ... I tried to push it, but finally I burst into a laugh to this movie. It was a scene when Mr. Reagan came out from telling the Communists that he wanted to be on their side. Then he searches for a bottle of brandy. Then, playing cold-bloodedly sober, he takes a drunken companion, Devey Martin, to get the sulfur to cure the hangover of Mr. Martin. Of course, the North Korean communist watchman is stupid as they come. So, the drunkard draws the attention of the guard until Reagan leaves to pick something from the drawer, which is next to a bunch of empty boxes. I'm sure the boxes should contain something; but, of course, Regan forces them to shake enough to discover that they are empty. Ia gotta laugh! I think that the "Prisoner of War" will most like the family and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise, it is scary. * War Prisoner (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Devei Martin
