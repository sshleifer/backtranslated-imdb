George Brent is a journalist who sent an interview with the successor. She is allegedly the successor to the face cream. He interviewed his yacht. They fall in each other in bathing suits. It turned out (pretty early) that she was not a heir. It is part of the advertising campaign for cold cream. Film follows the ups and downs of their romance. The carrier is slightly raised. Davis and Brent carry a picture. Although this is pretty predictable, it's also pretty fun. It's far from her best. But, especially given his ambiguity in her opus, is not one of her worst.
