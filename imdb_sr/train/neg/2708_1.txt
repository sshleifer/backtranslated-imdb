This film turns into a social commentary, when, in fact, it is as equally ridiculous as racism itself condemns itself. The premise of this film: African-American = Strong ... any other race = weak. The worst part is when Rapaport pulls a pistol at Omar Epps and the Jew. The Jewish type, in a stereotyped way, is broken in fear and begins to pray for his life ... but the great, powerful, defiant Omar Epps stands firmly without fear. We also have a condemnation of every member of the fraternity as an arrogant drunkard or rapist. A raped white girl, of course, begins to consider lesbianism as she is a weak white girl. When the stupid white man is rejected by members of the fraternity, he must, of course, enter into skinheads, which are incredible cowards; especially the big muscular guy who was blown away by powerful black people. Wait ... BUSTA RHIMES BEAT A GUICE TVICE HIS SIZE ??? Of course. Naturally, blacks NEVER reject your people and Omar Epps easily deals with them. The scenes where Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in order are just stupid - of course, he is dominant as his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually emigrate. This film was terrible, and in the end, he actually laughed loudly. Too long slow motion capture between Epps and Banks becomes hilarious with the characters they make - it's like watching a nephew and cousins ​​making faces on each other (and everyone is under 5). Do yourself a favor and skip this crapfest.
