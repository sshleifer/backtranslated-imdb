As someone who likes to shoot scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true story, I was an optimist in this movie, but too many obstacles were found in the way of the good story that should have been. LOÅ E - I am the fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he played, but his role is boring as an insurance investigator. is the real trash. From what I read, there were several directors who replaced each other in this film, and that's bad. You can say things are wrong with the story. I could not "get involved" in showing Cooper's Treat Villiams. It should have been fascinating, but it was not in this movie. It's also some kind of sad comment that the guy who committed the crime was some kind of "national hero", but I admit that I too got used to it. Not everything was disappointing. I can not complain about the landscape, from the lush, green forest of Oregon to the desert in Arizona. I would like to re-create this film and make it better, because it is a story.
