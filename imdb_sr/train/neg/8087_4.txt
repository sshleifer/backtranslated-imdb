The film has no confidence in helicopters that did not exist until the 1950s. But no woman would do what had been done here, even women before the women's movement of the 60's and 70's. The only part of the film you can trust is that Germany would like to know where the landing will be. Ignore for a moment that the British captured all the spies, but even if they did not, they would not let him wander like this, only to convince the Germans that the landing would occur in Calais. This is not one of the main things that the movie does not do. It is the culmination of all the wrong things that make the film unsuccessful. Poor routing, bad scripts, no attempt at authenticity (in general) do not just make a movie. Generally speaking, spies should fade in timber. Uncertainty arises when the spy is wondering whether the information they have or not, and worry about discovering them. This game has been finished since the beginning. This spy did everything except spying. Your only chance to get something that has some credibility and introduces some uncertainty can be reading a book.
