This film was so amateur that I barely believed what I saw. Filmed on VIDEO! NOT film! Since the early seventies of the last century, I did not see this kind of thing, when the late night-time networks showed a film of undrawn 'horror flickers' filmed in the video. It looks like a bad soap opera, and it's a compliment. Some of the actors give their best shot. Michael Des Barres agrees with what was given to him, and that is to act as a sexual addict outside control. I can not say it's pleasant to watch. Nastassja Kinski as a therapist sits on the chair practically for the entire movie, with very small variations in the corners of the camera. I can not blame someone else's blockade, but she's totally incredible in her role. Her girlfriend's voice is working against her here. And I consider myself a fan of Nastasya Kinsky. She is definitely timeless and exotic, but she is out of reach with this. \ TAlekandra Paul is pathetically overcome. Each line it delivers comes with three exclamators. Someone had to instruct her to scream at all costs. Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a wild horn? Finally, Rosanna Arquette as a sweet, wicked woman turns out well, and probably the most credible of the crowd. But that does not say much. This must be the worst movie I've ever seen for years.
