Vincent Minelli movies are usually worth your time; Meet me at St Louis, The Bad and the Beautiful. I expected this film with great interest. But what a disappointment. Some Came Running is a scene after the scene of fatalism. Sinatra is a sad bag, she returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships, a disappointing lean who hung him, living in disappointing mines while the girl urged him to finish her disappointing writing project. The film has a huge dramatic ending in which a disappointing criminal comes with Sinatra and McClain and something disappointing happens. The intention is to get the sequence full, but Minelli is not Hitchcock; he is so confused with beautiful colors, he does not notice that the scene is a hideous clich√©, and the characters are so thinly drawn and poorly developed that we do not particularly care about being shot. (especially MacClane) But this is the only real cinema in the project. Otherwise we will look at the constipated characters standing around the bars and the living quarters, and two hours on the nerves. Other people are hell, obviously. In this film nothing is happening. The dilemma of soldiers returning to resettlement and indifference after the Second World War was more skillfully processed in the "The Best of Our Lives". And one of the two Inge products, 'Splendor in the Grass' and 'Picnic' covers despair in the trap in a dead city, with much more sharpness.
