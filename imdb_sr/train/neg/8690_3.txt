Everyone involved (and the audience) should look for the "Candidate" to see how this film could be good. What happened to the South American story? What Julie Christie and Kate Capshav thought were to allow their roles to be cut out of cardboard. So far I've loved every show and / or film by Gene Hackman. He was either uninterested (which I can not believe) or terribly wrong. I also loved and defended Richard Gerea (and he was convicted for that). But he did not have the "power" here. It was never terrifying and only convincing at times. All in all, I was very disappointed. I expect much more from this director and actors. If you can not look at "The Candidate" watch "Vag the dog" or even "Bulvorth".
