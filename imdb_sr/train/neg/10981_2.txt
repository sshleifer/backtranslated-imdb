Or listening, in that case. Even the soundtrack is boring. Honestly, this is not the worst gai film I've ever seen (it would be Billy), but it's very close to the bottom of the barrel. This thing pulls and pulls. It's not that the plot is pointless - in the hands of a good writer, it may have succeeded. . . surely it could have been much more fun. There is not any plot that you can not see ten miles down the road. The dialogue is flat. Jokes are old. To add insult to injury, it is full of one-dimensional, stereotyped homosexuals. Nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or relationship of the two traces is possible, and even less real. There was no chemistry, no dynamics, in fact there is no evidence of why water leads one another. . . We just said they were in love. It's hard to understand when they have nothing in common and are not sexually compatible. They love the same book? The acting is not completely bad, but pacing is incredibly slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch - slow, but without Jarmusch quality. In fact, it would be a good barometer for you. If you love Jarmusch movies, avoid this.
