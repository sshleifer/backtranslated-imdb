'SherriBaby' is a rather painful and rude melodrama set in Jersey, the story of a young mother who came out of jail after a drug investigation and struggles to stay clean, to find a place in her life and especially to win the love of her daughter who takes care of her family brother. The only reason to watch the movie is Maggie Gillenhaal, an actress at the top of her career, who fits very well into the role and wears the entire film on her shoulders. However, this is not enough, as the story is too simplified and expected, and the emotional accent has been placed in the wrong place - I was constantly wondering if I should be sorry for the former and perhaps the future drug addict. the mother asked for by the director and script writer, or the innocent child in the middle. Even Maggie Gillenhaal could not convince me that I should not worry more about the kid.
