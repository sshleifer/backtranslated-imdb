This is certainly one of the worst films ever made and published in a large Hollywood studio. The action is simply stupid. Dialogue is written in clich√©s; Therefore, you can make many sentences in the script. The acting is ridiculously bad, especially Rod Rod Cameron. "Choreography" is stupid and completely nervous. The only thing that can be puzzled is the reviewer who watched the 23-year-old Ivonna dance as a sexual; It's just a very bad choreography. The ballet scene at the beginning of the movie is especially funny. If you are in bad movies and enjoy laughing with some Hollywood chicks, this is for you. I bought a color version on VHS, which makes the movie even worse. Ivonne's heavy makeup, when painted, always looks like a clown. And she's the best part of this movie. What a way to start a career.
