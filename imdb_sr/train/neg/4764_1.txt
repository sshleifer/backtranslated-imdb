86 lost minutes of my life. I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch it, and I must say that I am not one who would ever fall asleep in the cinema. I've never seen such a ruthless action that has acted so stiffly and forcibly, and I can only assume that the actors were as stubborn as the protagonist writer allegedly was in the film itself. Everything in this difficult adaptation is exaggerated. And if it's not a woody act, as if you can see a teleprompter, then it's a set that overlaps and interrupts in extremely unnecessary ways, and too exaggerated in an inconceivable extent, enough to turn you away from the whole farce. As for the presumed shock of a detective under a mask, every person who does not see it - like the rest of this ridiculous complication - telegraphing light years ahead, should immediately check their sight. Poor acting, and of two very decent actors, along with hyper-codled Branagh overdirection of the brand, it's enough that you want to use the real bullets, not the gaps themselves. Above all, there is a completely acceptable homoerotic tone in this, the enhanced end. The only thing I can hope for is that this was such a flop that people will not try to ever again mimic this film level.
