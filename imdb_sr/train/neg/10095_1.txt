Someone actually gave this movie a 2 stars. There is a very big chance that they need immediate professional help, because anyone who does not spend 30 seconds to see if you can assign a star is literally terrifying. This film is ... well ... I suppose it's some kind of attempt of a horrible porn / snuff movie without pornography or real terrible parts (except acting, plotting, stories, sets, dialogs and sounds). I mistakenly assumed it was a zombie. Watching is actually pretty scary; You're horrified that somebody will come and you will never be able to describe what it is and that they will go away thinking that you are a freak that looks at domestic amateur tape recordings or something like that. So I am found to write this review on my mobile phone so that I do not forget to try to reduce the rating further from the current 1.6 to save others from the same terrible fate I was just suffering. The worst movie I've ever seen and I can say (with a hand on my heart) never, will never be at the top.
