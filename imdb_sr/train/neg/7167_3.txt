I saw a trailer for this on another video, and I decided to rent it when it came out. Man, I was disappointed! The story is very boring, acting (except Christopher Valken) is bad, and I do not care about the characters, except that I really want to see how Nora is struggling. The role of Christopher Valken is such a throw, what a mess!
