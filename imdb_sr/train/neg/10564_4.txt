The real shame of "Gatherings" is not in a bad mood, nor is it in a desperately shallow pit. It's a real shame that it was a lot worse than the series that started, even though it had one main attraction: Takashima. I would like to see Laurel Takashi in the room with Susan Ivanova, even just five minutes. She has this sarcasm, that wit, that dual personality that is both unstable and appealing at the same time. Unfortunately, the pilot film "Babylon 5" has an incredibly boring story that involves assassination. Patricia Tallman, who never returned seriously in the series until much later, luckily she became much better with age like Lita Alekander, who is just a little bit more than a malignant fatigued telepath. I'll leave you with one final thought - why does Delenn look like some sort of outside frog (although she is a woman)? Thank heaven for the way Minbari watched the show later.
