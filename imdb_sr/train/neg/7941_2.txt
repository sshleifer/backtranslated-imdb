As the 2000s approached the end, King Kong's adopted daughter went ahead and announced that the end of her concert was a tear. As Miss Vinfrei collapsed, I laughed and screamed like a wild Indian from the old West. So what does Oprah do? she takes familiar people and puts them in her performance. What kind of people? The people who suffered (just like her, except that these people lost more than their innocence) suffered muted faces (a true story), the limbs of the limbs (The True Story, see the end of the paragraph) and abuse of the spouse (too much for the count). and somehow they come to the show and tell their story, as if we did not hear it before tons and a ton of times (Bethany Hamilton, I heard your story of losing your hand for a shark since the first day, October 31, 2003, do not tell me you do not have any hard feelings.) But the biggest thing on Oprah was Michael Jackson's interview in 1993, after being accused of being a child molester. Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson has since died. but this one broadcast talked about Michael's personal life, something that many did not know at the time. Oprah's real impact comes from middle-aged women and soccer moms. It seems that sometimes they think she is a personal Jesus. but all I see in Oprah is some big gentleman from a ghetto who made a big one, and she only shows how rich she is. I'm glad that her shows will soon end. we need better television programs.
