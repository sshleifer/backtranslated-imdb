Just to get your movie fans getting a point on this movie, I decided to write another review. I missed a few things last time ... First, the scenario. Second, acting. Thirdly, Jesus Christ, what did they think to make a piece of garbage like this and then expect us to enjoy it when there are no redemption properties from the beginning to the end, except when Joseph Fiennes was finally thrilled with a very unbreakable climax !!! Br /> I can not believe that I lost my money when I could give it to a homeless person or a bus or something! Do you get the picture?
