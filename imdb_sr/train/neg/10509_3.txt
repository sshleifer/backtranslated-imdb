The boot from the sky, a gang of naked naked female angels (with large plastic sheeps), occupies a dwelling in a ghostly forest where they feed on any unfortunate soul that should wander. Soon, then a group of friends on a journey becomes a victim of bloodthirsty pieces? The Independent Horoscope with a small budget made in the UK, Forest of the Damned takes an interesting premise and throws it in a pan with the worst performing effects, effects and directions I've seen for a long time. Director Johannes Roberts shows the occasional flair behind the camera? The shooting tricks are quite tense and there are some skillfully "shocked" moments - but mostly the film is technically amateur. Include some really terrible performances with horror icons, Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson, and you have a really bad movie on your hands. Some fun can be derived from the ordinary film rigidity, and there are many female nudges for the guys to enjoy, but most will find this as a tiny job.
