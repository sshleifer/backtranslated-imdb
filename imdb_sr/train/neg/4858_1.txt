Why would someone make this piece of garbage? The first two films of Zombie Bloodbath were stupid enough, but this takes the cake for the worst trilogy (Maybe all the time). Todd Sheets is still a director, but he is no longer a scriptwriter, who is not negative or positive, as he is equally untalented as the one who wrote this. Writing is heavily reliant on the f-word, which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times in nausea. The acting is roughly in line with the last two Bloodbath films, so it's natural that it's the worst thing I've ever seen. Special effects are better than the last 2, but they still look divine. The shop became too complicated for its own good, and it was about some government experiments that went wrong and the production of zombies. Also featured are frozen zombie mutants and school kids who know how to travel through time, leading to one of the idiotic endings I've ever seen. After the movie goes on outtakes, which is strange because this whole movie is out of the question. You see only this to laugh, because if you enter this with a serious mind, you may be killed. My rating: BOMB / ****. 95 mins.
