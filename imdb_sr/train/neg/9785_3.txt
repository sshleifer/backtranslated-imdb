This film, for a special school, is not so bad, and that's the problem. Nothing happens. You feel like you're still in time. A man learns a bunch of young bumps to be good ball players. We will never see that these underdogs work poorly as a good player practices them. Suddenly, meditation turns into good players. It also has too many characters and no character development. Too much time is spent on the main character and his sexy sister, and not enough for some others. This may have the feeling of 'Bad Nevs Bears' (original) since the girl was on the team of all the guys, but there were no feelings for this movie at all. There is no feeling and leaves a dull bone pain after looking at it, it's not fun to bag, it's not fun to watch, and it's just ... there. Plain. Boring. Something you'll take care of after school before your eulogy. As if the day was boring and it was a long, long day watching this movie.
