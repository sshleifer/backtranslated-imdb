Oh, my lord. This movie ... It was terrible. I'm a big fan of horror films. And most of the time, horror films that other people say are bad, I love. The actor who played The Scarecrow was incredible, I'll say it. But this plot was horrible. Does not make sense! She had too much blood and unnecessary (and disgusting) scenes of sex at the beginning. I believe that the director was trying to be "shocking" or something else, but it just went horribly. In order to add a bunch of festering shit they called the plot, the actors (except the 'scarecrow') were terrible, and I was so worried about them that I soon forgot who it was. In conclusion, this film tortured me. If you can avoid watching this movie anyway, do it.
