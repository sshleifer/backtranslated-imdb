It's weird that many people who say this is far superior to Romer's version tend to be very young (judging by their other postings). What we have here is a smooth, action packed, bloody and "Vhoopee" filled with a two-hour MTV video. Frantic editing, pop-video camera, "cool" music blah blah blah <br /> It's not really bad compared to other recent treatments (Chainsav Massacre is a total disaster) ... all-round pretty predictable in "who will die the next" stakes and the total stake on the name Dawn Of The Dead that will generate a lot of revenue only by the fans of the original who will go and see him out of curiosity ... Do not remake the classic nervous? Can I REALLY CONVERT something original? Why remake Dawn Of The Dead? Things made by the original special (middle child segment think it's boring should be slow to show that, when you get everything you ever wanted, you're still not happy) are completely missing. This is an action that is simple and simple. The faster the better. If you're in action shifts (and as such, the 2004 version is well made) fair enough, but for anyone who loves a bit of content in their movies ... get ready to sigh again (again) ... <br /> < Take a look at the cinema over the next few years, while we get the The Godfather series that was reworked by the one who's currently the most famous pop director, and Star Vars worked out, and all the kids said that the new version of Miles Better than the old version is slow and boring and holding the camera recorded for more than 5 seconds ... It's not bad, but for 10 years they will continue to discuss the Romero version, not this one
