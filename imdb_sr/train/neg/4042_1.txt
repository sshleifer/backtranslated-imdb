This movie is great for watching, but it's like watching a really bad experimental theater. The action (if any) does not make any sense. But it's very "artistic." A lot of shots of semi-trained actors struggling and looking deep in the eyes. Many artistic footage through windows and people outside the box. Murdering people who are wandering. Long-lasting large facial and body plans. When you reach a triple on the roof with a cat, you will be ready to throw a bottle of KI on the screen. but you'll just want them both to finish each other and finish it. If you have always wanted to see bad Russian gay porn without any money, your wish is approved.
