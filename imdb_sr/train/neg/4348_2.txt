This was a horrible movie. It hurts me to watch. Almost every action was unmotivated in the context of the film, the performance was very bad (P.Diddy was the best actor who is really talking about a movie) and the plot is generally predictable. Some connections with Carlit's route were fine, for example, his dream one day moved to Carribean, but in general they were weak. Love interest in my opinion was wrong, but hey it's controversial. In any case, I did not expect much before watching the film and I assume that even those expectations were not fulfilled. I feel bad for Jaia Hernandez because he is a really decent actor (Fridai Night Lights). I'm lucky because I'm sure there will not be too many people watching this movie. Generally speaking, I give movies a decent rating if they are challenging my interest, so I'll go ahead and give these two stars. Better luck next time. And that I enjoy Carlit's path.
