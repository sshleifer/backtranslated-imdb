In short: this is a romantic comedy for cookies that really wants and tries to be something more. She wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, a Graduate. She wants to be deep and human. It has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, editing, all of which gives you the feeling of an important movie. Dialogue is smart - sometimes. There are some instances of "laughing out loud". But here's what prevents him from ultimately being more than a formal late-night cable, on a plane, a killer of time: 1. David Schvimmer - how many times Joe a sad dog dog can staring openly into the open space for an open air before it starts to get nervous? Maybe some saliva would help. 2. Gvenneth Paltrow - It's really straight and not only in the chest. Her role should be this lively, beautiful, caring girl who is constantly dealing with wrong situations, as a result she is very confused, and that's why a sad loser such as Schwimmer has a chance with her. But Gwenneth plays very boring. Combine this with a bushy, salty face (above) and you have very little chemistry to take care of. (I continued to imagine someone else in that role - for example, Kate Hudson.) 3. The script and the plot - things that are happening basically do not sound true; all the problems are finally end up with a proper and orderly inclination to make the whistle appear and the script writers just said: "Oops, it's time to finish, take the train!" So they pulled out the Hollywood formula, examined all the boxes and went home.
