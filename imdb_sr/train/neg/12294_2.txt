I watched this movie solely because of the setting. It was filmed in the old hotel owned by the owner. The action was predictable, the act was at best, the fears were more brutal, and not real fears. Much needs to be remembered. The hotel has not been used even for its greatest potential ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is located on a peninsula. For a moment, you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay, which is actually a ghostly scene in the morning or late at night when the wind rushes through the cracks. Best way to see this movie is with the remote control in your hand so you can quickly advance through the action (and I use this term loose) scene and pause the beauty of the environment!
