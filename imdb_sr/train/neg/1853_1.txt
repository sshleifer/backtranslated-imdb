This film, no correction, this thing, this enormous horror from the burning pit of hell, should have been killed before even leaving the writer's head. I could not get enough adjectives to describe this movie. But let's try it anyway. Terrible, bad, painful, tired, shit, vomiting provokes, the bowels are very bad, disgusting, nasty, rotten, there's simply not enough words in English! "Action" includes a serial killer who becomes a snowman. Do not ask how, it does not matter. The killer snowman is about killing people. How, you wonder, can a snowman kill someone? In the unsuccessful ways that you want to remove your eyes only if you do not have to support that styrofoam anymore. In ways that want to fill your ears with hot wax, so you no longer have to endure his snow penalties. Do not watch this movie! Destroy it in sight! Do not look for your soul!
