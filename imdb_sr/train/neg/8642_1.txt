I must say that this is a horrible movie, only because of the fact that when you look at this film on the guide, it is listed as a documentary. As I watched her, I began to laugh, thinking to myself, does this man really expect me to believe this is real? That's why I had to look, and now I see that it's a movie, but now, since it's not a documentary, it's a bad-acting movie now. So, in any case, it's pretty bad. I did not really get to the end. I had to turn it off. I am a police officer in New York, and I felt that someone was trying to deceive people to think that this is a documentary, with the intentions of making money from a terrible day for me and my colleagues. Well, I got it personally. Maybe I was blinded by it, and it's not as bad as I personally think it is. Everyone has their own opinion.
