This is a 1974 German film that has something to do with some women coming to the castle and beyond, I can not tell you my purpose or even the purpose of the movie. I can tell you that there are several women who also fly as servants in this particular castle that are being removed, dressed in the body and thrown into the bongo as if they were in the Goth Kit-Kat Club, and that looks like a good part of the work of this movie. Yes, there seems to be something about worshiping devils and vampires, and there are girls with girls, etc. But the main focus seems to be the colored babies turning in the basement. I liked seeing one of the main housewives / worshipers of the devil, who gave the authenticity to the proceedings and made it even more evil. Was it Vanda Lesbian Evil (as charged in points)? Does not matter. If you're not too picky to your lesbian devils who love movies, you might like this, otherwise it's a pretty boring thing and I could not even finish it, it was so boring. 3 of 10
