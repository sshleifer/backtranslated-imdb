I captured this a few months ago on Famili Channel, and after some memories of a TV show from my youth, I decided to watch her with my four-year-old daughter. I should have taken some psychedelic mushrooms, because this is just bizarre! Not only is it a musical with boring forgetful melodies, the necessary effects of cheese and precious stars that have passed their collective perks, it seems to have been produced as someone's good sour trip. Speaking of flutes, British children are too old for this type of shit ... in the words of Krusty Klovn "uuuuuugggghhhhh! What am I?" If you are a great fan of the whole of Sid and Marty Croft's opus, move on; Otherwise, unless you are ready to crawl before watching, stay away, far, far away.
