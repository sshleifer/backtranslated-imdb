The acting was not great, the story was full of simple turns and transparent characters. This is the result of a struggle between right-wing Flemish voters on the one hand and people from Morocco who live in the Belgian city of Antwerp on the other. Is this a political analysis? Is this a Belgian story from the west or the modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is not strong enough to answer both questions (assuming that it was also the director's questions). However, some of the scenes could function as a film by Ken Loach, set up in Antwerp. After all, this city was the starting point of the extremist right-wing Flemish Block party and struggling with many problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It's very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this unfortunately is not successful. Nevertheless, it is a story of a very real and complicated situation in today's Belgium. Several foreign viewers should try to enjoy in it and realize that it is not an important movie that is important, but a social separation line that follows Belgium, a country of 10 million people in the 2000s.
