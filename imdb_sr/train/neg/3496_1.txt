I remember that my parents did not understand Saturdai Night Live when I was 15 years old. They also did not understand Rock n Roll and many other things. Now that I'm approaching their age, I still remember, and I discover that I understand many of the things my children like. But this is pathetic. I can not say that I saw anyone from Sarah except a few occurrences here and there. They were reasonable. I do not see it as something special. But this performance is so much below what I expected from her. He wrote IMDb that sounded like a potential. That's why I started to watch the first episode. I turned it off half way. Everything else is better than that. Jokes that are intended for five-year-olds are presented on the presumed adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult is encouraged to shut you down. I can not believe that someone really financed this insult to comedy. The only good thing that I can say is that many bad jokes are left here, which save other performances from such shame.
