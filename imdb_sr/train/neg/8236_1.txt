I can not believe it's on DVD. Even less it was available in my local video store. Some claim that this is a good movie if you consider it had only $ 4,000 of budget. This is funny for me. It would be very bad for me, regardless of the budget. It's even funnier, I read the following in yet another review: "Dramatic aside, if you like horror and love something modeled on Duel (1971) updated with a few more stories and some pretty girls thrown, please will you get this movie. "What?!? This is a disgrace compared to these two films. I give "1" because I can not give "0". I just do not see how this movie could be fun.
