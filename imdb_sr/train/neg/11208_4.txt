Raymond Burr plays a lawyer caught in the killing of his best friend (Dick Foran) thanks to his love for his friend's wife (Angela Lansburi). This was a whole year before he started working with Perry Mason, so the movie could be of particular interest to his fans if it was an inspiration for his throwing. There is not much that is interesting here. Lansburi is always good, but her character here is very dimensional and the motives behind her crime in the mystery are absolutely obvious. There is an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter who is also in love with "femme fatale," but Burr's figure is quite simple. It's sincerely bizarre to see an actor like Burr doing this romantic scene with Lansbury, and his delivery suspension does not coincide with his character here, as he does in most of the movies I saw in him. the whole uncertainty was about the title of the film and the way Burrow's character puts Lansbury character to intertwine (double danger prevents her from being tried again for the original murder). He does this with a very large tape recorder that he does not notice when he enters the room, I suppose. Several maybe unintentionally fun moments and essentially the rest of things could have been done for TV.
