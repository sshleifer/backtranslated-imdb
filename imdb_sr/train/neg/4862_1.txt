this show is one of the worst shows of all time! Absolutely no original jokes and it always lasts for a year. as in 2009, will finally say something about the Michael Vick battles. All members of the band are people who wanted to be on SNL, but they had to go to the lowest, crazy TV. . so if you have any problems tell me id love to hear the opinion of 3 people who watch this show. The family said well: "Osama bin Laden hiding in one place that no one would watch, stupid TV. There is a reason why nobody is watching the show.
