Anyone who wants to be an editor should watch this movie! It shows you every mistake that does not work in editing a movie! My grandmother could have done better than that! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (It's actually so bad that I'm not able to write a sentence with no signs of exclamation!) If the first episode of "Les Visiteurs" was a pretty good family comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues, this sequel badly copies the recipes first. Funny pieces could count on one side, and maybe half. The pianist exaggerates with his role even more than in the first part, Robin tries to act like Lemercier (because he replaces), but it's grotesque. Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even if Muriel Robin can be fun on stage alone, she is not in this movie because she does not act as she once was. I know it would be difficult to replace someone who was good in the role (Lemercier won the Cesar Award for his role in the first movie), but made a big mistake: instead of playing his role, she played Lemerciera role! As for the story, it's too much! Of course, at the end of the first film, we knew that there would be a sequel, but Poire and Clavier should try to write a simpler story like the first episode. Gags are repetitive, childish, and deja vu. No, really, there are no more than three funny things in this. The only good things can be costumes and some special effects. So, you only have two reasons to watch it: 1) if you want to learn how to edit a movie, 2) if you want to waste time or if you really need a moment without a brain! 2/10
