Daniella has some questions that are created under her attractive exterior. He starts losing his mind when he finds out about a distant cousin (who looks like him) who was burned because he was a waswolf. She goes wild wildly when she hits the horny men and cuts her throat. She finally finds a man who helps keep her inner beast, but when others ruin their bliss, she pulls out her violent and furry vengeance. good movie for the crowd. Fun time could happen by destroying bad acting / dubbing / translation and fair raw production. But it moves slowly, but there are enough nudity to keep you awake?
