I must say, I usually love horror movies I have never seen ... however, this was just pathetic for my cruel taste. I got used to nasty guys ... but this film was chrome. The acting was terrible (they were still sweet). And continuing, Scarecrow Slaier was worse! Yes, probably, when it first came out, there was a huge talk about it, and people liked it. But when movies such as The Ring and The Ekorcist from Emily Rose appear, movies like these make movies like Scarcrow's kids. If you want the movie to just pass the time, choose this one! Special effects are chewed like heck. But seeing that it's a low-budget movie, I can see where it will come. This will remind you of the "Corn Kids" movie. Independent movies ... most of the time. So, if you want to see a scarecrow that kills people with corn, or in the sequel, 2 scarecrows that go to it, then those movies would be for you.
