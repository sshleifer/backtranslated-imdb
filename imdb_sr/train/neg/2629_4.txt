A hollow point is a fine movie worth half the rental price or if nothing else is in good time without any thought. There are necessary explosions and acting heads and beautiful ladies. Pretty good actor with Donald Sutherland, John Lithgo and beautiful Tia Carrera. This actress plus a light heart touch is not a great movie, but fun ... on a scale of one to ten.
