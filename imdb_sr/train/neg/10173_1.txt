It's no wonder that most actors want never to film this movie. It's just meaningless and embarrassing to watch. Poor actors read the raw lines, while the brilliant classic car salon is constantly rounding up a dinner that looks more like Disneyland's attraction. Students struggle with a disrupted headmaster while trying to prevent them from igniting the bronze statue of a civil war. Watt's riot with actors ... ugh ... 10 ?? Dermot Mulronei tries not to fuck while playing with Marie Hartman, similar to the smirking smile of 'Mr. Sardonicus'. Noa Weil reads the texts of Bob Dylan for the teacher's badge with a cursor in the swing and a very bad face lift. A drunken virgin Rick Schroeder sits in a children's rocket last night before he entered the service. Stupid, giggling school girls dress up in leopard trousers and walks around the set 'Shindig', sings awfully off kei, and actually makes him big in music business. And who wrote this convincing dialogue: "I'm going to Burklee and I'm carrying flowers in my hair" .... "I think I found someone to buy Stick's wooden!" .... These people are "animals"! "" These people are my "family," while Shirelles sing "Mama Said." About Brother, What a mess ... This is like the Reefer Madness of the '60s, except that it's not even funny.
