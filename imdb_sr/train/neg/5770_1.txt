If I made a film thermometer, this film would be absolute zero. Zero Star Rating: Zero Star Video Quality: Zero Star Sound Quality: Zero Star Zero: Zero Star It is as if the high school students were one afternoon assembled with the camera, invented a plot and shot a movie. So there is no artistic value in order to watch children walk through high school rather than watch this movie. Still, something can be said about the depth of the abyss. "Shooting" on the staircase is one of the funniest entertainment scenes that ever happens. First of all, the fighters simply drag the plastic pistols to one another, jerking their arms forward and backward to simulate a jerk. The two actually "bounce" non-existent bullets. No cracks, no sparks, no voids, only a spray brush. If you want to see two grown-up men playing the actor, let them roll one day ... after cleaning the fridge, combing the carpet, polishing all the knobs, raking the gravel, aligning books on the shelf, etc. .
