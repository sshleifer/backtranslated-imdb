The only good part of this film is a beautiful landscape. This film was long and boring. The priest was to retire from the preaching station at the time when his son Paul left the teaching he had published. How many times his boys can take the Lord's name in vain in this film from the Presbyterian past? It does not fit. I wanted Paul at the very beginning to overthrow the river without a boat to spare us funny, funny, selfish stories about Paul (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher, and Paul becomes a compulsive gamer whom Norm wants to save, but not so. It's very uninteresting. We see the prejudices of the whites that Paul opposed for his girlfriend from America. It was the only part that had some interest and perhaps it could have developed into a real 'wild west'. What we see is just a dormant city in which the sons of the two ministers have nothing but 1. Norm takes the lame girl and deals with her family; and 2. Paul makes a stupid story in the newspaper store as he scratches his head and takes a lot of swallowing and tie a lot of flies . I'd rather watch a show about fishing that this movie again - which will never be.
