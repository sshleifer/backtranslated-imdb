I believe that Shakespeare explained what I read well. I think that he (the lady) is too protesting. The whole thing sounded like an author trying to convince herself! He lists profane literature (texts from the same time period, but is not related to the Bible) several times, but at least three references from the top of my head can be remembered that give historical accuracy to the events contained in the Bible. Everyone can distort data and prove everything they like, but that does not make the truth. Customs are changing, the definitions of the words change over time (see English and German where this is clearly a common root) nothing stays the same, always grows and changes. The Bible has many different translations, but the version of King James is the one I found to be the best when it comes to any research. In the version of King James, you will notice that there are certain words written in italics. These words are added by the translators and can be discarded and the middle of the whole verse changes. Letters from the time of Christ are written without space, without punctuation, without passages and without numerical verses. These files look like one long word and the translators have added all the above. For example, to read this: ANNIVERSARY do you read it as if God is not nowhere or are you reading it like God is here now? The same series of letters are two completely different meanings. Because of this, many Bible researchers use a "lexicon" to help them translate, as it gives the word to translate words from the original Arabic, Greek or Hebrew, depending on the language in which the writing was originally written. It is also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove that God exists, but you can not prove that He does not exist! In the end, I like to listen to people who think they are so smart they are trained to judge the Almighty. Talk about ego! Putting soap, God blessed Majegh
