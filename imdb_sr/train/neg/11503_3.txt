Kuentin Crisp once said that when things show up too nicely, one is romantic. When things turn out to be intolerably dark, they are real. And when something is ironically treated, they are on the spot. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa, he falls into the second category. This director obviously tried to make the Spanish film "Ken Loach," without the ability to catch comedy and heat between characters, which raise Loach's films from "depression." Los Lunes al Sol, it's just that, just depressing. Things are unrealistically dark. The symbols of the ultimate moments of misery reach the peak at the same point, and if the story of the dark is not enough, Aranoa flushes the story with a visually gray and dirty color palette. The films were ridiculously overstated at Goiama. A film that shows empathy for the weaker citizens in society, in this case unemployed port workers, does not automatically make a good movie, although I would first feel the fate of those people. This movie manages to make me unhappy about their fate. In Spain, the 21st century, unemployed people do not live as beggars, and ferries in public transport have decent toilets, and it is difficult to come across at least with so few players and so little luck to find themselves in it. Leon de Aranoa obviously has no idea about the working class of Spain, and that does not mean that he is favored. Pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene in which men watch the football game for free is directly copied from a film that is much more "realistically" dealing with the theme of "trap of poverty", that is, "pure belter", which is far more interesting, witty and sad again.
