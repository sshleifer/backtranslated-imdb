I did not expect such a good movie as "In the Line of Fire" or episode "24", but it seemed that this film was made for TV and that at best he did a central job. (Good) actors could not conceal the fact that the plot was too predictable and that the actors had to fight (they are really trying everything they can) through the line of bad scenarios, giving their fairly straight characters all the accessories. When I watched the movie, I got the feeling that I saw the most in other (better) films. In it you had car searches, big guns, romance, complications, etc. Etc; This movie has none. ** Spoiler ** As soon as you see another woman talking on a Cuban face phone, you know who stands behind all this and all of your tips ("stand too close to the president, you see from my perspective ..") sounds silly . If it was up to me (and maybe it's good not to), I would copy the action like this: First Lady orders her husband's murder because she is sick and tired of writing checks in Cuba all the time.
