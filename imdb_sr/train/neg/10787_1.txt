Allow me to say differently: balls. Or, how about pain. This is really terrible, shameful of those who try to satiate. Julia Roberts is a skillful actress and usually her work is on the highest standard. This film is so lacking in the direction even when it struggles to look honestly. Normally, she is a top professional, but I swear that in her eyes there were signs of confusion and despair. turning the movie into a secret documentary about actors. Unfortunately, this topic has not been explored to full potential. Too little, too late. Zeta Jones was wooden, Cusack was Cusack, and Cristal would have to keep acting. Two talented ex-Buffy stars had different experiences - green hopelessly erased, and Balfour - insufficiently used. Well done in July only because it keeps this from being the worst movie ever made.
