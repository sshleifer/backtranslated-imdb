I watched this movie for two hours and I have no idea what this is about. Someone was killed or maybe not, maybe somebody did it or maybe not. This brought back memories of good old days (bad old days?) When all Canadian CBC films were stinky. Lately, stinkers have been an exception, but this confused hawk of trendy feminism, a mind that returns a flash of back and a muddled dialogue makes up the lost time. I never found the books of Margaret Atwood for easy reading. This film continues this fine Canadian tradition. It's not easy to watch. Maybe the trendy people in the cocktail party chi chi chi Toronto pretend they like it. Our people in boons are a little less pretentious.
