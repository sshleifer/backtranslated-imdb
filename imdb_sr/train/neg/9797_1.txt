Today, this is a kind of trend of watching all the shows since the early 90's as a classic (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days), and although some of these shows were / are undoubtedly good, this is just pure shit. I watched this show a lot in those days since it then got a REPLY on TV, and even as a child I did not like it. Even an 8-year-old can see how many people in Pover Rangers are exaggerating, and how many special-FKS sucked even then. When the show does not come close to the badly "fighting" scenes, it accentuates the viewer with this unnecessary soap opera on a group of teenagers and they are there and there are little social problems there. I do not know about you, but I did not give the rats ass for any of it, and it's actually stuffed until they have to "fight" with some guy in a very clich√© outsider with a firework or some toy-bottle. You never feel 'involved' in some way with this show, and the fact that most actors act as if they really do not have any interest, except that the wallet only increases the lack of feeling. In this show, there's really nothing to remember, and it's pretty surprising to have gotten so much spin-off (Beetleborgs is a good example). It's all just a quick way to make some money. I challenge any 'fans' to tell me exactly what is in the episodes that should be so good, because I could not find anything that is even a little attractive to children. I suppose most of the "fans" of the Power Rangers will say that "I simply do not understand" or something like that. I really do not care; It was shit then and it's still bullshit.
