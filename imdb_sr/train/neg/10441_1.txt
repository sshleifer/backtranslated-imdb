I stopped watching this POS as soon as the snakes started to "take over" the plane. First I thought you should get "one" for comic relief. But then I realized that I could watch three puppies free and laugh more! Whatever respect I could have for Samuel Jackson was irreversibly destroyed. And Hollivood once again shows how far they have actually been removed. When I was a kid, we grabbed snakes for the party. The only thing snakes would do is to collect at the bottom of the warehouse. And no Hollywood snake can change that. This film is not worth a trip to Blockbuster. Be warned: if you pay for it, the only "victim" is your stupid ass. If you want to be really scared, I suggest descending. If you like humor, go to your local stand up comedy club. Their worst performer will be one million times better than this garbage.
