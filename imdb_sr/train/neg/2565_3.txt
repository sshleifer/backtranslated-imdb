There are only so many things in common with this movie. To begin with, the first twenty minutes of the movie could have been compressed into just five or maybe ten. The whole movie was already (gracefully) short, but this could have been compensated by paying a little more attention to Mean Lion (how did she miss the reference to "The Viz" on that one?) A little closer to the main plot. In short, the script had a good idea of ​​the seed, but it needed a lot of processing. Second, it could have been done without gross humor. The original had some that he could without them, but at least it was almost a thought - here, bloating and urinating abound. Third, the show is a bit too self-conscious. The original series had this good enough, as did the first film, but this is just the way, too. Brendan Fraser-in-vicevi were just a little above the top (and why is not the "new Ursula" mentioned?). Other differences with the narrator, especially a few interactions at the end, also outweigh the good sense. Fourth, a little more attention could be devoted to CGI work. In the first it was difficult to say that Shemp was not an elephant (except for behavior, of course), but here CGI stands out as a sick thumb. Ideally, special effects would only tell the story whether they are good or bad, and at least they succeed in that account, so it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there. All that is said, the appearance of Christopher Shoverman as George is decent enough. She does not have the charm of Brendan Fraser, but Christopher does not really succeed in this specific comparison - he even managed to give George a bit of personal depth, which should have been the main violation of the film inspired by Jai Ward, but he was not here. Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me as being even better than Leslie Mann in the original. Most of the other performance was pretty standard, not separating in my mind either as good or bad.
