This horror movie is really weak ... that's if this is the right movie I'm commenting on. Nothing terribly continues until the family adopts a sweet little puppy from Germany. I had German Shepard and that's a really good dog. I did not get the idea to get it from this movie, but from the comedy "K-9". It's still a different story. This film does not really have much horror, because it's the most horrible scene in the end and it looks very sour. Also, we see that the guy almost put his hand in a lawnmower. That's why. However, the father doubts something, because his family seems to be quite weird, somewhere where he finds out if you have a mirror while they sleep, you can see if they are obsessed. All in all, a very bad horror movie even on television standards ... television films that work there like "This House Owns" is pretty good and there is another movie about a haunted house about a woman and these strange creatures that is also Good. This is really boring.
