Can anyone prevent John Carpenter from continually and deliberately destroying his reputation? How low can you go? Looks like this man lost self-esteem. This episode looks like a student of a movie, it's not worth talking about WHAT was bad, because it was just a borefest, directed by someone without talent as a director or without any motivation ... Come on, Mr. Carpenter, please retreat immediately with the rest of your self-esteem and stop wasting your garbage like this in a bad tradition from Escape from LA to Ghosts of Mars. Instead, get drunk.
