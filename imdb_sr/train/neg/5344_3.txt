You remember Spice Girls movie and how bad it was (except songs), so their manager Simon Fuller (also the manager of this band) makes the same mistake putting S Club (another of my favorite bands) into his movie. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (what happened to the seventh member, Paul Cattermole?) They basically ask their boss for the break, they go on, and while there see on TV! Three of them change, and vice versa, half reveal that the clones are made of a greedy scientist, and the other half is just in trouble. Also starring Gareth Gates as a clone of himself. This film may have more complications than the Spice Girls did, but next to the songs "Bring It All Back", "Don't Stop Movin" and "Never Had Dream True" this is no reason to see This film. Not long after the band collapsed forever. Adequately!
