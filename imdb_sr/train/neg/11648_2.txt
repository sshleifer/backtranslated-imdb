As if at that time there were already enough of those who were floating around, we have another cloned cloning of GODFATHER by director IL CONSIGLIORI (1973), which I watched earlier this year. The name "markuee-value roped" at the moment is Telli Savalas, who is delayed in the process and is first seen from the back, fairly measured in his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of French painters! Apart from not looking at the minimal Sicilian, he makes no accent from any other kind except his famous drawing. Antonio Sabato, then, makes an incredible gangster - besides being the leader of the leading man; his relationship with Savalas, who becomes paternal to the shift of the eye, is also unconvincing (especially because he later becomes romantically tied to a spiritual teenage niece)! In addition, for gangsters, there is a precious little action that is being talked about and none of it is remembered (although the finals set up in the clinic are well-processed); Moreover, the result of Francesco De Massi is useful but nothing else. Otherwise, the DVD I bought in the basement starts half way, so that none of the team members - or even the title of the movie - has ever been listed!
