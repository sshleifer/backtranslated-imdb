The illegal immigrant opposes a system of social support that causes terrible consequences for many. He was well shot and acted, although the story was a bit forced, but the slow pace really makes a conclusion. The sense of loss in a large city is effectively transmitted. A small person lost in a big society is something we can all deal with, but I can not support going out of your way to see this movie.
