I am a big fan of old horror films, and since I am middle age, my old film was made before 1970, and most of them are from the 1920s to the 1960s. I'm not a big fan of modern horror films, and one exception is Creepsh 1, which I thought was great. I could recall those stories, but I really enjoyed the monster in the story of the box with Hal Holbrook, and the one about a really clean guy was a great ending. All the stories were great. Why did they like me so much? The characters had a decent development, the lines were very clear about who was good and who was bad, so the horrible parts were enhanced by the close expression of the face with fear of fear, and the funny bits were really funny! This extension or to a large extent lacks these elements or are completely absent! I write this only after I watched it partly because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like writing movie reviews at IMDb.com, lol. When George Kennedy and the old Dorothy Lamoure receive a bribe, this tells you something ... 4 out of 10. Also, it's hard to find Romero's expertise here, they had to tell him to mark it to the PG standard (I do not know what this is rated, but it looks like PG for me), and that's not a good thing for a movie that does not happen elsewhere. This is shown on the Encore cable channel if your iuck iuck is to see it.
