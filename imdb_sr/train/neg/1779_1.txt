It could have been a wonderful story based on the ancient races of cats, but it was not. This business could be just that; wondrous and full of mythological references that kept my fascination. The main characters (Charles Brady, Brian Krause, and his mother Mari, played by Alice Krige) were shallowly made, without the depth of personality, and hardly were cute or cartooned. Even Madchen Amick (who played Tani Robertson) did not fit into that description. However, as I have said many times, when you adapt Steven King's novel for television, you simply have to consider the fact that his books are not written for TV, and his script. Unfortunately, the talent lacks the fire and depth that he shows as a novelist. This is another unsuccessful attempt to take magic from Steven King's writing, whether it's from his novels or the original script. Simply cut and paste your work into a small screen. His novels are completely stopped in the process, and everything that ends up creates a good movie; nothing less but surely nothing more. His scripts were hit and missed. Unfortunately, this scenario was a failure. Excuse me, sorry, I'm sorry, movie. This film gets 1.0 / 10 of ... Fiend :.
