Curiosity led me to this "masterpiece". Unfortunately, I did not rent it, I bought it! What is most worrying about this movie is that it's not that disturbing. For the reasons they know, the creators of this film have shown the human side of Jeffrey Dahmer. Are you kidding on my account? Man gave a new meaning to the term "good licking your fingers"! And with all flash and flash-forward, I had trouble tracking the story. All in all, the performance of Jeremy Renner was not bad. You can catch him in "S.V.A.T.", in which he plays a disgruntled former policeman. In any case, I estimate this as 1/10. He was only 1 for Renner's performance. There are many books and TV documentaries that work much better than covering Dahmer's crimes. Avoid this.
