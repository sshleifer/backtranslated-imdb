Big as Tekas prerija and equally boring. Even Liz Tailor, James Dean, Chill Vills and Dennis Hopper can not fly this boat. Tailor seems to look bad - wrong wardrobe, wrong hair, and wrong makeup - a unique achievement in her extraordinary career. Hopper gives the only convincing performance, and Dean on top of the screen shows an extraordinary talent as something that we do not usually remember - a comic actor. Rock Hudson is his usual prototype Barbie doll Ken and you seem to be wondering what, say, Redford could do with men's guidance. There is no noticeable plot that would provide any tension for the last twenty minutes, just a pasty from the milestones that have little interconnection. In addition to Hopper, there is no character development, but only a collection of cardboard cutouts that appear occasionally without any apparent reason, such as accidental goals in the gallery. On the compliment, the film deals with racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects, and it has SIZE, which makes it an excellent choice for the release of unwanted guests. Those who have a DVD version can afford a part of the boredom by starting with another DVD. You will not miss anything interesting.
