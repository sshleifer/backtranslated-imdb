Yes, people are racists. People are even racist at college. This is a good point, and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times in countless films. What distinguishes high-level learning from the pack is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most adapted and predictable possible way, oh, that's in college. This film deals with this problem of racism in the way Frankenstein deals with most problems, he constantly burdens you with a head in a brutal and slow manner. Most characters are cartoon, one-dimensional, caricature (lesbian feminist, angry blacks), who react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible. Instead of defying stereotypes, this film is overwhelmed with them. Angry black people feel cheated, feminists hate men, etc. (A feminist even has a sign that reads: "Dead people do not rape. See what I mean?" If someone seems to be a fictitious loner or rapist, they will probably behave just the way you expect them. The changes through which the characters pass are obvious to everyone except people in the film The great turn of the plot depends on whether violent neo-Nazis will behave like violent neo-Nazis, I suppose you'll have to look to find out what's going on. The other problem I have with this movie is that it should be "big "and" hardly suitable ", but they make the Nazis bad guys I agree that the Nazis are evil, but that's my point Everyone thinks that the Nazis are bad, we do not break any new ground here, Nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930s The film does not question any kind of It does not merely make statements, it only deals with issues that we all know in a clumsy, special way. Being raped, anti-racist and anti-Nazi is not a very difficult attitude towards a controversial issue. </ br>> More learning is predictably, cartoon, and words stupid. Avoid at all costs.
