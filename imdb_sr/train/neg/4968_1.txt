I was expecting a film based on Grendel, a book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It was based on Beowulf's epic, but from the perspective of the monsters. Whatever you think of Gardner's book, a Beovulf-based movie should not be called Grendel, when he says nothing more about a monster outside of a few pathetic scenes where the monster of Montenegro is. is shown as nothing more than a modified Predator. Additionally, writers should also be punished for having rocked the original story so much and contributed to the ever-growing ignorance of mass TV audiences throughout the United States. Typical Hollivood to make this a mistake. Very disappointing and completely wasting time.
