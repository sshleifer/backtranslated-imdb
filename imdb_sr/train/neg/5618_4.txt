In fact, I am surprised by the amount of good ratings that this anti-Christian pseudo-documentary received. Now, I respect my opinion and faith, I personally am not, in this state, a believer of the learned Christian doctrine. However, anti-Christian propaganda is something else. This film has a valid point, but they are very small and featured in a very biased context. I do not recommend watching it. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide for themselves whether they believe it or not. And this is actually more of a chance than the director gives to Christian teachings. Instead of an examining approach to this topic, it looks like personal revenge at a Christian school that has affected his childhood. It also erroneously represents Christians most of the time as or incredibly naive or fundamentalists, without the moderation between them. former school and represents almost exclusively anti-Christian historians and writers. In fact, I have found the director to be the weakest person and I think his attitude was entirely justified. I also doubt that any of the Christian believers who were interviewed had been consulted after, or even before, the interviews, they said the purpose of the investigation. here are some very original thoughts about the issue of Christianity. However, the way in which this whole thought is produced is often offensive, extremely unprofessional and terribly biased.
