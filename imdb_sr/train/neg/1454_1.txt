I recently watched this movie twice and I can not figure out why the manufacturers made this pile of shit. I think that, it gives a great impression on Hitler's environment, and I mean the way they reproduced Austria in the late 1990s, the First World War and the interwar period. What I do not understand is why Hitler was conceived as a 100% pure evil, crazy, unreliable, mentally unstable freak. He was, however, very thoughtful, full of love and an intelligent man who, of course, had his dark sides, there is no doubt about it. But why do they portray him in the heavenly name in this way? All his positive aspects are excluded from the script, leaving only a portrait of the man who had the greatest influence on modern civilization. Yes, he threw Germany into the devastating Second World War. Yes, he was racist, and that at some moments he was unstable, especially at the end of the war. Everything is true. But again; why did they, to hell, show the public the public? To warn us? Absolutely do not think this film was a warning. The real danger of Hitler and the Nazis was the fact that they were able to come to power at times of severe global weakness. The fact that this evil is so recognizable, and yet so grateful to almost every living German (not to mention the Austrians and MANY OTHER people), makes it a warning to modern civilization, NOT the fact that Hitler was such a "freak". If it were as if the producers were convinced - I would be convinced that the German people were left behind. A man like this in this film would never even come close to the party leader - not to mention ReichsKanzler. 4/10
