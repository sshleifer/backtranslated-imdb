In short: Spike Lee clearly has a lot to remember. Thinking of racist color, media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, 'heterosexualism', drug policy, and so on. Etc. ... The level of awareness is own is great. I think it is a blessing that more and more people decide to critically examine the basic aspects of our everyday life; the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies. However, just because Lee makes controversial films does not make him a good filmmaker. What appears in the "Jungle Fever" is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is largely the result of two major failures: First, Lee is simply trying too hard. It seems he desperately tries to accept every political / social statement he refers to in the 90's. And as such, the end result seems confused and reluctant because it does not allow itself time to develop characters that can fully embody ideas that they hope to present. And thus it's exhausting stereotypes and we are left with urgent testimonies and very burdensome dialogues. The end result is very organized and unrealistic. Second, trying to make statements about such a wide range of social functions, it does not seem to have a concrete or original interpretation of the socio-political issues that have been presented. What is encountered is a patch of returning non-sense. You feel that he bought a textbook from basic level sociology and printed out all 500 pages. These are very troublesome features because the art of film is sacrificed and the work turns into a loudspeaker for the voice of the movie. He is not able to distance himself from work and let himself speak for himself. It does not work either as an artwork, nor as a good political argument. Although I still appreciate Li to present these important questions, I must say: Two inches down.
