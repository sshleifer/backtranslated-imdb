I read half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems that opinions differ greatly. I have to agree with those who thought this film was horrible. I'm sick of writing this because I would hope it would be great, or I would not try to see him the other day. I like to support indie cinema, especially if they are gay themes, but this movie is almost too tolerable. Those who came out, as I thought I would work after about three minutes, probably did not bother to fire $ 11.00, or they just thought it was not going anywhere, quickly and not improving. Perhaps I am a little more optimistic than they or they or they did not pay to get in the first place. Logan is bored. He's a slut. He's gay. I agree with that. The problem is that because the main character in the film is bored, it does not necessarily mean that the film about him must be boring! There are ENDLESS scene of this kid, which just lies around as a washing load, re-establishes everything you've already learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc. Etc. Nothing or nobody goes anywhere. NIKO does not say anything even remotely or funny or interesting. Probably the most important thing is that I did not feel the slightest empathy for Logan. This is in itself a great achievement. He did not grow up, he did not change, he did not learn (he has no one to teach him), he did nothing, and he did not even film! The scene after the scene of the same thing does not make a movie. In addition, the title does not make any sense. 1/10.
