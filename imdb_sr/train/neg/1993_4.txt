Franco Rossi, 1985, the six-hour Italian mini-series Kuo Vadis is a very curious beast, creating an absolutely convincing ancient Roman world captured in the fashion of facts (very few long shots without big city landscapes), but playing drama so much to the benefit of allusions classical literature and history that the story is constantly lost in the background. Variable structure (most episodes 1 are played over voice through letters) and the lack of narrative urgency makes it a full six-hour version, at the same time demanding and undemanding, and certainly too often, but there is something that is imposed on it . The two main advantages are the characterization of Petroni (thankfully called Frederik Forrest, whose voice almost certainly offset his dialogue) as a man who had been searching for a cramped angle so long to survive court life and become incapable of experiencing emotions, and Klaus Mar√≠a Brandauer takes a unique Nero as a vannabe actor whose every move and action is calculated by the way his "audience" gets him. Otherwise, Mak Von Sidov appeared briefly in several episodes, since he was awarded the most impressive and prominent performance scene he meets with the child while trying to leave Rome. It's something that the show could do with more, but it seems that it's too often offset any potentially emotional, inspirational or exciting moment under its tirelessly low direction. Unfortunately, Francesco Kuinn makes a stunning anonymous hero, fitting into walls and coming less like a Roman officer than that quiet, somewhat ruthless but harmless guy working in the same office as you who never say much on Business parties - you know, the one named Dave or something like that. Budget constraints are very visible when they meet Lions for Christians and Ursus battles battle so decisively low over you before the concert suddenly loses interest and suddenly ends. I'm afraid I'm not the way I specifically recommend, but if you go into it, it's not entirely without its small prizes.
