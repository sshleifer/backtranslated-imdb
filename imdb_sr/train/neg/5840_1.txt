Well OK. I just watched the shit out of the movies - all with different degrees of quality. I was not too sure about which I first wanted to review. Then it hit me like a sack: Rodentz. Warn people about Rodentz. This monstrosity does not lead anyone and is painfully boring. It's about mutant rats that kill people. Yeah ... it's a real fucking original. "Food of the gods" or "Villard" anybody? They were better than this, and that does not say much ... ** POSSIBLE SPOILER ** Good, here's the story: Inna Laboratory, a scientist and his distinguished assistant experimenting on rats and their labs. is in a shitty neighborhood and a shabby building, and stupid auxiliary friends appear drunk and all become food crazy rats and almost everyone dies and, oh, yes, there is a giant rat that looks shitty, but kills it, the end. There, all in one sentence! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff !! I pray that I differ! When we all realize that there is a giant rat, we all know that they will die in the end !! ** FINAL SPOILER ** Here is the fault: Good: - Well, I looked it free, but for all the rest ... hmmm, no. There's nothing good here. It did not hurt him, did not help: - Um ... well. Blood was decent. - Very average cinema. - CG rats are not as bad as they could have been in some bumps ... Bad: - In other shots, CG rats were pathetically cheap. Look, if your movie has a small budget, you might not need to rely on CG. A lesson to be taken to the heart. - The acting is extremely poor. - The characters are beyond the insensitive - we have a mish-porridge of clich√©s and none of them even does so well. --Boooooooooooooring. - Be made before - many times. - A stupid story, just stupid. - A giant rat looks like a fat man in a badly designed bear costume - it was kind of funny - but it's not funny enough to give any value to this movie. People who drink Tekuila drink Tekuila from huge plastic milk mugs - and yet they do not seem to be drunk for more than a few seconds. A way to keep up, guys. The Ugli: - This film is bad. Simpli terrible. Worse than you can imagine. It's not even funny, like, for example, "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead". Now these movies are bullshit that you can enjoy. Even if they make you stupid. Unforgettable scene: - The chromatic finish of a movie movie, complete with unharmed heroes and explosion. Because he did not even feel like the rest of this monstrosity - but he's still sucked.
