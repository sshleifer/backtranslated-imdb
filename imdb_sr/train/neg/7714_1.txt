Okay, damn it, MooCov will reluctantly admit the truth: I'm like this cheap parody of the '70s. The idea that huge horde of killer tomatoes destroys the United States is a great idea, and in spite of itself, moovie provides some decent humor, the purest sight of horrified addictions that flee from large, obviously fake tomatoes. This film, along with Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the earlier attempts to fake, which has become so popular in the 80s and 90s, mostly thanks to the plane! This, like the worst of this, is pretty bad. Many humor attempts are poor failures and will cause many sighs. But thanks to the hordes of paradise tomatoes, the disgusting song of "puberty love" and the great scene of the helicopter accident, Attack on Killer Tomatoes provides some products, although mostly for the wrong reasons. There's a lot of things wrong with this movie ... and so, it's hard to explain. A lot of people have to enjoy the fact that tomatoes have returned to two films, and a series of cartoons !! Big pieces of time spent away from tomatoes are quite boring. And dig that clothes out of 70, man! = 8) This tomato is spicy and cheesy, but it's worth a laugh or two; MooCov says to grab pizza and get tomatoes! : ??
