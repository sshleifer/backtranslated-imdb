While I was watching this movie I got sick. I was awake with Pipi and every time was a real pleasure. when my wife came to Sweden, he looked old and had a good laugh. but this American version should be renamed and never appear. It's terrible from start to finish. how can they make it so bad. Well, I guess that some blame for the ha ha ha .. but never close to Pippi. maybe this movie has never been seen before and has never been broadcast. burn the movie and save the children. If you want to look Pipija then look at the original film and have a good laugh. We love PIPPI Inger Nilsson, sorry Tami Erin, you'll never stand to be Pipi .. Oh .. that when you read "explanation notes", "spoiled" surprise and robbing viewers of uncertainty and enjoying the film. "So I guess the director behind this ... watch this movie at your own risk ... it's really a waste of time ...
