Thumb's idea is not a winner in the second round. ThumbTanic was not as good as Thumb Vars for a number of reasons. First of all, I think Mr. Oedekerk had much less work with the Titanic. Unlike Star Wars, the movie "Titanic" (still?) Has not become a cultural myth, and there are many less references that will resonate with the audience. In ThumbTanic, the holes are filled with one-time jokes that do not seem to be anything connected. For example, the hero's insinuation that the heroin is not clear during the "bumpy end of the boat" scene - is not ridiculous. Instead, think only of yourself: "Did I miss something in the original movie?". There were too many such types of unfounded jokes (Arachnid's success). By contrast, the sending of a giant ship designer had meaning and it was funny. It was also very funny to send a guy from a movie who wanted to go "faster" than a maniac running around demanding everything * to be "faster", including the sinking of the ship and himself as the first to die. These jokes meant something in the context of the Titanic and gave meaningful humor to Thumbtanic. Finger "media", faces and voices are still fun. Requests and sets and CG animations are worthy of respect. All in all, although ThumbTanic proves that self-confidence does not function on its own, these films still keep you fun and fun to the end.
