At the end of this episode, Holmes asks Vatson not to record a case for the offspring. For a good reason! Super sleuth has left his small gray cells (sorry Agati) at home for this story. There is no deductive reasoning, there is no acute analysis of signs at places of crime. Holmes stops fifty feet behind the plot. Prevarant CAM finally solves the old fragile - in a way that would make Charles Bronson's heart come true with pride - six bullets in a bread basket. We decided to extend the story of Cinderella. Murderer, Holmes and Watson, free. Oh well, a little change in the pace in late Victorian London. \ T
