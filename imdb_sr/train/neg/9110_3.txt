I watched this movie at three o'clock in the morning, the time of the day when I'm usually very open on films. But I still think it was not good, this film was not good at all. The reasons for this are many. The performance is not very good, and the situations that appeared in me resembled the poor 90s Chevi Chase comedy. I mean, come on, like the handcuff situation, and the poker situation among the slaves ... This film was so obviously based on the first, and that's OK. But if I did not see the first one before I saw this, it would be worse. Like the end, he came suddenly, and I felt as if I had no closure of what ever happened ... Sebastian suddenly changed, and this film seems to have been made just to explain no. 1, and as if there was no time or effort, it was used to make anything else. The result is the same as in the first, and he did not feel like a movie at all ... They were supposed to solve situations with more style and class, but they did not, and that's why this movie turned out bad ...
