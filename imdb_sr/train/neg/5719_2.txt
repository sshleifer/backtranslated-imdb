This film is similar to a film host, except with * BAD * acting and not too much uncertainty. The elements are up there, but you do not feel anything for the characters, making the violence not effective. Some parts are just weird ... like getting a snake on a throat. What about that? Should it be terrible or bloody? It's kinda stupid. As for torture, there really is not one (except for the one that was initially burned, which they do not show anyway). The main bad guy keeps saying, "Let him die slowly," but the butcher is killing them all very quickly. All deaths are relatively fast. Yes, I've been watching an "unclassified" version. So, all in all, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not at all good at all. You will not miss anything if you skip this.
