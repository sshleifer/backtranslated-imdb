Dana strives to tremble and extreme with all her trembling and madness, spilling water on her and rolling on the floor. Too much. Calm down, get yourself together and smile. I did not fully understand his comparison with comics and rock stars. Just because they both are on stage or something? He said that every comedian wants to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield really was when he was alive. He had several good jokes like the Burger King joke where people shouted for a ride. I also liked the joke of Reese's pieces. If Dana did not behave so mentally, he might be more entertaining, and I might have given more ratings, maybe even eight.
