Larry Buchanan. Yes, the same guy who made "Attack of the Eye Creatures" and two (Count: DVA) plotted movies about Marilyn Monroe. He's guilty here. Adding to his growing bunch of maps left over by Oliver Stone's "eh-rast-van-of-it" drawings of the conspiracy, here's the "Down on Us". "Beiond the Doors"), which is a working definition of historical inaccuracy. Forget everything you thought you knew about Jimi Hendrick, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, says Big Lar, because this is what you know, the three big names in the wall of the 60s were killed by the government, so which were subversive or counterproductive to the Truth, Justice and the American Way, or so they are. In any case, three people (Chatman, Meril, Wolf) who look awkwardly like their real shadows (that is, if you close your eyes, turn your back and walk five miles from them) show that good old Americans put a hit instead of the recorded deaths on them! Yes it is true! Man, I can not believe I was watching this movie. The perverse credibility of breaking points is meaningless; The act makes TV commercials look like a great drama and if you look at it honestly, you deserve to end up "twist". Really, you really are; I swear. Genius. But like a man said: "Rock and roll is dead - a long live rock and roll." But not this film. No star for "Dovn on Us". And that's the movie audience that describes the movie.
