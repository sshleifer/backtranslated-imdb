This really should have been one star, but there were so many cliches, predictable turns, it was all before it was a parallel slasher flickr, that I actually gave him another star for making me laugh ... although that There has never been a director's intention. I'm sure. I do not write often comments about movies, they must be either sensational, or in this case very bad. To be honest, as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey in it, I knew he would be poor because he had a unique nose for ejecting the worst movies. Somehow, the farce of all of this led me to look at all the passage, probably because of the hilarious voice MR T, (not the Mr T relay, but you know what I mean if you are trying to look at this), if you watch it, Make sure you do not pay to see it. This may have been the case that they actually made the intended comedy, but I'm sure that you will find here a strange laugh in the farce of all this ...
