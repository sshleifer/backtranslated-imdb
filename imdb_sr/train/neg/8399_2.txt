I am a big fan of Stooges, but this and only movie that was used by this movie is that Curlei is in it. Almost long before he began to drink, he is his classic self in it (and Larry is not bad). My character is a flat part (mostly) and this film would be better called "The Curlei and Larri Movie". None of the Stooges films were good (in my opinion), but as one commentator said, it is sad that this film had real potential. Casting was good, he was well-directed, recorded and edited, but the story was trying to be something serious with just some Stooges antiques and musical numbers (which I guess were good). Do it yourself during this movie if you really believe that it must be better than mowing lawn and garbage (which is the subject of the debate) to wait on the Curlei / Larry scene and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat during the rest.
