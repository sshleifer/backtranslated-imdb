"Shadrach" was not my favorite movie. I thought it was too sentimental and that the acting was below the vapor. Harvey Keitel and Andy MacDowell were good, but some of the other actors were not convinced. I also did not believe that Paul's parents would leave and leave him with the Dabnei family, especially when they had a housekeeper living in the house. Their social classes were too far removed to make it convincing. It seemed that Dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated. There was a scene at the beginning of the film that showed Andie MacDovell came out of the car after having sex with someone. Who was that? Her son? What should this scene show us? Why was the scene even included? It had nothing to do with the rest of the film and in fact it was never aluded to it anymore. It looked free and did not fit into the story. To me, there was too much inconsistency in the film. The story of Shadrach was beautiful, but I was not convinced that the Dabneys were kind and generous as they were shown.
