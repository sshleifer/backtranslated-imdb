I am Anthony Park, Glen Park is my father. First I want to say that the story behind this film and the creation of the Amber Alert system is good. However, the film itself was badly made and the acting was terrible. The main problem I had with the film was the other half with Nicholas Timmons and Father Glenn Park. The events surrounding this part of the story were not entirely accurate. My father then suffered from mental disorders and picked up Nichola without any intention of harming her. He loved her as a daughter and was thinking that she had saved her from some kind of harm or neglect that she believed came from her mother who paid little attention to her during the three plus years my father had led for her and occasionally raised it so that her mother could have fun. The film showed my father in a way that would in some way damage his shape or shape. It's ridiculous that Nichole spent many nights sometimes in my father's place, while Sharon would do or do everything she was doing. The reason my father originally thought he was violent was because he had objects that could have been conceived as a weapon on his truck. My father was a landscape. Objects that they thought were weapons were tools for landscaping that he constantly kept in his truck for work. My recommendation is to carry this film with grain of salt, it's a good story and based on real events, but the details of the movie (at least part of Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park) are generally inaccurate and show the director's failure to discover the truth in telling the story. Interestingly, if the director would interview any of Sharon's friends who knew the situation, they would say exactly what I posted here.
