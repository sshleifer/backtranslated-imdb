this is the result. A piece of garbage that does not deserve to be even classified as a movie, it's just a bunch of things on the movie roller, which makes no sense. Let's get back to the actors, who from the very beginning looked like just a bunch of friends who thought they would get some money together and try to make a movie that would be a great horor movie. In any case, it's a great horror, no matter what the film is. There's a lot of terrible acting in "Hobboblins", but the top guy is Richard, which is too weak, even for him. Well, when you throw away a bunch of friends and try to make the film scary, at less than budgetary resources, nothing less, that's what will happen. Well, at least the MST3K version was hilarious. But this is still a horrible movie, which deserves all that is gained. 9 for MST version.
