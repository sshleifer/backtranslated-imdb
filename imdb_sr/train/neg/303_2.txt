It is impossible to objectively consider this film. It's not that I did not try, but I'm seated, and I'm falling into the old VHS, and I'm looking at the opening ... and suddenly I'm five years old again and I keep my Bear well and watch. a film with open eyes and passionate heart. I can see, objectively, that this movie is a BIZARRE combination of silent babies of merchandising-mascot and creepy prepubescent children with evil forces that have a thin story and an uninteresting animation. But my inner five-year-old says: "Iai! Care Bears!" every time I think about it. So - I would only (cautiously, reluctantly) recommend this film to those who saw him during his early youth and may call the terrifying power of nostalgia as they look (as I am) OR they are personally cynical Gen-Ks / I-ers who deliberately search for oddly / strange (the category in which this film definitely belongs). For those who are actually looking for an exciting movie or a healthy family fun: you might want to keep looking.
