I think it's time for John Rambo to continue with his life and try to put Vietnam behind him. This series of old and Rambo is no longer a solidarity, but a cold-blooded killer. When it appears on the screen, someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place and frankly, I'm tired of making Hollivood look like it is. This is not the worst movie about Vietnam, that honor belongs to John Vaines Green Berets. In any case, John Rambo who carries about 50 auto cannons taking what seems to be half the Vietnamese military plus a lot of Russians is an insult to watch. What's worse is Rambos's heartbreaking speech at the end ... Please! Oh yes, I heard that they made another one ...
