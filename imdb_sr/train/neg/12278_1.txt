When watching this show, you are not quite sure if it's a story or acting that's more boring. First of all, the story of each episode is very predictable, the writers certainly used all the possible clich√©s, you can hit not only the general action, but also the layout of the scenes, as well as the lines of each character, making the show some sort of. collage from every police series. At the top of everything comes the "message" of the play, that they are good and bad, and that at the end of the day they will prevail well and that we all need to love ourselves, to be better and better citizens, all in the most memorable way. Actors, as vehicles of this message and nothing more than that, will use a limited set of acting skills: smile "I am a good person to wear", anxious look and "victory is our" body position, while bad guys have "I am bad" frowns look at "you caught me," and then "I am for nothing and I should be removed from society" by the bandage head (this type also summarizes the overall development of each show). The true story or not, the show is garbage, yet another proof that manufacturers do not give viewers **, that we are all idiots. And this series makes every possible attempt to idiotise a living head from you.
