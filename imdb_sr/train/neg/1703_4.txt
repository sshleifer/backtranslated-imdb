A veteran from Vietnam decides to take on a crazy city crowd, and anyone who gets on his way is eliminated (including women). Released in theaters just before "A Star Is Born", which turned his career on, this action drama is in the lead with Chris Kristofferson, wildly reckless, reckless and subverted. Filmed in Simi Vallei, CA, the results are truly rude, with rare clich√©s and mindless violence that make up most of the scenarios by director George Armitage. Armitage brought together the most interesting actors from the 1970s for his film, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters, and little, Loni Anderson; however, at the center of everything is Kristofferson, who is rude and rude. It deserves points that I assume are completely insensitive thrillers, but poor vibrations (and a funny climax) overlap the whole project as a nasty stain. * 1/2 of ****
