Yes, I rated this film as a single star. However, from now on it will be in my rotation of Christmas films. This is really so bad that it's good. This is another production of K. Gordon Murray (read: buying a really cheap / bad Mexican film, spending zero money and getting it in English and publishing it in Chinese matinees in the mid-1960s) life as I'm certain that some " mood enhancers "have made this even better experience. I'm not going to question what many other reviewers have already said, the Christmas movie with Merlin, the devil, the mechanical wind, and some of the most childish actors I've ever seen. I plan to do this during the holidays with Kelsei Grammar's "A Christmas Carol". A truly holiday experience in hell. Now, if I can find "All That Goodnight (aka Slairide)" on a DVD, I will have a triple feature that can not be won. You need to see this movie. It starts so slowly that I do not want you to touch the quick swap button - especially in two dance routines! This thing smells like expensive blue cheese - I suppose you have to go past smells and enjoy the experience. Feliz Navidad amigos!
