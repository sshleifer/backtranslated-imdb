Blazing saddles! It is a struggle between two alienated brothers (Dennis Kuaid and Arliss Howard), who both can mentally fire the fire; they are equated with differences in childhood, while Debra Vinger is caught in the middle. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (a TV-girl behind "Moonlight") suffers from a dark-textured comedy in Vince Gilligan's scenario with such a smooth presentation, the film is reminiscent of the contribution of the enthusiastic student of the film to fifteen million dollars. It has a barbed energy of great commercial content, but a formless style that does not bring any of the characters except their ridiculous eccentricity. These are not even characters, they are complicated functions. Barely released for theaters, the film is a disaster, although strictly as an example of style versus substance, looks good. Wing is the only issue in the plaster that looks truly confused. * 1/2 of ****
