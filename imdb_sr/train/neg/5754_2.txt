I watched the mask of the 80's and is currently showing on Fok Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember thinking that it was kind of cool in the day and that I had several toys, but watching it now is boring. Never before had I realized how boring and boring was this caricature. It's just awful! Not close in the same league as The Transformers, He-man or Thundercats and is very quickly forgotten almost every time he stopped making it. I'm only looking at Fok Kids, because Ulisses 31 comes right after that (that's if the mask does not put me first on sleep). One of the smaller cartoons of the 80's, which I hope to completely forget again when I finish broadcasting on Fok Kids!
