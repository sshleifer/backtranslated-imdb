Undeveloped / incredible story, (by the time I somehow realized where it goes, I do not care anymore) bad casting. (Come on ... Villiam Macie as a killer ???) poorly directed, (did you ever see Tracei Ullman so bad?) (Should I have been worried about what happened to an unethical, incompetent, unknown the image of John Ritter?) Bad script ... (Really, I'm not looking for a formula script, but this was really awesome The only good thing about it was a kid Ten lines It's not ok if your comment is less than ten lines? Why can not I say what I have to say in less than 10 rows? Is not it arbitrary? Why it's OK to have less than 10 rows ntara?
