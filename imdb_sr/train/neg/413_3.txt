This is a film that leaves one impression. Incredible visual effects .. Very good acting, especially from Shue. Everything is perfect. Except ... The story is just poor and it all goes down. Imagine this, if you have the power to be invisible .. What would you do? Well, our crazy scientist here (played by Kevin Bekon) could not think of anything other than caressing and raping women. That's all he could think of his ingenious mind. Does he try to get extra strength? Not. He does not even try to explore how to get back to being visible. The guy is essentially a sexual crazy maniac. Add to that, a laboratory atmosphere, you have all these young guys .. Throwing around the joke as if they were in the bar. All white coats and equipment, you think this is a bad imitation "Cheerful". A very shallow and poor personality and very little care put you on the idea that you think these guys are all but lambs for a wolf-hollow man. exciting "scenes are written down so badly and full of illogical behavior by actors who scream only" this is just a stupid thing I must do to hunt a man myself and kill me. "If you read a book while the scientist (Cane) goes to women, there are many mental manipulations and disturbing thoughts that go into his character. In the film, Cane is just a patient who goes to the crowded market to rub her body with women and to retreat. sad.
