Ooof! This one was a stinker. It does not fall 'somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller', that's for sure. In all things, it falls somewhere between the cracks of Vham! video and Captain EO, just not with a big budget, and many more close, ugly teens who cry. Simon Le Bon is sophisticated, and the rest of the band is trying to hide the fact that they have stolen their entire career from the last 3 albums Rock Music. Short cuts of Barbarella do not add anything. Avoid at all costs. (However, I liked playing "Hungry Like The Wolf", but why did a tiger lurk in the audience by going to a woman painted with tigrams? "Hungry as a Tiger" is a wolf! Anyway.) Duran Duran's videos from 80 It's probably worth a look for nostalgia.
