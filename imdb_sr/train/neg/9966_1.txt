Although I never like to be a person who denies someone's personal taste; If you like something, it's fine. But this film was horrible and there is no way to get around it. I do not like a lot of Ani Difranco, but she is a great guitarist and songwriter, which I can admit. But I can not admit that there are some redemption qualities for this movie. Many people think that this is an accurate overview of the problems that high school students face. Perhaps, but everything is shown too embarrassing. It seems that there is an attempt to "naked pistol" - eskue type of comedy, but the timing is off; There is too much space between the lines of the actors, as if they were holding a laugh (they were not). Whoever wrote the script was everywhere. They tried to put together a number of controversial issues in one movie, almost never fully developing any of them (especially the girl who was impregnated by the teacher). I did not laugh once throughout this movie. I was too offended by this humorous attempt and satire to do anything but turn my eyes on the screen.
