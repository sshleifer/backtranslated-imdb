There were some scary scenes, which I always loved more than the right ones, but otherwise this film was pretty weak. There were too many questions that remained unanswered, and when they tried to explain something in the movie, it was still quite unclear. After watching this movie, I still looked lost in many ways. It kind of reminded me of Silent Hill a few years ago. That movie was also unsatisfactory, but even better than that, because he tried to work and the story actually made sense. This, not so much. The performance for the most part in Abandoned was decent, but the film retreated, and never gave any satisfactory conclusion. As I said above, there were some nasty scenes, but otherwise, this movie was a mess. I'm sorry, I can not recommend it.
