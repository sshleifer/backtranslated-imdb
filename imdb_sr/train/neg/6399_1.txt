One: Richard Prior and Jackie Gleason, two great comic strips turned into juices for a brotherly kid. They both sold in this, worse than Prior's character. Second: A terrible, excessively sentimental letter that could have been used in Harold Lloyd's film. Three: The choice of a black actor as a toy; The racial subtext of this is unbearable, because he never addressed. There is no message here, Prior part could be played by any actor. Four: That kid ... I wish I could go back in the past and stop him from acting ... it would mean movies like this one and Kid Co. maybe they were not made ... and my childhood would be free of their power to bend the mind. So, if you want to watch a pair of great comics that hack into a sickly cute baby movie, just go ahead. If you want to see them in something good, look at Prior's old act and Gleason in something better, such as Honeimooners.
