George P. Cosmatos "Rambo: The First Part of Blood II" is a pure fulfillment of desire. The United States apparently did not win the war in Vietnam. They have inflicted damage to this country beyond the imagined and this film continues a fairy-tale story about such innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war. The character Ramba is perfect to notice. It is extremely patriotic, complaining that Americans do not appreciate and celebrate the achievements of a single soldier, but they have nothing but distrust of the leading officers and politicians. Like any film defending the war (eg "We were soldiers"), this avoids the need to explain the understandable reason for engagement in South Asia. And in that sense, the reason for every American-American soldier who was there. Instead, Rambo is refreshed for the wounds of the whole nation. It would be better to work on how to deal with memories, not to suppress them. "Will we get this time?" Yes you are.
