This movie must be the worst I've ever seen. The title of the film seduces the audience thinking that there is hope. The story of a movie is at best ridiculous, and the acting so poor that it just needs to be teased. The title of "Zombie Nation" includes the zombie bins when there are a total of six. This can not be categorized as a horror movie due to the introduction of 80s music, when zombies attack. Zombies actually speak and behave as human beings in a movie with the only difference that make up a make-up that looks like something from La Rouk videos. If you ever get an opportunity to buy this movie then do it, then burn a copy.
