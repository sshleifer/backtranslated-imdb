It took 9 years for this film to end. I think that for those 9 years someone would say, hey, this movie is horrible. I saw better acting in porn movies. The story is tired and played. A disabled child becomes a serial killer. What do you say about something new to change? How is the abused child turned into a florist? At least it would be a new craft. Why do everyone with a camera and film idea (especially non-genuine film ideas) think they can be a director? I admire the fact that they have been holding this film for 9 years to finish it. It shows persistence and spirit. With this kind of drive, we hope that next time they will be able to focus on a better scenario. If you want to see an unsuccessful experiment in making an indie movie from a writer / director from Michigan, see Hatred from a minute. If you want a good Michigan movie, the writer / director comes up with Evil Deade.
