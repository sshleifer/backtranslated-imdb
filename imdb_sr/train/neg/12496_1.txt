To be brutally honest ... I WANT to watch Severed. That's why I gave him 1/10 stars for his nonimaginary story / shooting / acting / everything. This movie was RIOT for watching. If you enjoy watching a bad movie to entertain them, You'll really get a blow from Severed. The story does not matter, it involves someone who is bald and has a sword and visits the heads of random people. But he has a supernatural craft ... no one ever sees him. Even when, in one very memorable scene, he enters the recessed night club and hits a girl and sees nothing. Severed does not just look like it was filmed on a video - it was shot on someone's home camcorder. The film's authors knew the lighting (very thin knowledge) and the composition in some scenes. But you mostly do not hear actors ... you can not understand what they are doing and you laugh when the next victim releases your pumpkin from his body. Go and rent this movie. Support such films - they are whistle and hollar!
