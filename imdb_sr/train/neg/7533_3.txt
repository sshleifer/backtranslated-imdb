The film had some cute aspects. Maybe too much for my taste. It felt as if the writer / director desperately tried to make us feel the inner conflict of all his characters. Not once, several times ... but all the time. It's a television business, not a movie. The location of the train station was well selected and I enjoyed the performances of Sascha Horler as a pregnant friend. I felt like Justine Clarke's performance was bad. Her reactions to things were forced, as if the director were trying to express the subject of the film through the terms of her protagonist. I also can not believe that the director can make a beautiful Daniel Farinacci in an incredible presence. I can not understand the choice of pop music squeezed over entire sequences. This is a lazy device, especially where pop music does not come from a diagnostic site on the movie and / or where song songs feel uncomfortable seriously. This means that the film's film intimacy is delighted with Australian warmth and a local attitude with the originality. It creates an atmosphere of heat and sun. Especially with the use of beautiful animated sequences that rescue the movie from a full center, bringing it into passion and handmade charm. I wonder why the dialogue feels so overwhelmed. "Who knows if there is a god? Like a guy sitting in the sky and telling us what to do" or whatever the line. Perhaps one of the worst moments was a friend who returned home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to tell his wife: "I quit smoking." Advertising against smoking? TAC ad with some delicious animations? I had to leave the cinema for 50 minutes - everything was too much.
