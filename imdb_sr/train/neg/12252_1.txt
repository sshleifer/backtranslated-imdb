** SPOILERS ** This is one bad movie. Seriously. Acting in an absolutely terrible situation, the FKS is terrible and the plot is right. But hey, it's so bad it's fun to watch! The script is so bad that it's a pleasure! You just have to shake and laugh at lines like "I guess that's what you call CROCTEASING." like a woman's full chest with crocodiles. I think I'm coming to this ridiculous cause so bad! There are so terrible jokes that they are funny! But after a while, it becomes a lot like turning the film into a shit. I really started to fall asleep. Believe me, though, the plastic crocodile feet that crawl on the leaves and the constant swing of the crown and keep you for a long time. Although I must say that he had a cool part when the crocodile broke this guy in half and he only hung a little there until he figured out what to do. Heh heh mindless movie, which must be nominated for the MST3K line !!
