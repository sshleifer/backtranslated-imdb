I love sharks. And mutants. And the explosion. Theoretically, with these parameters in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should have been the best movie ever. No. Monster looks like a villain from the Power Rangers, and has roughly the same range of rubber movements. This could be fine if the producers were not so proud of his design as it looks. That is, for a guy in a big rubber suit in action / scifi / horror movie that could benefit from some mystery, the shark gets a lot of time on the screen. However, it is usually trembling and irregular. I suppose you should assume it's so scary that even that guy with the camera is crazy. The camera leaves the person to eat, the camera goes to the shark. The camera returns to the person to eat, just screams now and do not have a hand. Et cetera. Costing is bad, acting is bad, and special effects are sub-pair, but writing is by far the worst. Things happen quite randomly, so you can eat more people, or something like that can explode. Because I LET ME TELL IOU, the people who made this film definitely went with more explosions = a better way of thinking. The characters burst into the car and there is a massive explosion. They are firing helicopters, there is a massive explosion. Barrels, stones, trees, all the time, all explode, so in the end even an explosive shark exploded. When we are already in this, I do not care how crazy it is, I think it's hard to believe that someone would think that an attempt to make a giant half-half-shark dog has sex with a woman to be wondrous Dogs did a good baby. That is, if that person is not a crazy scientist in this movie. The bad thing is that the film is so random (and sometimes boring) that even its bad side is not enough to maintain an extended person's interest. He could be good for MST3K with his friends, but it's gone, if you accidentally catch this bad boy, do yourself a favor and change the channel.
