In this unforgettable little thing, 40-year-old Norma Shearer plays a flicker, a girl from Monte Carlo, caught in a fight between George Sanders and Robert Tailor. It would be tempting to blame the failure of this film in the boring, talkable scenario or director George Cukor, who never seems interested in reviving the generally comatose state of the film. Basically, however, she is guilty of Shearer, who desperately wanted to continue playing "young" parts until she could get out. Unintentionally, this makes her "her cardboard lover" a bizarre monument to the elderly woman.
