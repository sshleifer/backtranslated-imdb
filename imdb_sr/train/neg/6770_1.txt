I went to see this movie at the age of 17. daughter. I insisted that we go on displaying matinees, not because I'm strong, but I just feel that I have it. In the NASCAR spirit, this is the dream of a sponsor. So obviously advertising, almost qualifies as info-mercial, if there was no so-called acting. Adhering to the tradition, the Herbie franchise continues with its raw lines of the story, the car is just a 'vehicle' (without the intention of playing) for this bowler of the movie. Earlier Herbie rates (although they were also sirens) were produced in more serious times, which made them easier to guard. Ms. Lohan, Drama Queen of the Drama, has few acting abilities. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon would join in such a project. Just a snack bar, it was a bigger ripoff!
