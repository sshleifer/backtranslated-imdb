I would not say this is a bad film. Unfortunately for me, I have the feeling that the more you know about fencing, the worse is just because it becomes completely unrealistic. I've been fencing since I was 14 years old, and this movie shows him very badly. F. Murrai Abraham is good (and it seems to have a fencing context), but most other actors - especially students - seem to be lost.
