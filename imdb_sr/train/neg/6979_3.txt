I also watched this movie, and it was done very well, I found it as a heart, and I would not recommend it to women who have little children. The train is really heartbreaking. And the sad thing is - she dies internally. In the end he returns to Applacian Mountains. All the money in the world that makes up dolls does not hide the grief he has. I remember her desperate face as she extracts money from her clothes and tries to heal her child. I am surprised that this film is taking place in Detroit, because when I looked at it, I certainly thought that people came to Cincinnati, Ohio. This was also the way for the poor from the mountains.
