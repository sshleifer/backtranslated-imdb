A rural family drama - perhaps with the sign of "ordinary people" - refers to a young man who retired after he mortally wounded his elder brother in a shootout. Despite the bad theme (the ruthless glamorous treatment by director Christopher Cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story that is worth exploring. Unfortunately, an isolated farming atmosphere and the repulsiveness of adult characters to take responsibility for the situation make the movie a difficult experience. What about Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and William Brimley in the movie, the film is almost a shortened collection of "The Natural". It's a pity that this project did not get the necessary talent behind the camera so it could really make an attractive, unforgettable picture. * 1/2 of ****
