It is surprising that the film has something of a redeemable quality when it moves toward its end. For the second part, this film is really bad and lame, with a small budget, offensive with a bad written letter and everything that goes with it. It's stupid that with all the money moving in it seems that Christian circles never get enough money to make a decent movie. I'm not religious, so I do not really care, but filming makes it a good tool to get to a new audience for churches, and draw people to be more interested and curious about reading the Bible. In that sense, these films always look like a futile opportunity. Low budget really damages the movie and reduces it. This makes the movie funny to watch with its effects and only gives the whole movie a feel that looks like a B-movie. But the more painful this film is is its writing. The things that are just happening in this film just offend intelligence and then I do not even regret or talk about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the film progresses is so incredible and people in this movie make such incredible things offending their viewers. I also hated that the movie was soap opera sometimes. It seemed to me that it was simply difficult for them to turn this into a feature film and added some characters and dramatic events just to fill things up. Simply, sometimes I did not care less. Still, it should be said that the film becomes tougher and more stable towards its end, when its story focuses more on its essence. However, everything remained foreseeable, but it prevented this movie from being a complete wreck for watching, and as far as movies of this kind are, it's far worse to be seen there, although I do not think this film will conquer any new souls. 4/10
