What is the name of the horror story without horror and stories? This is the most exciting thing about the movie: I feel the writers never decided what's really going on in the movie! The other thing is knowing, giving an indication to the audience, but not completely revealing it, but here, you get the feeling that the scriptwriters do not know it, the characters in the movie do not know it and the audience sees that nobody knows! (Remember "Cube"? Even that movie knew more about myself.) I spent a lot of movies about the horror / horror of the 80's and this film has its roots deep in those films. But many important things are missing. We really do not know anything about the characters. They constantly repeat the empty lines. The story does not really develop - it never goes anywhere. B-acting is fine in this type of horror movies, but there is not much in the script. We do not care about the characters. We have nothing to remember. There is not even a sweet humor or unnecessary sex. And most importantly - no excitement, no winter. You get only some common elements of horror movie genres. They show the Lordi Monsters one by one, but their characters do not contribute anything to the story. I honestly believe that this amount of story, character and atmosphere development can be achieved with a minimum amount of crew. and equipment. Oh, yes, the filmmakers did it - and much more - about 20 years ago! I felt the common shame of the audience when the film was over. A pity.
