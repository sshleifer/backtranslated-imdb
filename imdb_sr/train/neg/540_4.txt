EVERYTHING FOR LOVE (as it was called when it was broadcast on weekends) is a drama of the romantic period with Captain Saint Ives, a French officer in the Napoleonic army captured by the British and captured in Scotland where a young girl visiting a prison is in love and falls in love. There's also a story of murder. I will be honest and I admit that I was not too busy film because I am not really a fan of the dramatic period and the script feels somewhat episodic, but I will say that this was well reacted by everyone involved and having a good actor Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E Grant, Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs. Design costumes as you can expect is also excellent I would be very surprised if this movie does not receive any complaints after broadcasting on BBC2 in the cafe. Captain Saint Ives lies in a bed with a prostitute where the nipple is completely exposed and there is a place where a gathering of French prisoners involves a full frontal male nakedness not to mention the place where the blood is clearly visible. You really have to worry if BBC distributors have any clue about what they are doing
