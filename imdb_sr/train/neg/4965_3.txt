For such a great classic story, the environment (location), Grendel was disappointing. As a writer, I was guilty of a scenario that completely did not have a dramatic tension. The section of the club story is useful and would allow a new understanding of the literary classics. For some strange reason, the column fell early. To know that this was taken 21 days, tells me, "hurry" and this unfortunately shows. Now we'll have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I told FKS, I can tolerate the really creepy CGI, but the script has to be rock, and this was slow, spartan and without drama. I would blame it for actors, but ... since I can write more than acting, I will pick up my colleague.
