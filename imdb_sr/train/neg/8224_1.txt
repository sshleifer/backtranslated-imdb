Are you watching this movie? I thought how much rubbish. These girls must have stones for the brain to even agree to be part of it. A waste of time watching him, the pale sky I hired. The acting was below the standard and the story was unbearable. Everyone who thinks about watching this movie, save your money. The film has no merit. I am a real movie lover, and this is worse than "Attack of green tomatoes". The money would have been better spent on the homeless of the world. I just hope there will not be any further.
