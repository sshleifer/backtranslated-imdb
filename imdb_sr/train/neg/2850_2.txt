If I realized that John Wain was in this movie, I would not look at him. It's humiliating for the Japanese, unhappy for Hollivood and shameful for any thinker. But then, most of John Vaine's films are like that. In the 1950s, Hollivood still believed that everyone in the world likes Americans when the truth (and still) is somewhat different. The film deals with the isolationism of Japan from the nineteenth century. Maybe it's Hollivood that should be isolated. To make things more crude, this film is a horrifying yogic trap.
