I liked the first half hour of this movie. The obvious romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was cute for watching and I wanted to see how inevitably happens between them. However, when the action moved to the home of Ingrid's fiancé, everything went completely apart. Instead of romance and charm, we see that there are some very parallel characters that destroy the film. The frightened son of the fiancé and the military attaché who compete for the attention of the maids looked dumb - in a way, as a sub-assembly of an old love episode. How charm and elegance of the first part of the film can give preference to doping is beyond me. This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to regain the success he had with the RULES OF GAMES, since the film is very similar when the action moves to a rural estate (as in the second film). I was not a big fan of the RULES OF GAMES, but ELENA and her MEN guys gave me the opportunity to appreciate the art and nuances of the original film.
