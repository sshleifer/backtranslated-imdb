Now, I'm one to watch films that have bad reviews and say: "Hmm ... this is not so bad!" I loved The Cable Gui and I thought my Big Fat Independent Movie was excellent. Keep in mind, I really did not start looking at this with great hopes, but I realized that perhaps ... just maybe ... it was bad in some way so I could laugh. I was wrong. At no time during my suffering through this "movie" (and I use that term rarely) I was even close to mildly having fun. To begin with, Shak makes Kuentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I hate rap music, but as far as I can tell, the Amish priest would probably make a better rapper of it. The main character is simply a boring, not an easy-to-figure character. Quite honestly, I'd rather eat an oily vomit from the bloody wounds of Harlequin's fetus than I would be watching this again.
