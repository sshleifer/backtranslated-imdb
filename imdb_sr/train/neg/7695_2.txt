I was so hopeful that I would see the adaptation of a classical story such as the Arabian Nights. Instead, I was disappointed in a movie that failed to keep my attention from the very beginning, even though I tried to watch it twice! It was a bonus that Caradine was in this movie, but he was not as good as the actors did not have sympathy. For something a bit like Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras is much better for action, comic moments and overall benefit. something you should be interested in in terms of martial arts and a line of complications that you will not get. If you just want kids to rest on Sunday afternoon, maybe this is for you along with 3 ninjas.
