I love the novels Jane Austin. I love books and films Pride and prejudice, reason and feeling, and I'm halfway through Mansfield Park. But I could not stand Emma. I gave up the book after 2 chapters, and until the end of the film I did not care about Emma. It does not seem to have changed at all. Perhaps Paltrows acted (which is great at Se7en) or my lack of interest in the film. Dunno. The costumes were nice, but the dance was awkward compared to the Pride and Prejudice Dance Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. I gave her 2 basically for the fact that Knightley was damn magnificent, and although it was a rather brittle performance for Evan McGregor, I liked his singing.
