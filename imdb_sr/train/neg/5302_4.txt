Devaana as a movie goes through the usual clich√©s. A man and a woman fall in love and marry, the husband is allegedly killed by a family friend who wants his family happiness, the woman gets married again and suddenly surprises her husband no.1. The film reminds Chandni Iash Chopra and countless others. Divia Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan give good performances. Amrish Puri as a criminal goes through moves and is nothing more than a standard Bollywood dogger. Music Nadeema Shravana was great, all songs were brilliant. My favorites are Sochenge tumhe piar or Koii at koii chahiiie. Devanna is an ordinary movie that goes through movements.
