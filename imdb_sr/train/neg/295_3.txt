I got this movie because I worked in the movie store so I got a free rental. He came, and the lid made him good. Hot fish, carry a weapon, okay, I'll check it out. Oh man, bad move. This was so terrible, I spent half the film looking in a quick step to get to the nudity, which was minimal. I think there may be three scenes of partial nudity. Crude Dialogue, Smelly Violence, Bad Speech Expressions. I feel bad when I lowered this film, because I know it was made on a cheap budget, but also "Clerks" and became a cult classic and a franchise.
