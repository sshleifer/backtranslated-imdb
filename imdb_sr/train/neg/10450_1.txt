This film was the worst movie I've ever seen from "Date Movie". I laughed through the entire film instead of being scared. It was strange that snakes would require a certain body of passengers to attack, for example, the eye, tongue, butt, breast. If we have seen a national geographic channel, we know that the snakes will not remain on the body when they bite. For each scene, the snakes would bite the passengers and stay on the body that bite the person. I believe that the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior. I can not believe I spent my money on this movie. So, I do not recommend this film trust, just wait until it's in the theater or rent it.
