I see little girls enjoying this show, but calling this family show is ridiculous. I am wondering how well I remember after all these years. It is an extremely immortal and stupid notion of the widow of the father of three living with the brother of his dead wife and his stupid friend from school, and others as the seasons continue. All plot lines usually have a really stupid lesson. In the middle of each episode, someone is angry with someone else and every episode they make and ending on a lightly unbridled joke. And as for the actors, they did not like me either. Bob Saget was painfully immature as a dad with his mother's obligations. Dave Coulier is a joke, a 30-year-old who makes cartoon voices and acts as a child, and he's terrible. John Stamos was the most characteristic character, but it was so cliche that it was hard to watch. The oldest girl, DJ, was a really bad actor in the show and she never showed emotions. Middle girl Stephanie was too clickable as a boring sister. The youngest girl Michel showed what kind of bad actors are Olsen's twins. You can always say when you turn them off. The lines of complication with too many stories were so unrealistically stupid to be exhausted. This is a "family" show that tried to replace any good substance with beauty and love, and although they are necessary for the idea of ​​a family, they are too overdone. This will be remembered as my least favorite sit-com from the '80s and' 90s. My rating: Horrible performance. TVG 30 min.
