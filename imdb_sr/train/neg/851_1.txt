After I finished the book the same day I watched the movie, I knew what should happen. I had great expectations from the movie, for the rating. The only reason I gave this film 2 out of 10 stars is that it was okay to be a movie. I have several main points that I do not like this movie. ************************ <br /> <br /> 1. The casting. Jack Nicholson barely fits into the character of Jack Torens. Also, I NEVER chose Shelley Duvall for Wendy. I imagined Wendy a lot differently. I see why they chose Jack Nicholson, a smile, a spit of eyebrows, but he should not really look "evil". He should look normal, and he becomes evil. Also, they make one of the worst movie pairs. Danny was fine, but he took more life. The road to the drony was behaving. 2. Scenario. They cut out so many things that were in the book and added things. Some of the things that were in the book that I expected in the movie were either deleted, altered or wrongly processed. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to see (hedgehogs, rocks mallet, lift) were not in the movie, and it was 2 and a half hours !! I was very irritated. 3. Completion. The end was completely changed, Halorann died, Jack froze, Wendy never hurt ... Overlook did not explode. Ending was so cool in the book, and the movie screwed him up so much, that I was being appealed. Haloran was not supposed to die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least some Jack used a roulette mallet. You've never seen a mallet in the whole movie. There are other things that I did not like in the movie, but there are things that were fine. Angels with the camera were cool, the blood that went out of the elevator (it did not happen in the book) was cool, but maybe I was too irritated that the film did not go with the book, to try to be scared. I recommend that you read the book before viewing this movie. I applaud Stephen King, who actually agreed to sign a contract to no longer destroy Stanley Kubrick. I would never do that, I would take all the rights that I could cry to him all day. I can not wait to see the 6-hour version, at least there are live animals. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2/10
