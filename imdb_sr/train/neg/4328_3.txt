Any movie with the "National Lampoon" in the title is absolutely guaranteed as a death in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy and anywhere in Germany. It may be an institution in the United States, but practically unknown in Europe, the "National National Holidays Day" probably will not fix this situation. The horrible Grisvalds are just that - horrible. They are not funny. It is clear that Mr. Chevi Chase thinks that he is ridiculous. After all, Ms. B. Angelo is laughing in her jokes, but she's paid for it and did not have to give up £ 2,50 for that privilege. Section in England is typical. Same old old TV performers, Gentlemen Idle, Smith, Coltrane, Miss M. Lipman emerge from the same old, old, tired clichés, g. Chase is lost in the hotel corridor ...., whining, whining .. Bucking - ham Palace, Big Ben ...... I feel cheated that we have never seen bobbies on bikes two by two ........ rosie red cheeks on a small nutrient - Dren, should I continue? The English are the shields, the French wicked - the silly Iank-haters. The Germans are pompous and puffed up, (do not mention the war, Clark), and the Italians are ludicrous bottom-pincers. Every possible "comic" situation is exhausted, death g. Chase desperately pushed, Miss Di Angelo Sweetheart, children are unpleasantly bad. The fact that this franchise has lasted as long as it has to last must bring comfort to those who claim that you never lose money by underestimating the taste of the public.
