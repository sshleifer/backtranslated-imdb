Stefan is Ks-zon who married Marie five years ago. Their marriage was stable until Stefan got up and offered to do the work of the courier. Stefanov's job is the delivery of heroin from Germany to Sweden, which should go easy. In Germany, Stefan meets Ella, a girl from Bosnia who is sold to the owner of strip clubs. Stefan does not like what he sees and decides to help Ellis in her misery. Due to the fact that Elli's father went to Sweden during the war, Elli is now going to Sweden with Stefan. To make up for the past, Stefan promises Elly to help her find her father, no matter what. Finally, in Sweden, the whole situation is more complicated than Stefan had ever thought ... This film does not fit into the ordinary class of Swedish films because of the fact that Americanism is a lot. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergkvist make it all average, but the effects make the movie a bit too much. See it for yourself. <br /> <br />
