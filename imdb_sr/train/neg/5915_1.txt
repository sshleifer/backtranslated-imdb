I've seen many, many movies from China - and Hong Kong. This is the worst. No, the worst was "Unknown Satisfaction". Yesterday I watched the 'Platform' and thought that the other two films of Jia Zhang Ke should be better. Tonight I was disappointed again. Tomorrow night I will not watch 'Xiao Vu' because I put all three films in a trash can! Whoever gave this film, the 'Platform' ten out of ten, should watch more film! The photo was very bad: it was very difficult to distinguish some of the characters because of the lack of work in the close-up. The story was so unconnected that I quickly brought it to the end out of pure frustration. I would not recommend this film to anyone. Give me Zhang Iimou or Chen Kage every day. These are the real masters of the Chinese film, not pretentious people!
