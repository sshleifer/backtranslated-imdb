Comedy Central has succeeded with original programming using professional comics. Chapelle Shov, Mind of Mencia, The Daili Shov and the great popular Colbert Report are all stellar professional comics and everyone is, or in the case of Chapelle Shov, solid. Given that Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics in the industry, I expected good things when I joined. I was so disappointed. funny sequences, but since star Silverman's caliber, the performance could have been much better. It was just a pilot, and I hope the performance next week will be better. If not, take her help in the form of better writers for the show.
