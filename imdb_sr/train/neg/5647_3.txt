We bought this series on DVD because of all the great reviews we've seen here. I gave her three stars because there can be no doubt that acting, directing and writing are brilliant sometimes. In fact, they are so brilliant that we did not see the propaganda that was so smoothly transmitted to the series. If we observe it with discretion, we will see that the entire litany of radical right-wing beliefs have been proclaimed by Fauk (Neville Netsworth). To avoid giving any kind of spoiler, I will refrain from highlighting all of the dozens of specific cases. A brief review of the parcels found here on the IMDb will reveal that everything from torture to arms control to the right of the network to provide "Infomercials" and to call them the news justified by sweet complications and passionate speeches given by some of the best actors in the world . We watched a lot of shows and finally gave up dishonoring when they justified torture using Prosecutor Gonzales as a great example of why all types of torture should be used in the name of protecting us all. The series also manages to humiliate male and female homosexuals in subtle ways using them as devices for displaying evil people. All in all, a complete litany of the radical religious right wing. There is no doubt that the popularity of this program will be exploited by future historians as evidence that America has lost its way to the beginning of this century. As a student of history, I would describe this program as a league with Goebbels propaganda for Hitler and some propaganda that Hollivood made for the American audience during World War II. So, if you want me to use this as a teaching tool that will help your students to understand how subtle propaganda can be that way. Just be sure to buy a cheap second-hand copy to avoid enriching the ultra-right wings in the Fauk network that produced this travesty.
