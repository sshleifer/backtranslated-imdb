Brothers Kuai are directors, according to conventional thought, short films were to be held. I really liked their first game, the Benjament Institute, but judging by their other student effort, The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes, I'm ready to agree not to approach the equalization of my past genius on the length of character. Piano Tuner is, no doubt, a wonderful movie for watching, and often for listening. Unfortunately, this is a boundary that is painful to survive with its intricate narrative and glacial pace. Reading the synopsis of the action, it sounds like a pretty good story. But brothers can not make it alive. One thing to consider completely avoiding in the future: dialogue. God, it's terrible here. Huge busts.
