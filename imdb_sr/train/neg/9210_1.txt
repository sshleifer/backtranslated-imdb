So far, I have completely forgotten this film. It was the biggest attack and the worst attempt to demonize the hobby I've ever seen. It seems to be the message: "Do not the teens use their imagination, can seriously grasp games, craze and hurt people." I can only guess that the unimaginable writers of this piece thought that D & D games were a form of syllable ritual or worship.
