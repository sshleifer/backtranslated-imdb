This film seemed too long in just 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror films is that there are always too many shots of people walking (through a jungle, along a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to drive away. The film pays off for a funny and naked domestic zombie with large, bulging, bloody eyes that are always followed by a soundtrack with heavy breathing and a lot of reverb. Eurotrash fans will have a lot of fun due to poor English duplication, free women's meat and very stupid makeup on the monster and home accessories. For zombie / cannibals it was quite light up, but then I probably did not see the uncut version.
