I waited a long time to see DR TARUR DUNGEON and after I watched her, I was really disappointed. It's not a baroque movie that I expected. The trailer (which I saw on DVD Something weird) is much better than the whole movie, which is amazing. There are almost no prominent scenes in it, and the look and feel are interesting, but they do not even approach other Baroque films there, from Fellini or Jodorovsky. The characters are boring and virtually nothing happens dramatically, although we see rape, crucifixion, madness, etc. The main problem DR TARUR DUNGEON is the fact that it was a conversation. - More than anything else. It was almost like watching a book. I just wanted the movie to have moments of silence or mood or something, instead we see / listen to the main characters who are chatting about pointless things. Missed Opportunity.
