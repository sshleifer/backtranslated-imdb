As far as movies are concerned, this is nice enough. Funny characters, good dialogue, interesting enough story. I really liked that he did not really irritate me while I was watching the utter contempt shown by the city in which he was placed. Glasgow. In Scotland. However, each character is English (except Sean's girl, which is Dutch). Scottish accents are heard only briefly in routine affairs and roles. As a Scottish woman (and as a viewer who loves "real-life films" more resembling real life), I really do not think it would hurt to use one of the countless talented Scottish actors ... at least I have English who could add decent accent! The vain attempt to use the word "tiny" has done nothing else but to insult.
