The only real news in the movie is the death of a sniveling guy and the reaction of surviving characters to him. In every other way, this film is a very rude cheat Javs, Lake Placid, and Alligator, with a small number of Godzilla (1998). As the standard for horror film in the style of the 1990s, the two females that do not act are separated at least once. There is no female leadership, as it obviously has a better agent. The whole film surrounds the recording of a really stupid extreme sport called surfing with blood, in which surfers themselves cut and surf in waters that are polluted by sharks. In this film, giant crocodile with salt water is also located in that area. People are eating. The movie ends. I do not mind a bad horor movie, but I really hate a dull bad horor movie, which this definitely is.
