Did it indicate when Tori complained that her first boyfriend was being treated as a robot, and then her new boyfriend (killer) proved to be an artificial intelligence designer? I think so. Scenes to cuddle you with excitement: plenty of assembling, strip-kissing in a kimono (how do you call it when seductively putting clothes instead of removing them?), And the ultimate battle on the skis! Definitely set for start and end, but you can take a sandwich during the second act when all the action takes place. Is it better than CO-ED CALL GIRL? Nah. Does Tori ever come to heaven, or even from the snow? Nope.
