I understand that the US military was demoralized by 1971, but this film was incredible. It was supposed to be a training camp, not a SS battalion for the sentence in the novel, Sven Hassell. The writer must be a real military hijacker. A psychological sergeant who was constantly breaking the shit of people belonged to the prison cell, and the useless sergeant Black Peak was to be fired. These people went abroad, the units they received would surely be wondering where all the useless damaged recruits came from, and there would be an investigation. The scene that completely emptied him is an electric shock. Farrell, an alleged lawyer from the barracks, would have an instructor over the bar to issue an illegal order (torture of prisoners of war contrary to the Geneva Convention), a real attack on an engaged man, sexual abuse and behavior that was not available to the police officer. Just leave. After that, the discipline bounces to the level of the lunatic and the film becomes invisible. I do not know how it ended, I went to bed.
