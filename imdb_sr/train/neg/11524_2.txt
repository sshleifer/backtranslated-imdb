Pretty incoherent film about the man who belonged and left the occasional hippie religious cult of the sixties, struggling with them sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other cultists who was hiding during the police raid, and was taken by another man named Havk who lives in a small cabin by the river. The cult kills some of his followers or some people in the city. It is difficult to track who the characters are, or in what time the scene takes place. The leader was released sixteen years later (I got it from the box - I missed the amount of time in the movie). Nobody is made to look older, not noticeable, in any case. One murder is done with a large circular saw, while others are done with knives or crossbow. I've never heard the name of the actor mentioned in the film, but he is the one who overruns the most, throws and screams. to explain what's going on. Some of the sound effects were pretty bad. A man hits, and we hear the sound of a shot. A woman fires a gun, and we do not hear it with fire, but instead we hear a rikshot! It does not seem that this was done for a comic effect.
