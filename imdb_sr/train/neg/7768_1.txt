This divine film is about three stupid millionaires who gather a bunch of people to play a deadly game, and the winner gets a million dollars. First of all, acting is terrible, and the film does not make any sense. It's not the least terrible, it's so stupid that it made me laugh, which is why it earned that 1 star. , and some of the characters are very boring and furious. In addition, the monsters in this movie are so cute and fake, and not scary to just want to throw something on the screen. Last but not least, the end is terrible. I do not want to refuse it, in case you are strange enough to see this piece of garbage. AVOID ALL COSTS !!!!! It is not rated (but should be R) for nudity, profligacy and mild Gore.
