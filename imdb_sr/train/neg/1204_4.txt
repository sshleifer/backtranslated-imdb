I remember that Devil Dog played at TBS nearly 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watched her and laughed the next day. It's not so bad for a horror movie made for TV, but it's a derivative (mostly The Ekorcist) and business, because of the lack of a better word. He will not delight you with skillful cinema or brilliant acting, but it's not a waste of time. It's a movie you watch to kill a few hours when you're not in a position to think too much. However, if you enter the film looking for some laugh, you have won. t be disappointed. The early scene, with Lucka the Devil Dog, as a sweet little puppy with the children of the damned eyes are hilariously non-threatening, and the climate effects of the blue screen of the giant black dog (with horns) are quite pretty. And watch out for the hidden Satanist in Maverick's shades at the beginning. It's not really a great horror movie in any part of the imagination, but I'd like to keep making such things for TV.
