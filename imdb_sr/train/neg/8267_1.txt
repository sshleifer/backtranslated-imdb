I'm starting to see the pattern in the movies I give. These are almost all the movies my wife made to watch. Maybe I should stop believing her taste in movies. In any case, this is a typical joke that is aimed at pre-teen girls, but it's done even worse than usual. Once again, the writer interrupted the main rule of every film. He / she did not make the main character acceptable. It starts by being at first a complete friend with her friend, and then finds out when she is 30 years old, that she is essentially a person with disabilities (having jobs, etc.). Why would F feel about this person? OK, let's say we can go over it. Jennifer Garner is not as attractive as you can get without some kind of deformity. I do not know if she or the writer is guilty, but her character goes well beyond my threshold for harassment. Here's the advice for future filmmakers: 13-year-olds are NOT fun, boring. Far far the most unpleasant moment in the film came when they were dancing for the "Thriller". Holy shit that was painful. She showed her to practice that dance at the beginning. That explains why she knows it, but the whole club is full of people?!? Argh !!! Macarena would be more convincing! Suddenly she is completely incompetent and has no idea how to do her job and nobody notices? At least, Tom Hanks's character on the "Great" had a job that made sense to the child. These body / child turns that become adults overnight movies are really getting out of hand, and this is by far the worst.
