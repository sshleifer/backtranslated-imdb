... but this must be the worst adaptation of Christmas Carol all the time. And for this, something needs to be done, with similarly different lifestyles. Do not misunderstand me - I have nothing against Cicella Tison. I enjoyed it in some other role (see Sipsei in Fried Green Tomatoes, for example). But the script does not give it the possibility, except that it will chew the landscape. And chew it, with all the enthusiasm of Tina Tim related to Christmas goose. Give me the classics at all times: Alastair Sim, 1951. With the exception of perhaps Scrooged, all the rest are top efforts to grasp the past, the present or the future Spirit of Christmas.
