The guys from MST3K should see this dog's movie. It's mostly a dumb actor in Hollywood who can not land on acting. And he has this strange obsession with Taki Driver's movie. What does this stupid actor do? He fears his hair in blue and begins to act as an actor of the surfer in the naive hope that he will do this to actor roles. You will laugh at your head in so many unusually funny scenes of this movie. Like when the actor's girlfriend drew her heart broken and chattering and pronouncing lines like, "How could you do that to me?" And why are they crying? Because he painted his hair with blonde and became a surfer dude to get acting gigs. This movie makes no sense in everything! And the actor who played the governor at Benson is also a play of a stereotyped right-wing politician with a lot of stupid funny dialogues. This movie will break you, believe me. Are you telling me this ?!
