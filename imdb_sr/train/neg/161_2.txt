If you can imagine Mickey Mouse as a street pimp in New York, or John Vaine as a communist spy, then you can believe that Pat Boone is a minor delinquent on his uncle's farm in Kentucky and that you can enjoy this movie. This movie is so stupid that it's not even campaigning for a sexual love story in the mid-1950s. The problem is that Hollivood made such a big deal about Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman, and not his wife on the screen before the release, that the audience knows that he will not kiss Shirley Jones, so you can not see the screen consumption. their love. It's like looking at a Western man in which cowboys do not have guns. The story is pointless. Even the title song sings with painful enthusiasm. Apricot love belongs to the worst film business along with Ishtar and Plan 9 from the universe.
