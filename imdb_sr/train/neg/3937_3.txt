It's hard to believe that in 1997, David Duchovni was at the top of his fame, with Ks-Files, one of the best sci-fi series ever, which is at the top of the glory. Nine years later he was almost forgotten, and his attempts to make him on the big screen failed. I can not even explain why, he is a fair actor, but he probably took his moment of glory into an eternal role that takes away the great talent. At the same time Angelina Jolie was much less known. , and she was really happy that a movie like 'Playing God' did not lead her career into a dead-end street. Luckily for her, 'The Bone Collector' and 'Girl, Interrupted' were waiting around the corner, and when Lara Croft came, her career began. It can not be said much about this film. It's the only big screen of Andy Wilson, and there must be a reason. Everything is banal and most of what is happening on the screen is expected in this story of a former doctor who saves the life of the victim of the shooting at the bar just to find work for the mafia. Voice outside the screen is particularly bad, with a moralistic text that kills every nuance of cinema experience from the film. You probably will not meet a movie, but in DVD stores or on TV. Try to find something better.
