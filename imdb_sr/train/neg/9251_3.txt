This film, despite its "independent" status, is a stupid Hollywood version of the painful relationship between mother and daughter. At first, it was not so bad, but somewhere during the film - at a time when a daughter comes out with that guy, I think - turns into a film about the mother and daughter who agrees. I'm sorry, but I do not even know about a mother who has such a relationship with her daughter ... although that may be better.
