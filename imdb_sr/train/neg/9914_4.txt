This film deals with the abduction of children from the point of view of Mama (the pictured Hartman Black), who acts as a man in an action thriller. Unlike other films focusing on the police, Mom follows her ex-husband who kidnapped their son. She got help from her lawyer who eventually fell in love with her. Before finally caught up with a son, many bizarre things happened. Mom tries to take a child who looks like her son from a local game for children in a local theater. She is caught, and then she realizes that it is not her child. Only that would put most people in the Mental Department or for several months in jail waiting for the trial. However, in this film mom was released after a few hours, because the victim's parents are complaining. A little later, the mother enters the house of her mother-in-law, and then the police arrive and they have weapons on it, but let her escape because they recognize her (and they complain?). On the second point of the story they found the child, but when the police came to search the house, it turned out that they went out to the back door and entered the river on a boat that apparently had a father holding such an urgent escape nearby! Mom gets someone to loot her, and although it takes some time (in the real world), she and the boyfriend, and the police, caught the second raft quite quickly, and it's upside down on land. Instead of getting out of the raft to look for a dad on the ground, Mum assumes he drowns the boy and jumps into the water when he sees his life jacket. Of course, she can not swim and tone like a rock. The lawyer is rescuing, but miss the opportunity to run for dad. At one point Mom was told that her son died at a clinic in Mexico. He's still going, and where he stops no one knows! In a way, this movie really takes advantage of the kidnapping of children and that's not very positive. On the other hand, to look at how women are doing all the crazy things men do in such films was fun (or funny?).
