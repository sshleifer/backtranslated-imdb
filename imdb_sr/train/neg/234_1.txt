This film was intermittent, unwitting and fictitious. It was also a very fierce display of women. I rented it because it was referred to as a comedy (it's stretching), and because it says on the cover that Andy McDowell was playing the storm in it. She was not. I'm a girl, I watched this movie with two guys, and after that, for an hour after that, we exclaimed how bad it is. WARNING: SUMMARY OF THE PLOTS below! RAMPANT SPOILERS! The film begins with a rather tattered plot about an older woman dealing with a younger man, to the severe disapproval of her two jealous girls. They want to marry the boring guy of her years who is in love with her. But she is so happy with her hypersensitive puppy that you cheered for them to stab him, and of course, she decides to marry that guy. But her harp girl, assisted by the reluctant, sets a plot to deceive our heroine thinking that he is cheating. It works. She argues with him, runs out of the house and is broken by a truck (Remember the title of the movie?) So now she's dead, two thirds of the way through the movie. And although our heroine is a school principal who spends her time watching the girls, she obviously forgot to use contraception and is pregnant. She has already broken relationships with her friends, because they were so unsustainable. She and the poor, she decides to marry a boring guy. Did I mention that he is a boring guy who likes the minister? She asked him to marry a young boy (nice, huh?), But now he tells him that he will marry him, and there is obviously no objection to being screwed in that way. But her girls are rescued on the altar and taken away home, where they do not quite recognize that they are mostly responsible for falling in love with her life. She has a child. On the final scene, they leave him in bed at her house as they go out to the veranda to drink, smoke and be satisfied. I do not share you, that's so bad. I left out a piece about red herring and a funny lesbian moment.
