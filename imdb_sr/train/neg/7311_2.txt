I heard about this film very well, and when I came to the movie channels on TV, I wanted to watch it as a horror movie. I think I can work collectively "huh?" for everyone who watched it. I decided to continue with my life, but at a party with my closest friends, we saw that this was happening and that some of us already saw that we could laugh our way through it, we both proclaimed "This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen." It was not scary; I'll give it to Roth (which I think is a young man); characters change through the movie, ala "Cube". Still, despite your typical scenario of "rats in the cage" - who will involve whom, etc., was a rather average horror. > A few things: 1.) What happened to that kid? I'm not even saying that he was weird and busted people. I'm talking about the whole "slow-down karate hitting," what was that? 2.) Good. I know that Rider liked Jordan Ladda, but as a young woman, I was amazed that she just attacked and abused her in a dream. Uh, that's illegal. 3.) Roth was in the movie only that Roth could be in the movie. Talk about meaningless writing! 4.) What about the deputy? 5.) So, the dog immediately immediately separated it? And the rest is a little or no blood? Just a piece of her jeans? Anyway, we laughed, and I like to laugh at horror movies (Return of the Living Dead 2, Evil Dead), but I do not know if we were laughing here ...
