This excuse for the garbage for television is the worst piece of garbage ever hit by Australian television. Home couriers are boring, uninteresting, funny, unintelligent, and are chosen on the basis that you will probably try to kill them if you have to live with them. As far as I'm concerned, the Big Brother is a decline in the Western society, which shows how we as a society on a steep slope to become dead morons. What happened to a television that did not target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience? This can not be classified as a party. I think it's true that Ten Ten can remove your soul. This happened to Rove McManus, who was once a respectable comedian and, when he moved to Channel 10, he became terribly immortal. With the exception of Simpson, which is very intelligently made.
