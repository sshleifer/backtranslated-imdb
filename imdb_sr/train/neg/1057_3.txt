I'm sorry, I had great hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to keep my attention. When I realized that the whole movie was really just about the older guy living his dream, I felt cheated. It must have been a device that brought us to something deeper, something more meaningful. So, do not buy a great drink or you'll run into the toilet. My children did not enjoy it either. Ah well.
