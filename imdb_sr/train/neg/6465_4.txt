This Charles trip is decent, but this is a fairly low performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There is a sub-set with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland, who forgets to develop and a little painful film. I'm still trying to figure out why Charlie wants to change his name. Every film with Charles was pretty bad.
