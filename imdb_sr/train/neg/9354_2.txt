There is a key aspect of the movie that Jobson seems to have forgotten - he has the ability to tell the story by showing it to you. You do not have to tell the audience what to think, because it will see it. The action is shattered here with some of the toughest narratives launched by the public who does not doubt - the purple prose of the sensitive heels of the former. And this should be unnecessary, because it is nicely thrown here, and some are beautifully shot and recorded. Perhaps Jobbo felt that the basic story needed full support. And maybe he was right, he lacks the basic credibility: in the 70's, Edinburgh was not too full of beautiful smart girls with a propensity for Velvet Underground and a soft spot for a passing sociopath. Of the too tidy and modern clothes that the figure carries for the intellectualism of codfish who is trying to connect it all, it's all too much for my taste.
