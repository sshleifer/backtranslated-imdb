You believe in God or not. You believe in Jesus or not. You believe that He is the Son of God or you are not. The choice is yours. Director Denis Arcand truly did everything he could to restore Jesus to a mere historical figure, a social worker, the son of two men, instead of the Son of God, the Holy Spirit and Mary, who re-opened our paradise. By encouraging the Big Bang, the world comes from evolution, instead of seeing the beauty of creation. The film depicts a theologian who brings some "modern insights" to the actor who plays Jesus in the Passion game, which combines them happily in his play. played in Montreal has a sexual relationship with one of the players from the game Passion Play instead of showing his love for God through celibacy. Often it is clearly seen the depravity of the director towards the Church. The director tried to make a parallel between Jesus' life and the life of the actor Pasijada. This is a wonderful attempt, but showing the resurrection by organ transplantation for actors in other bodies means that the director thinks about Jesus. My opinion is not important, God's opinion is, but I would not want to fit on the feet of the director and actors when standing before Jesus' throne.
