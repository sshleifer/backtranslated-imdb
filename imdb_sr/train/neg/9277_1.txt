I saw a sign when I was 11 on TV. I enjoyed the Trilogy. When the opportunity came to finally see one in the cinema, I did not forward it. I went to the cinema knowing that what I see will not be a movie edition, but made for a TV movie. However, as a fan, I could not resist. But this Omen film that I saw at midnight projection did not bring the winters that made the laugh. A rational dialogue such as "it is written that if a baby cries during baptism, they reject the god there". What nonsense. Faie Grant so Good and V are wasting this letter from hell. No surprise and fun. However, I laughed several times in our bad situation. It was truly pathetic
