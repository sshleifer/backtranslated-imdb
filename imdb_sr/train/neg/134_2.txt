This film was super-smart. It's a theme song with every horror movie ever made. Valentine makes ZERO an attempt to be original. What is Valentine's Day? It's a crowd of people who give each other the same crazy messages given to the same people a year ago. There is nothing original in Valentine. I saw it only once, and on this one look here are some of the movies that it trod. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.Any other horror movie in which somebody kills somebody. I know there are more, but my mind is slowly turning into a bar of silk so I can not grab them as fast as they came. Valentine had no chance of being a good movie. How come every horror film must have a "surprising" killer, people who do not care because their emotions turn in every other scene. At one point, a beautiful girl turns into a B-cha, then she is an insecure woman, and so on and a son on. One more Valentine does not have this. It was as if they tried to make the PG-13, but they failed, so they left editing. Do not see that this is overly inspired, if you do not hate yourself and you want to die. <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
