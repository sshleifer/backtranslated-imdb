The Haunting is another bad remake with terrible special effects and a large number of favorites on the screen and has no features that can be used except perhaps for cinema. I guess actors A-List (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) are there to deter us from boring action, funny special effects, and terrible attempts to scare his audience, but this is a non-tabloid film I'm not interested in we care about the characters and the story of two things that this film missed. The story is like taking the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and digging up four chapters, and then using what's left for the movie is so boring and much unclear. The characters are fairly thin and while the acting is good, not one character is interested in you. Lili Tailor gives a terrible performance and sounds like she's 8 years old She's old when she delivers her lines not to mention what a horrible scream is. Lili Tailor was not made for a genre of horror. Ghosts are stupid and cheesy, they look like a bunch of Casper. The friendly spirit and spirit of Hugh Cain looks like a thick guy dressed as a dark reaper for the Night Witch with a smoke machine. There is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms which is a huge purple mouth and is not even funny inadvertently just sad. Beautiful and well designed, it's probably the only positive thing about this movie, it looks nice, but it does not save from brutal everything else. I can honestly say that I felt like spending my time watching The Haunting on TV at no cost so that I would still be pi $$ ed paying myself to see it, but luckily it was on the Scream Channel.Overall The Haunting is a boring remake who is trying to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a bad attempt at horror.
