When I read the back of the DVD, I thought it sounded really interesting ... so ... my mom threw it into a bunch of movies in the "4 for $ 20" blockbuster section. When we got home and flew into the movie ... twenty minutes into it, we found ourselves turning to one another, "this is bullshit. Let's put something else." I'll admit, a few rows from a friend in a cafe, we were a little laughing. But let's get some decent actors! From time to time in the film, if the acting is bad, and the film does not take place in a painful and slow manner and it seems interesting, I can blow it out and I laugh a little how the finished (or under) are doing their turn. But I can stand that much. The crying of the scenes seemed as if the actors had hysterical laughter movements, there was no delivery for their lines ... amateurs do not even approach the actors in this film. Anyone who came here when watching a movie, said that this movie is good on some really good drugs. It's ridiculous that I've ever had an unhappiness to watch. DO NOT READ OR BUY THIS FILM !!!!!
