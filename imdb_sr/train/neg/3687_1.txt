It's not just about being a bad movie; not only are four of the "best" Mexican filmmakers in this film; and not only is the script horrible. Just ... this movie is bullshit ... a lot of time. These people spend money on terrible scripts. It should criticize Mexican society, but we do have a lot of this kind of movie. Should a bad language should be ridiculous? I do not understand. Mexican cinema is in great trouble if such films continue to play (and be written and produced). and they do not reflect us.
