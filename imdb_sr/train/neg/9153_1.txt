I've never published a review before, but I had to do it for this movie! This film is so bad, I found myself trying to justify how bad it is by trying to be considered a spine or parody. But it's not. It's really, not self-consciously bad. This is a serious attempt to magnificently break through. Other reviewers have highlighted many shortcomings of the film, so I will try not to repeat them, but I invite you to watch this film. Through him I was or without words, literally diving from disbelief, or rolling on the floor in hysteria. I did not have much fun watching the movie for years. In fact, I will try to find all my friends to see it because it is the kind of film to be shared. My favorite parts: - When Arthur's auditions are on the move - Boy (his dance is incredible) - Free naked (director / leading actor just had to kill himself) - Office of the preacher with cardboard and the display of Christ crayons - Of course, the famous wedding scene with palm trees and forgotten rings (what kind of a narrative function ?!) - Wrestling with your ex-wife with Ben in possession of her pistol - A detailed sequence in which Artur killed the preacher; He obviously lit him up with this incredibly colorful battle - Yes, a gay religious fanatic brother with his blooming hair and VeHo fashions - And, my favorite, the use of Joplin's "The Entertainer" as a music background and "Pachebel's Canon in D Major" as a final sound record! - the list goes on and on - MUST SEE !!!
