For Daniel Auteuil, Queen Margot was much better. For Nastasj Kinski, "Paris, Tekas" was much better. The biggest disappointment was Chris Menges (CrissCross and A World Apart can not even be compared with this) and Goran Bregovic to use the version of the same music theme from Kueen Margot for this film at the end of the movie. If this was an American pop movie, I would not be surprised at all; but for a European film with more independent actors and directors, a similar common approach to child abuse without an original insight is very simple and disappointing. There are those bad guys who kidnap and sell underage people. There are poor children who hate people who sell them and are waiting for someone to save them. And finally, there's that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor kids from bad guys. Each character is represented by simple black and white expressions: good against evil. Plus, from the very beginning, I could understand how the story would end. Is this the end of the history of sexual abuse of children? I think that the difficult question of child abuse and pedophilia is much more complex than shown in this not exactly the original movie. I think this film was not disturbing, but very disappointing.
