I saw this film only once, and that was enough for me. The film has very little, if not at all, plot and it seems to be just a constant scene of psycho-sadistic violence and very little. I wanted to watch this movie because it was Zoe Trilling in the second "Night of the Demon;" and I wanted to see her playing someone normal. Unfortunately, the Tobe Hooper script barely starts and does not go anywhere, because Robert Englund dominates film and chewing landscape and plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; hiding from this movie!
