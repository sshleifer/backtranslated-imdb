First of all, this is not nearly as bad as any other garbage produced by the Sci-Fi channel; this does not mean that Grendel is a good movie, in fact, it's very bad, but definitely has the potential to be much better. The disadvantages of the film come from the design of characters, characters, absurd add-ons of stories, visual effects, music, and mostly: acting. When we talk about character design, I, of course, means the way our heroes and villains are watching. Beowulf and the other Danes look like ridiculous Vikings, not the brute force fighters - that helmet that our main protagonist wears is too stupid. Grendel looks like Hulk, but with strange tentacles - elbows. The characters are very limited. Beovulf is the same from the beginning to the end, but Finn - useless assistant - has achieved two-dimensionality, thanks to his romantic background, and Unferth gets a certain idea because he becomes less educated. Like Finn, there are also useless additions to this story to do it, while still holding the original material. The solitary man who has been given to Beovulf is so ridiculous, I am surprised that the actors did not leave the set. In addition to the additions, there are omissions, such as the basic themes of Christianity and Paganism, as well as the consequences of lies. Special effects are very terrible. Grendel and his mother The Hague are poorly designed, and as such, they are displayed on the screen less than convincing. The music is exaggerated, especially when the character dies. All in all, this is not the weakest Sci-Fi movie ever. It's actually one of the best movies, although it's still garbage, it's a good garbage, which at best makes it wrong. The only thing that works is the dialogue, which is still there and still there. I recommend you skip this movie and watch Robert Zemeckis take over the ancient story of Beovulf, simply because this film Grendel) is only half the story, not the whole thing, which this movie shows as a three star.
