The fact that this movie made a trip to Norway is bizarre. This movie is horrible. This picture quality is only one small bit a bit better than you got from a mobile phone, and the action is so bad. The main character is simply boring, and the rest is just bullshit. Every person associated with this film should be ashamed. The fact that people who made this movie put their name on this is exceptional. And distributors; did they even see it? This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Mark this comedy is an insult to humanity. I invite you not to support this film by buying or renting.
