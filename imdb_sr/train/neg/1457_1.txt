I watched this movie a few times and everything I can say is that it is a low budget garbage and has nothing to do with actual historical facts. The performances of the actors are very bad, but they are a result of limited acting possibilities. Anyone who watched this movie now probably think of Hitler as a crazy little crazy dog ​​that runs with a pistol like a Chicago gangster. I can only say that there are many better films about Hitler and Germany in those years and that the rise of evil is very below the average. I can recommend the German film Dovnfall in which you can see the brilliant performance of the Swiss actor Bruno Ganz in the scroll of Adolf Hitler.
