There is no artistic value in this film that deserves any reward. Well, it does not deserve the audience either. Ironically, one of the prizes is for cinema, but frankly speaking, camera movements are at least annoying. Every frame, you feel you get a "full picture," as if someone "cuts your gaze" from the edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I'll be honest, I could not stand watching the whole movie. The most sucking was when I saw soldiers who were having fun at their barracks and one of the soldiers persuaded him to drink alcohol. These and many other similar scenes have so much reminded me of Steven Seagal. Take my advice, stay away from this shit.
