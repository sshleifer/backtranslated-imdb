Want a great recipe for failure? Get one parcel, add some bad, completely underdeveloped characters, and insert the worst special effects that horror movie knew about. Let them cook for a week (how long it takes to make this waste). The result is Corpse Grinders, a film that takes bad films to dangerous and exotic low spots. The film is totally blowing. My words can not tell how hard it was to watch. This is not one of those bad films that you and your friends can sit down and laugh. This is not plan 9 out of the universe. This is a long, boring, sad waste of time. Corpse Grinders II is the biggest loss of energy and talent I've ever seen. It deprives me when I realize that people actually needed time to live in this shit, if you can call it acting. But, again, when you have a bad direction, bad narration, poorly everything, acting is the last thing to be criticized. , the fear that a friend or loved one might somehow see. I could somehow ruin every copy of this film with myself, so it will not pollute the minds of ambitious filmmakers. Thank you, Ted V. Mikels, you gave me a new respect for every movie I've ever seen. You showed me what's really terrible, and why would I appreciate all those movies that are just shitty or boring?
