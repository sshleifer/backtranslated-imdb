This film wants to explain that criminals are the product of a modern society. So, can thieves, rapists and murderers (the killer of this film, Carl Panzram (James Voods), all three and worse) be held liable for their actions? An interesting concept, but it is very difficult to bring it to the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfactory manner. And this is the place where Killer: The Murder Magazine is very short. Although the film attempts to put Panzram's behavior in perspective, with the retrospective of his violent youth and dysfunctional upbringing, the viewer never realizes that Panzram is a victim, not a culprit. Of course, the system is corrupt, with one mobster occupying the whole hospital bay of Leavenvorth prison (where most of the film takes place), most prison guards are sadistic violent, and the prison director is something like a megalomaniac despot. But why, unfortunately, the new prison guard Henri Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard) condemns Panzram? Even after I read his terrible logs? The film offers some explanations: The smaller Panzram witnesses are beaten to the worst sadistic (and stereotyped) guards and are impressed with Panzram's intelligence (although it is not clear why Lesser thought this man was so smart). Certainly this is not enough to sympathize with a hostile man like Panzrama, although this film tends to diminish his crimes and emphasizes his personality? The smaller, Panzram is fairly loyal, and the viewer is given the impression that for Less this outweighs all the crimes he has read in Panzram's diaries. Does this man have so little friends that he took it in his eyes to anyone who only seems friendly to him? Perhaps the Lesser Product of a Modern Society, judging by its appearance, and not by its essence. I can advise the Monster, with Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, as a film dealing with about the same themes of more integrity and scope. BTV: The killer looks like it was filmed for TV (not really good)
