This is a complete hoax ... The film is clearly recorded in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan. See the scene of the chase - the vehicles are Indian; Writing is all the Hindi language used in India. The ride is on the typical streets of Jaipur. Also, the palace is in America - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The filmmakers in their (on film) DVD Bonus appear to sound like they risked their lives by shooting in Kabul and its surroundings. Almost all of their action scenes were recorded in India. The scene in which the band singing about the fire is so fake that they did not even think that the changes in the folk song Afghans. They just recorded the folk song of Rajasthani. How I know it, because I've visited the area. They're just on the caravan to make a big problem. I challenge filmmakers to deny it.
