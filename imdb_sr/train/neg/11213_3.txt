OK ... I'm watching a lot of bad movies. I am proud of that fact. Many times there are some gems in B bombs. But this film is one of the worst I've ever seen. I love a good horor movie ... but one with a complication and a sense of motion. The introductory scenes looked pretty good. Competent music and pictures. Then it goes downhill. One of the main characters has a disability (ringing in the ears called Tinitus). Now he will threaten to reveal his secret. They focused too much on the film. So, what rang into his ears and accidentally left his ear plug where he was not supposed to be. There's no need to keep talking about it. So this guy has an affair with that girl, and in a motel he falls and hits his head at the table. So, instead of everyone knowing about his affair, he decides to throw the body out. Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her. Well, after seeing her sister again (like a zombie like a ghost) and even pointing directly to the location of her body, she finally finds out. Now the body is recovering and it is ready to fight with one single suspect who killed her. The bad thing is that she did not have a lot of plans. Just pretending to be her twin and meeting the man where the body was thrown. Idiot did not even think he killed her. So everything is discovered there, even though she had a gun ... she somehow managed to get rid of her. So, the last scene of the film is the "spirits" of her and her twin who come out of the water. So you want to tell me this movie to win a bad guy. And not one, but two innocent men die. Good things about the movie: pictures Bad things about the movie: long sound effects of music and drawn the wrong direction of work at a low level of action from some not all actors
