'Anita and me' is a drama about growing up in a multi-ethnic Britain, like 'Bend It Like Beckham', or, closer, 'East is East', with which it shares the 1970's. The tone is decisive chirps (in spite of the sudden black accents of the country), but the film is missing. East is the energy of the East and the result looks rather thin and banal. Moreover, showing the central relationship between the film, between the Asian woman and her white friend, is not deep enough to justify the way the film is structured around it. I also got tired of movies in which a hero's year was a writer, which is, of course, often something that the real writers have experienced, but it's hardly a fresh element in a fictional story. 'East is East' was fun and sharp; 'Anita and I' seem to be obviously boring in comparison.
