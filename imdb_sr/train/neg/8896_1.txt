I saw Brigadon on television last night (September 12, 2009). I'm 61 years old and I watch movies as much as I remember. I can truthfully say that Brigadoon stands alone as the worst movie I've ever seen. Accents were embarrassing. The local kids club would produce better kits. The characters were so wooden that they probably collected a dry rot from the tear of cartridges who had an accident to watch them. It should be hoped that the stars of this film had enough thick skin to protect them from the shame they suffered when watching this movie. The owners of this burden should provide great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film.
