Yesterday I saw a movie "Flibois" and my girlfriend told me it was the worst movie she ever saw ... Since when I thought it was pretty scary, it made me think - which movie was the worst movie I've ever seen I've ever seen it and it was the only movie that came to my mind. Unfortunately, it's been a few years since I saw him, but I remember the terribly wrong presentation by Dean Cain as a confident soldier (the handsome boy Cain does not work very confidently) well. A strange agreement with the CGI helicopter, if it would probably be cheaper to hire a helicopter rather than hire some CGI guys to install it, but I think they found the helicopter as a free sample for some CGI program or the producer's son liked to play with his new computer. And how did it look? Terrible. And when the dragon charges the corridors of the complex, then it uses the same images again - it looks very cheap. Avoid this film - it's really terrible ...
