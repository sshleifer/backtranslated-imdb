Probably it was just my DVD - but I would not recommend that anyone try to watch this image on a DVD. I had to increase the sound volume on TV to the highest possible level, in order to hear about 80% of the dialogue. Some of the conversations remained sub-sounding. If you are from Scotland, you may have a chance, though thin. People's voices are submerged by almost all ambient sounds, including unwinding packages, steps, even smoking cigarettes. With the volume level up to the level at which the voices are heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will call the police when the scene changes into a loud environment, such as a disco. And you will be injured by diving for the remote control to get it back. There is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort, during the war, would meet international criteria to be classified as a crime. After about half an hour, I gave up, since I did not see anything else that could be imagined in the picture.
