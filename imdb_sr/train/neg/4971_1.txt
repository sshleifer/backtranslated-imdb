I work in the Blockbuster store and every week we have movies that come with just a few copies, these are the types of movies that the Sci-Fi channel displays. A film that nobody ever wants, and only those idiots rent, when I return it I ask them "was it good?" They say "we did not turn it off after 15 minutes!" Films with terrible computer-generated, super-imposed monsters and the like, very unattractive. This is the same type of film that is Grendel, and the absolute loss of time, if you want reasonably (and only reasonably)) Good Beovulf movie then try Beovulf & Grendel, starring Gerard Butler, who also starred in an impatient 300, like King Leonidas of Sparta. Plus, later this year we have another Beovulf movie starring Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson to Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. For another big disappointment. As for renting, this is my rule: if there is only one or two copies, do not rent it because it's crap. % of time, usually not true if the page title, or documentary.)
