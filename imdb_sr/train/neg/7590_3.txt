Beautiful bodies, sumptuous colors and camera work, pretentious dialogue, banal plot. The name of primadone, Kamile and the often-appealing flowers of the same name are enough to remind us of similarities from Dumas's novel La Dame auk Camelias, a Camille film starring Garbo and (I think) Robert Tailor, and the last but not the least Verdi's opera La Traviata . Beautiful, not very vile young ladies, for one reason or another forgiven, they love, split, reunite in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene ... One forgets the banal complications and stupid unreal dialogue in the opera, but why it is taken away from Haiaku , Don Sutherland, LA's beautiful performance in the 1930s, the earthquake deus ek machin that perfectly kills another woman, and all that beauty in this central Turkey where there is no good singing?
