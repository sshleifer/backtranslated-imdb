It's like the title of this topic. The only impression I got from this film was that the character of Marley Matlin was always angry, so cynical and so pathetic. The first blend of her character with the character Villi Hurt where they danced were stupid. All in all, I tried to finish watching the movie four times, and I've fallen asleep four times. I would continue to watch this film with one intention ... to win my problem with insomnia, because all I need is to sleep me. Sveet dream.
