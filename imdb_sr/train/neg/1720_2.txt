A lot of unprofessional actors are terrorizing the prehistoric being. This creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal stop-motion animation, but oh, how long will you be after that margin when you replace the rest of the animation film with production assistants waving around the inner tube with your teeth. There is no time for terror when this film is hijacked halfway through these comic relief boats, which suddenly become the main characters; but you have to admit again that you're watching them trying to be funny, better than walking around after the sheriff. Only at the end one of them eats, and another leaves to sit on a stone crying tears of loneliness - it's not fun!
