To start by telling me how much I love the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man who apparently could not realize his dreams because of his oholog, manipulative father, it was incredibly easy and fun to watch in practice. In my opinion, this is no doubt one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has 10 out of 10 ratings without reserve. On the other hand, this film is a real tragedy in every sense of the word. It is difficult for any essence of the TV show to be successfully transmitted to the film. This film has a very gloomy, depressing tone that almost always led me to tears. It seems that Harold was beaten in a pub (not in a comical way) is not my comedy idea, but it's definitely one of the reasons why TV fans will not love this movie. The film was painfully immortal except for the scene where Albert bathes in the sink and sees a neighbor. The romance between Harold and Zita is completely futile and it seems like I wonder if the producers of this film have ever tried to watch the TV series. In the TV series, Harold always looked for respectable girls, not strippers. Albert's response to Harold's remarks was absolutely priceless in TV shows. In the film, Albert says almost nothing when this opportunity is raised. Most movie spin-offs of British comedians are usually pretty boring, with the notable exception of ON BUSES movies (which in some respects were actually better than the TV series itself!). But, STEPTOE AND SON must rank at the very bottom of the crowd, even below GEORGE AND MILDRED. My advice - skip this and see the other spin-off, STEPTO AND SON RIDE instead. It has a much lighter tone, it is more loyal to the TV series and it's actually very fun.
