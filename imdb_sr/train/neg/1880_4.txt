Despite being a big fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, only six years ago I first saw 'Follov the Fleet'. I knew all the songs from the old Astaire / Rogers record (yes, vinyl), but I did not know anything about the plot. I just can not love Bake Baker. While trying to make up for his longtime partner, he constantly sabotages her career. His character does not have the usual humor and the character of other films' Astaire characters. It's worth watching the songs and the excellent solo routine of Ginger Rogers.
