Unusual charisma Martin Koslek brings a certain loyalty to his character as a frustrated artist. He intertwines his dialogue with a strange sense of realism, making sculptor Marcela a convincing individual. The character manages to come across a real person and not so much on the typical B film criminal. The story does not mean anything about which one can write, and many scenes are boring. What makes the work is a weird chemistry between Koslec and Randy Hatton as a craze. Kosleck's conversational, philosophical character is contrary to Hatton's low key, a monosilabic approach. Creeper's character was not developed much more than the basic level of the monster, but Hatton proposes underdeveloped opportunities and makes you wonder about his back story. I have a certain nostalgic affection for it. It's worth seeing it once, for those who enjoy horror films in the forties.
