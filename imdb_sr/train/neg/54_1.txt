The only good thing about this movie was the clip of Goldie Havn, who was standing in her little French bikini panties and struggled to keep dozens of other wretched women from removing her little warm cotton top as she whistled and giggled. Ooooof! Her thighs are against Nina Hartley. This film came out when I was fourteen years old and that shot almost killed me. I forgot all that was hidden in the mischievous Roladek of my mind until I saw him the other day on TV, where they actually blurred its central part in that scene, a good sorrow, reminding me of what the smoker was on the woman Goldie Havn was in the eighties . Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.
