Welcome to a bad story about ghosts and somebody's nightmare. This terrible story reveals that the newly married husband (John Hudson) and his wife (Peggy Weber) persecuted the memories of his previous wife and screamed the skulls found in their empty villa and the lily pond. Does the husband really try to get rid of his already distressed bride? Or was it the gardener Mickey (Alec Nicol) who was involved in learning and who took care of the palace from the death of the original lover of the house? This horror film in a series of budgets has a story that leads you to the end of the finale. Special effects are pretty bad even under the standards of 1958. I swear that the screaming skull sounds like it's in the Godzille movie. Also in acting as Reverend Substance is actor Russ Convai. Otherwise ... the luring gardener (Nicol) is the director of the film. You can capture it as part of the AMC Monsterfest.
