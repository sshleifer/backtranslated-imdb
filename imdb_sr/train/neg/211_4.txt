A hilariously obvious "drama" about the bunch of high school students (I think) of children who enjoy non-stop hip-hop, break dancing, graffiti and trying to become a DJ in Rocky - or something like that. To be completely honest I was so boring that I forgot! Even people who love music agree that this movie is terribly behaving and - as a drama - unsuccessfully repeats itself. We should find these kids nice and nice. I found them bored. The one I really hated was Ramon. He made graffiti on the subways and this is considered to be great. Sorry? It destroys state property that is not his. Such "big" girls go into the city's electricity to keep a big party in the abandoned building. Uh huh. We should find a bunch of legal and entertaining law lovers. I can forgive all this if the music is good, but I can not stand the hip hop. The songs were - at best - central and were uninterrupted! They used to play! It came to my point that I quickly went through many endless music numbers. (Cut your music and go to a 30-minute movie - maybe) There are several imaginative numbers - the fight for dancing in the underground, a really fun Santa number and Climate Rock Emissions. If you love hip hop here is your movie. But you're looking for a good drama mixed up - forget it. Also, how did this get a PG grade? There is an incredible amount of cursing.
