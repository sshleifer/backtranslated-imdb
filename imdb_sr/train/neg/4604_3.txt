I have to tap my back because I watched this movie, because it's really painful. An incompetent painter becomes a fully capable killer? This film was full of absurdity, if I mentioned them, I would give a movie. Norm Peterson, aka George Vendt, must really be in the track that he agreed to this film. The act was sad and the story was even worse. As a healthy and intelligent individual, I could not understand where the writer came from and where he goes with this film. There was incompetence of every major character, there were a series of unhappy and funny events, and then the film was over. An absurd act for dialogue with dialogue does not make a movie, it just makes conversation with the train.
