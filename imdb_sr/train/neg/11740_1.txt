George Sanders' positively terrible vehicle, from which the thief was transferred to the police emperor. While Sanders was a great art actor, he certainly was not the leading man and this film proves it. <br /> <br This is absolutely beyond stupidity. Gene Lockhart provided some comic relief until he instilled a moment of anger to fire his pistol with a tragedy. Unfortunately, George Sanders and co-actress Carol Landis committed suicide in real life. After making the film so unfortunate, it's not shocking. The usual attractive Signe Hasso is not really anything.
