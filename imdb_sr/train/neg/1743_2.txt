Contrary to his title, this film does not offer any spice, so the audience is exposed to a tasty meal. Whole Humor seems compulsive, theatrical, mechanical, set, recalling those Pakistani performances available on the video, including even manners. All screams, yelling and doing strange things for no reason. The premise looks interesting, as it is a direct lift from Hollywood's 'Boeing Boeing'. John Abraham, who is so natural in almost all his films, is totally unsuitable here. If we maintain a morality factor, even then the bizarre events seem to be numb. Kumar and Paresh Raval, two experienced brave men, are trying to lift the film to natural but vain, at least the characters of the three girls are contrasting in order to bring some interesting elements, but unfortunately, all of these are also those who are sinless, bukomed bimbettes (3Bs) who talk, behave and even scream in a very similar way. The main conspiracy hole is what kept the protagonist three girls in his same house pretending to never know about each other? The same could be done in hundreds of other ways, so there are so many dramabazi for no reason what the audience will easily digest. Uch movies are great beginners. Now for those who call it situational comedy, I call it pathetic taste. The sense of humor of such a cinematographic audience is surely corrupt and crazy to the extent that they connect with the sadistic, weird and disturbing type of humor, where characters are not allowed, but to themselves and to themselves the frustrations we are watching as we become meaningless in order to laugh must bear such things?
