Before I start, I'm Eddie Izzard. I think he is one of the funniest stands today. Maybe that means I'm going into this with too many expectations, but I just did not find Eddie on this trip. I think the main problem is that Eddie is too busy to be Eddie. Everyone knows him as a totally unimportant comic, and we all love him for that. But in the circle, it seems to go more for irrelevant than ridiculous, and completely lost me in places. Many of the topics he covered earlier - I even thought I recognized several recycled jokes there. If you buy a DVD, you will find a look behind the scenes on Eddie's tour (interesting in places, but not so funny), and the French version of one of his shows. Die-hards will enjoy watching Eddie in another language, but the subtitled comedy is not very funny. Buy what I say. If you just go shopping, buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill - you will not be disappointed. With Circle, you'll probably be.
