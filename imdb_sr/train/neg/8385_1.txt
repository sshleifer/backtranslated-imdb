I just realized that by watching this film I lost the precious precious moments of my life, I will never return. This film is not only bad. He reminded me of every stereotyped black shot ever made. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I watched this movie. because there are no white actors. Mate, I think you will find the reason why nobody liked this because watching dry colors is far more fun and fun than this pile of nonsense.
