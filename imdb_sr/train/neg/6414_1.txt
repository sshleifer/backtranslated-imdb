This is by far the worst part of cr4p I've ever seen in my life. That hardly made sense. It was not scary at all (unless you're scary as loud noise and screaming?) Sarah-Michelle Gellar should stop these horror films. I think everyone in the cinema agreed with me when I shouted "SHITE" when the loans were raised. On my list of the worst films ever made, this will go like this: 1. Return 2. Cabin Fever 3. Silent Hill The reason I am made by Silent Hill 3rd is because he showed some scary scenes, but the rest was an absolute cr4p. The same with the cabin, it makes no sense, but the return has surpassed that list. It's worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever together
