Think about the "scene game". This is worth a look at once for performances by Lionel Atvill and Dvight Frie. Compare Melvin DOuglas to "Ghost Story" with Melvin DOuglaso this movie. Is there a vampire at liberty in this 'Bavarian' village, or is there a more natural, but equally evil explanation? Dvight Frie is Herman, a red herring, which is thrown like a particularly gentle character. It's fun to watch his different facial expressions in what's really a stock figure. It does not happen much for a long time, but then we discover that Atvill's pipe doctor is a real killer. There are too many "comic reliefs", but this is a couple for this time. Fai Vrai looks really good.
