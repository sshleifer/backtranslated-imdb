I just watched an episode of this program and I could not even get to the end of the program. Every moment I watched this program, my IK had to fall by about 10 points. It's basically like a children's program, but with cursing. Even the swearing and insults she talked to others did not laugh. After all, the story has to be written by a monkey and people who actually put this script for this shooting program must have been held under the gun and had no choice but to shoot this retarded, disappointing, horrible acting program. Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she made from this program and get some damn lessons.
