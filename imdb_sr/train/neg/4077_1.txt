What do you get when you have bad acting, bad directing, scenes that are painfully long, terrible illumination, painful editing and terrible effects? You get Jessica: The story of ghosts seems to be shooting at betacam, which is fine, but the lighting has to complement this medium. In this case, no. There are several CUs where the person's face is completely shaded. One scene is especially a psychiatrist scene. It's a joke if you ask me. Some of the scenes were so long that they could easily be halved ... but I guess they would not have a movie at length. The main character is incredibly flat. He is the LEAD male, so he should have some elements of the "hero" in his character, but he does not do it. He blew and scared the whole movie. I could proceed, but I do not want to waste my time. Although the lighting was terrible, I must say that they had a nice camera movement. It's a shame that the lighting did not complicate it. The DVD cover is beautiful and it ends. Just terrible.
