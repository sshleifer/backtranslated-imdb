All the ingredients of a low b-film cult movie. Topless (and no bottom) girl, kung-fu kicking chefs, slave traders, wicked Germans with mustache, Cameron Mitchell and zombies with swords. And, of course, Camille Keaton Breast, which is most famous, appears in classical feminist exploitation and Spit on Iour Grave. We also have to mention the juices of Shepard, who play the whore in the recent The Cooler movie. Full blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts among toples dancers in the bar, whore, and on a ship moving from martial artists who go to some zombie island where bad fighters are dying or something like that. The tops and bottoms are easy and often removed because the passengers are well lubricated thanks to the Owner of the ship. Then the disaster worsens when their ship is destroyed and landed on a zombie island where mass monks sacrifice young girls to dead fighters to bring them back to life. Just when you thought it had everything, they were pirated in the water. Ium Ium Great German German for dinner. Just for your next zombie fest.
