The words "Swedish" and "action movie" do not interfere. This becomes more apparent with every genre attempt. This is another unsuccessful attempt. One day, foreign criminals threaten to harm his family if they do not do what they tell him. They want secret equipment and do everything to get it. This film has ups and downs. And usually in Swedish action films there is no "rise", but "fall". I suppose something in this film has shown some quality. To begin with positive comments, I can note that the film is technically well-made. The recordings of airplanes and helicopters that fly are well recorded and look very nice. The acting is of very different quality. Shanti Ronei makes a decent performance while Maria Bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual (I wonder how long will Swedish directors continue to use it although she has the acting ability of a wooden board?). Stefan Sauk is ridiculous as a "cool" man of special forces coming to the base to explore. And what about action scenes? As I said above the scenes of planes and helicopters, flying is nice. But, in addition, there is not much action to talk about. And this is a common problem with Swedish action movies. Simply does not happen enough. Maybe it's a budget issue, maybe it's a film culture. I do not know, but it negatively affects the experience. Frankly, the story and the acting are not good enough to rely on this film. I rate this grade 4/10 for effort.
