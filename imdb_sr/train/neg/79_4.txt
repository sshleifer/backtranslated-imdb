The original book was set out in the 1950s, but it will not be for the TV series because most people look for a style from the 1930s. Ironically, the tube train near the end was a 1950s train that looked like a 1930s train, so Underground can play in that game. The hanging story of the story of Jarra's March was weak, but the version of the 50s had students who began to think about the world around them, so I guess they make them think about the poverty of the participants. All the things that Japp had to take care of himself was also bad, but they had to invest in something to fill the time. That would make a decent half-hour show or they could record a book and make it a better long show. Obviously, this episode is a victim of style compared to content.
