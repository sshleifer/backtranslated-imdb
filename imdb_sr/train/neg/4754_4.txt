I loved the original. It was great and it will always be. Strange, however, I rejoiced that I would see again. I'm usually a little against re-creation, because there are too many of them, but somehow it's somehow intrigued me. I really enjoyed it. Caine is brilliant, as usual, and Jude Lew manages to stick to herself. It was pretty smart how it was modernized and functioned. What keeps this from getting really good is the last seven minutes. It is completely distancing itself from the original, so far it actually stops being clever and just bored. The end in the original was fantastic! So much tension was built and it was incredibly smart! This? It does not grow in tension, but in frustration because it seemed that they decided to make Caine's character homosexual. It was if they were trying hard to make a difference. And then ... BANG! The law is dead. Roll Credits. This movie is worth watching only for performances, but they have really dragged it down for the past seven minutes. What a shame....
