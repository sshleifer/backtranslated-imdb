Look, there's nothing spectacularly offensive about this movie, it's just boring. It's a typical rom-com with the ending you can see before you've seen as much as a trailer. The key difference is that classical rom-coms deal with their stories with the spirit and lack of pretensions. This movie has no pretension, but there really is no sense of motion, you feel like you can stand up and walk at any moment. Film production also has a sense of debut film made fifteen years ago. I would recommend you to watch a classic movie again when Harry met Salli instead of this shallow imitation. Oh, another big problem ... no chemistry. If you're used to seeing Michael look sweet as Vaughn in Alias, you will be seriously disappointed with the way they made him look here.
