I fell asleep on my couch last night at 7:35 am watching Larry Sanders (I usually directed it, but not last night). He woke up at 3 AM (a bank investor on the west coast), and was fascinated to see this on HBO2. I was shocked that this movie was bad. Seriously. shocked. So shocked that I had to write a comment on iMDB. This is really very bad. Writing is bored, but directing and editing are simply below the mode of friars at the film school. Yes, it's a clip. Keep in mind that it was recorded on VIDEO, not on DIGITAL VIDEO. It looks like a soap opera. Clips from a skateboard video have more "movie" feel for them than that horror. I wanted to describe a bad directing, but honestly I can not remember anything. Videos and blocking are stupid. Yes, I chose the word 'stupid'. not unconventional, not brave, not brave, not boring, just stupid. I know people who review this review will say "good, give me a case". Can not. It was 3 o'clock in the morning. but believe me, I know that you will look at it anyway, you will be attracted by horrific reviews. <br /> <br />
