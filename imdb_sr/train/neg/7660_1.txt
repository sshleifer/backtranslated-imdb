Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Valker, Vill Sanderson. Directed by: Uwe Boll. Based on the video game director Uwe Boll is trying to recreate the game in the action pack of nails that unfortunately does not work. Instead, he makes one of the worst movies ever! Though there are fewer celebrities like Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, his film does not have the necessary basics to make the movie a good one, such as a story, and some basic relativity of what is happening in the dark and light. The film revolves and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And not to mention the bad CGI used to make the monster. Although they looked cool and the feed was good, a bit lame. Frankly, this is one of the worst movies ever made. My final rating is 0/10.
