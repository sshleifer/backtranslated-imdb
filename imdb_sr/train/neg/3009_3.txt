That song keeps pounding in my head. Not the best song, but the 80s. This film talks about a singer who "guesses" that he will be killed while being charged with murder while he catches his girlfriend singing backup vocals in her band. The main singer, who is called Billi "Eie" (yes, right) is dead after two years and his band returns to the concert is just a spare vocal singer this time. Billy is following her and eventually moving around killing all these people and scaring the girl and making people around her thinking that something is wrong with her and that she is imagining things. Finally he decides to go to the graveyard and dig his grave to see if he is still there. She sees that she is dead, but she still sees and hears his voice. At the end of the film we find out the reason behind all this, Billy has a brother named John (again right) and John admits he was jealous of his brother and killed all those people to return to him and kill him. blamed his brother and then took his girlfriend and terrorized her because she called him crazy. The ending is very slippery, and the performance is very limp and woody. But ... I like it anyway. I'm watching him for a song. I wish I had it.
