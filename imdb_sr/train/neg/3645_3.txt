A young man gets a bad day by his hair, goes up the hill and falls where he can not escape. Then, he meets MR. ATLAS, a "mythological" man of 2000 years ago as his best friend, and Arnold Schvarzenegger looks and sounds like that. His Herculean force helps the boy in danger, and later adapts to modern life. Then what's the big deal? This is the worst idea of ​​a "family trip"! In any case, this should not have been tried at all, really! Our fictitious character of power and muscle is nothing more than a typical stranger that looks like a common remnant of the universe. Adding to blasphemy is the lack of anything new or appealing, and before you find out, there is an attempted violence that does not qualify as a "family" party. However, the scene in which Atlas complains about his shorts. Spend a nice, quiet afternoon in the park for a change.
