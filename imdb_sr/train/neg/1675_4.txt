The plot was certainly interesting enough. How can life brutal murder be transformed into a truly boring film? Well, you can watch "Wonderland" and find out. I heard about the killings of Wonderland before this film was published and found that this is an interesting truth story of some genuine sadistic people. Unfortunately, there is a zero character development, so we will never get an opportunity to understand why any of this has been done or to get a good sense of interaction between characters. The pace of the direction was very tiring. All this leads to an extremely boring film. Since Dawn Schiller - the central character of Holmes 'girlfriend - was a producer and Holmes' wife was a consultant on the film, we should have the opportunity to gain some real insights into the characters.
