I watched the Imdbs bottom 100 because I thought I had never seen anything bad like Plan 9 out of space or Roller Ball remake, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur won both of them. This is from many countless movies that I've seen the worst movie in the world that I've ever seen. Bad director, bad characters, terrible acting, terrible story There's a reason why no one but Sam does ever say anything positive about this movie. He was a dreadful and boring actor himself, but his direction was so bad he could get Ed Vood out. be set stars.
