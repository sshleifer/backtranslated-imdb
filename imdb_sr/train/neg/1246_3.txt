I suppose they're spoilers. Apsurd logic ending destroys entire movie. I just could not get over it. And what's wrong with the character of Mark Wahlberg? If I suddenly find myself on a planet full of monkey who talk, I would be like "AAAAhhhhHHH! Run for your lives! Monkeys have inherited the Earth!" But he's like, "the monkey's story, okay. Next?" I would say that. He needs to encounter more strange things on a regular basis. In addition, this is the best work of Rick Baker. This film is a genuine proof that we have long come to the apron makeup area. 3/10.
