I watched it just because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and I had Claudio Cassinelli, the actor I liked. I must have been disappointed. The idea that convicted prisoners will fight to death due to TV rating is overstated with Rollerball, Logan Run, Blade Runner and the new Death Race, which will surely suck me in because it shines Jason Statham. It was mostly boring. The "Kill Bike" campaign was ridiculous. "Training" was drowsy. He just did not grab me and made me worry about anyone, including Dallas Jared Martin or Fred Villiamson. Choose one of the other and you will be better.
