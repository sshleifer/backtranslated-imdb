Big hair, big tits, bad music and giant safety needle ... these are the words that best describe this horrible movie. I love siren horror films and I've seen hundreds ... but this has to be at the worst ever made. The action is paper thin and funny, the acting is disgusting, the scenario is completely funny (it's best to end a bribe with a cop and how it worked out who is the killer - it's so damn terribly written), the clothes are disgusting and funny in equal measure, a lot of suckers refuse, men wear those cut-out shirts that show their stomachs (disgustingly what men actually worn !!) and music is just a synthesizer of garbage that is played over and over again ... in almost every scene there are garbage of music, breasts and nurses who take away the bodies ... and the gym is still not closed because of Grief !! All jokes aside this is a really bad movie whose only charm is to look back to a disaster that was 80's and have a good old laugh as everything was bad then.
