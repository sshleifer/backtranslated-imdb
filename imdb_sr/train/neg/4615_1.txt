I may not have the longest attention span, but this is the second film I refused to see until the end, I even bought it on DVD for its "classic" status. At first I thought the director was playing a big joke, so I was still waiting for the resolution, something I'm laughing at, something that will keep my interest, but this resolution has never come. Instead, the writing was ridiculously amateur, the film took place and it felt unconnected, as if someone had cut the TV series to a feature film. The Academy must have been on drugs when they nominated this film for no less than eight Oscars. Once again I repeat myself. This is the second film that I refused to watch until the end. The first was "Exterminator". I hope this gives you an indication of how badly it really is. 1/10
