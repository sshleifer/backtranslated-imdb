Natural, uber-stupid frat boys who still lead JACKASS or Tom Green will find the idea of ​​faecal matter coming out of a tube, SEX OLIMPICS (I really do not have to give you details, do I), and a clown who essentially makes me It's a "not very expensive clown," which I've already seen ninety times, eat this as a balege: well, more power for you. I just want to say it, despite what you've heard, this film in no way was a model for many endlessly entertaining movies such as KENTUCKI FRIED MOVIE or not. Skit film has already been done in the US And now for something completely different, everything you ever wanted to know about sex, and so on. And the better.
