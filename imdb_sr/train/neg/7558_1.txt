Whatever you do, do not waste time on this pointlessly. Movie. Remake that did not have to be recounted. Everyone who came from the theater had the same comments. The worst movie I've ever seen. Save your time and money! Nicgolas Cage drove the bike over the hills, swam in the dark water, and rolled down the hill while being attacked by bees, but still his suit was perfectly bent and the shirt was white until the last scene. Although a good actor with Ellen Bernstein and Cage's acting was as incredible as the movie itself. It's amazing how good actors can do such bad films. They do not get the first copy of the script. If you still have interest in watching a movie, at least wait for it to appear on DVD.
