I often do not watch a movie that's as scary as this one. I continued to look at each moment, hoping that this was conceived as a joke just to find out that this was meant to be taken seriously. Well, seriously like this genre. The acting was embarrassing and the situations were terribly fabricated and clichÃ©d. If the film was made in 1920 (for example) and had the quality of Hide & Seek (Cord) in its direction, we consider that the film was naive then. As it happens, this film was made in 2000, and I have not yet seen a silent-era movie that has as much charm as this one. Definitely not for serious movies. /> <br /> [Not worth the rating]
