I'm so disappointed. This film left me feeling that I was out of my time and mental energy. Here again, the essence of Voodley's Allen film was again: the upper-class neurotic Manhattanites who were discussing whether or not they would cheat on their spouses. Wow, I've already seen these characters, but I've seen it a dozen times from you. Where did your creativity go? You must open your eyes and look around you. The world has changed dramatically from Annie Hall - and you have to change with it. It has many more interesting and fun scenarios to which you can apply your brand angst and neuroticism - why not try instead of again re-extruding the same old slap. When I hear that Voody Allen has a new project, he does not do anything for me - because now I expect to wait for the old standby: a couple who are dying and who eventually cheat. Depressed and the same old, the same old. If Voody wants to win her fans, then she must understand that our sense of humor and intelligence must be stimulated-not offended.
