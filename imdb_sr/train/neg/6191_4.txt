I watched this film, along with any other adaptation I could get, including watching the shows in preparation for some academic research. Cinema is very mobile, as well as music. Unfortunately, all life is taken out of the story. I've never seen such a terrible picture of Mr. Rochester. All his most basic traits have disappeared. Where is his ghost? Where is his passion? Scott's Rochester resembles Rochester's film, St.John, rather than the character from the novel. In fact, the actor who plays St.John in this adaptation played passionate St.John while Scott is pleased to break things or just staring at the ceiling (which he is constantly working). I have no idea what they thought. I would like to give this film a little more votes based on wonderful music and cinema, but I can not sincerely support this film too long because of George C.'s performance. Scotta.
