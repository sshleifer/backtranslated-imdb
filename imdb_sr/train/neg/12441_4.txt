Some things need to be clarified. Picture of Ferris is not Mark Ferris who played in this movie. I know it because he was my dad. Please remove this image. Also, Mark Ferris was a writer, at least one of them. I'm trying to find a copy again or a way to look at this movie again. It's been years since anyone can point me in the direction of getting a copy, that would be great. The film was not so bad, and tried to compare it with today's world of Star Wars and other high tech sci fi fi. If you watch it, just enjoy it being involved and witty. Get rid of movie snobs and enjoy some less creative and innovative movies.
