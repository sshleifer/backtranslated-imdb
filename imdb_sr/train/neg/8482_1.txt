Some of my old friends suggested that I watch this movie, but I have a chance only recently. I had great hopes to see something interesting from Kamala Hanse, what I saw was a bunch of angles of blending that were mixed at high speed. I could not understand what the message was except for humiliating Hinduism. I am more like a type of religion, but I felt that Kamal Hasan was a man of low character who orchestrated this kind of thought. He could have made a horror movie of this shit. He tried to add a Hollywood genre of the virus, and God do not let him turn it into a mutant and eventually go to world domination. This is a very convenient movie movie school versus regular public. You're ashamed of not having the talent he has. The beginnings of the stories tried to get Haos to borrow ideas from the butterfly effect, and then between a little religious harmony at the cost of offensive Hinduism (I once again offended Hinduism, but this film has no equality and my insult is the same for a religion that could have been this intellectual film at all. )
