I have absolutely no knowledge of the writer Phillip Pearce or any of her novels, and if TOM'S MIDNIGHT GARDEN is typical of her work, I probably would not be interested in her books as a child. When I was a kid, I was not interested in litters if they did not have soldiers who fought with a high number of bodies. middle class children, as most stories turn around Tom Long's protagonist who moves into a house without a garden, and then suddenly finds metaphysical. Having your own garden is undoubtedly something that people from the working class did not have in the fifties, so I suppose there is somewhere a sub-text of the political class. There is a romance that includes a young girl named Hattie, but are cynical children again fond of love stories? Perhaps the worst criticism is that very little excitement or adventure occurs within narration. This is a children's movie that looks like it's dated from its source. It's harmless, but I'm surprised at his high rating by the IMDB voter. I wonder how many would have given them so high ratings that there were 10-year-olds who just saw the trilogy of the ECONOMY?
