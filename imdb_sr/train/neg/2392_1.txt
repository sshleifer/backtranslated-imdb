We watched this two times in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time. Maybe we missed something ... no, what's missing is missed from the start of the pre-production. In fact, I returned to Robbin's novel to see if I could find a problem, and found that what I thought was funny and exciting is that nowadays so much unconnected and volatile trash. > So, the initial problem with the film was to decide to do it at all, and the rest of the wreckage of the train had progressed from there. Absolutely nothing works - it's not a blessed thing. Some beautiful photographs from outside are obtained by accidentally positioning the camera in the interior. All actors look at least embarrassing - Angie Dickenson looks positively shaken - except for Rain Phoenix, which leaves the impression that she is too unconscious to realize how truly she is really terrible. Dialogue is one, long and firm. Scenes do not make sense from one another to another, and the connections between them do not exist. Nevertheless, the film is blindly intertwined, convinced that it speaks something deeply. This is too bad to make it even funny; It's just annoying. Gus Van Zant has done other good films, which I encourage you to see, and I am happy that he survived (and seems to have learned from) this mess.
