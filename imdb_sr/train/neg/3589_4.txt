This movie attracted me when I looked at the list, but after I watched it, I must admit I was a little disappointed. The main problem of this film is that actors are not able to keep this movie on the back. Why? Because of the bad scenario. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones are making great efforts to transfer this film to some other level, there is no innovative narrative and the direction is too plain. For fans of Matt Dillon this is a movie that can be seen, just like lovers of beautiful Diana Lane. The legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great, but for him it's not a movie; far below its level. So if you catch this great actor, watch him, but do not expect anything big or extraordinary. The only thing you will remember about this movie is the Diane Lane scene; the rest is very forgetful.
