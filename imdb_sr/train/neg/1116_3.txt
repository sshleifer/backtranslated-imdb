It seems that this film was at the training exercise for the Coppola family. It does not seem to know whether there will be "A" or "B" west. I mean, the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for God's sake. William Boyd must be in the grave. All "B" Western Clich√©s are here. Two pistols of a pearly toothed hero in a white hat with a trusted horse ("C'mon Thunder"), an all-in-black bearded villain, a heroin in trouble, a rancher in trouble, a cowardly sheriff, over the top Poor guys, Gluma, with a few exceptions, is strictly from the Iakim Canutt School of Acting. Chris Libbert (who?) As a hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) As a criminal, they seem to be more at home at the 30th speed. In addition to actors Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulagera and Villa Hutchins little help, but they are not given enough to save this. What was the purpose of Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine? Should we believe that Shin's character was a ghost? What was the purpose of black gloves? It simply did not make sense. Since I am a great fan of Western all-genres, I've worked hard to find some of the features that can be used in this movie. The cinema was pretty good and the settings looked very authentic. Apart from the hero and the main criminal, the other characters looked authentic. If the producers wanted to raise Hopalong Cassidy's character, they might have thought about how he described it in the way it was originally written - a pink pink lipstick with a pink lipstick, with a chip on the shoulder, the one in which Lee Marvin pointed out. What else can I say, but ... on the thunder, to the big guy.
