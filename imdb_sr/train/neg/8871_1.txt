I'm looking, probably, 200 movies a year at the movies and at home and I can say with certainty that this film is by far the worst I've ever seen this year (if not ever, I have not seen "Kuest of the Delta Knights" yet). This movie is just a bad joke after the bad jokes adapted to the 13 year old and because I had discontent watching him on a bus trip I could not leave. Make yourself a service and skip this one in passing for rent. Four dollars would be better spent on any movie by numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
