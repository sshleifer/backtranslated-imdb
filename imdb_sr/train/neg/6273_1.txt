This was a sweet movie to the end. The ending was just another disgusting effort for men to become indignant and empower women to their account. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive / aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the type that ultimately gave her power and control over the relationship with her. It is no coincidence that she sat behind the driver's wheel in the car as they eventually drove off after she had to pray and beg her to return it. This film is a victory for all women who think they should be in charge of all people and control their relationships with them. It was a disdainful movie for that reason.
