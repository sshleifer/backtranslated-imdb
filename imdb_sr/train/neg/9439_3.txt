Your ending can be really cool in the movie. It is especially interesting when our turn is in front of our eyes, but we do not pay attention. These types of screw endings are those that make people think. Then we have curves like this film. Screaming, whether or not you pay attention, you have no idea what will happen. When they discover this kind of random turn, instead of shock, this is a somewhat stunned reaction. This movie begins to be interesting for horror, but after about 20 minutes, it's nothing but boring dialogue and a stupid shift. \ T get lost through the woods and hit the trunk. They end up in an old crazy feminine house that hates men and welcomes her daughter-in-law, Marion (Laurel Munson). Strange events happen because these girls stay in this house for several days, instead of trying to leave or go home, and uncertainty is advancing into a stupid slasher. and is always between several characters. We have three main girls, an elated anchored old woman and an old lady, and the conversation of any importance goes beyond these five. To make matters worse, they never had anything interesting to say. It's actually pretty confusing sitting through their conversations. We want to know what is happening, and instead they just talk and talk and talk (nothing about). The house where these girls stay when they get into a car accident is obviously three miles from anywhere ... wow, three miles! Two hours or less walks will kill them. Why did not they ride with a worker for this household who drove to town? Did he have one seat? How can these girls never question leaving and only willingly remain, rarely even checking each other? Why did that have to have so many stupid plants? Maybe the answers are in a boring scenario. Having a slasher five-character movie is a really bad idea. It's not exciting, it's not scary, and the end is definitely there, but undoubtedly stupid. My Rating: * 1/2 of ****. 79 mins. R for nudity and violence.
