Not a movie, but a collection of performances from the works that were part of the British invasion, which followed the Beatles' dynamic entry into the music world. Some of these shops did not make a big splash on this side of the lake, but there are many. Presented are: Herman's Desert, Billi J. Kramer and Dakotas, Peter and Gordon, Honeicombs, Nashville Teens, Animals, and of course, the Beatles. They grind and polished their actions.
