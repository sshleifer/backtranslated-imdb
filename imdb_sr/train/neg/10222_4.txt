Apart from great cinema by the wonderful James Wong Hove in battle scenes, this movie is a real stink. The first was Rembrandt Charles Laughton. It was so bad that I turned it off. I'm afraid it's not much better. Flora Robson is ugly like Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps her performance as a virgin queen was good for the standards of 1937, but when compared to that of Helen Mirren, it absolutely does not correspond. Robson mode, Robson lists his lines. Her combat message to English troops is so elusive in spirit. Even tricky Laurence Olivier can not save this boring piece. A supporting role here and it does not actually convey anything here. Let me think that Scarlett was 2 years later! It's a shame that history with the Spanish Armada was made so boring in this movie.
