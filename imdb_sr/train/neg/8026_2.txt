It seems we are wondering how this show is going on. There was a couple who stayed together, married and had children, but all the others broke up. What is the purpose for this to continue? The show can be fun at the beginning. You see all the girls that fall on one man, which almost everyone loves right away. It's like real life! Girls begin to take sides, bite each other and show their right (or so we think). But one man is left to decide who to choose to think he can marry and live happily ever after. How can you fall for someone when you are forced to choose them? This show is incredible. You thought dating online was bad, but people have to go to TV to find love? Not real. How could a girl be with a man when she leaves with a few more people, with them? None of these questions are answered, and finally, when the concert ends, you know there will not be a happy end in the future. All we know, everything is written.
