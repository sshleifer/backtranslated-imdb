Throw this poor dog on the bone. Really bad ... you can look anyway. Kol (Ross Hagen) is an intergalactic bad guy who escapes and evaporates through the inflammatory commander of the spacecraft (Jan-Michael Vincent). Cole manages to steal a landing shaft. An unstoppable android killer is sent to bring back the wicked dead or alive. John Phillip Leo plays a forest / park guard who calls for caution in working with these two visitors from far, far away. The costumes are unheard of and the script does not have enough intelligence. Vincent certainly took the money and escaped. The law shows the only sign of effort. So bad is almost comical. Also in the actors: Diana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Vildsmith.
