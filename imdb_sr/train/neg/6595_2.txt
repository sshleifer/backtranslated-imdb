I put this movie in a hotel room to entertain children in the morning when we were leaving home, because I packed all their toys. (Males do not like to watch "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "Look.") My four-year-old found one scene funny, but he told me the rest was "too stupid". This is the fourth year, people. Anyone older than, say, nine, wants to kill his television, not letting this play itself. There is no question how much this "movie" is really funny and extremely terrible. The acting is bad, the plot is stupid, and the script is pathetic immortal. Since it was supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you can not even laugh about a bad movie makes it even worse. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is the worst with some strange false accent (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun as far as I could say), but all the characters are terrible. I did not see the real Laurel and Hardy movie for years, but I know that they had to be better than this. What is the purpose of destroying a classic comic duo with ... this? Bottom line: derivative garbage. Avoid at all costs, unless you have a freak Bronson Pinchot. 2/10
