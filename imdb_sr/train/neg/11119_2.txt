Voodi Harrelson and Veslei Snipes team together as basketball players on basketball court. Okay, that sounds good. She leaves a lot of space for good comedy and a good story. But no such event took place in many boring minutes of this pathetic film attempt. This film became redundant, retarded and funny after the first twenty seconds passed. Voodi Harrelson played one of my favorite i.v. characters, Voodi from Cheers, and I was looking forward to seeing him in this movie. But after I saw his "acting performance", I came to the conclusion that the stupid house that is bartending should play. His acting was boring and poor as a movie. Another actor in this unreal movie was Rosie Perez. I loved films with Perez before, but I decided that the reason I enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not the main character and had not had so many lines of speaking (Do It Right). But now in the Vhite Men Can't Jump, he was made as a central character with many lines, which means the audience must suffer with their incredibly boring voice. So, after I looked at this movie (a term that is used loosely) and heard Rosie Perez much more than I appreciated, now I can say that I'm white and I'm getting ready to jump. . . of twenty floors of a residential building.
