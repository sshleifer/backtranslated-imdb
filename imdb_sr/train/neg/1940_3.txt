the writing of a journalist and a compulsory ruthless press officer and a pathetic grandmother was a hand and clich√©. I can not blame the actors, but somebody is sure to say that you are joking that I can not. This episode had a perspective on the press and police perspective, while the police perspective was standard enough, the perspective of the press and characterization were overly exaggerated and at moments incredibly incredible. I noticed that it was a HBO co-production, if that's the case, then perhaps I can explain the stereotypes of the mice, I totally shook myself during a press conference. he lacked any credibility and did not give out true. 40 minutes in the first episode and I'm still waiting for uncertainty. Skip Five Daisthis. production 2008/9 with these characters is far better and uncertain, even if the crime is at the top. This story has had unflinching moments that can only be described as incredibly incredible. The press officer starts a press conference without the presence of an investigative officer answering questions for the press. So incredible that he felt like an amateur clock. Then I started to ask for a press called "Scoop" and for Perry Take it to appear. I saw Hunter 2009 before "five days" in Australia, not realizing that it was battered and rejoicing Bonneville and McTeer again going around. The head trembles terribly.
