In the so-called "documentary" there are so many incorrect statements that I appeared on television. Bart Sibrel could make a cheap DVD, but he unfortunately does not have a look in the science behind his claims. He relies on inaccuracy, does not speak a full story, or is an old favorite "the government always lies to us" insinuations, and people who believe what they are told and <br /> <br /> Moreover, its "exclusive" or "unpublished" footage is freely available on the Internet from different locations. Further reading of the circumstances surrounding the recording of this production shows that he used false statements to get an interview, and used creative editing of the responses to promote his opinions. All Mr. Sibrel's claims about "inaccuracies," "mistakes," or "whistles" in the Apollo program were thoroughly poorly challenged. How to get these 40 minutes of my life back?
