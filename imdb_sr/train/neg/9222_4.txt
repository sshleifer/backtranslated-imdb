I really like the sexy action and sci-fi films of the sixties, and for the actresses who have appeared in them. They found the sexiest women in these films and it did not matter if they could act (remember "Candi"?). The reason I was disappointed with this film was because he was not nostalgic enough. The story here features a European film about a science fiction movie called Dragonfly and the director was fired. So the producers decide to let the young ambitious director (Jeremy Davies) complete the picture. They are one really beautiful woman in a movie that plays Dragonfly, but hardly it is in her. The film was written and directed by Roman Coppola, who uses some of his father's tales from the early days and puts it in the script. I wish the movie could be a hommage to those early movies. They could have lots of actors acting in them. There is one actor in this movie that was popular since the sixties and his law John Phillip (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockvell also appear. I guess I will have to continue to wait for the director to make good hommage films in the sixties. If anyone reads this, "Make it sexy as much as you can!" I'll wait!
