Good sadness I can not even begin to describe how bad this movie is. Do not misunderstand me, I did not expect much to start. Let's face it, the PG-13 slasher movie is destined to miss the ummm ... cutting, so nobody should be surprised by the lack of the up. But that was the level of incompetence and clich√© that was exposed in all other aspects of this film, which really blew up me. We have a protagonist who is simply so completely useless to find yourself at the root of a villain. And here are books for books ... IT IS NOT EVANGELIZING NEVER - it violates the basic rule of basic screen writing - character development. If you think that by the end of this film, the poor girl will turn around and finally kick her ass and think again. On top of that, we were perhaps the least intriguing (and definitely least intimidating) killer who could ever adorn this genre. I'm not kidding when I say that Dora in the researcher has more horrifying villains than this movie. Finally, because all the potential for tension or reward has been removed by an incompetent (and apparently thirteen-year-old) director, what could be left to fill the 2 hours of the screen? Wardrobes, that's what. Many and many wardrobes: large cabinets, small cabinets, mirror cabinets, cabinets for Narnia, so many cursed wardrobes that you will not want to wear for another year. In fact, this film was supposed to be called "CLOSET", and it had a picture of a great scary follower on DVD. On the back she could have a photo of the audience who fell asleep and quotes Roger and Ebert - something to the extent that: "What is f * @! We just lost our time watching!"
