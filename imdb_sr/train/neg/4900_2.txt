SEX VISH was actually released (minus ten minutes longer, hm, 'extreme' footage) here in the UK in the early days of the video boom, and caused a tabloid storm in a tea cup when it allegedly inspired a murder case. It's strange that the papers were erasing this ultra-disturbing move under the carpet in a hurry to get a fairly harmless personality FROZEN SCREAM and NIGHT OF DEMONS, and the film was almost forgotten. I jumped on the opportunity to watch it on the DVD-RV and spend most of the film life with its fork on the floor. It's not as politically incorrect as it's totally crazy, triple-Ks take Michael Vinner's DEATH VISH (did the title give the game far in terms of inspiration?) With hardcore sex and some really nasty violence that they threw into the already bubbling rush of the seventies . If you do not think that you are nasty, it can make you re-think. By the time SEXY WISH ends, you will want to clean your eyeballs with a disinfectant and take a long hot shower to clean. If any film really deserves "it's just a movie, just a movie, just a movie", it's this one. High-profile (or shortened) - a rape victim who uses the vibrator on the victim while masturbating over her, Harri Reems's mustaches for the theft of scenes, a helpless young black couple who are forced to smash the killer of a sword stick (they won the Oscars for their very credible performances if the Academy faltered) before the man was castrated for his troubles, and some deadly course threatening to raise the process above their obvious origins. Do not say I did not warn you. If you thought the world was innocent before thirty years ago, SEKS VISH will prove to you that you are very, very wrong.
