Note: I'll find out the key part of the action, but if you've looked at the cover of a DVD or any promotional material, you'll already know it. It seems that this film was written by an eleven-year-old who is not really great and she was probably very tired when he wrote it. The author does not know the difference between a chemical and an organism. Forget about the fact that the UN and NSA, it seems, are leading an exhibition in Hungary. Forget about the fact that when these crafty intelligent agents go in pursuit for someone whose only touch will kill you in a minute, they do not wear protective equipment (not even gloves). These are confusion in the context of this film. In the scientific world within this story, 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity goes laterally. The fact is that people in this film do not (with few exceptions) behave as people behave. Almost every time a character reacts to something, it is inappropriate. A love story (of course, it exists) makes soap operas such as Shakespeare. I can not believe that we in vain have taken a free rental movie on this thing.
