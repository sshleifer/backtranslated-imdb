This apparent pilot for the non-produced TV series shows the young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as an amnesia with some pretty incredible powers that must be used when the demon wandering around man is freed in the world. CGI is a couple for TV business, and Applebi is fine as amnesia, but it's hard to swallow like a superheroin. A famous face on TV Richard Burgi is on his way to Applebe's mentor, but he can not do anything to raise this shit over the central level. We see too much of a cartoon demon flying from the very beginning, a bad sign. Also, the scenes where Burgi trains Applebia to fight are actually funny. They are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other films, especially REMO VILLIAMS.
