I thought I was going to watch scary movies ... and I ended up laughing with the whole movie. In a scene where a man turned into a wolf, I thought he was joking. Today's computer games have ten times better animations. A low budget is a convenient comment. I would recommend Volk (1994) with Jack Nicholson for a good invertebrate film. It has good special effects as it should be (human transformation to the insect). Unless you want to make a good laugh, I would not recommend you watch this movie. This movie is a joke.
