This is at the top of my list of the worst movies I have ever seen on Starz on Demand. It looks like every one of them can find DVDs and put it here. Why? Who knows! Obviously, anyone with a digital camera and a budget with a small perimeter can get to the horror film and put it on TV. To be honest, this looked terrible from the moment I saw a trailer - but I gave her the right chance. Always try to have an open look at low-budget movies. Some of the best movies I've ever seen are movies that worked around a low budget or in other cases required a small budget to be excellent. This is not one of those movies. > You know the plot so far, I'm sure if you read this. Or you heard about it on Starz on Demand or for any reason you came to this page of boredom. It's about a pathetic and furious girl we know all 3 minutes in an incredibly bad "heavi metal" music video. Whoever put it together, he must have thought he looked really interesting, but really, really not. Anyway, she kills himself. Then she has somebody. Then some killing starts. It's really unimaginable and totally average and boring. When the first shot enters her apartment, it sounds like a piece of popcorn. Was that the best sound effect they could think of? I could find a better sound effect that I can use for free (without copyright) on the Internet ... right. Now. Do not let other criticisms that claim that this 10-star movie deceives you. They are obviously either film distributors or perhaps even a director who tries to deceive you thinking that this piece of garbage is worth buying. Funny.
