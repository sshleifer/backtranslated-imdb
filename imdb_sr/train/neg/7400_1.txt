I've seen some pretty bad movies, and this is there. There's no complication to talk about, it's like one of those bad episodes of coma on soap opera. I just wanted to hit that little girl because, say, just say, she's really suspicious until the end of the movie. The monsters that run around carrying something bling were funny. I saw a little "Silent Hill". And I read that he did it and watched the Finnish metal band, Lordi. No wonder it did not make much sense. It seems to be a means of promoting the band and nothing more. FKS are very good, the appearance of film, monsters, and even acting. But the story and talk about it are simply not there.
