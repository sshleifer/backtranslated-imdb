There is nothing new for me to say: 4 hours of people dying again and again on the same hill. The actors were starred, but unfortunately the producer / director / editor / God is gulio. He should have eaten a modest pie (if not for himself, then for men who died in Kargil), hired one of these brilliant Bolivian directors, hired a real scriptwriter, hired a real editor, hired a musician who was not in some way (and who apparently listened to some bad version of the "Apocalypse Now" on some cheap Indian drug, hired a real professional team, dropped all fireworks and told the real story. Unfortunately, he, like great Indian soldiers, made decisions that were terrible for his actors, and horrible for his Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal PS: The next time the Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha regiment, we are all dying again and again. Please do not repeat it, sir! , I propose to employ more than one nepalese to represent the team. There are certainly many Nepalese men working in Bombai - the last number was 40,000 to half a million.
