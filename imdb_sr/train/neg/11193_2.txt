OK, I did not have great expectations, but I could not even imagine this film that went down to depth. The action, as it was, involved a priest in an obscure 2-member command that investigates the death of the founder. the order of the sinner. Individuals of sin allow Catholics to achieve salvation beyond the authority of the Church, and there is another immortal film with a lot of mischief. Regardless of the fact that it does not make any sense, from then on, the Baptist could give you salvation ... we will move on. I will allocate the plot without giving much: a priest goes to Rome with his friend to invest. He brings with him a mental patient (not inventing) who shot him during exorcism and who loves him (no licking of this BTV is explained), a drunk Irish priest and Peter Veller as a cardinal. They come to Rome, find some creepy kids who do nothing in the movie, meet the S & M anti-papa device that drunken Iraq knows (does not explain) and who gives information killing people (oh, BTV, he's bad so he has an industrial / techno soundtrack) and then ... umm, seriously, I'm not sure. pitch meandering. Heath trembling with Sin Eater, flying to New York with Sin Eater for overnighter, and then some other things happen, and then (everything outside the camera) falls anti-pop and the movie ends. About One Movie Hour is really wondering if something has happened. Something has happened to the end, but you can not be sure that this is important, as most of the drama takes place either before the movement or outside the scren, you really feel cheated.
