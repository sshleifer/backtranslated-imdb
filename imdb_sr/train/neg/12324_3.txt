This was the seizure of the same garbage we had to watch Bob Sage's host for about half an hour before this. Dave Coulier just thought it was funny and it was the same show as the most entertaining video spots in America, except for hosts with a combined IK of three. Kitaen's kitchen certainly needed the money and Coulier had to go to the garbage bin for his jokes. It was enough to see him populate Pope and the second exhausted cartoon film began at Full House. That guy who has played all the practical jokes about everyone deserves to be at the end of the admission class. Coulier must have needed money to satisfy Alanis Morissette while they were leaving.
