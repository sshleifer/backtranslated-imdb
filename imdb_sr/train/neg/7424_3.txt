A very, very boring movie card here with Stella Stevens looking for instructions from someone who was disguised (I did not need to guess who it was) in Old Nevada outside of Vegas for looting money at the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens runs his girlfriend of three, and finds that they have to work much faster than they expected. Despite some nice views of Las Vegas in the 70s, a very average but authentic acting from the largest number of participants, and a plot of potential plot, Las Vegas Ladi lays a big bored egg. It seems that the film is always on the move, and when it does, it only pulses here and there and never accelerates. I was a little disappointed with this film. Of course, I did not expect anything big, but at least I thought it could have been one of those neat exploiting films from the seventies or something. Not even close. Nobody dies. There is a chromatic battle between the stingy Stuart Vitman and the disgusting George DiCenza, a year before his big performance as Prosecutor Buglios in Helter Skelter. The shooting has all the uncertainty of seeing the waterfall. There is one blow and one head hit by a blunt instrument. Behind it nothing in terms of action. As far as girls are concerned, do not expect too much there. Stella and her girlfriends (both very central but very nice talents, entering the sauna and swimming What we see Nothing but a passing profile So I could write one thing that would recommend a movie, but it did not need to be, and I have little to say in favor of this movie., it's not for nothing.
