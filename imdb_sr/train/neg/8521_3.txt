By the way, this is part of the plot. Charlie Brovn Christmas is one of those timeless classics that teaches you the values ​​of Christmas and enjoying your vacation. That, however, is not. She tries to capture the A Charlie's Blooming Christmas Emotion, there's even another Christmas show, but it does not work with stupid and light jokes. Charlie Brown no longer asks about the spirit of Christmas but wants to buy a gift for Peggi Jean (gloves of $ 25 ... what?). His sister Salli is the most boring character in the film. Here is one of her jokes: Salli wants to write a letter to Santa Claus, but she does not know how to write Charlie (for some reason she must be in her letter) and instead decides to call Sam, because she knows how to spell Sam . Also, Salli plays an angel in a play with one word per day: "Hark!" Instead, she says hockey stick (har har). If Salli says he's hark 12 times (all weird sounds the same) does not kill you, nothing will. Peppermint Patti and Marci are a great focal point, but it does not do better. Marci is ridiculous with her answers to Patti, but Patti is another story. Sounds like a boy (which does not break the rumors) and crazy when she has to be a sheep in the show (terrible baas and everything). It is obvious that she is a sheep every year, and is worried that she will forget her lines (lines that do not exist). She is so concerned that she has been mentioned twice, one immediately behind her, and she gets the same answer. I suppose he must have a short-term loss of memory, or something. Lucy and Linus are more welcome (although Linus still has boring tips), but it's hardly a lot of time. I'm sure Schroeder is not even in this. All in all, he tries to be a parasite to the original, but compromises the message for a few quick laughs.
