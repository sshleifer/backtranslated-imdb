This film proves that "commercial" cinema, or Hollywood movie, is in a serious crisis. There is absolutely no reason to produce this film except the fact that someone was expecting success based on Shakuille's name. It's worth remembering the plot: it's a bit confused by the node. What else? The screen is a bit mutant, O'Neal is a bad actor, but Francis Capra is worse. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10.
