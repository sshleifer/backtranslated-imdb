Not only does this film have a bad story, a bad direction, and a terrible acting, it opens a whole new meaning to racism. In this film "White" girls are whores, "white" guys are out-of-gangsters, and successful (again) "white" businessmen are disgusting toilets. I'm just wondering what would have happened if I made the same movie with the same line story and I wrote about white people only. "He's a dude, it's good to finally see how you stopped having fun with those black chickens." It looks like nobody notices it, but watch this movie again and vomit how they showed new Zealand "bite bois". Suddenly, his white men are the main cause of the aggression of gangs, and whores for a quick burst. Only girls from the Samoans have a heart, there is no such thing as a non-whore white girl. It made me sick that they could not make this film without giving the Caucasian community in New Zealand a disgusting profile. If you think that I am over-generalized, go watch this movie and see what you did from the "white boys". Just because the Samoans decide to call us "white guys" in real life, does not mean it's funny. If I say a black boy, I'll lose my teeth. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. Do not spend money. Do not be a racist.
