I do not like Frosty's return and this one. Both films are absurd with poorly written characters and bad voices. Votes could have been done, but Frosty returned to the worst of this because of the snow they were drawing. Frosty winter land was great, as was the original cordial drama. The only good thing in this movie was Frosty, the snowman was similar to the classic 60s and a funny line like when they talked about things that were not real, and then Frosti strolled along the window with a buzz, whistling what he was doing, but everything else badly written and poorly animated and I hardly got a plot. I saw a DVD cover in the library two or three years ago, and the art looked exhausted, so I did not pick it up until this year, because the backgammon looked a little touchy, but I played this movie. It was a hassle of bad art figures, just like a DVD and it was horrible just for what's happening. I watched it at night and found it bored that I fell asleep on the whole thing (Wait, I always do it when I watch something while I sleep) But this film was boring Overall rating: Grade-C <br /> This is like another feast of a special bad separation in cold returns and this. This is a bad fourth continuation, as Home alone 4 well thought the movie was fine, but I was home at home 3. But it's like a bad home I am 3 and 4 people hate this. My sister did not look that much, because when she came to my room to watch for 2 minutes and a half, she walked like "I hate the animation!" I agree with her as the third Frosty returns. Plain avful!
