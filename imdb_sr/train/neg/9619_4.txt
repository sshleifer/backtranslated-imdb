If you can believe, * another * group of teenagers returns to another * cabin on the lake three years after * one of those fatal 'accidents' claimed one of them. Hunting and looking, a psychic carrying a camouflage hockey mask (cheap paper at that time) appears to be consuming one at a time. This mechanical "Friday of the 13th" has earned the slightest glory as one of the first digitally recorded features, but this ends with interesting facts and everything that remains is predictable, amateur production with sub-pair performances and repetitive bum-mic \ t intrusion. Completion of the last second helps a little to raise ghosts, and 'Day of Remembrance' is something best that is cast into the lake and forgotten. One only for crazy sakatores.
