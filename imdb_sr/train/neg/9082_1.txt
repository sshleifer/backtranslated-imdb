This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was fooled thinking that it could be good because there are some of my favorite actors in it. Now I want to hit Jason Schwarzman in the face for this role. I was physically ill after watching this movie. I really do not understand Hollivood sometimes. There are so many people who are trying to break into it, I'm sure you can take it off the top and get the best. In this way, the worst film you make is equal to Ferris Beullar instead of this sludge. Gags like a hair doll and obviously tearing up jewels advertisements added the humor of the film. I'm glad I avoided this movie and watched it on TV. This proves that January's announcements should be avoided at all costs.
