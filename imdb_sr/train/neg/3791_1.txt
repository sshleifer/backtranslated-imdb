I can not vote on this because I would not watch the trash from these people. They got my money by another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore that they would never be repeated again. I think my civic duty is to help people stay away from this garbage. Go to the forums on this movie and read where actors are trying to behave as if they were seeing the movie for the first time. One type answers to yourself ... using the same name! There are forums that say it's as good as Shavshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... Not close (in no case). If this is the second film of the company, it should be better than the first one. This means that the third film should be much better. Not so, I saw him. All I want to know is how to distribute this garbage using the same names all the time. Having fun with friends and filming a weekend weekend is fine ... but do not try to sell that trash!
