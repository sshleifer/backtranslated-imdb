DEAD HUBBANDS is a bit of a stupid comedy about a bunch of husbands who have stormed to throw away other husbands. It is by no means unpleasantly bad as some comedies that I can mention, but never reveals my potential. Imagine how this could have been good if Farrell's brothers sent Ben Stiller in the role of Carter Elson. Oh, Carter is based on Jerry Springer? I'm just curious, because the phrase on Dr. Elson's show is "to look at each other and keep talking"
