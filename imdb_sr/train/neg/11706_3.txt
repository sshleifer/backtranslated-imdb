Roman Remarkuea. A head that looks great on paper. The left refugee is struggling to stay in Paris between wars. Secret officer of the Gestapo. It's a pity that there is no synergy here. The pieces are never united. The stories of leftist refugees in France do not have to be so boring. Read the memoirs of Arthur Koestler "The Scum of Earth" (if you can find it). Or his frozen "Dialogue with Death" (same). The only interest in this film is in some random details. Leaders spend much time drinking calvados, Norman apple brandy. I welcome any incentive for me to have a Calvados. Surely this movie looked faster. But, according to the film, it is sold only in cheap, low-class salons. Vive le tabac parisien! That's what I say. References to alcoholic drinks are abundant here; It seems to be the preoccupation of scriptwriters. I enjoy the films set in France because it can be fun to wait for the inevitable alcohol full-size ad appears on the wall in the background. I was not disappointed. This time, Birrh was a very unusual choice. This film would be rated at 10, only that we judged him for the sophistication of his drinks. The indifferent result of the film is Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is best known - if you can call it so - for his opera "Car Jones", based on O'Neill's performance. It was premiered at around the same time as the film version of Paul Robeson. Opera survives today in one or two images by Lawrence Tibet. It should be reappeared soon; The operation seems to be an appropriate theme for the mentioned, because Charles Boier's image works under his "Czech" pseudonyms. Two of them are "Vozzeck" and "Gunther", both featured roles in the German opera. Is it just a coincidence? It seems that the appointment is only part of this film. Note that they call Himmelstoss over the phone. Himmelstoss is one of the main characters in Remarkue's earlier "All Quiet on the Western Front." I suppose there was no time to develop a drama.
