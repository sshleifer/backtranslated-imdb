What a waste of time! I tried to sit through 'Ski Captain ..' about 6 times, and every time, within 3 minutes, I started to do something else - anything else! It's really boring movie, acting is horrible, writing is boring, and obviously the first time a director, because it's stiff, and I wanted to love it, I love sci-fi, old cliffs, and I can appreciate the attempt to tune on Flash Gordon, and Metropolis, but my God, what I did for "Paramount Pictures", and I wrote Sherri Lansing in 1993 about the use of a blue screen for screen tests. She told me they would never have any interest or need to do it. Sherri was right in 1993, but she must have forgotten her advice when she enlightened this dog, the blue screen, the effect, but not the entire movie, let's not forget, neither Jude nor Jolie are great actors (but Paltrow's performance reminds me to the effort in the high school, the damage - could work, but only under the expert director. The most fun thing is that Captain Neb's director will continue to work, even after this shit. It's a store, not an art!
