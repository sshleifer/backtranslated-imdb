Well, the writing was very messy, the direction was more messy, and the editing worsened (at least I hope it was editing). The act was not bad, but it was not good either. Almost no character was nice. At least 45 minutes of this film was a waste of time, and the second hour was not used even close to its full potential. It was a great idea, but another good idea is going on. could have ended three different places, but only kept going to the predictable Hollywood region. and what was not predictably done was so bad that it did not matter. The ending was not worth watching at all. Sandra Bullock was out of her element and should keep away from these types of films. and the movie looked hurry. the movie was not really worth watching, and that I paid for it would be very crazy. Maybe I was more disappointed because I expected a really good movie and got a bad one. the film was not terribly bad, but I would not recommend it. I gave him 2 out of 10 b / c and so much I liked the idea and I did it as one character (Justin I believe, super smart). and also had some very cheap ways to cover land holes. As if I were trying to cover a volcano with a cheap masking tape, it was not nice. in any case, if you see it, wait for $ 1.50 a theater or video, unless you love almost every movie you see, then you will like this.
