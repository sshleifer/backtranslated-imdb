Superhero films are mostly crap, and this is no exception. His only sole quality is the fact that the movie could be even worse. I would put 'Batman & Robin' and 'Steel' above this movie, so if that's so bad ... If you're looking for a black superhero, check out 'Blankman' your not superhero movie, but at least fun .
