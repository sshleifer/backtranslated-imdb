This is the biggest pile of shit I've ever seen. NO RENT! The creators of this film should be a band from ever shooting another movie. It begins with something that is a complication, and then fades quickly. I think I'd rather look at a dry color than looking at the covers. The actors were terrible, the shop quickly disappeared, shooting was left to do a lot of work. Not a good thing to say about this shit. If you rent a movie, you lose your money. I really enjoy the National Lampoon movies, but this was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce, and learn to manage. I feel I should sue these holes that made this film for money spent on rental costs and lost time.
