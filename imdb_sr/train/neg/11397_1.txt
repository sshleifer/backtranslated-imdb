This was really terrible! She had a terrible story, she behaved badly and was like an amateur remake of the evil dead, but not so good. I did not have to go to the toilet, and I doubt I would come back! This makes Hammer House of Horror look like a Hollywood ep. The only value of this film was the endless supply of beautiful women. Not bad among them! If you want to talk to your friends after a night on beer, then this is for you ... otherwise avoid it as a plague!
