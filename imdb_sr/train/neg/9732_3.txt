First, leadership, Brad Dourif is KOOK. If you are trying to grasp this film seriously, then, I guarantee it will destroy it for you. If you do not take it too seriously, then it's actually fun to watch. Like the other reviewer, I liked the scene where Lisa (Cinthia Bain) and Dourif declare their love for each other - between avoiding the flames of flames that shot him in the car's hands. Another great campsite scene was watching John Landis as a producer who had a toast and throat around the room. Actually, I've found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laughter-rebellion - I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper wanted it to be.
