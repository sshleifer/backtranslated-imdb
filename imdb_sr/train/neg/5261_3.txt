I have read some other comments and I have to agree with those who have not finished. I thought it was going pretty well to the end. It kept your mind running, then clapping. I had no idea what was going on in the last few minutes of the film, except for a complete riot. As if they were left without money to get to a good end, they improvised. First, they had a mysterious thing that made people disappear, and then they had a guy who spoke about area 51 (what are you thinking about aliens), and then he went to shit. I thought actors and actresses did a good job, but the script was broken. In any case, if you are watching this movie, be prepared to be disappointed at the end.
