In a way, it's a disaster that Fellini has been doing all his life. The boundary between the absurd masterpiece and free association shit is very small, and which category of film will eventually fit into it will often depend on personal feelings. "Casanova" left me in cold admiration for her sets and a little more than Bukovski can not even more concisely summarize: "Kazanova died, only old guy with big penis and Long tongue and no courage To say that he lived well is true, to say that I can spit on his grave without feeling is true. Dame usually goes for the greatest fool who can find, so the human race stands. Where today is: we have grown smart and lasting Casanova, all from the inside, such as the easter bunnies we feed on our poor children. "What makes me is concerned, it is an attitude that Fellini takes in relation to its subject matter; awarded, with more empathy, but still horrified. Casanova's environment was made from decay and incestuous behavior, topics that Fellini considered in more detail in "Satiricon." The inheritance of the plot is characteristic of soft pornography, only without coherence; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slim to the point of distracting attention. However, there may be only a point where Casanova is portrayed as an ugly fool. And I invite everyone to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini could not. More than ever, it appears here as a dirty old man - maestro, surely, but one whose impulses satisfy themselves more than anyone else. It's hard to imagine the audience that enjoys this movie. It was a story that is not worth it to say.
