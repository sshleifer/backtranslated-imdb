I watched this movie as I liked the plot, a group of aliens held captive trying to figure out how they were connected. The setting and premises were obviously under the influence of the first (and the best). I saw a movie and although there was not much action, the story was moving at a relatively good pace. There was a comedy with a relief name in the form of two battles 'Alpha males' and it was a welcome surprise (in any case) to see that Melissa Joan Hart had not given up acting yet. Several things left it for me personally; 1. Pedophile was more characteristic, which was disturbed by all of the children to the dead bodies. 2. MJH's line about how her cop "got into this" when in reality he was least deserved to be there, he did not know that he contributed to the events that led to their capture. . The end ... what kind of film just ends in the middle of something that's happening? There was no resolution, no rock hangers, no obvious end ... it just ends. And I fell for two stars with my grade. The first 2 points would let me slip but not the end!
