SMALL SPOILERS! So I just sat down and watched this movie, mainly because I enjoyed and rated some of Singleton's earlier works like "Boiz n the hood". However, I must say that it was a great disappointment and that everything I hate about fictitious, clich√©, so-called "messages" of films. Action is mostly poor, (pop stars and models do NOT necessarily make good actors ... take into account), situations are hard to swallow, (the victim of rape becomes a lesbian overnight ... please!), But the worst of all this is compounded by every mess a stereotype that you can imagine. In the second half of the film it has become caricature in its characterization, making you lose every piece of empathy that you may have had for your one-dimensional players. the causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result, it just ends the sensationalization of the results of these problems. His message is contradictory, which leads to feelings of confusion and a general lack of connection. As far as film conclusions are concerned, I found it predictable, unpleasant, exploitative and mildly offensive. For a film called "More Learning," I have to say that everything I've learned is that I never see this again. If you want to make a real comment on some of the topics that this movie does not fully elaborate, then go to hire the "American History of KS" ... unless you just watched Tira Banks go to hire a life.
