I love Clash's music and I love the music of Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros. I went to this film hoping to find out more about the man behind it. But I got out of the theater not knowing much more about Joe than I did after reading the entries in Wikipedia. The film never goes to the person, his thoughts and feelings. What they did was to collect small material that they had, clammy blurry videos, and interview some people about Joe Strummer in a campfire. It turns out that most of these people knew very little or not at all, and that the director just wanted them in the movie so that some other celebrities would say: "Oh, he was so much inspiration for all of us." Like Bono or Johnny Depp (whom they apparently asked to keep their pirate costume in order to take advantage of his current success in the Pirates of the Caribbean). It seems that the director could not even wait until the body cooled down before jumping to sell his version of "the biggest punk rocker and hippy heart" that he had ever lived, consecrating a person without knowing enough about him. Of course, as a fan I enjoyed watching the pictures of the band, hearing anecdotes behind the songs and the like, but in the end I felt as if what remained as a portrait of Joe Strummer could easily be said in the 60 -90 minutes. Go watch the movie if you're a fan, or rather listen to some Clasha music or even better off the undeclared Mescaleros, where Joe Strummer has reached the peak of his musical development with his death, dissolving all his rich influences together with an incredible sound.
