I'm a fan of Jean Harlow because she had a star quality. I think her films are not good and I do not think she was a good actress, but she certainly was great in comedies. Every comedy in a Missouri Girl is very good. But this movie may be more like a love story. Jean Harlow is wonderful in this and you can forget the rest of the actors - their performances do not bring anything new. It always impresses me very much when I think that Harlow's beautiful body is a sick woman. Well, it looks great in this movie.
