I saw this film on drive-in in 1959. To "Hovard the Duck," I regarded it as the worst film I've ever seen. This film attempted to combine all the generations in one; comedy, horror, teenage fear, and hot rod that must have "My mother, car." Perhaps he deserves a second look to see if it is the exact reflection of time.
