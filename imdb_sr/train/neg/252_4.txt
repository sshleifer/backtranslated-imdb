The uninspired course leaves a decent thrown in a nice but gentle adjustment, in which the dialogue seems to be recited but not sincere, but the inaccessible outlook of the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; Edward Woodward, as the Spirit of Christmas Attendance, kneels around on stools and appears to leave Bernard Cribbins' impression.

The scenes in which he showed his past have so much impact as if he half-joyfully flew through his family album. No one seems to be making any effort, except Frank Finlay, who chronically converts.
