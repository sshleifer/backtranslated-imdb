** Possible connections forward ** Gerald Mohr, an occupied B-movie actor during the forties and fifties, is leading an expedition to Mars. Before we get to the Red Planet, we have fun with a romantic austerity between Mohr and scientist Nora Haiden; resident doofus Jack Kruschen; and look at Les Tremaine as another bearded scientist. Mars exteriors have false backgrounds and shades that range from red to pink? - "Cinemagic" process advertised in ads. Really cool monsters include a giant ameba, a creature with three eyes, a too large trap of Venus flies and an unforgettable rat / bat / spider. The whole bizarre adventure reminds survivors of Haiden under the influence of hypnotic drugs. ANGRY RED PLANET, as reported, had a lot of cult follow-up, and probably picked up most of his supporters during the psychedelic sixties.
