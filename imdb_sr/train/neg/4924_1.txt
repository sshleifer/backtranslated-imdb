This movie is really bad. It may be cruel, but it is. It really is. Bad letter, every vampire clich√© in the book was used, and no sympathy was given at all to the origin of the protagonist ... i.e. Ole Dracula. There were some really great movies about Dracula / Vampire in the past, but that does not even get into the "awesome" slot. Take a selection of people who seem to get out of your teens, add duck Dracula Lore and mix the tonic of religious / surreal dreaming ... and you'll get a confusing mess of the movie - Dracula 2000. <Br /> <br / > I really can not find any good things to say about this movie, as if it was not bad enough that it was made in the first place, they seem to have made Johnny Lee Miller the effect of an English accent ... What's the problem with what I hear You're crying ... Well, he's an Englishman, but he sounds like an American trying to make English accent. All in all, you can tell your money (if you thought you bought it), or rent it, watch it and find out why it's so terrible as Tellitubbies. PS Although La La is pretty scary!
