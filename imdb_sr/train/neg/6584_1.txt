As the only film I could see at this year's "Nordische Filmtage" in Lubeck, this year's festival will be remembered as the lowest for me. This film, which is announced as an erotic thriller, is nothing more than a sick piece of shit! Excuse me in the language, but there are no decent words to describe it. First of all, actors are not the best. But even better actors would not save the movie. E.g. The plot: after the first 15 minutes, it was quite clear that John was ill, the neighboring girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend. The so-called "sex scene" was nothing but disgusting (hitting each other until blood flows to me has nothing to do with sexuality), but unfortunately they were not the only disgusting images that were being shown. Everything else was copied by other directors, for example, Linch, but of course without their genius. So, to sum up the whole movie and to save other viewers time and money: the guy loses a girl, the girl returns home, the guy kills a girl and then becomes crazy, the guy imagines hot but crazy neighbors, the guy he has a very disgusting sex with one of them (or he thinks so), in the end he realizes, he is crazy, and his girlfriend and her new lover are constantly lying in his apartment .. a bad story, bad actors, pictures that you want to vomit. .. 1 of 10 (1 point for the fact that you understand how well you can understand Norwegian if you have learned the Swedish language - at least Edna benefit from the evening - and you can choose 0 points here).
