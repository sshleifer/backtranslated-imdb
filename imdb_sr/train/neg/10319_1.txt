Unlike many, I do not think that the premise or theme of this performance is the least offensive. However, its execution is quite another matter. Like many B-minus movies, it seems that all decent gags are embedded in trailers. For most of the 22 or so minutes, we sit in the sensation of every bit of real humor. Or at least to prevent it from spinning with remote or numerous carpet fibers. With few exceptions, acting is terrible; comical exaggerated emotions and the gesture of some actors might be appropriate for the late night of commercials, but not for the humorous series (even Canadian). Regardless of the original cultural angle, I can not help but think that this is mostly a defective CBC shootout to repeat the success of Corner Gas. Unfortunately, they got the tone - and the scenario - completely wrong for prairie. The ultimate insult was that they obviously could not afford to do the work in a small town (Why? Is it so hard to find them in Saskatchewan?) Did they think that the crowd would cheat on the exterior of Regina? As proud Canadian, I hope that this thing will soon disappear, and that the rest of the world, prepared by CBC publicists, quickly forgets this colossal shame of the sitcom.
