A really bad movie, the story is too simple and predictable and bad as a complement. This vampire hunting story is the worst I've ever seen, Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi), travels to Mexico in search of bloody tits! He uses some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to Blade), and is part of some of Van Helsig's vampire hunters? OK, but he does it alone. He is assigned a quest for a powerful vampire queen who asks for a black crucifix to perform a ritual that will allow her to be invulnerable to sunlight (almost the sequel to Vampire (1998) directed by John Carpenter and starring James Voods), Derek begins her search in search for the queen with some new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, a very bad act) teenager with no experience, Father Cristiano De la Fuente, a Catholic priest, Natasha Vagner, a special vampire, and Rai Collins (Darius McCrari) another vampire expert . So obviously in this adventure is not alone. You can start to feel that this movie will only be viewed by its main actor (Jon Bon Jovi); there's a big difference in the quality of the acting compared to James Voods, and then, if you're watching a movie (I do not recommend this section), you'll be in one of the simplest stories, completely predictable, with terrible acting, really bad special effects and unconnected events! I strongly recommend that you do not watch this movie !, you are renting another movie, watching another channel, dating with friends, etc. 3/10
