With this film, which lasted only 61 minutes and nothing good on television, I decided to take the Revolt of the Zombies to DVD to pass the time. Even as I realized that he had come, I was very disappointed. It started with an unusually optimistic opening quality (what - without music?), Then quite slowly opening sequences. God, I realized that the film about zombies - even from the thirties - had some winter (White Zombie, with White Lugosi, it certainly is), but it was not. Zero. He was barely dramatic (except for a few moments when the eyes on the film were indicative of hypnotizing someone). Like the equally boring King of Zombies, this movie could be interesting curiosity, but nothing more.
