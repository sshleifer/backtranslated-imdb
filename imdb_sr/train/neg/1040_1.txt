I can not believe this film has managed to get such a high score of 6! It's barely visible and incredibly boring, certainly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long and long time. Makes the impression that you are watching the total creative wreck of the train. This film should be avoided at all costs. It is one of those "festival films" that only satisfy pseudo-intellectuals, because they have done so badly that they think it makes it "different", so good. ", that's just a bad film making.
