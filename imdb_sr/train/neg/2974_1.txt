I'm a nice guy, and I like to think of myself as a tolerant genre. And, I suppose, I think I'm trying to watch a movie in the context of the genre it is in. If nothing else, that saves me from feeling like I should speak really nasty things about people or movies, which I do not like to do. The action in this is obviously obvious, the production values ​​are very low and sets, uh, simply. From time to time, the play was raised in "good for high school". My feeling that it was taken in one day - please tell me it was. Worst of all, sex, though pretty rich, was pretty earthy, disturbed, at least in my copy, "sound-over" that was inconsistent with the action (climatic rocks and cries while lying on bed by removing a bra?). There was definitely no "edge" to it - nothing distinctive or interesting, and with surprisingly quick cuts. My voice is then "1", with the following summary: it is better that the stripping material in the club is expanded, and the rest of the film is thickened.
