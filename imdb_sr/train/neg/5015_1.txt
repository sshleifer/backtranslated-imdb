As a film critic of several Dutch sites, I need to see many movies, not everything very good. Some movies are so bad that you will not be surprised that they are posted directly on the video. Alongside the taboo, I was surprised at what was published on the video at all. This is a really bad budget of poor quality bad-written garbage. A group of young people plays a game of taboo. They record their earliest desire or rank, and later people are killed for their taboo. The question is, should we believe what we see? The film has a potentially interesting plot, and I will not give it here. But what could have been interesting remains stupid, bad and for no reason. Some of the actors used to play in larger titles, so why have they applied for this for good? If you see this anywhere, try to avoid it. There is no logic in this film, there is no human sense of quality.
