It must be, after all, the absolutely worst movie I've seen in the last 20 years. When I saw Michael Madsen in it, I realized that he could not be a bad movie because he was in some pretty decent movies and he was a fairly fair actor. VRONG! Nobody should waste time on this movie. I was passing over 80% quickly and I do not feel I missed anything.
