I think Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I would not have the courage to go as high as 5 feet from the crocodile. But everything in this movie is bad. Farting jokes, people who are eating, and skit on the president make the movie one of the worst of all time. It's a really bad movie in which you have to stay away. All the "jokes" are so minor that you'll laugh because they are so stupid. The action is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old. I'm surprised that Croc Hunter did not ask the crocodile to eat it after he saw it.
