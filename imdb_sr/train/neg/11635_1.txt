It's okay for this to be a short and sweet review ... Something that the movie should have taken in practice did not make his life shorter and smoother than he was. There is a good reason for there to be a petition with more than 40,000 signatures. ALL who demanded that Uwe Boll stop filming franchises that people loved. Blood Raine is there big. Jokes are good ... if you have never heard them over a thousand times. The act is lowering, but you can really blame the script for it. Even a few moments I wonder if they even use the script. The film has nothing to do with Nintendo's original games. HELLO, if you played the game, you know that the main character does not have a real motivation beyond killer instincts such as mass murder because he scored a toe or simular. There are too many stories for such a stupid movie. Like I said. I would not even steal this movie. And for the person who says this is 'The Most Entertaining Movie 2007' .......... you need to look around, the news is better than this.
