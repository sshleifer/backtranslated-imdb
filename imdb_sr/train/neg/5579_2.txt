The Sixties are an occasional entertainment movie, most of this fun is from laughing film. It is extremely uneven and includes many unpleasant elements. Take, for example, a switch between black and white and color. If this is to be done properly, it could be quite effective, but because it was done badly, it turned into inconvenience and only took away a bad experience; a large part of the film had a strange feeling. The show was not extremely bad for a movie made for TV, but it was again quite unpleasant on other occasions. Many events were not coherent and in the end they were confusing. How did this family somehow end up in many great events during the sixties? The ending was too skeptical for my tastes; because it was holivised, it all had to turn out in the end. I advise you not to spend time on the 60's and do something else with your time. I'm glad to watch this in class, not in my spare time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the film was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. These are just my thoughts about the movie. I hope you will listen to my advice and stay away from this.
