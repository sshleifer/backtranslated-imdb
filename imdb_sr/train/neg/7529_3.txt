Bruce Lee was a great fighter, but this film is probably one of the worst films ever made. Bruce Lee dies as a result of a fall from a helicopter after being hit by a ninja knife at the back of the door, but that does not explain how he came to the helicopter because the previous scene is near him but not on a helicopter that is already 200 feet in the air. Since then, it has become quite absurd, like something from a cheap comic book. Perhaps the idea is not so corrupt, but it does not work with any degree of art from the point of view of film creativity. There are dozens of such martial bombers there, usually in Hong Kong. I think Jean Claude van Dam has improved the genre by adding convincing stories to his films and creating movie makers who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagel's movies are far better than 90% of the martial arts garbage films that emerged during the 1970s and early 1980s in Hong Kong. The "Death of II game" in my opinion belongs to the category of worthless cinema, despite Bruce Lee's being in it.
