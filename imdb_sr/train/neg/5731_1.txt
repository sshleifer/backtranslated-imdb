I watched the Unrated version of this movie and took about 30 minutes to never get my time. I endured to the end in the hope that the dialogue will improve, the martial arts will look realistic, the special FKS would actually look special. I was so wrong. I love Horror, I'm a full grain up. The number of some of the eighties is between the giants of the film world. However, this was not done in the 1980s, if this film came out in the early eighties, the fax could be forgiven because it looked so bad. It was not that there was no defense. The dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines that I whistled in writing, not in torture. I do not like Hostel, I never had, I thought it was overvalued, overweight and I did not feel anything about the protagonists, but shines like a lighthouse sizes next to this garbage. The back cover of Live Feed promised you would ever come, because I'm still waiting for a promise.
