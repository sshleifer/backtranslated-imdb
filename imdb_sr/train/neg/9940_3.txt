In the sixties of the last century, in the background was the trial and recording of "Simpathi for the Devil" in the classical album "Beggar's Bankuet" by the revolutionary bad boy Rolling Stones? Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Viman and Brian Jones ?? plus Marianne Faithful, Godard reveals other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movements? black power through black panthers, feminism, communism, fascism - interwoven with reading a cheap political novel about pulp, divided in chapters: "Stones Rolling;" Outside Black Roman ";" Sight and Sound ";" All about Evi ";" Heart of the West ";" Within the Black Syntax "and" Under the Beach of Stones. "" Sympathy for the Devil "is another pretentious and boring mess Disparate director Jean-Luc Godard, narration and recordings are terrible, but fortunately I love stones and "a crush on the devil" and it's nice to see them at the beginning of a career, otherwise this documentary would be unbearable. Voting is three. Title (Brazil): "Sympathy for the devil"
