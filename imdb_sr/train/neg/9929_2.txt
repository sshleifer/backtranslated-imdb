Watching this was as if a large mackerel was being pulled over and over again. Even when you thought: "This mackerel can not be restored again," * the slap is there. I'm not sure what they thought. This is the type of pilot I looked at and wondered, "Did the actors know that they were on a ship that was doomed to failure, which would never be turned into a series?" Not only black stereotypes, but also Swedish and Indian. And while "Blazing Saddles" turned these stereotypes into a mixture of comedy and discomfort, these stereotypes were simply offensive. There was no line of complications, he ended up slapping, and jokes were not. However, if you are a student of a comedy, watch the pilot to see what you should not do.
