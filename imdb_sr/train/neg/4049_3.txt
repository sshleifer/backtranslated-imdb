I did not like this vehicle, Bill Murray, when it was originally released in the '80s, so I tried to look at it again to see if my depression for this movie led to my movie tastes in the 1980s or was it "Stripes" It's just a bad movie. Well, the verdict is and "Stripes" is a bad movie. Now, "Stripes" may have been an innovative comedy of the early 1980s, and can attract people who have undergone basic training or who are fans of Bill Murray, but still a bad movie. Why is it Bad? Mostly because "Stripes" should be a comedy, but that's not so funny. There are some laughs, but few are. Most of the films enjoy a dramatic plot that is incredibly intricate and not interesting. This lack of comedy is especially noteworthy if you are used to modern comedies such as "Anchorman" who tries to laugh in every part of the film. Stripes continues to suffer from Bill Murray and Harold. Ramis's lack of acting skills. Bill Murrai is an excellent comedian, but at this time in his career he was not a very attractive drama actor, and Harold Ramis plays Harold Ramis. These two are simply not as good as actors who carry the dramatic line of the film. In the end, most of the comedy that is in "Stripes" revolves around God Murrai, an authentic, smart alexander. a man-child figure, so if you do not think that the character is funny (like I am not), you will not find the majority of the little comedy that is in the "Stripes" funny. "Stripes" is largely a movie of its era, it is not well old and not worth the attention. If you want to watch comedy in the early 80s, I would recommend "Stir Crazi". As "Stripes" humor in "Stir Crazi" is not as fast as in modern comedies, but unlike "Stripes" he grew much better and as a result he is still visible.
