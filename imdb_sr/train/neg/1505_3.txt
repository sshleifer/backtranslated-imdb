Pretty common stupid Italo-western, stupid story full of clich√©s and lack of logic, some central actors, dirty ambience, a multitude of shots and people shooting in massive proportions. This has nothing to do with Django. - At least not in my German-translated version, this German DVD release is called "Adios Companeros" and has Macho Callaghan, who is fighting Butch Cassidy and Ironheed because his gang killed his (he's the only survivor). Then Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fight each other because they were fighting and the gang split. And you have Ironhead who's fighting everyone, because he's the biggest and greedy assassin anyway. Yes, that's it, no more cleverness in the story, hehe. The small role of Klaus Kinsky as Revelation Cotton is remarkable (that's why I bought this DVD). In one scene, he tried to separate two men from the fight by striking them and screaming: "I said love!" and on the second scene he won the competition in throwing horses and crashing in a second - FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC !!! It is also amazing that JOE DAMATO aka Aristide Massaccesi did the cinema. incapable exploitation-thrash, so it was "aahhh" for me.
