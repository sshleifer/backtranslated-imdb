I will spend so much time on this review as the writers worked on the script. This is simply the LARGEST sequel EVER. They killed Navin Johnson. Not only was Mark Blankfield a GOD-AVFUL performance, so everyone else is !! Physical comedy was forced, straightforward, and predictable. It seems that the script was written by mongoloid monkeys who used the names Ziggi Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. As the producers managed to push this kind of cinematic feces out, it's beyond me. They even managed to make veteran actor Raio Walston look like a fool without talent. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself. I want 96 minutes of my life that I spent watching this fucking memory of a great comedy, so I can try and condemn everyone involved in this movie beast.
