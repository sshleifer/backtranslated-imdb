The film started well enough. He had a striking striking green meteorite, which received supersiles (telekinesis, X-ray, irrepressibility, flight, the ability to speak dogs, superspeed, thermal vision and the ability of plants to grow large and fast), and the fight against crime. From there it's all downhill. The meteor man gets his mother's costume, fights with resident gangs, and has many breaks with gang leaders who serve you to prepare you for the disappointing, long lasting and stupefiing ending. It would not be so incredibly bad that there was not a sighting of a boxing match where two fighters pretend to hit each other, while the audience looks forward until the fighters just continue to dance. Despite all these stupidities, the movie has good points. It is clear that if you try to accept only the gang, they will return to your home and hurt you. It states that gangs and communities must see their real enemies (big bosses who use them for their purposes to destroy honest people in the existence of a ghetto). It also states that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community, destroy predators that harm them. The only message he does not really have is that voters should ensure that their elected officials (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George V. Bush, and George H. Bush) are not also thieves. <br /> <br />
