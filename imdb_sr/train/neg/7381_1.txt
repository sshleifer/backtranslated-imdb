Okay, first, Seagal's voice is renamed 50% of the movie ... Why? Because there was obviously a rewriting of scenarios and stories while they were recording and they must change his dialogue for the continuity of the story because they have multiple versions. From the very beginning, you just scratch your head because overdubs not only disturb, but do not make any sense. Still, the story is still exhausted and it does not make any sense. When I came to the end, I just scratched my head because the film was so meaningless, and the end was not meaningful. Avoid plague. This movie forced me to stop watching Sagala directly on video films, because they only worsen and worsen.
