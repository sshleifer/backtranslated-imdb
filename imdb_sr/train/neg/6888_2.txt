This film is poorly conceived, badly behaved and badly written. John Heather is terribly boring and can not escape from the same Napolean dynamics. Self-obsessed and ignorant. Moreover, Diane Keaton plays the same smaller, overly obsessed mother, who is too concerned, and yet not enough about the lives of her children (see Because I said so). Anna Faris, although she likes her mostly, plays and idiots in this movie. Jeff Daniels is passable, but nothing special. Please skip this movie if you want to keep your soul.
