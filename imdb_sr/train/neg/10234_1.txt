I'll keep this short; Thanks to Greg, who helped me to briefly describe this: Imprisonment refers to the type of drug that adds a woman's drink, closes and tortures, and then presents himself as a prisoner to have sex with her. It's a unique craft and punchline movie. Torture is like rape with slow motion. And it's not even a good movie. Not so bad that it's good; That's just bad. It should also be noted that among the critics there is a "spoiler code" that does not dare to break, although some have been tempted to do this because it is so evil. Why no one had cojones to rise and say, "this is the garbage, and that's the reason why" is beyond me. Do not give your money to those whores.
