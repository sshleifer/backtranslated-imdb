One of the worst movies I've seen working with a bad camera, a fucking useful filter, the movie was grainy, the script was terrible, I think, come on, how predictable was the big battle at the end ..... <br /> <br Some of the combat scenes were fine, I guess .... Some scenes were so bad that it was comical ... as Sorbo takes the horse and rides in the end ... really .. horse? I can not forget how the bad killers roam in the same vehicle during the whole movie .. you might think that after killing key witnesses and federal agents, they were followed ... ETC, ETC really do not mind watching it ....
