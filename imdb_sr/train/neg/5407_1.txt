If you want to watch a real 'high quality' movie, come to Formula One. This miraculous movie must cost all 50 dollars. It contains a thin wafer script, pathetic bad sets, lighting and camera work, and stop motion, a paper mache monster that's extremely funny (it looks like they used to use a guy in a rubber suit and / or a monster glove dummy - but they were all equally terrible). All actors speak their lines as if they had never seen and read them from teleprompter before. Special effects are far from bad. The only sad thing is that they have dropped the really wonderful original title 'Tiranasaurus Vrecks' which sums up exactly what you get in full 90 minutes. This is what happens when the whispering bottom of the boom is so hard to break through to the lump that lies below. I loved every minute.
