I just saw this movie on Flick after shooting a timer. I grew up watching F Troop and I had a lot of effort for Vrangler Jane so I was shocked, literally shocked, to find out after I saw this film being a degenerate nurse for the killing of Melody Patterson, which looks pretty good, but looks quite different unfortunately it looks completely different badly photographed. I would never have thought it was in a million years. What the hell is she doing on this picture? I agree with the guys that the movie lacks what it pushes. No sex, no blood, no teasing. It's also a remake of Atomic Brain aka Monstrosity (1964 or somewhere). Most of the actions are tiring; The main character spends a huge amount of time running through the crazy house and the doctor's basement, and in the neighborhood in general, or when a policeman hits him, it's all boring and time-consuming. If the Italians did this, half of the movie would be Slingblade / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam, a sheep that fascinates unconscious naked girls. But you get it only 20 seconds.
