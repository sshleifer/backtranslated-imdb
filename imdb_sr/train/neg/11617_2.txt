This film "Joshua" is extremely disturbing and utterly meaningless. Actually, I seem to be trembling if I think there are people who will enjoy it. Without giving a story, this is the reaction of a young man to his newborn sister, which is just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout the film, the viewer is subjected to some of the most exciting behavior of children imaginable. By adding injury to the injuries, there is absolutely no real outcome to the end of this film, except for the creation of pure evil in the hands of the child, which has outgrown an entire group of stupid adults. There is no redemption, there is no justice for a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is happening around them. Frankly, I did not enjoy watching this movie. It was very disturbing. Even for those who could enjoy horror movies, this movie could be too much. Despite the fact that this film was a good actor, the story itself is so disturbing that watching was equivalent to waiting for 90 minutes in the dentist's waiting room in anticipation of a painful dental procedure.
