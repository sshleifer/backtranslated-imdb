This movie is horrible. It is not offensive but extremely predictable. The film follows the life of a small urban family in the mid-sixties. The father, the school director, is going through a middle-aged crisis. Enter a beautiful teacher from a large city that begins to challenge your students' minds with some things that give rise to thinking, as you think for yourself. The director disagrees with her teaching, but she is beautiful. You can link points. His teenage daughter (Vinona Rider vannabe Tara Frederick) is saturated with the life of a small town and wants to live. She gets some bad advice, hangs with some bad boys, and obviously family planning is not taught at her school. Shocking! Watching that director Paul Shapiro mainly worked on TV, this film is played as an adult version of a special school or as a special episode of one of the most ordinary series.
