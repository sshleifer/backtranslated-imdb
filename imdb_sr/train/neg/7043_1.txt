I was ready to laugh through this movie as an experiment of the Mysterious Scientific Theater, but it was just boring. It seems that the producers had many friends of biker enthusiasts, and from there they decided to film the movie. Often it is embarrassing. A lot of bicyclists that ride along the clay road, with the same repeating music. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon is hardly in the movie. Harmon would probably revive things. Maybe she had other obligations on the day of the shooting. Naturally, cyclists are terrorizing a small city. Fighting, murder, cowardly policeman, scary mechanic, etc. One of the cyclists always wears a football helmet, a poor attempt to distinguish it from all other outlaws. . One scene shows a biker who attacks a woman and yells at the woman's face "You're all the same! You're all the same!" Let's get back to the scene minutes later and he says again: "You're all the same!" Could the writer have been able to make something more creative to say? In the end, good guys killed bad guys. We also learned that a marriage was canceled between the middle-aged mechanic Joe and the young Susie. Susie goes to college, and we suddenly find out Joe's wedding is still in effect (but with another young man). The end.
