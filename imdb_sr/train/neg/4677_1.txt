What is the load on the left-wing Hollywood mallet. This film glorifies rebellion as brave and noble if it is about pacifist principles. The fairy tale ends with a pacifist character, played by Danzel Washington, and is actually upgraded due to betrayal. What about these Hollywood tools? Is this still a return to McCarthiism? If I sound cynical, it's because I have a lot of movies that run a political program. The war trumpet in this movie is shown as, what else? Gung-ho war robbers. Sounds familiar? Have you ever seen a movie in which the CIA or any government agency is not evil? Think about that. However, Crimson Tide emphasizes the point. Hackman's figure, Captain of the Ramsey submarine, encounters a crazy lunatic, until the end, of course, he feels, makes a complete 360, rejects his lust for blood, proposes the promotion of the treacherous Rona Hunter, and repents from retirement. The guy fights, takes over the command over your ship, puts the United States at serious risk of getting the first nuclear attack, and you promote it? What a stupid thing!
