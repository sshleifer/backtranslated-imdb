Is Miike like Chabrol, changing art with a shit, sometimes confusing two? Does he answer fifty-fifty feet of a claim for Chabrol? Do we see too much or too little Miike here? I do not know. I do not know. I do not know. But I could easily fill ten lines just by quoting thefts, allusions, and cliches of the Chakushin Ari. Others here will hit most of them, although not perhaps Ochiai's Saimin (Hypnosis) for the sleeves of telecasting that causes supernatural things. Only once, when Iumi took a mother like a zombie in his arms, One Missed Caller was a little stunned. Ishibashi in Audition's offensive story, and as Dead and Alive's Boss Aoki from the flick of fire and more, can be the most convincingly evil character I've ever seen. He's a cop here.
