Do not waste your money or time on this wretched film in the form of cinema. When every third word dedicated indecent language and there is no real plot, and acting old actors who still give the same performances dated from the past, which did not evolve in their careers, there remains much more to be said. I was expecting something better than the award-winning actor Benicio del Toro. The vision that others may have of a Puertorricans-being irreversibly distorted such waste as Maldeamores. The bad thing at a given moment in the film can be used to emphasize the given point of view and can even be funny or sad depending on the context (see the movie Elsa and Fred, for example), but should not dread complication. The film is a total disgrace and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this film.
