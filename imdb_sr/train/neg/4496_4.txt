This film is not interested in bad acting and bad set design, as well as for sticky lines and a ludicrous plan. But it's so much fun to watch. Everything about this is hilarious. The basic plot is a group of scientists from a future trip to the past to catch their evil collaborator intent on destroying them all. They arrive in 1146. The 'futuristic' laboratory of the 2033 scientists is an eighteenth-century room with a bunch of 'futuristic' blinking buttons and a weather capsule that looks like a grass shed. Actors deliver their lines with unpleasant applause, which is not hard to grasp because the lines are usually shakers like "I checked everything twice!" He checked everything twice? He checked four times? And not only that, they are already feeding you the entire premier of the film in the first five minutes and proceed with quick fire until they reach the medieval period. When Roger Corman ran out of money. And he had to stop traveling through time and consequently different sets. The medieval set is a comic mish-mash of everything, from the end of the 10th century to the 16th century. Any costumes they could find were used. I suppose the chain mail was not in the budget, because the guys all wear shirts with shingles that are shaved in the armor. The battle scenes are ridiculous, and men slip back into cardboard swords, abandoning and dying to death, throwing them with a drug attack. It sounds really terrible, but I enjoy it every time I watch it. Lines in themselves are enough to attack you, and everything else is sabotaged to create an incredible B-movie that, if you are a connoisseur of crazy moves, I suggest you see. And once you read it, read the review of unknown movies. I like to listen to them pointing to all the funny, really horrible parts of the movie.
