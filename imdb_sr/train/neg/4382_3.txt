Unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (despite being shown on the dead night), it is very well arranged and especially a graphic scene (described in "Stracultr") in which the Asian slave trader gets his compensation so However, the disturbing sequence in the film when a politician's throat touches a few girls (including, of course, Gemser and Shubert) at a midnight meeting under the New York Bridge with a group of rebels (this is the way in which he gets his votes, take it!) - with his friends from the high d the smiles that look rugged - it seems pretty intact. The gentler element of this entry - except Gems's tendency to completely take off every time she enters the house (even before the perfect strangers) - is her trip to India to interview charlatan / guru George Istman invented that he looks like Christ) extends the coitus unlimited, of course, when Emanuelle invites him, he ends up with a premature ejaculation ... !!
