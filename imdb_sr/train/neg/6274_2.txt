I'm generous giving this 2-star movie. the line about "did you even see the wizard from Oz" was the best part for me! with terrible writing and behavior as shown in this film, it's no wonder many of them have taken over the worthless TV reality show. Make yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit the game of baseball, you will be glad you did!
