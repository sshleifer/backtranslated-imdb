I know that movies do not necessarily reflect the reality, but this has plagued me. He maintains unknown stereotypes about "psychological trauma" and mental illness. The thing of "psycho-mum" was done many times (and usually it works better), and the bulk of the rest of the plot is also incredible. The acting was not terrible, but nothing about which could not be said. One peak: I am a longtime fan of the General Hospital and it was this time to see one of the roles played by former professor, John. Lindstrom. In any case, if you can overlook the false psychoanalytic part of it, in the same way that a person must suspend reality / reasoning when watching a lot of movies, then this film could be tolerable. If you do not have any better and fairly low standards. I'm sorry to spend time watching him.
