Var, Inc. - Corporations are taking over the war in the future and use lonely killer Brand Hauser (John Cusack) to do their job against the rival of the CEO. A dark comedy, both the army and the corporation pray. It was often difficult to understand what is happening exactly. I kept waiting for things to make sense. There is no reason or method of madness. Cusack believes that the "spiritual heir" of the Grosse Point Blank. So the war is more or less knocking. We see Cusack again as a killer who protects the spoiler from a person to be killed while braving for his conscience. To be fair, John Cusack looks somehow credible by pulling up half a dozen people with relative ease. Short fights look good. The rest of the film is not. It's all weird, it often borders with bizarre. War Inc. is not funny enough to be a parody, and too lively to think of anyone as a film message, which, I suppose, could be a senseless way in which corporations, such as war factions, compete and plan without respecting how they affect the average citizens. Interesting, but the satire simply does not work because it's not funny and there is no heart in the heart. We should worry about how the war affects Cusack's shell of character, not the millions of lives torn apart by the war. John Cusack gives decent performance. His character kills hot sauce and drives the smallest private plane, but is meant to replace character traits. Marisa Tomei waves as a romantic journalist. There is not much chemistry between them. Hilari Duff tries Russian accent and does not make a fool of himself. Joan Cusack just screams and sneezes and pulls wigs. Blech. Ben Kingsley may have to return the Oscars if he does not start over and over again. Pathetic. It's not a horrible movie, but in the end you have to ask "War, for what good is it?" Absolutely nothing. C-
