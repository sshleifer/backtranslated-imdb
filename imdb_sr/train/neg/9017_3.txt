I captured this Sci-fi movie before I went to work. If you are interested in seeing how Dean Cain dies and avoid being caught at least ten times, this film is for you. If it does not give you the greatest attention, well, I'm afraid you'll want to be the one who will be surrounded by flames, because this movie is pretty bad. The acting, for starters, is terrible, terrible, terrible. The characters are completely disgusting, and the dialogue is worse than your typical Z-class, Sci-fi movie. In the end, the film began to remind me of the 'Hollow Man' (complete with the escape through the elevator axis), except with the Dragon, not the naked, invisible man. Unlike other similar shifts, however, this was not even terribly bad ... it was simply bad.
