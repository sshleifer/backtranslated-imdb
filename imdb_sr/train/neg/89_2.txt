I've seen all the four films in this series. Each of them goes further than books. This is even worse. My problem is not to follow the book he's called in any way! Directors and producers were supposed to call it any other thing except "Love that is delighting in joy." The only thing about this film that seems to resemble the book are the names of some characters (Villie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). Names / years / half of children are wrong. The whole story does not exist in the book. I consider that it is a big disadvantage for Janette Oke, her books and her fans that under her title make a movie that is not correct in any way. Music is too loud. Actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. If you want a good family movie, it could do it. It's clean. But do not look if you hope for a shortened version of the book. I hope this will be the last movie in this series, but I doubt it. If there are more films, I want Michael Landon, Jr. and others come closer to original actions and stories. Books are great, and if we follow them carefully, they would make great movies!
