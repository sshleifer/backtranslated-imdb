This film gave NISHA new or valuable. After I saw her, my wife and I agreed that the studio simply put it out and that it was easier if it was fun. This is a good example of the "movie of the only concept" - they have a film concept, and other details are irrelevant because executives know that they will make $$ only based on the initial concept. The film begins when Cruella leaves the prison and goes on parole. She no longer hates the puppy, but is programmed to adore them - she just could not hurt her. This does not last long after her release, and she returns in old ways. Period of time. The most unfavorable aspect of the film were the accompanying characters. Eric Idle, as the voice of Vaddlesworth's bird, made me hate him-and that's TOUGH since I'm a stubborn fan of Pithon. It was obvious that he did it because they gave him a lot of money (there can be no other reason). The servant of Cruelle's low self-esteem, Tim McInnerney, was ridiculed in the Black Adder shows, but here he is totally lost and infertile. And it must have cost several dollars to get Gerard Depardieu, but he was completely lost. There were some other auxiliary actors, but given that the characters were badly written, I'm trying to block them out of my mind. All in all, it's better to let the kids watch TV. than letting them see this mess.
