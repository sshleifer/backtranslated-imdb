I wonder who's responsible for this mess. Jokes would not work for Gilligan's island. Had this been going on in the series, would there be a joke about Auschwitz, or would Eva have to replace her oven, only if Adolf proposed that kind of 50 seats? Another post compares this show with Love to Lucie. The problem is that Lucille Ball was a genius in physical comedy and bizarre situations, and this mess was simply poorly done and an insult to my intelligence. After the damage done by the Nazis to England and the number of people who killed them, I think the concept of a comedy about Hitler would look repulsive and most normal people would kill this concept before any episodes were produced.
