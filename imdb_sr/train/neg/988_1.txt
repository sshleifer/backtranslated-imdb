This film offers nothing to anyone. It does not work at any level. The acting is a terrible, boring, long-lasting drop. They were obviously about the length of the end of the sex scene trying to be shocking, but they just ended up quite a parody of what the movie was trying to do. Complete rubbish, I can not believe what a ridiculous movie was. I'm sure Rosario Davson has ended up in this movie because, although it would have been her daring, she separated an indie hit, a stunning NC-17 film. The problem is not that an adult will hold this film because the film appears as an unattractive episode of the OC or something that is directed at teenagers. Pathetic.
