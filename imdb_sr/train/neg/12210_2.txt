This movie is a joke and it must be one of the worst movies Stallone has ever made. This is a typical film from the 1980s, in which a man himself destroys the entire army. "First Blood Pt 2" is very similar to Schvarzenegger's "Commando", but here you have Arnold who kills a terrorist while you have a specific nation here as bad guys. This film is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. True, this was the peak of the Cold War, but it is my pain that the Communists or the Nazis are always shown as enemies. There are so many American films that have this common thing. Why is not there a movie that shows Americans as enemies? Who will believe that a lone soldier will destroy the whole army? Do you really think that something really would have happened? In all likelihood, an average, American observer who was brainwashed would certainly be.
