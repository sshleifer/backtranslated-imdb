All right, the introduction, with its hockey offer of a free suitcase to anyone who dies of fear in the film, is so scary that it's ridiculous. And so the first "skull scene" is so drawn and unbridled that it's ridiculous. The real plot of the movie is somewhat decent, there is at least a little bit of food for thinking in the behavior of characters, and the tangle of the story is decent how horror walk. The acting is average, but not really bad. All in all, this film does not fall quite exactly in the way that the film would be 1/10. It is not scary enough to get the lowest rating or even the lowest. If I only read the script, I would say that there is a potential to be a decent movie. Only that horrible direction and production destroy the film. So, that's a bad movie, but there's a lot worse.
