First, the title character is not even the main character of the movie. He is the assistant to the leader of the cult. The actor who portrays Igora believes that loud screaming, hysterical laughing, and distortion of a smile while crawling your eyes is a great way to scare people. Likewise, Igor had a disturbing habit of shouting (because he never spoke) with a loud voice. He would say idiotic one-layer. For example, when a cult leader kills one of his followers with a buzz, Igor, after seeing it, yells: "Paul! No Paul! Why did you do that? I could cut it off! It's so clean!" In the second scene, Igor tells the victim that he will have to 'get his own tools for surgery, because right now there was a time for surgery.' In addition to the bad acting, the end did not make sense, because while the story builds the few couples that are at its peak, Igor takes the arrow of the arrow to the head and the rest of his crazy friends who are killed, he appears. twice twice to kill the remaining 'good guys'. The film does not offer any explanation for this, it only tells the viewer that Igor has escaped from a psychiatric hospital. What??? The conclusion is not to waste time watching this movie. I wish I could bring back the moments that I lost by looking at this.
