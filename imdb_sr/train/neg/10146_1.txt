'Flight Of Fury' is shockingly awesome, but the worst of all boring Action films - I do not expect much from Seagal, all I expect is to moderate 90 minutes with some foolish actions - unfortunately this is not even that low expectation, action scene the action (which is completely irrelevant in these films) is unnecessarily complicated and confusing with huge cavities, the acting is truly hopeless - it borders with the shameful Seagal and its whispering of one expression on the face is the best among the sad sorts of third rating - it's hard for me yes p I believe that any of the 12 million dollars spent on this terrible mess if you do not take $ 11 million from earnings and 12 - somehow I doubt it! One moment of interest for Straight guys or gay girls is that from seemingly nowhere two hot chickens do not end up in some kind of lesbian sexual scene along with huge bangs on the screen in addition - that's the central thing that does not differ from many Michael Dudikoff B-Movies, which I have endured <br /> 1/10
