You realize that for eight years you've been watching EXACTLY SHOW? I could understand the initial curiosity to see unknown people on an island, but I would think that after watching the unmanaged, stinking heroes running through bushes with eggs on a spoon for half a decade, it would be enough to get to devote something to the original (and more interesting). And I'm not even talking about the validity of the display which is considered questionable for the record. It's hard to put an end to the disbelief that Bushi Bill eats rats when the whole team of producers and people with a camera is placed in an air-conditioned bio-dome with interchangeable shifts, sipping cold mochcinno with moxin. What is the Appeal here? I do not care about these people or their vivid lives. I just do not understand. But if you find yourself fascinated by hairy, unwanted people, I suggest you turn off the TV and just go to your local bus station where you can see these people in their true habitat. They call them BETTERLY PEOPLE, and for free, you can relax and admire their incredible ability to reach various residues of cigarettes from a handful of garbage cans, eventually hit "dirt" and make domestic cancer Dr. -Stick, all the time, ask people to change food when the smell of "Akua Velva" in their breath is enough to suggest otherwise. And the best part? Similarly to Survivor, a member of the tribe "Leaves" "Island" every week, when they ruthlessly sent packing to a local institution when a terrifying state without full schizophrenia hits the speed! Now it's a party!
