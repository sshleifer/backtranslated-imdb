What was it supposed to be? Remake Fisher King? Why do we care about Sandler's character? What a slow, boring, boring film that co-gives-damn-o-those-people !!! It was simply painful to sit, I turned it off before he finished. So it's obvious that Cheadle needs help as much as Sandler; as I said: can you say "King Fisher"? And how does this psychotic character work in his everyday life? I suppose we should not think so deeply. Why does Cheadle continue to give Sandler a chance to become violent? If they were such good friends, how did they break up? If Cheadle has control, why ask for a psychiatrist's advice on the street? We have never been told. That's why Fisher King was a better movie on so many levels and why it's just bullshit. Almost 8 out of 10 average results? I do not agree. At all. Even top movies are lucky to get such a high average rating, and this shit does not deserve to be in the same universe with them.
