Do not waste your time watching this! Unless you want to study for all the wrong things that you should not do to make a good movie. I am not a person who usually watches a movie, but this one is personal. I spent a precious time that I can not return. I feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste time watching this shit. If this is a student project, I should say it's not bad, but only for the first 15 minutes ... after that, it becomes embarrassing. screaming, bad sound, bad video (a good camera could do it much better). and yes, what about the effect of Blair-Witch? No budget? I was hoping it would be better, but no. How the hell did he earn 4? 2 is fair, but 1 for wasting time! I said my peace.
