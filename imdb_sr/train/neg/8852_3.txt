To be honest, I did not see all the original 'screaming', but the scenes I've seen obviously is that the first wrap was an excellent movie. so wonderful that it was necessary to make seven horrible sequences. they started with Hovling II: Your sister is a waswolf. I got this VHS film from my uncle some time ago when he gave a lot of old movies he bought when Atari was brand new. I just looked at him last night, and it was not really bad, it was weird. I mean, the whole thing with Sibil Danning that goes in three directions with two of her insects was unreasonable and rather disturbing (but somehow hot), Christopher Lee wanted to kill Dead Karen as if he were a vampire, etc. , this film was actually like some sort of mish-mash of Dracula and The Lost Bois ... except with the insects, because everything that Christopher Lee (who played Dracula himself) talked about wolves who were mostly cut off from every other vampire film in the heart, garlic, nightmares must die in the night, and the ruler of the weir is living in TRANSILVANIA). not much for the acting, but the worst came from Annie McEnroe. I swear, at one point in the film I found myself cheering on the wolfs to throat her throat, because that damn throat must always say something. In any case, the plot is pretty stupid and clich√©, so there is no real point to tell you, you could just read about it on Wikipedia. Otherwise, the thing that really bothered me about this movie is the fact that this is the only movie of all seven sequences that are in any way related to the original (not counting Hovling IV (1988), which was a remake of the original, or in other words, a sequel based on the same novel). so do not watch this movie. there is no real horror, barely having a waswolf, and a terrible special fk. 3/10
