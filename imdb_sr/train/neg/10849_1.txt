Normally when I go to the local Hollywood video I'm going to B-Horror movies. For me, the basic principles behind the film B-Horror are that for me, the value of the camp, Heavi Gore, Much unnecessary nudity and special effects that everyone can put together with the packing of corn syrup and latex. I rented Cradle of Fear because I was a fan of the band since they released the first Demo in 1995. The film started on an interesting note, and then when I saw Dani Filth go on a very obvious latex mask and LAUGHED. When I saw a lesbian sex scene for lesbian sex scene, I laughed even harder. I spent almost the whole movie laughing and when I did not laugh, I shook my head thinking that the multi-million rock star wanted to make a movie that looked like it was in the budget of hundreds of dollars. It seems to me that the whole point of this film has attracted the "Hardcore Goth children who think that death, destruction, sex, blood, and Satan's greatest things have been invented ever since the Lava lamps." That was really for me. This movie looked like 80.5 % What happened in this movie happened only because it was Satanic. This film had a lot of potential and could really be a good movie, but in the end this "movie" is really just extended to Cradle of Filth Video.
