The worst, and many people who really need to know better (actors have six Oscars between them). It was set up in 'modern' Africa, (it was created in 1979), and it relates to slave trade. It's terribly scripted and acted, (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and Villiam Holden achieve a low career in this), and completely lacking excitement that would have a moral focus. It is also absurdly drawn. For a moment you do not believe that some of the characters would behave the way they do it in these circumstances. Richard Fleischer manages, but you have the impression that it was over the phone. This is as bad as it can.
