Basically, it's a couple who wants to adopt another child. At the adoption agency, they meet with the mouse (Stuart) and decide to adopt it. If you think this is stupid, hold it because it gets worse. Stuart arrives at his new home, where he is treated as a human child. (Reserve me!) The rest is usually a common cliché, family problems, jealousy from an older "brother", and eventually all questions are solved and all are "happy family". Bored and exhausted, as it is, is shown in the most dumb and unsophisticated way. I do not know if the director believed that he was creative by introducing the mouse into the cliche, or only trying to fill it for a few minutes, but only upgraded the clichés from the boring to the abominable. Why I then gave 3, and not ZERO? Because of a family cat who likes Stuart as much as a "brother". And for some funny gigs, where Stewart is using his small size well. Overall I believe the film will work pretty well if: a. Stuart was PET, not "brother". b. He kept on ridiculous performances, as Stuart tried to outwit the cat, and omitted the boring clichés that did not match with anything else.
