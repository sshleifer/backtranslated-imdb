Please, warn: this film, although a pretty bad story, was one of the most horrible films I've ever seen ... EVER. Just remember that before you get to the couch to enjoy the movie. So, officially begins with the fun. Just an average party, but there's some type. It's pretty good at Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. Remember his face; This will help later. So Kate goes to find George Cluni (I did not say that the plot was bad?) and so takes the tube. It's London underground in the middle of the night, but she's so stupid. So the order of the drive says the next, and last, the train will arrive in 7 minutes. Now, Kate, the stupid girl who is her, decides she can sleep for free 7 minutes. She usually misses the train and is locked in London underground. Sam. Well, almost ... So, the movie goes on from there. Blood, bowels, limbs, even certain parts of the body that I will not mention are cut and eventually amputated by the body. In short, it's a typical horror; beautiful but thick girl in women and sick, strange psychopath. Or, as it may be, Creep. I would say that it should be released if you are in Sav, Hostel or Tekas Chaseav Massacre, but for the rest of us, scream with the pleasure of horror you need a lot of thanks.
