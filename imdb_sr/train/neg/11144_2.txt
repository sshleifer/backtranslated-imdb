This film reminded me of those lame "erotic thrillers" that I used to get used to late and watching Cinemak when I was 13 years old. I would label this film as a glittering core because there are simply no simulated bugs and grinders. There is, however, a bunch of nudity - the introductory scene is in a strip club, we see Kane Hodder keester (or at least a relay) and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of a movie and act a female insect who seems to have robbed Munster for a costume. Boys of 13 years rejoice. In addition, the willow transformation scene has the worst CGI I've seen for years. The recordings look like FMV from the Resident Evil video game in terms of quality. The wolf is too bad to be explained and, despite the poor quality of the suit, it is shown too many times. Action and acting do not make sense. There is some strange story about the worms and hybrid wolfers - Darkwolf is the latter, but from what I can say hybrids do the same thing as all the invertebrates - they look human, they change to the dragon people who kill. Darkwolf is trying to find a partner, but unusually he can not find a partner, but he can bargain with anyone he touches. Once again, these skills are less useful than Darkvolf struggles to kill a few people whose target has never touched, met or even saw the best I know. A friend does not know she is a jeweler and she is struggling for transformation or something. I would think it would be hard to screw up a plain monster movie bad like this one, but it's good. You want a quality modest inferno, go for a hire. Soldiers want tons of T & A. This is your movie.
