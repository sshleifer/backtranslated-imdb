This was a strange movie. It started pretty well. A solid sound track behind the glittering pictures above and a crime like our psychopath did its thing. Then comes his "Fall Fall". Poor acting, I think how hard it is to hold a gun and behave like a policeman? These guys could not. After the death scene of our psychopath, we get an initial loan and the film begins ... From now on they are bad big tits, an occasional pot of blood and poorly made death scenes. Br /> It was said that I gave the film to the four because, despite his faults, he kept some sort of horror that I could not completely shake off. I do not recommend this. but I must admit it seems worse.
