I can not believe I spent an hour watching a bad movie. If there is only one movie you need to miss, this is one. Robert is a teenager whose father recently died, so he starts to hang out with some local anti-social teenagers and uses drugs. All this makes him subconsciously violent and finally such a subconscious explodes ... The first thing is not to think that I can find any meaning or trace of great ecstasy in this movie, not in any sign. If the director considers what I have seen in the last few minutes as a great ecstasy, I must say that it is not even close. Cinema is also not ripe. For most of the time, I could not see the facial expressions of the actors and I did not feel that body language was sufficient to make an impact. Perhaps the crew were so tired that they fixed the camera there to include everything in the settings. Everyone is happy except the audience. The operation is particularly weak. There are many unrelated scenes and speeches that might be related, but they are really so random that you can never collect them all, perhaps unless you are the ones who wrote them. In one and a half hours you can find less than 5 minutes of real acting and all the rest of the time are just people who walk, speak, and move. So I really can not comment on the acting here. Good choice of music in the last few minutes. Maybe this is the only good thing. I never gave movie 1, but this film certainly deserves (at least you laugh when watching Scari Movies). This is a film about when an unsuccessful attempt to portray troubled teenagers encounters an extremely disturbed audience. I hope you do not fall into any one group.
