As much as I love Rodney Dangerfield, this was a horrible movie. The action was some sort of holistic tearing up of various films, but unfortunately, they forgot to roll off any good joke. In addition, it was boring and boring, and that was kind. If you are looking for a good laugh, rent a copy of your private parts.
