A film about a small town with an equal number of mormons and baptists. A new family entered, there was an overwhelmed dialogue, a central act, a green salad of helms with chopped carrots, and every other "inner Mormon joke" known to man. Anyone outside the Mormon culture will find it hard to study this movie. Anyone in the Mormon culture will have a bit of fun and fun with the smiling here and there. You will be better off watching Hess's other movies (Napoleon Dynamites, etc.) than trying to sit through this one. The acting is central. Jared Hess had many more high-quality films such as "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamites". I would recommend both films through this voice.
