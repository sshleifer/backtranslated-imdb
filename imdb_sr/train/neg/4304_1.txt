This is an anti-Serbian propaganda film made for TV. "Muslims are good; Orthodox Serbs are bad". It is a message. The use of "entertainment" to transmit a propaganda message is nothing new. This film puts it in the thick. I know better. I know better. Serbs, under General Draza Milhalovic and his Chetniks, were rescued by 500 killed American pilots from the Germans in World War II. Churchill decided to betray Milhalovic and put British support behind Communist Tito. Roosevelt followed them, and as a result, after the end of the war, Yugoslavia was handed over to Communist Tito. And the American ally Milhalovic has since been blighted by the media. The film is part of an anti-Serbian propaganda campaign designed by George Soros and his International Crisis Group (ICG) that culminated in a "war" in Kosovo, in which NATO bombed Serbia for completely false claims by the ICG on " mass graves "in Kosovo filled with" victims "of the ugly Serbs. The fact that there were no such mass graves and that Albanians (Muslims) did not work in Kosovo in Kosovo are facts that most media will not print. I'm watching this movie because One sentence on the video title looked interesting. Imagine my disgust when I discovered that I was deceived to rent another branch of propaganda machine intended for Serbia. Instead of this propaganda, someone should film a film about the Clinton administration's unwillingness to came clean with the Congress and the United States about his complicity in the delivery of weapons from Iran to the Muslim government in Sarajevo. I will not hold my breath waiting for such a film.
