This Masters of Horror installation was terrible. Obviously, Mr. Carpenter should learn something about the pace and a decent, acceptable dialogue. There were times when I literally screamed on TV that something had happened. Perhaps he thinks he's building uncertainty, but Carpenter needs to shrink that exaggerated, overly simplified musical party of his (or his son) and slightly improve the action. How many times the girl said, "Oh no, I can not have this baby!" and "Oh, not coming here"? Carpenter takes elements from much, much better movies (Assault on Precinct 13 and The Thing) and throws them here as if we need to admit and appreciate his trademark. What is missing here is true uncertainty and energy. It's like it's in the month through the process of making a movie. For better Carpenter movies, stick to the tried and true classic - The Thing, Halloween and Thei Live. For better masters of horror episodes, take a look at my personal favorites: Families, Jenifer and Dreams at Vitch House.
