Simply put, I do not like Westerne. And since I have never overcome one from the beginning to the end, I decided to watch "My dear Clementine" and see it all the way, no matter how painful it was for me. At first, it was as sad as it was expected. I thought that the act was funny, that the landscape (your standard desserts, horses and cowboys) was boring, and music and its timing on the edge of pain. However, after mentally speaking to fight, after the first 20 minutes, it became much easier for me to withstand. Focusing on the cinema, and how John Ford managed to make even the most sophisticated situations (boring to me) looks rather amazing, makes it more interesting. In conclusion, I can not go so far as to say that I enjoyed the movie to the end. However, it was good enough for me to sit all the way down to the very end, and this impresses in itself.
