This film deals with the story of Eddie as mentioned in the title and his return to old friends in the community at sea. The action refers to a group of friends when it comes to the light that Eddie left as a means of coping with the death of a friend in which he somehow feels responsible. But this is inconsistent, because the choices made in production are extremely poor and not fully realized. Scenarios do not always have to be 'funny', but they should at least help the development of a story. Here, attempts from one line, such as "he just took off" or "I know you do not have love in the heart," are completely challenging something that's worth the audience time. Also, whenever the writer feels lost where to go next, he records the music installation of a protagonist walking through the fields to some indie music. Talk about trying hard. If you are interested in a good movie, the one that gives quality and essence only in style, then that's not a movie for you.
