There's no way you'll be worried about any of these characters. A crowd of spoiled middle classes of sick children take some drugs at a party and fight each other and argue. I just saw this on TV and I did not think it was a "movie" as such, a more post-'This Life 'indulgence that really does not have resonance or appropriate drama. Such things will be ordered for unforgettable moments, unfortunately, irrelevant shit of "lifestyle" of middle class that is too seriously understood. In it is David Baddiel and that bird from Cold Feet, you know what to expect. There were a lot of these things around 2000, it was a particular British weakness ... "they are educated and working drug friends, but somehow dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships? Sounds great!". This kind of stupidity, and post-Gui Ritchie comedy-gangster stuff ... dark days. If you have a taste, it will annoy you to the point of violence.
