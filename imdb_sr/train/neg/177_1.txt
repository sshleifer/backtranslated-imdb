If you are planning to see this movie, please consider it. I do not usually comment on something I've seen on television, but this was such a loss of my life that I needed to do something productive to get that bad taste from my mouth. Criticizing this film would take too long because there are so many things in it. I'll just say, please, never watch this movie. It was a total loss of my time, and that would be your waste. Anyone who wrote a positive review of this film is one of two things; extremely incompetent, or working for the company that produced it. Again, I guarantee you will really regret that you watched this movie!
