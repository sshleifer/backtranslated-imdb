Did they use your entire budget and pay for porn stars or what?!? The bulk of the acting was good considering the scenario ... "virgin virgin" played a very good role. Mutants look really cool, and this actually could have been a really cool movement with the right brain behind the wheel ... but, unfortunately for everyone involved, that's not the case. I do not even have money! It's good that I did not rent a movie myself!
