After buying a DVD in Bargain Bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the front page, I put it in a DVD player and everything looked good. Nice animated menus and lots of extra features ... but when I released the movie myself, what made it go down. It's the worst thing I've ever seen and I've seen some bad movies in my time. The comment that praises the movie here in IMDB is actually from people who made the movie. So do not believe if you do not want to spend your money!
