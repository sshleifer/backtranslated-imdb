At first, I was convinced that this film was made for a TV that was not worth the primitive time. But after a few minutes of stupid awe, I realized that there was at least a comical value in over-the-top stunts and c-movie starring. This film would get 1 that my wife and I did not laugh as much as we watched wondering actors can hold the right face. It was like a less funny spy version of The Big Hit (I was so lazy that I bought Big Hit DVD) with even worse acting. We were disappointed that Nick decided to marry Elen, and not for Jim, after all the embrace and high five. A few rum and coke will surely help to get down.
