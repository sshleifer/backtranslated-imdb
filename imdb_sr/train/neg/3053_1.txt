Vov. Who ever said that Edward D. Vood Jr. has never affected anyone? This steamy bundle of assassins is the perfect case; makes "Violent Years" look like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" also makes Keith Richards the worst flashbacks look like my first night show. I had nightmares, you know, awakening and sweating bullets, which will never come close to the visceral terror that Santa Claus dug out of the apparently clean ground of my being. However, I can imagine some parties in which this movie could pass well. Also, if you are looking for the perfect example of the Santa Vat dictation on the VHS cassette, do not look for further. Do not watch this movie, as I'm informed that the MST3K version is now available. Move over Satan, here is the "Santa Claus".
