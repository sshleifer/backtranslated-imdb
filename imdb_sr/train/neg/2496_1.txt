I would feature this film under the horror film genre. I did it because I'm not aware of a genre called terrible. Since the genre horror is closest to the horror, I decided to put it in this category. The acting was amateur. You know who the villains are on the first scene. A heroine is ugly as well as a movie. Students of film creativity should take this film as an example of a lesson that should not be done in the film. That's so bad. Man is a bad word of underestimation. Zlikovci seize an ocean boat and want $ 10 million. They want the money to be shipped to the populated island of Rose amid the Pacific. They would sit like ducks after they got the money. There is no escape plan. How stupid. Female director of the cruise is a former policeman, a navy seal, kung-fu I'm afraid. A funny part is the way the time bomb is destroyed. He says he knows what he is doing and constantly pulls all the wires one at a time. Then he puts it in his pocket and towards the movie with all the connections. Is it crazy? Like crazy people who watched this RIDIKOLNO. If you have M-i-L that you do not like. I do not mind renting this movie and pretending to enjoy it. I assure you that you will definitely tell your wife that you have such a bad taste and that her son / daughter married a person below the standard of the family.
