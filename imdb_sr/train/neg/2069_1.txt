I went to see this at the Eskuire Theater in Cincinnati, Ohio, and now I hate my life. Christopher Reeves would be a more convincing boxer. As a film he was sick, but looking at Brett Carr himself it was desperate to be at his peak. My favorite part of the movie was to see that KK hit the face of what looked like a "C" battery. The jury is still on it. She was from dildos and was in a slow pace. Yes. "Shoot only to the left side of the face ... people become famous for the hardest things!" - Bret Carr B. Carr dressed Chicken Costume for a little reverse psychology, wandering the streets of Clefton and breaking his film. He should. It's true that the film is released. My soul was bitter after this film. Bret Carr is not charismatic enough to be the leader of the cult, or smart enough for that matter. It's the feeling that you get from what Bleepeskue drops of a brainwashed, impressive neo-iuppi who came to see this Bret Carr piece of work. , so goodbye. -Anonimous
