"The Crush" is a pleasant 40-something romantic girlfriend for the first two thirds, as she is trying to be Brit and "Sek and the Citi." Especially I enjoyed the reversal of a trophy young piece whose character was not much enriched (we think that we have not seen everything that is a lot of physical body from it, and Kenni Doughti is worth seeing more). Surely they made much more work than a younger / older woman than they were made from the opposite of both versions of "Sabrina" (I do not even like a movie) or for that thing with Douglas / Zeta-Jones or Dion / Swing Wedding. Nearby Andie MacDovell as formerly otherwise welcome familiars from British drama and comedy, such as whore-tongued Anna Chancellor. The plots are rounded to the end and feel very deus ek machin. But only when the credits appeared in the end, I realized what could really be wrong. As with Sex and the City, the writer / director is a man, here's the first Scottish officer, John McKay, and I think he really wanted to make a script about three gay men, probably about going out in relation to his lovers and at work (characters are school principal, cop and doctor), which would be a better and more interesting film. The working title for the film was "The Sad F * cker's Club", which would make its parallels with the gay club "Broken Hearts" even more obvious. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 6/6/2002)
