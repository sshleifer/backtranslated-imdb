Before I begin ... let me say that I fully believe in God. I believe in heaven and hell. Kai now, when that is so, I just want to say that what the worlds do these morons who call themselves "hosts" think they are doing? The last time I checked the host does not discriminate, it evokes hateful full of TVs, or tries to push my beliefs into every unfortunate soul that goes to the channel. But these crazy, idiotic, conservative, biblical battles, the lover of Fred Phelps, Pat Robertson work everyday. I am for freedom of speech, but since when does it cover a guy that pretty much says that if you dare to go to his ideal lifestyle that you immediately sent to hell? This is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of SOOOO many problems. One day in my classroom we had a substitute teacher, so we decided to watch TV because the teacher did not give us any work. And we (against the will of many of us) watched the Club 700, and of course that patty Pat nagged and buzzed about the Bible, and said that Simon modeled on "God says homosexuality is a sin" and I actually heard the child go "Hmm, I guess it's right." VTF ??? Seriously, if the host tries to make people think that others' sexual orientation is a big sin, then they must seriously take this host, sticky tape and throw them off the cruiser in the middle of the Arctic.
