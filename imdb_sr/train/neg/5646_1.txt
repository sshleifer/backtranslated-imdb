A completely predictable silly idea of ​​a man who killed his wife by sniffing her while driving and claiming to have fainted. Why was he still driving a car? Why did he still feel able to drive the car and kill his wife? This question did not tell the writers. The story then asks about a psychologist and her unsuccessful marriage that is related to an unsuccessful marriage with a darkening driver killed by women. A twinning mother and a one-dimensional child are put in a good measure, and the whole is built up to the foreseeable development and ending. Are police psychologists so easily received? Deadly writing that actors are doing the best they can, but they are doomed to failure. This is parallel to the Harlequin romance. Do not waste your time watching this unless it's what you're targeting.
