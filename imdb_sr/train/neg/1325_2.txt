Richard Dreifuss is, indeed, in this film, but in a fairly small part. He is NOT "obsessed" by the director - he is a business manager / group accountant. Even the box incorrectly describes the movie. There are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke, as advertised, unless the term "erotic" is not used completely loosely. I would not consider watching a movie without Richard Dreifuss in him as the protagonist. Perhaps, however, I realized that the famous anthem of the 60's, "Suzanne" by Leonard Cohen, was an artistic influence. In addition to the short recitation of the lines from the end of "Ulisses" by James Joice and interesting visual references to Ingmar Bergman's "Seventh Seal", I discovered that this is a bad attempt to combine symbolic elements and moods embedded in films like "Last Year in Marianbad" and " Un Chien Andalou ". If you like the idea of ​​an eccentric artistic hull, there are many superior movies, from "Bie, Bie, Brasil" to "Cecil B. Demented".
