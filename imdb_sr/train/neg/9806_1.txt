I can not explain why the popularity of the children's television show, Pover Rangers. I never understood why kids who do not doubt love this show, because the characters look so idiotic and not worth worrying about everything. The costumes look totally awful, such as the multicolored spandex that people wear to go to the gym. What exactly is the purpose of this in any case, but for children to learn how to fight to solve their problems? What's with the terrible haircuts and clothes on this show? Not to mention this show that continues to be played on cable television, just to earn money to teach children how to fight each other when they disagree about a particular problem. There's a lot of fun for today's kids, we hope they are not as gay as the children of the nineties who watched this show. Oh, what about homo erotic tension between red and green renderers?
