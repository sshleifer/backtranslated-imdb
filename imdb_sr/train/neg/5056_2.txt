*** SPOJLERI *** Let's start with the "good" of this movie - a useful game by Cinthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the acting is terrible (this is not supported by the horrible scenario). The worst culprit is the criminal, Buntao, the head of the Asian criminal union (played by Frans Tumbuan). I laughed at my head while expressing my "anger" over losing a lot of money; horrid performance. Patrick Muldoon is not much better, and his line "It's an Enemy Takeover" (that's the rest of the title of this movie) was delivered as badly as possible. There are no other major characters, but no other actor / actress has stood out in this film. Next we come to conspiracy. This should tell you everything you need to know: In the original "Rage and Honor," Cinthia Rothrock, starring Chris Fairchild, was a teacher in the city center. Now, she is C.I.A. agent (or it was another government agency - I'm sorry, but this movie was so bad that I do not even remember it). Hmmm ... I can imagine what is C.I.A. was similar to the application process. Questioner: What work experience did you have? Chris: I was a teacher. Questioner: Ok; you're busy! I give it only "2" for some decent acting and a nice twist in the end (although we know that Tommy (Muldoon), a secret criminal, will be caught).
