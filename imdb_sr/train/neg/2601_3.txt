I just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to watch how I like Drew Barrymore and I wanted to see one of her early films. The film is about a girl (played by young and beautiful Drew Barrimore), who moved from New York to Los Angeles to overcome her recently disturbed loss. In short, after moving a guy who falls in love with her, it becomes obvious that she has the double count of the duplicate who is persecuted. The film is pretty poor and bad. Both dialogue and acting make the movie really worthless to look at it. Summarizing this is something for lovers of Drew Barrimore.
