I can not believe I'm wasting my time watching this trash! I did it because Leonard Maltin gave him an "AA" rating, and for TV films, this is usually a reliable indicator of some quality entertainment. on any medium of communication. The plot is ridiculous, the motivation of "bad guys" is completely absent, and various family interactions are stupid and shallow. For example, Dad preaches that the aggressive reaction to aggression is bad, but it turns out that she is a "wonderful" person NOT because of her "ignoring the idiots" of philosophy, but because she is pretty good with her fists ... The only message I could I gather from this paper that the nuclear family is good, and alternative life arrangements are bad. Oh, and bad people are good people.
