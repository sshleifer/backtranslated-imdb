* The inspection may include spoilers * Predictable, poor special effects. has a sense of TV movie. The idea of ​​the UN as a takeover by Satan is an interesting turn to the end of the world according to the Bible. The premise is interesting, but its absence falls short. if you want to turn people into Christianity with such a movie, at least make it a quality! I seriously checked the watch while I was watching this piece of shit. I can not say much more about this movie since I saw it more than a year ago, and there is not much to say about this movie except ..... skip it!
