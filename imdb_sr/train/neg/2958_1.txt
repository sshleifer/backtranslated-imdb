This film was astounding. It's out of fear. I often meet with a group of friends and go to the movies to find horrible films that will watch their comedy value. My friend suggested this, but as we watched it, people began to leave. I really wanted to finish, just to say that I did, but I could not. It's so bad. Horrible running gags, poor performance. The main characters are boring dinosaurs klutz and Vhoopi Goldberg. I'd rather watch Costener's The Postman twelve times in a row than see a part of this movie again. I think they are trying to deal with some issues of discriminating dinosaurs, but a part of the film that really stands out is a dinosaur that constantly breaks things with his tail, then whispering about it. That hurts. Be careful if you are the pursuit of a masochist, otherwise, leave this alone.
