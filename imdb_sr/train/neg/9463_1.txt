Central, witty, and rightly humiliating adaptation to the classic children's story not only does not have the charm of his ancestors, but he misses any talent. Mike Miers should not just be ashamed of himself because of a terrible performance that is a clear phenomenon from what Jim Carrei did, but should give up acting. He's so boring that he wants you to run over if you can jump right into the movie. The sets are ugly and the cinema is very bad. This year I saw a lot of bad movie, but this not only takes a cake, it is, no doubt, one of the worst films ever recorded.
