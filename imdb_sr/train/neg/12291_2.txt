Humm, an Italian film starring David hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I did not expect much, to be honest and actually, I took even less than I expected. That does not mean that this movie is the worst I've seen since I looked up from this, but the plot was mostly confusing and uninteresting, and some good scenes are the only thing that saves it. In addition, you will love some special effects, they are really raw and bad. Now I just want to watch "Trol 3" of this same director, I'm sure it will not be worse than that.
