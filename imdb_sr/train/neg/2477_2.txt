If you want to know the real story of Vendigo, I suggest you take a copy of the original story of Algernon Blackwell. This film was not only bad, but had nothing to do with the book. I loved the book when I read it as a child (in "Campfire Chillers" EM Freemana) and I was so excited that the film came out on that basis. I was so disappointed when I finally saw him. The other thing is that during the film there were too many PCs (politically correct) who did not have room in the movie. When the book was written, the PC did not even exist. My suggestion is not to waste time and money !! If you see it on the shelf of the video store OSTAVITE TU.
