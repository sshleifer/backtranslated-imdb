I saw this film at Sundance in 2005 and I was amazed at how bad it was, although on the basis of the catalog description I was excited to see it. Apparently as "mockumentaries" of two high school students who make a documentary about secondary school life, there were bad acting, bad directing, a complete lack of engagement of characters as written, and everything in total is a total failure. I love good movies about high school, and this is not one of them. The characters are one-dimensional and self-conscious "cool" though they should be excused. You get a general impression about the group of people sitting around and making a deliberate-bad movie to show their friends, but somehow he came to Sundance. Mistifiing.
