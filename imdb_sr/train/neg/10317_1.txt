Until this new season I was a big fan of the 'Small Mosque'. However, the new season completely destroyed it. The new Christian Vicar destroyed the whole intent of the show. It was always common to overcome prejudice. The new vicar destroys this premise and shows the Christians in a very bad light. I am neither a Christian nor a Muslim, but I loved to watch the show and see friendship between Amar and the Reverend. Not any more. Just cancel it and finish it. It's no longer worth watching. It may still be preserved, but many changes will be required. Restore the old format.
