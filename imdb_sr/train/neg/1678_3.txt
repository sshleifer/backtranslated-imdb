I want to make "Holmes vith Doors" a dash, but I can not get it all. Appropriately coarse and redesigned VONDERLAND gives Kilmer the role that channel Morrison at the same time .... but how great this film is about a glorious 14 inches! Australian criminals flashed it all the time and skipped graphic violence ... ... as someone heard once said about the double standards of American cinema: "kiss your breasts, and that's Ks, stab him and his action PG 13". VONDERLAND was also too long in 14 minutes, and in the end, we were lucky to get away from the cinema. How many movies will we call VONDERLAND? In the last decade there must be six. Clumsy violence and a dull color set a shadowy tone, but the rumbling becomes tired, as if we are constantly watching their nostrils. Taking a few signs from the DOOR and TAXI DRIVER, all this becomes forgetful the next day.
