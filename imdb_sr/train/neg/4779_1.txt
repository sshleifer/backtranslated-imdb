In 2004, I liked it. Then it became very stupid. It suggests that children are meaningless. She insults the children. Cartoon Network was once great. One of the shows I loved was Hamtharoo. He managed to be interesting and imaginative in his approach to programming children. The Foster's Home for Imaginari Friends is like putting 20 tablespoons of sugar into your Sprite. It seems that today's television producers are only interested in earning money instead of engaging the imagination of children and earning money! Lately, my children are aligning themselves with old shows (60s) to find something interesting to watch. Perhaps, in the absence of originality, television is looking at its past and recycling children's programming from the past days.
