I have read some comments on this film and I can only assume that some people are easy to entertain. This film is nothing. It's so badly written, directed and acted to barely leave the impression. The characters speak in a dialogue that takes place in the clich√© and the situations are incredible. Although this could make this campaign and fun, it's not because everything is so lifelike that the film gets boring. As if Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman who was fighting her sexuality, but she was not allowed by the director of the studio to tell her some genuine pleasure or did not have coyons. This film could go on in the encyclopedia as a standard film about Lifetime Television.
