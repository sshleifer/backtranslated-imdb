Jean Rollin is an artistic nonsense about vampires, aliens, and the quest for immortality. Women are beautiful, and pictures are amazing. Dialogue is empty. It's a ridiculous mess. It's great to watch, but like any kind of horror movie or trilera, it's terrible. I'm trying to figure out whether we should be scared or not. At the same time, was it placed or not? His strange blend of artistic and horror films that never coincide and while looking nice, it does not seem to mean "nothing," and it is by no means dreadful even if the occasional footage or sequence creates a moment of frisson. pretentious tvaddle. Something that will be left in the background like living wall paper for those who like naked women.
