It's a waist to let such big actors in such a dull and boring movie. In addition to all the unanswered questions posed in other comments, what's so difficult to catch the robber? Just eliminate the bank employees, see who was in the bank - from all corners of the camera - before the entry of the robber and you have 4 remaining robbers among hostages. Where is the uncertainty that each body is talking about? It was so obvious when the hostages were asked to move into the same uniform that everyone would go through the front door ... they saw her many times. At least it is Mr. Spike Lee could play a movie with good music and artistic recording. The film is not worth it. Pronto!
