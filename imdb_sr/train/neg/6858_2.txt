John Huston's wise blood was a terrible misinterpretation of Flannery O'Connor's book than I could imagine. From extremely terrible acting performances (and not, "Oh, it's done intentionally, you just do not understand it!") To the music score that was more suitable for the Rockford Files episode, this film was disgusting. At first, I looked at him without any mischief and, in fact, I expected a pleasant experience. However, the misrepresentation of the southern characters, from the ridiculously deceived Southern drawing to Lilting, the comical way in which their faith was portrayed, was unforgivable. Until the very end, completely devoid of any characteristic feelings, he collapsed in every place that O'Connor's book shone and echoed. Actors who show "southern" cops can also eat cracked hot dogs from street stands in New York and quoting Kum. The only acting performance was the lively and dead representation of Ned Beattie, Hoover Shoates, a religious artist who heard Moates's sermons about Christ's Christ-free Church and sees dollar signs and business opportunities. O'Connor's powerful book is best known for its dashing, religious undercurrent that leads to the apparently lifeless dead "Vera". Mr. Huston's film is a shameful mockery of the author's intent, as I and most of her fans understand me, if I can be so brave to say so. While I admit that I can not exactly know what the author wanted to convey, I have enough love for her and her works that they want to remain fans. If I had been watching Vise Blood as Mr. Huston had obviously done, I would throw him in the trash. For the name of Flannery, and mine, I forgive you, John Huston. Forgetting ... that will take.
