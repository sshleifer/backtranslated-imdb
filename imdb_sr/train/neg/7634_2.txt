This is a film that shows the scarcity of French cinema when it comes to making a thriller. The director's desire to "sound American" is so obvious that you will not be deceived for a minute, unless you see a serial killer movie because "Peeping Tom". Two male policemen (or one and a half, more like, as you will see), terrible killings, complications more complex than the complex. Charles Berling is not lucky with the genre (see the stunning stupid "l'inconne de Strasbourg" a few years ago). Scenes with his pregnant wife - who should be a panda, or the atmosphere of noir of the rest of the plot - among the worst are Add a paired love scene between them and a bloody autopsy to get PG 12 and thus attract a huge audience of adolescents. , that's really the silence of the lame.
