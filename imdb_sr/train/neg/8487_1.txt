I have not seen anything so bad since I left James Bond movie "Moonraker" twenty years ago. I managed to sit through the whole of this only because of Tilda Swinton, but she could not do anything to save this beast. As a cross between "Pi", "Orlando", and "Tron", this film has failed in all aspects of filming. The characters were cardboard and incapable of provoking any kind of compassion. The action was completely incredible. The actor, besides Swinton, was an amateur. Computer graphics were worse than in the "Tron". Timothy Leary was extremely boring. I could go on, but what's the matter? The only good thing I can say about this movie is that Tilda Swinton was in it. I have no idea why the actress of her caliber agreed to appear in such nonsense, but she most likely regretted it now. Do not spend money or your time on this stink. There is nothing worth seeing here.
