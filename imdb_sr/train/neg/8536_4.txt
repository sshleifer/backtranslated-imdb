This is a typical Steele production in which two people who have gone through a kind of tragedy can gather in spite of the chances. I would not call it a spoiler because anyone who has read Steele's novel knows how to end. If you do not want to know much about the plot, do not continue to read. Gilbert's character, Ophelia, is a woman of French descent who lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert should stop filming films where he has to have an accent, because she, a good actress, can not really pull out any accent. Brad Johnson, also a great actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a pretty nasty divorce. He is gentle, persuasive and tempting in this role. Two meet on the beach through her daughter, Pip, and at first, Ophelia accuses Matt that he is a child molester just because he talked about art with a kid. They all become friends after this episode, and then the couple falls in love. Chemistry between the two traces is not great, although the talent of these two men, in my opinion, is not a question. They did the best they could with the predictable complication and scenario that borders with the stereotyped. Two people are confronted, a tragedy, a greater tragedy, a secret was discovered, another tragedy, and then they meet. I wish there was more to it than that, but there it is brief. I wanted a senseless party and I got it. As for the genre of romantic films, this one can not be unforgettable. "Secret Affair" with Janine Turner is far superior (not Steele's book), as some of Steele's earlier books have been turned into a movie.
