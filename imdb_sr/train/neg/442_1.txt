This game was made by Sega. It was made by the Sege I did not expect much, but I did not expect this garbage. To begin with, the camera angles work against you in this game. A motorcycle is your vehicle for moving. The motorcycle is the worst part of the game. Whenever you enter something, just stick there and do not move. You never get off the bicycle or wrecks. The main character is hard to tell, although there is a voice that suits him. Graphics is terrible. You ride through the trees on the bicycle. The camera disables the fight against the enemy. This game would not be worth renting.
