I just finished this movie ... I saw it on the video shelf and it was Nick Stahl's fan, I just had to rent it. Frankly, he probably should have stayed on the shelf. The concept was interesting and there were a few pretty smart crafts and turns, but somehow I hit almost all of them before they came. And the movie went a little too far in the end, in my opinion ... if you have to suffer from watching, you will see what I mean! On a positive note, Nick Stahl's acting was brilliant (especially considering what he was doing with it). Eddie Kaie Thomas was also good, but he always plays the same kind of character ... too Paul Finch of the "American Pie" that goes for me. And in the end, the worst part of this film has to be a performance without the emotions of January Jones ... I suppose a nice face is really what's important in Hollywood.
