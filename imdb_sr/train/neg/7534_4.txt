Mummy tells vignettes about men, women and sex between them. Huh? At the beginning of the mummy, she accidentally asks the viewer: "Imagine sex with this girl. Imagine sex with this boy" about 37 times, while flashes with pictures of half-naked fashionable young men. Later, they said that fashionable guys are drinking fashion girls with ... vegetables? If you ignore (or accelerate) through the mummy's wandering, shorts are not bad in themselves. I found a few of them pretty entertaining. My personal favorite is the one in which a sexually confused man tries to persuade a girl to have sex with him while his pet is sitting on the bed. This is one, bizarre movie.
