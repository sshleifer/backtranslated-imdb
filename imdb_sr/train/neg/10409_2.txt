As if the story was not depressing enough, this film shows cows that are graphically killed in a slaughterhouse for five minutes, while the protagonist narrates his early life as a butcher. Strange things. Then, there is the basic premise of the hero / heroine who goes away and cuts off his dick because he was told at work that he would go with him to be a girl. Is this person a psychopath, a masochist, just a goddamn queen who takes things too far? And what kind of traumatic childhood did he have? Only he had not been adopted and had to live with the sisters who first loved him, and later hated him because he was disobedient. He tries to explain to us the reasons why he did what he did, but it's really really hard to sympathize with. Such a sad and unusual self-destruction. Should it be funny? What is it actually about?
