The actors are fine. The script is sometimes inconvenient and it takes some time to understand what the purpose of the film is. I found myself rejoicing with the vessels. "Shehan" is a shit about the war. I guess we did not notice that ... we did. It's a house, you did nothing more than kill forty-five minutes. Showering ... huh? What was that? Literally, it's that I have a client, "Ok, you can use our shower." Iavn. The corners are trying hard to break through. There was a series of forests, suddenly his transient cause that you can see through him, then deep and the animals die. In the end, this is a horrible boring film of boring proportions.
