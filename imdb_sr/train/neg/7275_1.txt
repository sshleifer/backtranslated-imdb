"National Lampoon Goes to Movies" (1981) is the absolute worst film ever made, surpassing even the insane "Plan 9 from the Universe". The film Lampoon takes place in three separate and unrelated vignettes, each of which contains different performers. The only common thread is the complete lack of any redeeming features. Well, maybe there is. The other reviewer on this site said that short-lived naked recordings are fine, and that he is right. Miss Ganzel and Dusenberi blaze their property in the first and second parts. But their glamorous images are, unfortunately, futile. It seems that the directors forgot that even T & A needs a credible story that will surround it, and that it is not in sight. and an unfortunate choice as a turning point in this movie. Benson plays a young eagerly eager police officer, who clearly appears for his first day of duty, ready to free the streets of evil. He was paired with the old, cynical policeman Vidmark played, and when these partners of oil and water set off on their first patrol together, we felt the possible redemption of previous film failures. Perhaps, perhaps only, the cynical native will be reformed by his new partner, a strong sense of duty and loyalty. Maybe it will all end up happily. But this film goes straight to the toilet, without redemption, without a happy end, without any coherent story. Before the "National Lampoon Goes to Films," I thought I had already seen the worst trap Hollivood could fall back on. Unfortunately, I did not see half of it. <br /> <br />
