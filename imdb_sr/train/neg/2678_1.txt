Nothing positive to say. Screaming nonsense, huffing and puffing with "messages". New Russian (post-Soviet) films can be very good (I'm cowardly), but many have a bunch of cardboard and asbestos retro-box (a good example would be Nochnoi Dozor). This is the "Doctor" type of emptiness. The acting would be terrible, if not because of the rescue grace of an extremely irresistible direction and incompetent editing, which is sometimes so horrifying to distract from the power of actors. Special reward for the cameraman for every shot to be trembling (would anyone realize that Blair Witches had her 15 seconds of unheard of fame?) And lasts, she's focused on pre-teens who have diminished on CounterStrike and masturbation. Female leadership presents and tries to look too seductive, male antichero needs a trainer of diction (although genetics is not bad: fairly expressive eyes.) One (middle) finger for this irreplaceable bunch of non-art. Anyone who evaluates him positively is a better (distant) cousin of the "author".
