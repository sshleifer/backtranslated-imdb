Geez! This is one of those films that you think you had reviewed before, but you did not. I mean, you did not give anything about it, but somehow it came to your mind. Be Honest and Short; This is one of the worst, boring and stupid sweets ever made. I can not say anything good about this piece of crap, because there are hardly decent sequences that could be said to have been made by professional filmmakers. The plot is kinda good considering that he copied Popcorn from 1991. To make things worse, this is not a movie so bad it's good. It's just bad. Molly Ringwald tried to do the best she could, but that was not enough.
