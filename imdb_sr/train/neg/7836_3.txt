The first episode set up a bar pretty high. It was played by Villiam Hurt as a hitman who was contracted to kill a player. We received very little information about his character or about who pays him to kill, indeed, the episode is known for having no dialogue at all. Returning to his modernist penthouse, he gets a pack of toys, which gives him a smile, but he throws it away and goes to work. But he is there for the night in hell, soldiers are alive and ready to fight, ride jeeps, shoot machine guns and bazaars, and even flying helicopters! Special effects are good for a television show and it gets tense as it eludes the flat using its reason to survive, sometimes gaining advantage, and sometimes not. I will not spoil the end, but it is enough to say that it was a smart little craft. It gave me hope for the rest of the series, but I was disappointed, the other episodes were garbage and I lost the interest of the fourth. Stephen King's adaptations are always a mixed bag and this is no exception
