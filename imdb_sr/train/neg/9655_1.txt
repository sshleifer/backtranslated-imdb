In the end I watched this movie before I went through any review, at the request of a woman. Only from curiosity, I thought, let me find out if there are people who recommend others to watch this movie. I'm pretty shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this site that I have concluded that this is a scam. Regarding my opinion, I must ask, "Are these filmmakers retarded or do not assume that the viewers are retarded?" The film is terrible at so many levels, and I do not even talk about the story nor presentation. So, this crowd of people and a girl (the main actress) make up a music band; I guess it's a constant presence of the guitar. Damn, when the dancers started to become part of the Rock band ??? In any case, let me accept it as Bollivood-version-of-a-Rock Band, but amusing enough all the scores that these two guitarists actually did all kinds of "Rock Gestures" and I guess they played instruments, sound guitar is completely gone !!! I just can not understand the size of the nonsense here .... I'll only conclude here because it's absolutely not worth pointing out any further flaws in the film. It seems that Bolivian directors no longer have a shame !!!!!!!!
