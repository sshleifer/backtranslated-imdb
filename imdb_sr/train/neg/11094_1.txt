This movie is another one on my list of films that does not bother. I saw her 40 years ago as an adolescent, she was left late to do it, she was very angry when she discovered that it was about 95% of romance, 4% everything else, 1% of history if so. That's what I call a bait and transfer movie, one with an interesting title, the real movie is a scam. This is a topic that deserves a good film treatment, this film is almost an insult to those who served. The real members of the Escadrille Lafaiette were not fleeing from the law, nor were the products of abusive homes, they were in fact idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I doubt that many of them came from a higher class than Tab Hunter. Flying school is not for smart aleke and everything they know, an individual like the one shown here would not last for two days, it would be either a hinterland or infantry. Discipline in the French army was often quite fierce. In short, another Hollivierd version of a historical episode that deserves proper treatment.
