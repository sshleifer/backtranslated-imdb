In the beginning it is interesting. Naive Career (Colin Firth) marries a handsome, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) who is known for a short time. They seem to be happy and then disappear without warning. He searches for, and after several dead ends, he encounters something of his childhood abused and a weak recent past, which may involve criminal activities. And then, it seems that the filmmakers did not know what to do with the story. The beginning, though not as uncertain, sounds, at least it is visible. Then it stops being interesting or even makes sense. And the end is so poor, so boring, and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence, you will think that the scriptwriters did not know what to do with it and they were bored with trying. What a sad failure of a good idea!
