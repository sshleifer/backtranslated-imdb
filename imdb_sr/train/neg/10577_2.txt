Some of the filmmakers involved in this series have made some truly great movies, but they are sure not to show much skill in this series. Special writing. Okay, the first season was a bit better, but these new episodes only create stench. I am a big fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are totally trash. Nothing new or truly interesting. Few of them are visually creative. It's just typically fictitious Hollywood shit, uninteresting, childish, poorly designed and, in some cases, ridiculous. Similar to Tales from the Cript, the only good thing this series offers is a great nudity! Others then make this series hard to burn. Sometimes I have the impression that they have hired a bunch of eighth grade to write episodes. Maybe they are.
