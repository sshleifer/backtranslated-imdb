Shit! What a horrible, horrible Spanish thriller! I had it for about four years and finally I started last night. I watched an hour or two before I went to bed. I was quite intrigued by the whole thing. Last night I ended up and I could not believe where I stopped him last night. Literally, I stopped it before the film fell completely. As I said, I was pretty intrigued and curious about where this mystery was taking place, but it stopped when Simon received the pack at the bar. I picked it up when it opened the package to detect a laser pistol and then play the "threatening" game of the laser mark. Vhev! Then there is a great discovery that the whole thing is a terrorist plot in the playroom of the role. VHEV! It can be said that the Spanish industry was definitely behind the director Mateo Gill (co-writer of the two great previous Amenabara). There is a great result and great photo. But this scenario resonates with stupidity. As someone passed through the last 40 minutes with a real face is beyond me.
