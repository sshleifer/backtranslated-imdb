Maybe I missed a meeting when the meaning of "B-movie" was explained, but what I saw was ridiculous. Do you want a good review of this movie? Take aliens, replace ksenomorphs with vampires, and then remove everything that was good about it, and that's pretty much. 5 minutes in the movie, the "V-SAN team" (that's the stupid acronym I've never heard) checks the "base" massacreed by vampires, and then they come down (down? What?) Ladders that are apparently attached to the billboard with the obvious today's train in the background. When should this happen? 2210. Ok ... (Wait, I'll be back to it) Yes. characters. Wow, there is also an Asian Asian whore, a coward, a redhead captain, a ready-made vampire / hot topic for the casual box, and the other in the command. They are all played by their actors with the same lack of ambition. It almost hurt to see Micheal Ironside in this movie. Does not he get enough money to be Sam Fisher's Splinter Cell? The only thing that's original in the Vampire Wars is how badly it is. Seeing this birth of a movie, the only fun I got was from a poor set-up attempt. Since when does PCI card recording on the wall count as a ready-made room on board? The money needed for this movie could be much better used.
