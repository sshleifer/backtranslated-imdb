(Frankly, Barbra, I know that you are the one who clicks all those "NO" on my magazine, 22 times? How many people did you have to direct to help you here? Have not you got any better work, Watch yourself in the mirror all day? Spielberg told Barbie that this is "the best movie I've ever seen from Citizen Kane." That largely speaks everything - and serves as a terrible warning! What are the ingredients for the film disaster of a safe fire, and the one who will persecute you, not allowing you to forget tears of both laughter and pain? Ingredients: Barbra Streisand's face, musical, feminism, gla Barbra Streisand, directed by Barbra Streisand and an ultra-cool / idiotic hypothesis, Hollivood is full of egomaniacs, we know so much. In fact, almost everyone, by definition, has to be an egomaniac in Hollywood, why would someone want to act?

It looks like HORRIBLE. Songs. They made me shudder. Especially "Daddy Can you hear me crying like a demented female scorpion in the heat?" and "Tomorrow night I will prepare a sequel, IENTL 2: RETURN OF KITCHEN". Did you know that Streisand was thinking about having a nose job at the beginning of her career, but changed her mind, but changed her mind when she told her that her voice could change? Can you believe it? She should have done it! By killing two flies with one shot, that would be.
