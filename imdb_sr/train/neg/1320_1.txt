This film was exactly what I expected to be when I first read the casting. I guess I could write a more exciting plot, it's a shame that they left him a hell of hell. Alberto Tomba must have been a good skier, but he must thank God (and us) that he does not have to rely on his acting skills to earn a living. She can not play, can not talk, she can not even move to land without skiing ... Michelle Hunziker is a beautiful blonde girl, that's all. She was obviously not chosen because of her stunning competence in dramatic roles, but most probably for her beautiful legs. However, I must admit that she could be Tomb's teacher, because she is even worse than an actor, and it's ridiculous, especially since she is not an Italian. I was constantly laughing at watching this movie. I found him so ridiculous and meaningless that he actually made me laugh, loud, very loud.
