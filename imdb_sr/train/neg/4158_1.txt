This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen !!!! I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie worse than this !!! And I will never !!!! I am a big fan of "B" horror films. As you can imagine ... I was exposed to the worst things the film industry has to offer. I was lured to this film by his title. I mean, come on ... who the true horror fan would not be intrigued by a title like "Vampires vs. Zombies" ??? The images of the "innocent" fighting each other against "real estate" danced in my head. I thought ... "I have to see this" !!!! Well .... I'm sorry to say ... "I want this I did not see" This movie title is very wrong. There were no vampires fighting zombies. In fact, there is no complication !!!! If you ask me about what this film is about, I can honestly say that I have no idea! <br /> <br /> No complication !!!! There was no story !!!! This movie absolutely does not make any sense !!!! At the end of this debacle ... I found myself regretting the poor souls who invested money in this project because they certainly do not have a business sense !!!
