Because "cruel" would be the only thing that could describe the intentions of these filmmakers. Where do you start at all? In the b * tchiness bubble, I will start with a horrible act of almost everyone in this movie. Get it. She almost does not belong to this sentence. I can not imagine a single person who is well represented. Although, in all likelihood, it would be almost impossible to portray these nul-dimensional characters in a successful way. However, the girl who played Katherine (whose name I do not intentionally include - I pretend she does not exist) remains one of the worst actors I've ever seen, just being outcasted by the guy who played Sebastian. The story was terrible. He tried to reflect the shine that was the first, but it failed in many ways. Almost every part was meaningless - although I will admit (reluctantly) that the plot was pretty good his surprise. And the end was at least a bit witty. But this movie is upstairs with the worst I've ever seen. Do not look at it. Just do not. There is absolutely no value in watching. No one. He just takes away the enjoyment of the first one.
