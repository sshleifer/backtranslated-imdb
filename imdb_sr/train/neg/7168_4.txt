The writer came with a fairly decent idea for the story, but many of the disadvantages in the performance of the action have so far gone from the film that they almost made it invisible. Basic elements, such as character development, were at best erased. Disagreements also raised their ugly heads. A massive villa in the middle of a rural Irish village? The characters just "appear" in the gardens during the stormy night (in very favorable times, I would add)? All in all, it was not "bad". I rated him as 4, mostly based on the story and talent of Alison Elliot.
