This film could have been very good, but it's very short. Quite special effects and so acting. I could look at the past if the story is not so bad. If there were more background stories, it would be better. The action revolves around the evil druid witch that is associated with this woman who gets migraines. The film pulls and continues, and nothing clearly explains anything. Christopher Valken plays a role, but it's totally pointless, like most films. This film had the potential, but it seems to be really bad for a TV movie. I avoided this film.
