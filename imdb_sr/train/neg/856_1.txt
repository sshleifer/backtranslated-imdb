These files write about the end of the action, so do not read if you did not see this trash. I found this rubbish film in a terrible section, which makes me think it would be a horror. . If I had a video store, I would put it in the BORING section. This movie is so stupid that it will feel like you've lost your socks. This film contains endless footage of people who drive as if it were scary. Well, I go to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit cats) almost every day and believe me it's not terrible. It even starts with 20 minutes of driving some people. And a little kid does it. It circles and circles and never stops. What's so terrible when looking at a little kid driving a bike for an hour? I think that if you look at NEST, you will not think that way. The family in the car arrives at the big castle and they are on tour only walking staggeringly looking into the kitchen. Then a man walks about an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. That's all that's happening and as you see, it's trash.
