A formulation of a guy who wants a girl, a guy who will lie to stand next to a girl, a man who will get the best friend to help in an unhealthy way (comedy relief, no?) To help deceive a girl, etc. This was done to death, and with few exceptions from several z-score outputs, this was done better. Other plots to the side, the guides are attractive and have a few good moments. Jonathon Schaech did better, and his action came close to calling. Not a complete loss, but nothing new here in this lukewarm affair.
