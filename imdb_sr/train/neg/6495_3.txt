I rented this movie based on what the trailer showed, and, of course, Sir Anthony Hopkins. If Jackson Pollack teamed up with David Linch and Timothy Leary to film the movie, that would be the end result. I do not think I've seen such a movie that the LSD trip looked like an episode in Sesame Street. It's a bunch of sets where characters flick and come out of reality, or different reality, and the movie does not culminate in anything for the last 5 minutes, which makes sense at once. I wrote a sharp overview on my movie review blog that essentially gives it all, and I will not be doing it here. It's a well-played cinema, and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me say this, if there's one feature for this movie, it's music. It fits perfectly. Some of the dialogues are incredibly good, and at the same time incredibly bad. I enjoyed the parts of this movie, indeed, and once you finish it, you'll actually figure out what's really going on. It's sad that you have to pass through 2 hours crazy to get to the highlighted point, which minimizes the effect of the whole movie. I give her 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this movie is not acting, that's all.
