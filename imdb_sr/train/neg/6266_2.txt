It seems that somebody can film a movie today. As if everything you need is a camera, a group of people who will be your actor and crew, a script, and a bit of money and Valla you have a movie. The problem is that talent is not always a part of this equation, and often low-budget films turn out to be dudes. On the shelves of video stores there are so-called movies. These are not even pleasures, they are just a loss of celluloid which is better to forget. Troma Entertainment is known for making a recycling movie, but most of their films are film gold. However, some of the films they published did not have anything to do with creation, and some, such as "Nightmare Veekend", did not deserve any form of release at all. Professionals: members of actors do the best they can with poor material. Some unintentional joy. It moves at a good pace (It would take about 81 minutes). Cons: Horrible writing, which includes an angry dialogue and innumerable holes in the soil. Poorly lit, especially night scenes and the end, which you can not see at all. Does not make sense. Badli Score. Cheap and very outdated effects. A complete lack of character development and nobody is interested. This should be a horror movie, but it's missing in that area and it's not scary at all. Nothing interesting and exciting is happening. It is filled with unnecessary fall. Final Thoughts: I never expected it to be a forgotten gem, but I never imagined it would be so bad. I do not know if this is the worst movie ever made, but it's a definite candidate. Trom was supposed to allow this film to rot, instead of letting it go. Do not make the same mistake as me and let your curiosity be the best of you. My Rating: 1/5
