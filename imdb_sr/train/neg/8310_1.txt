Another huge film about a conspiracy trying to blame the US government and the armed forces (especially the army) for each catastrophe from the Great Flood. Anyone who has ever been in the US Army can see how far this film is fake. Uniforms, equipment, sets and manners are wrong. (And, of course, all senior officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots.) Blab propaganda without attempts at objectivity. Most of the theories presented have been contradicted in the past few years. Uses every clich√©, rumor, and Urban Legend from the Gulf - they are all presented as the gospel. (It's true that nobody knows for sure why some GV veterans are sick and others are healthy as horses.) PS This is not new. War is not funny and I know VVII, Korean and Vietnamese veterans with some pretty serious diseases. (And the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them.) Sensational films like this will not solve the problem!
