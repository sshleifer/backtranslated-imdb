Marilyn Miller made only three films before her premature death - the beautiful SALLI (1929), comedy THE LOVE OF LOVE (1931) and this little thing - SUNNY (1930). It's completely bad as an early speech and as an attempt of a musical - although it has four dance numbers, only two songs are sung (VHO and ONE MAN ONLY). The rest of the results, including the witty title melody, was discarded, although we can hear it in the background. Miller looks exaggerated and amateurish - there's no star quality at all. Even her dance. The film is very badly written, stocks full of staggering and unpredictable jokes and stupid situations. If you are interested in Miler as a performer, be sure to check it out, but for general entertainment, please go away.
