Dakota (1988) was another early Lou Diamond Phillips vehicle. This film is similar to the later published Harlee. There are several differences, but they are the same. I do not know who came first. I suppose he will remain one of the mysteries of life. But both are troublesome "children" who are trying to reverse their lives. Instead of a bike, this includes horses. They are basically the same film and both are cheese like hell. If you are serious L.D.P. The fan then I recommend you watch them both. You have received extreme looting and posturing by L.D.P. If you're in the game then go to it. We do not recommend, except for L.D.P. fans !!!
