I really can not say anything bad or good about this stuff. His characters are pretty cute, they can be produced and designed both professional (except for this monster suit). However, he has no originality, no ideas, and nothing you have seen in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and / or OUTLAND. It's just another formula, a cake cutter, "dirty corporate drones in deep space versus an unstoppable monster." It's quite a waste of time.
