Oh dear, oh dear ... For JM fans, this was a nail in the box as far as her Hollywood career from the A-list is concerned. After firm turning into a girl can not help, Vaivard Bus, Prowler and Rock Hunter seemed to be Jaine on a good way to become one of the hottest stars of Tinsel Tovn. However, the obsession with popular publicity and the appearance of this tantrum Mansfield pushed aside, namely, cheap loans for the euro, while Fok could not give up the contract as soon as possible. This film is truly a devil's waste of time for all people, except for Suzy Parker which is the only thing in this movie is bad enough for the material. Many people blame poor Jane and her grate for the bad return of this movie in cash, and while she is in this movie, she can only do the best she can with the material. After all, Cary hardly puts the screen on fire, is it? After a handful of very good dramatic and comedic reversals, Jaine took 10 steps backwards in her quest for a serious actress landing (simply because of Grant's appearance) to portray this scandalous, idiotic threat. Her character Alice is a complete cartoon bimbo and although she looks good enough to eat in the battle suit, her every look in the movie will increase your nerves. We all know that Jaine could do much better than this slug, but she's still here as a pudding. It's a real shame. Stay away from the so-called comedy. It's more depressing than fun.
