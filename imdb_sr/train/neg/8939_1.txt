Yes, I saw rough cuts. Unpublished sex scenes. Difficult scenes. Almost on the same level with the movie 'The Need' for horrible acting. This movie is as bad as bad films that are bad, bad acting, bad effects, bad locations, bad bad things. The best actors in the movie were dancers in the lap that they hired for vampire accessories! Its incredible ability to drive a car poorly, when it is obviously shaking people on the hood (check the reflection on the windshield), its inability to turn left, which is a class. OH does not forget the scene of sex. plus its significant use of toy guns that the guys in the props could not even imagine as a real gun. Other actors on the screen could barely deliver their lines. It was like half a time waiting for a line that was not there! the guys who did it took their real names from the loan! If you want to laugh at a party, then rent this movie ... then again there are many good comedies that are just as funny and you do not give money to people who do not deserve it.
