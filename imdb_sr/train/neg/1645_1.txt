Last night I watched this movie, and I had to warn everyone else who was thinking to watch this movie. In one word - do not. I seriously feel like it's something that a student script writer would write at the stage of Kuentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphi, i.e. Every other word was a curse. I have no problem with abusive cursing, as in "Good Vill Hunting", provided it helps us to get into characters. In this case, it was just a hollow joke with attempts to get the audience from time to time with laughter. The three main characters are all their unique stereotypes, the wallet on the wall, the banging of the cafes and the "I-not-Gai-Just-In-Touch-Vith-Mi-Feminine-Side" little-less-jerk. Only you do not mind! They are all shallow, incomparable losers that you want to lose. For those who dare, this movie has a few funny moments, from the very beginning and the very end. The VC / vibrator scene is ridiculous in the sick type "Uh, yes". But really, I would recommend this film to only the worst enemy.
