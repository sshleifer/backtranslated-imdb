Check for the spoiler warning. Just in case. Perhaps one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen, Mazes and Monsters felt like I lost 101 minutes of my life. The only quality of the movies they bought was scenes that were trying to be serious, but they eventually became funny because they were so bad. Evil Dead ani? Unfortunately for M & M (fortunately for us), the cult sequence has not developed and results in a trilogy. This film has tried to solve a series of problems that the main character Robbie (played by Hanks) met during the entire film. In the end, it was seen on stereotypes that helped D & D launch in the 1980s. If you want to avoid wasting time and money, go away this garbage. PS - Although the front page looks interesting, which is why my brother bought it, it does not in any way take place in the domain of fantasy, unless you think that New England or New York City is such a place.
