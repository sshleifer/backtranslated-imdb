What ever did Martin Scorcese have to do with this movie? And not only did he process it, but completely destroyed it? A senseless decision that the character who plays Robert De Niro (in his exaggerated performance, and that much talk) into a religious fanatic is ridiculous, and a pattern from Hollywood (and especially Mr. Scorcese) attitude - forcing writers to think that the best way to make a crazy personality is to tattoo a crucifix on your back. Anyway, this movie is horrible. <br /> <br />
