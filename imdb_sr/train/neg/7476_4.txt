Zli Aliens owes a huge debt to Peter's Jacksons early films Bad Taste and Braindead. I must admit they never enjoy these films in particular and I say the same about this. I lost the number of times the big Hollywood movie was quoted, the most famous being James Camerons Aliens. and dragged out. Maybe it would work better like a short film. The actors are poor, the direction is weak and the plot is nonexistent. but others did the same thing much better than they are presented here. 4/10
