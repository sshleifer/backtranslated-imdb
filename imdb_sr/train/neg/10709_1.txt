I can not say much about this film. This was a horrible movie ... I can not even tell you what made me look at it. There was so little that I did not know where to start. The action ran from incredible to absurd. My entire body was tense for the duration of the film, because I could not wait for the terrible thing to end and finish. By the end of the film, I felt that it was easier for me. The editing was bad, the acting was sub-pair, and the story was poor. Francoise Robinson acted as an Indian, though he is not nearly like someone from the American legacy. If the movie is idiotic, it should be ridiculously stupid - at the very least. It was not. It was just pathetic.
