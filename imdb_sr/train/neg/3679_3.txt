This is a Japanese movie, but there's a lot of English here. It's a pretty nice movie, with nice visuals showing the beauty of Hawaii. However, for me it was the only redeeming quality. The story was mostly boring. Who wants to see a young woman fearing 90 percent of the film because her "painting" husband is much older than she advertised? Of course, it could be a hassle ...... but go for it! Only in the last 10 minutes she works on the face and likes it. Until then, for most viewers, it was too little - too late. By that time, we had fallen asleep.
