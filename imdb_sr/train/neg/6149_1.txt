I will spend a few days dedicated to Ron Hovard before I devote myself fully to his work. Having, unfortunately, Lucas at such a young age, Howard is now caught up in so many Lucas attributes. How else can you explain his disaster by catastrophes? His only useful movie, of course, was 'Villov'. Everything else, including this, is too heavily dependent on surface rubbish. Some spoilers. No, Poor Howard is so stuck on his Spielberg guys that he'll quickly forget him. Here we have an old saying: "love conquers everything, even disease." It's a shame for Howard that Linch has already gone through the whole sub-text with more skill. Even Disnei was better than this. Ron is even indulging in opportunities offered by imaginary realities. The commentary of Howard is horrible. Do not even rent DVD. Final Analisis = = Cinematic Dud
