I can not say much about this film. I think it speaks for itself (as well as current ratings here). I hired it two years ago and completely regretted it. I even tried / liked watching him twice, but I just could not. I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to ever, ever, ever see this waste of time. And I'm not going to throw a movie, but I really believe it was terrible. It was not at all funny. The only pieces I enjoyed were some scenes with Christopher Valken in them. I think this film has destroyed both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. The only thing I can remember when I see one of their films is now a horrible movie, and reminds me not to waste my money. And Ami Poehler is very boring. All in all, I think you have understood my point. By the way, the stars are for Walken.
