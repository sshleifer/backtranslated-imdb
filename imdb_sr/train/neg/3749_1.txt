Wow, I love and respect almost everything that David Linch did. However, this film is similar to the attempt by the first film author to make a pseudo art video. 1. Give me a few examples: 1. David Linch is a typical visual film maker, however, it had a bit of visual artistic content (empty walls, "upscale" with ceiling in the background). David Linch is usually proud of a large amount of sound, however, you can also hear the sound of the video camera. In fact, it's very difficult to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie. except ... It's a joke, on David's side, to get fans to search his web site (s) just to find this nonsense. I hope, because at least that idea is ridiculous.
