I was skeptical when I first saw Calvin Kline-eskue commercials, but I thought I would give him a chance. So I watched him, and all I can say is bleach. This movie was so bad. It's rare that I hate so much a movie. Watching this film reminded those funny scenes in Altman's "Player" when the writers threw bizarre ideas into the producers. I would like to know which producer of MTV decided to make an hour and a long adaptation of the music video of Bronte (but this time Heathcliff is called Heath, he is a rock star, and Hindley's name is Hendrik). Even it may not have been so bad, that they did not acquire every other aspect of the film so horribly wrong. The direction must have been "lonely, I'm down for me." I laughed loudly during all the "serious" scenes and I was bored in the rest. Working with the camera was jagged and repeatedly reminded me that I was watching a bad movie trying to be sharp. My theory is that the sounding guy was bored and went down to the beach for a few beers with his boom - all I could hear in the half of the scene were waves. And in other scenes, I want it to be all I could hear. And when it comes to sound, what made the songs "Sisters Mercy" "The Sea" is absolutely unforgivable, then again, it's unthinkable what they did to Bronte. - specifically at the moment when Johnny Vhitvorth dressed the face of Katherine Heigl - and if you can tell me what the scene had to have with all the rest of the story for you.
