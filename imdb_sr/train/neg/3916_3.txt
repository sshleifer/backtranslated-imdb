We all know that the film never leads to justice in the book, but this is exceptional. Significant characters were cut out, Blanca and Alba were essentially killed in the same character, most subplot and main elements of the main plot were eliminated. Clara's clairvoyance was remarkably reduced, which made her look like a much tiny character than the one I met in the book. In the book we learn more about her powers and the important effects she has on so many people, which in turn was a key element in the family life. The film was just a special lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero third, otherwise, the son, and so comes after the Segunda second) and his relationship with that between Esteban and his grandson Panche Garcia (not the son whom he also did recognize) is cut in half and its importance is diminished. One of the most fundamental things in the book is that the movie is taken away: it's called "House of Spirits". Where's the house? The story of the 3-4 generation family should turn around "the big house on the corner," so many times from the novel. The house is fundamental to the story, but the film is unfairly undoing it just on the background. Before I read the book before, I could never assume that such a juicy, shallow film could be based on such a rich and entertaining novel.
