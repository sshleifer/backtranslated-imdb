I think this film is not properly evaluated. I took my copy and turned off the PG grade and wrote R. I would not recommend this to anybody under 17 or 18 years of age, regardless of the limit of R. Why? It contains a scene in the jungle with several Indian women in Toples. I do not know about you, but it's not something that kids watch. True, it can be a traditional "dressing style" of African (?) Indians, but ... I think a partial nudity should give the film a rating of R. I did not see the movie recently, but I think it was different, it was okay.
