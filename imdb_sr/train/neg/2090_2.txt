I realize that it should not be BSG and I can deal with slow shows if they are interesting, but I'm completely uninteresting and boring with this series. + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mysteries + Drama The formula for Caprico seems to be: Bland Drama + Moderate Scifi </ b> <BR> Maybe it will be more interesting but from episode 3 I can hardly watch it. In fact, it's at the bottom of my watchlist in a week. This is a sad state of affairs. The Sifi channel really destroyed their squad on Friday night. What happened to the famous days SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG on Friday night? They had a good thing there.
