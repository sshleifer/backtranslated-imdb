The only thing that prevented this move from being a total disaster was a couple of interesting styling touches. (moderate warning about interference) Death from a comedian is a little derived from the scene in the twilight zone: a film that brings death to the cartoon. Still, this is well treated, especially when the ink is bleeding and the color is exhausted. In addition, there is another good scene with a demonic motor. By saying this, I was glad that I bought a DVD inexpensively in a store that came out of business sales, because it was pretty scary. I bought "Soul Survivors" at the same time and both films are in a similar way boring to the constant perception that you've watched a dream. However, where "Soul Survivors" has nothing to use, or makes any sense, it has at least had some stylish notes, which are mentioned above. Interestingly, DVD allows you to go to the 8 'nightmare' in which something really is happening, which is the only way to look at it. Scripting between creative moments is pretty unbearable. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
