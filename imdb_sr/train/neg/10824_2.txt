This version is pretty rude, I'm scared. Jane Eire is one of my favorite books ever since childhood, but Villiam Hurt's tired, rejected style of acting is totally unsuitable for the brave passion of Edward Rochester and the poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a boring, sulky teen whose dentures hurt! I also can not believe they have eliminated Edward's great scene with a marriage proposal from the end of the book, one of the most fascinating moments in literature. I appreciate that they finally used such a young, ordinary woman to play Jane, a figure that should be world-class 18, but if you want to see a version closer to the personality and passion of the novel, see the 70s version with George Scott and Susannah York . York was too old, tall and handsome to play Jane, but no one touched Rochester's character in the way Scott did.
