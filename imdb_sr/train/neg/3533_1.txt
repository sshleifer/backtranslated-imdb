Let this film serve as a deadly ringing film of the 1990s "big crafts". Known in some circles like the Kiser Soze Syndrome, this film maneuver of the hand is now done to death by M. Night Shaiamalana, and even Ron Howard used the A BEAUTIFUL MIND variation. However, in REVOLVER, director Gui Ritchie (known in some circles as Mr Madonna) uses the motif of the Soze in a much more obedient way. Jason Statham (with a very suspicious hair head) plays Jack Green (everyone known as Mr Green). He may or may not be the criminal master of Mr. Gold. Or maybe Mr. Gold is an irritating spirit that can have members of the underworld. I'm not quite sure, but I certainly do not care. REVOLVER is one of the deepest examples of a cinematographic surplus that I have had the unhappiness to endure for a long time. Testify the fractured weather structure, painful jumps, continuous internal monologues and painfully pretentious animated sequences. This executive style "everything and a kitchen sink" makes Quentin Tarantin's work soothing. Cinematographic smoke and mirrors led me to believe that Ritchie was bored to tell this fairy-tale story as I watched her. Green Nevs. I wanted to love Green because I always enjoy Stratham as a character that is two steps ahead of everyone else. Here, however, he fights together as a reader in the class of University English Literature. His lack of wittyness coincides with the lack of restraint shown by his enemy, Macha (Rai Liotta). Guests on the scene as a starving man on a buffet, Liotta spits, cries and evaporates through the film in an unpleasant display of over-dressing and shooting a leopard of the press. REVOLVER does not have any advantages. This is another movie faucet dog from Ritchie and may even surpass his miserable remake SVEPT AVAI as his worst film.
