We rented five movies for the New Year's Weekend and we looked at this first. All I can say is that there was no place to leave after watching this. It was ridiculous and vulgar. The script of Harvey Keitel must be easy to write - just make two out of every three words of the curse. Andie McDowell is surprisingly good in character, but the film has nothing to recommend.
