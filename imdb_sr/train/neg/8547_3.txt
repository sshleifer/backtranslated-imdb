This was a pretty nasty film; I found that music is effective for this. Photos taken by Mario from the village were also disturbing. However, I had three problems with this film. One thing was that the light was very dark, so it was difficult to say what was going on, but this may have been just my copy. The other is that the very beginning does not explain well and that I'm not yet sure what's going on there. The third problem is that I did not understand the end, but some people seem to be doing it. Of course, there are also common problems of people who are doing stupidity, and men's advantage is 70s. All in all, visible, but not even close to being a favorite.
