I really hate this show! I watched an episode and I knew this show was really terrible. The stories are badly written and executed, and the jokes are really bad ... I mean, it's just a shitty rip-off from Dekter's lab and Johnny Cash, about a disgusting boy with a flame of blue hair with his twin. the genius of the sister and the dog who speaks; Daddy at home and smart, very busy mom ... Like oh-mi-flippin'-God! Their dad is crazy mother's host, is not he so gay! If my dad is a host, I would personally die! Too bad what it is ... I really would. I have nothing else about this ... this travesty, but only three words; Count them 3 words to describe them: Lame, Dumb, and above all ... F ** K UP! That's all I can say to people, it's definitely my list of the worst animated series EV-ER! If I had it.
