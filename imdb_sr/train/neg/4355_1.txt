Terrible. I see many user comments about how great this show is. It's really Vanna-Be-Friends - made in Taiwan. Jokes are as bad as ... and the plot is ridiculous. Actors are obviously struggling to be ridiculous and are likely to be struggling when they hit those terrible impact lines (if you can call them that way). Most of the other users who commented obviously from the other planet (or at least the other continent). Obviously, there are reasons why TV companies cancel broadcasts ... and none of it happens when emissions are progressing well. Makes sense? In any case, stay away - even if it's raining and there's absolutely nothing on this planet to do ... go stand in the rain instead - more fun.
