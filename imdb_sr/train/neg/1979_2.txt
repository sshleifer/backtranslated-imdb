Hmm, Hip Hop music to the west. Modern phrases like "cool" and too many others to track. "The sixties are in the house"! French manicured nails on strong girls. Microphone packs are clearly visible on the back of Li'l Kim. I just can not continue with the litigation errors made by the director and editor. The acting is not as bad as I've ever seen. Women treated poorly enough well enough. It was a strange hearing as Louis Mandilor spoke in his native focus. Costumes incredible, though totally defective. I just can not believe that they would overthrow what might have been a great story. I would feel insulted to believe that this film was full of such traps that it would be good to play in the inner city. <br /> <br />
