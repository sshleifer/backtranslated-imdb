"Three Brave Daughters" is a sickly cute, pink view of divorce, reunion and life with one parent. Obviously, social issues and economic difficulties do not have a place in the picture of the perfect life of the mother of a single mother who feels exhausted, goes on a cruise, then goes out and marries a band conductor. Even when the "only movie" phrase justifies the script to deal with real-life problems, "Daughter" suffers from too dashing high notes, children whose personalities are not based on true children and the leader of the band Hose Iturbi. Is it not surprising that a real person would act in a movie in which their supposed real wife is marrying? However, this film was published in the nineteen years. Only love for the old style of Hollywood romance and comedy could make 'Daughters' a tolerable film.
