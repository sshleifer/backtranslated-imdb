I often do not teach "those", but if there was ever a movie that deserved this kind of attention, then it is "Gas!" This is a self-indulgent crap that reaches a milieu M * A * S * H ​​and completely falls on the face in an attempt. I see what Corman was going to do - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce Gould's immortal role in the original M * A * S * H ​​original film version with a similar plot (in the movie "Vhiffs" - see it here in IMDb, http: //vvv.imdb.com / title / tt0073891 / for more information). Marmorstein and Gould have come closer to the brass ring with "Vhiffs" than Corman did with "Gas!" but he did not really get there. None of these films even came close to the success of M * A * S * H. What about "Gas"? What is not? Nobody approaches actual behavior at the level above junior theatricality. Production values ​​stink. Someone else here mentions the magically regenerating lights on the escape car, and there is also a lack of attention to detail. Nothing works in the way it should be in this movie, and nobody cares. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" I was actually sleeping. It's not a safe cure for insomnia, but it's really close. On the Cinematic Sleep Induction, "Gas!" falls somewhere between "Last Iear at Marienbad" and the remake of "Solaris" by George Clooney (which was remarkable because he was more boring than Mosfilm's original, despite the fact that the studio seemed strange to the idea of ​​keeping the public's attention with reasonable editing). br /> Reasonable editing would be decimated "Gas!" up to twenty minutes. The result would have been meaningless, but not more than the original movie. Certain movies are so bad that they have exceptional quality that makes them worth watching. This is not one of them. Do not waste your time. It's not even fun bad.
