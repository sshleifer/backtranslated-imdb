How this piece of garbage was shot outside of me. The only actor I know at all is Judge Reinhold, an accomplished actor whose presence is just an excuse for his putting into production. award for a spoiled tomato, this film really makes B movies a movie enjoyment. A highway car with police in hand, and no one knows how to stop the car, yes, exactly. Most made for TV films are terrible, but this redefines the word. Check the action skills of the bridge operator, clean the Oscars.
