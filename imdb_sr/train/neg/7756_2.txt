I remember seeing ATTACK when it first came out and caught it again. The Sci-fi channel worked even worse, but not much. A helpless jar of the Jurassic Park, ATTACK replaces sabertooth cats for dinosaurs. And they are at liberty, devouring as many supplements as possible. The CGI is pretty bad, and the big cats' prosthetics plans are ridiculous. We got some blood, which helps a little. Wait until you see how a crazy scientist who started this mess gets. Apart from Robert Carradine, who has very little work, the actors are unknown. It looks like this was filmed in Fiji. Good job if you can get it. It reminds me of all those low-budget STVs that were popular in the 80s and 90s.
