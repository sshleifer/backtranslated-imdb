First ..... What the hell? Why are they trying to sell shit at a low budget on TV in late night hours with the promise of a disturbing, offensive, ill-trash that every normal human being with a soul can not watch. What kind of shit is funny about a dog that's hurt, a grandmother that broke her head ... a guy who handcuffed his pieces with his hand, and two girls go to the bathroom? What the hell happened, this world came to people to consider comedy in something so sick. Anyone who thinks that such material is ridiculous should not even allow him to walk the country. But from what I've heard, it's not even offensive ... well ... they promise a comedy through the stupid bunch of sick bites ... and I can not even get it.
