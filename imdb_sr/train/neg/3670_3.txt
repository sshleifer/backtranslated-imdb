In order for a film that frightened science to work well, it must be either really genuine or very good. Not even this movie. Of course, there is a pseudo-original reversal in the fact that the guy kills people for toxins, not the disease, but that's a very small turn. There is an angle of government conspiracy, a cruiser protagonist who has a personal experience ... And one of the real disadvantages of this film is that the contaminated man has no pathos. Although the character is scripted to be someone who needs to be pitied, he is not. Without pity, the film is meaningless. The other characters are so cute that they are funny. Subplots are intricate and boring. And the saddest thing is that the movie is too flat to even enjoy it as a fake material. Take a movie in 45 minutes and you might be worth watching.
