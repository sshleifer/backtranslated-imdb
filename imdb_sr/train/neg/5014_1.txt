The film has the longest, sadest and painful ending of any movie I've seen for a long time. Unfortunately, it starts immediately after the opening of the loan. Janu Jones gives such a wooden show, I was surprised that she did not light up when she reached the candle in the movie. I do not recall the other films she did (the blessing I have to believe in. I never criticize the idea of ​​actors, because there are too many things in the film that can affect her, but in this case, it's so bad that she is, she is got lines and situations that Meril Streep would have had problems, but I swear that reading with a cue card off sets. For REAL! Action, dialogue and pacing are as bad as you'll ever see, but there's still no excuse for this show, nor for a director who allows it, a small Indian / breakfast club pushed it into a rotten one burito, and then the vice-principal of the school was vomiting.
