I'm unbelievable that the party is passing through today. maybe I'm a dinosaur from the fifties, and I have nothing to do with today's generation of the film, and this is obviously the case with this film, as many people loved it. I found that it was nasty and vulgar. I did not say that about many of my movies in my life, but this fits into the law. Humor is somber and rude. I am not a politically correct person, and I even found gay jokes, not only funny, but offensive (not gay). The main character in the film is neither a cute person, but only a pathetic one. When the movie is finally over, I heard that many people comment on how disappointed they are in what they just paid to see.
