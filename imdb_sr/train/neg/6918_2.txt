I went to this film, believing it had good grades. First, it's funny to publish a movie that was originally shot in 2001, seven years later, in 2008 in India. Everything in the movie seems outdated. Even for 2001, the film seems to have been made on a footwear budget. There is a scene in which a taxi hits a man to elaborate how low a budget you can get. It seems Anthony Hopkins does not know what he is doing in the film. In the end, he gives a debt monologue in the end. If the film had sparkling sparks during this scene, I missed him while I was sleeping at his seat. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hevitt does not resemble the Devil. He wears rude banal clothes and frowns at children. As far as Alec Baldwin is concerned, one should not miss the scene in which he first encounters Webster. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins rightly said, "Get back home and write better!"
