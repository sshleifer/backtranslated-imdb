I suppose there are some who remember Nicole Eggert from her girls on TV shows like T.J. Hooker, Charles and Charge, who's the boss? You perversions, you! Maybe you remember from Baivatch when she grew up and got breast implants. Regardless, you will surely forget about this alleged comedy about aliens eating a man. There are so many things that do not make sense and have never been explained. How did she recognize the alien? Why is the alien hot for pepper and cinnamon? Why did not an alien eat? You got a picture. Before an alien eats his boyfriend and takes over his identity, you will see her in the body of Alec Meneses. This Mexican / Ukrainian beauty is the only reason for watching this garbage. Stay on the shower scene and the guy, and continue with your job.
