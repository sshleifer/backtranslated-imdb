There is absolutely nothing for this movie. They took a funny story, misinterpreted it, misinterpreted it. A bad dialogue is badly done in a rotten and messy story. As bad as art, it does not work even worse as trade. Who could be the target market for it. Which age group? Which interest group? Someone should film a film about how and why this film was made. I would pay to see that. I've seen thousands of bad films, and this is with the "Sailor Dropped by Grace" and "Manos" ... my choices as the three most incredible bad movies I've ever seen. Everyone who is connected to it should be forced to talk to VanDamme forever. I challenge you. Watch this movie and perform an academic exercise - how could you take it and exacerbate it? I can not think of one way.
