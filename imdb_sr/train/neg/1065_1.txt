Based on a friend's recommendation, my wife and I invited another couple to this film. I really apologized to them - all four of us hated it and watched our watches all the time waiting for the film to end. Half vignettes are bizarre, with very little entertainment value. There were several scenes of Paris - for example, I was glad to see some of the pictures of the Latin Quarter, but I could not recognize it. Most of the scenes were at the bar. Nobody in the theater laughed or reacted in any way. If you like bizarre, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual movies, do not miss this. If you're on earth like me, you'll be sorry you saw it.
