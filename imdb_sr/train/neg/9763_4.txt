Bestselling writer George Plimpton (Alan Alda) takes over the task for Sports Illustrated. He will go incognito in the Detroit Lions training camp and try out the third Quarterback series. The members of the team with Alek Karras and Mike Lucci quickly find out. The whole team finds it entertaining to trigger a stumbling block in Quarterback's writer's determination for the series in the right game. This film is Alde's debut and also helped Karras leave the acting castle. In addition to Detroit Lions in 1968, the cast includes Sugar Rai Robinson, Roi Schieder and Lauren Hutton. Alec March is leading this story based on Plimpton's book.
