Perhaps it was a good movie to explore something more interesting, not just the surface of a lesbian relationship, if it is the meaning of a movie ... it is quite predictable without mentioning that the two girls are similar to the Russian tATu group. ..therefore? I do not think like that. There is nothing original in this film to support it, so they had to use something that is already known. Other actors ... well, I just do not know what their role should be. Most of them are famous people in Romania and I have to mention some of them are not even actors (eg Mihaela Radulescu). plot + opportunity to use bad language to shock = love sick .... too bad ... the idea was good, though ... and I seriously stick to commenting on the title ...
