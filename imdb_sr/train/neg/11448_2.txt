This film is not as bad as 'Perfect Stranger', but it was just not funny. She could not keep up with a kind of comedy - she jumped from SNL, Adam Sandler-esquire, to romantic, to big boys, to slapstick, to 'Loser' (comedy) comedy. Although there were some pretty fun moments of slapstick (falling down the hill), nobody was particularly funny or remarkable in any way. 'Schindler's list' was smsier (and she felt shorter). you never knew whether Andy Samberg was supposed to be in high school, abandoned college, or just a loser who lives at home with his mother - Sissi Spacek, in his worst choice of roles. And the poor Ian McShane, a serious actor if I just had to name him, got shit to read in the camera. The story recedes and is completely predictable to the end, including the end (there is no spoiler in case Adam Samberg wants to see him). Do not spend ANYONE money on this movie, and maybe Lorne Michaels will get a hint and start producing quality movies (Yes, Vaine's War and Tommy Boi are high quality).
