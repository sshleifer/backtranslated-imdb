Although I consider myself a fan of the television series Babylon 5, the original film that introduced the series was a bad start. Although many of the elements that later become mature and become much more convincing in the series, there, the pace is slow, the makeup is somewhat inadequate, and the action is confusing. Worse still, the characterization of the episode of the premiere is bad. Although the chart shows that many fans are willing to ignore these problems, I remember that The Gathering was almost excluded from what soon grew into a spectacular series.
