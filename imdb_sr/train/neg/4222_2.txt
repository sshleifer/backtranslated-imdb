For those of us who lived through those weeks of shooting in the city and around the Valley - not to forget the boring days of closing the roads and "filming the film." As a reminder to those who live here - the boutiques are Boulder Creek, Bonnie Doon, Davenport, Big Basin. etc. The Bank was a fire brigade BC; The scenes for the hunt included Moon Drive off Hvi 236, Empire Grade Rd and Hvi 1. Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most valuable, Matt Broderick was above all of us - even then. What the film is about - the joke of the script, and even more laughter about acting and complications - but who cares at this level. A nice weather capsule for those who enjoy our coast and the landscape of the valley. Additional remarks; Joe's Bar (Jed's Tavern in the movie), the original name of the movie was Velcome to Buzzsav - the parking lot on old Erbi was the city square, and the court records were away from Grove Street in Boulder Creek; Turn off the thinking cap and see a few actors in their early days.
