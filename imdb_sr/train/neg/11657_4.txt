"Scari Movie 2" was dropped in Scari Movie Franchise. Scari Movie 1, 3, and 4 were good, but this was boring and not so funny. Fortunately, they chose their action after this and made two more big Scari Movies. Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to run away. This film is not terrible, but they could improve a lot of things. It's a little fun, and if you liked other films in Scari Movie franchise, then give this watch - but I do not think you'll like that much.
