No wonder this film never saw the light of the day. The time was that the release was horrible. Gong show already "jumped with shark" at the time the film came out, so who would pay the money just to see some of the censored shots from the original show? And the shows are just a small part of this pathetic, 90-minute crowd of Chuck Barris about how much his life was host to the show. Did he really expect that we would be sorry for his confused life? Did he really think we even wanted to know about his life? (Apparently, since he later wrote his strange autobiography of his career as an CIA operative.) Did he think anyone would have it everywhere, everywhere audition for him would remain fresh for 90 minutes? Or was the network manager tracked at every step? It may have worked as a plot for a 30-minute serial episode, but not as a feature film. However, it was nice to see again Rip Tailor, Gene Gene and an unknown comic strip (though, for the film to be "spiced", it included only its most accessible routines). As some others have pointed out, this is the first significant part of Phil Hartman's film (although it only takes a minute). Please note that his name is HARTMANN in points, and that is the name with which he was born. You can not miss his voice and facial expressions, although he is much thinner and younger than in SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small part; one of his first after leaving the world of soap.
