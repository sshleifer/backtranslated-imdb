When I heard a plot about this movie, I just had to see it, I think the whole towns were erased from killer tomatoes! Unfortunately, the title is so funny as it gets. Leaded by Detective Dick Mason, a special team of soldiers and scientists (including Greg Colburn who never draws his SCUBA equipment and a porter that never "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" is a parody of B-Movies , especially on Japanese horrors from the 1950s. The film begins with a standard size tomato that reveals a woman who drinks in the kitchen before we find ourselves at the center of the crime while the tomato allegedly killed this lady, and let me tell you it does not make any sense how the film is progressing! To be honest, there is someone Any funny moments, for example, whenever a Japanese scientist, Dr Nokitofa, says that his voice has been renamed as an American accent, or when Sam Smith's hiding expert infiltrates tomatoes 'hey, can someone pass the ketchup?' Equally, this film was probably Much more fun in 1978 with all its bad, good concepts. Unfortunately, the films "Airplane" and "Naked Gun" were released for the movie "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes", which were made much better than this comedy. The act is horrible; there is no continuity in editing and only feels really slow and energy-free. For a parody movie, it takes a lot of things that happen at once, one crowd after the ending. Singing in the movie seems pointless, and commercials for the furniture store that flicker across the screen are just bizarre, even for this movie. After all, you can see why this movie is cult; I do not see that many people are indifferent to him. Unfortunately, it would be a horrible way to summarize it.
