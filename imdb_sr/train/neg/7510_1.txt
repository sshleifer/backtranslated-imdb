The film is a collection of clich√©s on almost anything. There is no focus, no goals, no real message. Symbolism is pushing to the top and stereotypes are abundant and unheard of. This film can not resist the temptation to make a drama where it does not exist. Every small word exchange is immediately transformed into a long, unjustified dialogue that is so typical of the performance of the acting class. Where there is no exchange, the actors (no matter how good they are) can not compensate for excessive emotions, called "role-playing." Through the acting, simply put it. The director here is not helpful. Nothing can save this story. He was forced, fake and bored with tears. Unpredictability in portraying a punk rock with The Vho, Piercing and Flying Scents of the '90s. The characters wander without the role, details and motives. Locations are arbitrary. This is Boogie Nights cum Good Fellas cum Saturdai Night Fever, with the sense and art that is extracted. Good DP. I'll give it. Some movies have flaws. This film is Lee's fault. He sold himself, like everyone else. He became irrelevant. There is no longer any interest in saying so. I do not have any desire to see again of this type (whom I will refrain from appointing from now on).
