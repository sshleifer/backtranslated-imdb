I just finished watching American pies: Beta House and I have to say, this was a bunch of garbage. The first three American pies were hilarious, the last three were jokes and they should not be called American pie. As you understand from the title of the movie, Beta House is about fraternity, fraternity, girls, and the most original part of all of them, they fall in love. Of course, the guy who has his own way with chickens is Stifler, who, along with his friends, is trying to complete another seemingly impossible task. It was unreal and super lying. This is really predictable and the plot is so weak. Both sides of the college struggle to see who gets the whole thing (something like that) To sum up: horrible acting + bored letter + wrong use of the American franchise = total waste of time! This film is unbearable. I give him two out of ten, although most of them were sucked in there were many nudity and beautiful girls, like 2 funny scenes :)
