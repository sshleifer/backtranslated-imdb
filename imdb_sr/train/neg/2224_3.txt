I saw that for the first time when I was about seven years old. I remembered what I believed was the vague outline of what had happened. Now, 15 years later, it turned out that I remembered everything with great precision, because it seems that the writers never managed to overcome the story. No complication for this movie / cartoon. There is no character development, no stories in the background, no character of arcs, nothing. Good guys do things because they are good, while bad guys do things just because they are bad. One unintentionally hilarious part is when someone who thinks he is important dies and nobody cares at least. I just shrug with my shoulders and go on. There is no dialogue. If you cut the fighting scenes and started the scene, you will lose 70% of the movie. See this because you want to see some good animation and for no other reason. Or if you like to look at sparingly dressed hot cartoon chicks (or scarcely dressed hot cartoons).
