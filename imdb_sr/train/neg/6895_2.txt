The plot is rocky. The act is somewhere south of Jr. High School. Cinema is not bad, but it seems to be cut out with a machete. I could not decide that it was a deliberately hockey movie or the people behind him actually thought they were making a good movie. Think Death Vallei Dais meets Maiberri RFD. People run around in a 'lawless' modern city carrying 6 pistols. She has more of her cutsei. Imagine how good guys get to the old farm and park Ford Mustang right in front of the rail. Imagine the staff at the hotel watching the obviously western (hemisphere) film with a Japanese soundtrack, but with English subtitles. It's all really weird, but it can be improved if you watch it while participating in a small pejot. It's real curiosity with modern parallels with every Western movie clich√© you can think of. There is even a modern version of the benevolent girl in the dance hall, and the harp of the Jew in the sound system. Really! If someone brings it to your home for a movie session on Saturday night, tell them your DVD player has died.
