Err ... this film is sucked. MUCH. I read some other reviews. Obviously there are many people who think that everything Voody Allen writes or plays automatically well ... I watched several of his films, in vain hope that something is missing. But no, they're just bullshit. Bad garbage. All characters are very stereotyped (not to mention pretty stupid). The thing is ... I think it should be mysterious. I'm not sure about that. Карактер г. Allen is ... Voody Allen, on any other movie you've seen. If you are a fan of Voody Allen, go watch this movie. If you are under 50, do not be tormented. (If you're a fan of Voody Allen and you have less than 50 ... well, you're atypical. I do not know what to say.)
