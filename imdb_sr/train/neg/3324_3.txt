I saw it by chance one lazy summer afternoon. He played on the HBO program for family programming. At first I was drawn into what I thought was Disney animation. But then, after a few minutes, I found myself in search of the remote, so I could find the 'INFO BUTTON' to find out what's on the world on my TV. I have nothing against Harvey F., I enjoy many of his films, but one is not, it's a loud artist. It certainly has one of Hollywood's unique voices, but it only works as part of a larger visual package. Attaching the voice to a sweet duck makes watching something difficult. As far as the rest of the actors are concerned, not inspired. I guess the work on this movie did not attract a really good voice over the talents. So, a low voice talent, a strong animation ... who was this movie? Gai adolescent ducks? I do not understand. Is there really such a scarcity of the role model for the young homosexuals who come and who come, that we have to resort to animated ducks? Cute story, and as a title, this movie was hard for me to love, just like a nasty duck.
