I can not imagine that anyone ever, in a million years, would like to watch this movie. Not because it was one of the worst ever made (it was), but mostly because it's about 20 years old and that's how it came out of the mainstairs. I was trying to find out where I saw the actor and it jumped. So, yes, the child stops playing a small league because he does not like nuclear bombs, it causes great media attention and quick resolution of the Cold War. The end. To be sure that it is a fantasy, but the one who is so upset would make John Lenon blush. Since terrorism has replaced communism as an act of fear for hell, this film does have no significance, except as an (inaccurate) overview of those times. Writing, acting and film deals are similarly underdeveloped. The reason I rated him as high as I did was that I watched this movie about 50 times while I was 5-6 years old and still have little room in my heart for it, but now I realize that this is not quite a mustard. So, if the law of large numbers is correct and someone eventually decides to look at this movie, realize that there are many better ways to spend your time, but also much worse. (For now, I will refrain from tycoon John K.)
