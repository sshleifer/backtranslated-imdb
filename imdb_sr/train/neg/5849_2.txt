As a lover of silent films, I rejoiced to see this picture for the first time. I was pretty disappointed. As already mentioned, it seems that the movie is a long, long commercial for the Makvell car. Perhaps if the scene was half the size of the shot, maybe I enjoyed the movie more. But he quickly aged. And as long as I recognize that reality grows many times in movies, without reducing the satisfaction of the viewer, what about the Mexican bandits? I mean, they drive a car through the mountains, a car that travels most of the time for about a mile an hour, and yet can not get it?
