After 30 seconds, you already realized that there was no real budget for this cheap blow. The story is taken from great movies such as "Tekas Chainsav Massacre" and "Hills have Eies". I love such films, even if they are duplicated well (Incorrect Turn, Timber Falls, Carver). But "Side Sho" is hard to watch: the actors are really bad, the dialogue is cheesy and music is stupid and totally wrong. You do not care what's going on with the characters. The so-called bad guys are not at all interesting and stereotyped. What about blood and blood? Well, they have them, although it's pretty cheap, and the action takes place very badly. 2 points, only for blood and blood, but realize that this is hardly worth a look, even for up-goners.
