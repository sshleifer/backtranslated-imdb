Serge Farnel highly criticized this film in the Rwandan Night magazine (vvv.lanuitrvandaise.net). Critics who show that France was behind all the situations that the United Nations passed in Rwanda. UN soldiers were in a dangerous situation, while French soldiers were warmly welcomed by the forces of genocide. Earlier, ten UN troops were killed. Because of that, UN troops decided to protect their lives by riding for French trucks. In this way they gave up Tutsi that are inexcusable of course. But we must bear in mind that the French soldiers have organized this situation.
