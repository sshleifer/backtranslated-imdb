Remake's top film from 1972 on the stage, beautifully throws Caine as the nemesis of his character from the first film. But nothing else does anything nice. Sub-performance of actors, Lion and Caine, further thinned by a weak direction of self-resistance. The warmth setting in the original is abandoned for the super-modern acquisition of homes. The subtle mutual relationship between Oliver and Caine, which made the first film so visible, was replaced by a horrible, arrogant arrogance that immediately provokes the specter of contempt. But this is not a smart, inspired and froing loved one, but the other character that is well fed, this is obviously the killing of the OTT character of both characters from the word go. This version of Sleuth is not really worth a look, watch the original movie and be blinded from the show.
