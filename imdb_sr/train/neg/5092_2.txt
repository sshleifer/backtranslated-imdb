Shocking! In 1965, I saw Yuri Gagarin alive. He was sincere, unpretentious and kind, he was relaxed and looked like a well-educated and intellectual person. In this movie I saw a clown! The actor looks like a puppet with a gesture and mimicry. They made a cartoon! Real Gagarin was someone else! Do not believe this movie! I saw this film in films such as "Spraying Fire" and "Apollo 13" and after reading the books "Rockets and Men" by Chertok and "Korolev: Myths and Facts" by Golovanov. I was shocked by the fatigue scenario, bad acting and production, and a multitude of inaccuracies in the "Space Race". The film is a boring display of famous Russian historical facts. Many interesting facts about space projects have not been shown. Some facts and details are distorted. For example, in 1945, Korolev was not a prisoner (released in 1944), and in 1940 he was not already in the gold mine in Kolyma, but in a special design office. Korolev was designer at the design office and was not buried. But in the film, Korolev worked as a digger after the 1940s (because the jailer had shoulder straps on the uniform). IMHO, filmmakers do not have a deep knowledge of this part of history and can not make interesting films.
