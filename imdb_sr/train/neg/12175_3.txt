Why review good films when you can preview "Trancers II?" Ooh, this film is soooo lame. I can only imagine the actors and the team driving around L.A. with your camcorder, throwing additions to the silly monstrous makeup for the poor, long-running Tim Thompson. Star families actually appear to play kameji, probably because Full Moon could not afford the "real" accessories. Lame effects, lame sets and scripts are so intricate that it will take an eon to drive away all nodes - these must be classic Trancers! And yet ... and yet ... it rules. Note that this is the same thing I say about "Trances IV". I say that because it's true. What can win by looking at an old guy in a coat to sow zombies, and then breaks with humorous signs like: "Do not worry ladies, they are biodegradable"? Well, much could be better, but still this is still a good thing. My only significant reservation is Megan Ward, which really stinks to the wrist. She is a bad rival for Helen Hunt - both are young bits of sweets, and it would be more effective that they were actually a bit more in contrast. Oh well, you can not have everything. At least the beautiful arrangement of the "long second hour" has returned to its place, and we have more than Hap Ashbie, the least convincing athlete in the history of the film (oh, wait a bit - he has a rival in the shape of David Ogden Steers in "Creator"). I have not seen this lately, but it seems to me that Martine Besvick runs twice in the final battle. Clock due to poor continuity! Just one of many accentuated films.
