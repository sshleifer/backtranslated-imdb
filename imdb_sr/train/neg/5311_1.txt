This is almost the worst movie you'll ever see! 2012 Doomsdai is currently pulling out the carpet below this, for me. Requests are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa used to call cheepnis. It seems that the space scenes were made at a plant in the 1950s, just before demolition. Music is really shit. The play is wood and ham. The characters they show are shallow and unconvincing. Plot is predictable. It is immediately and audibly obvious when copying techniques and ideas from other films. The quality of the guidance of the beggar believes. But you must see it, at least to experience what must be one of the biggest waste of a small budget ever. This is an invaluable example of a stupid movie!
