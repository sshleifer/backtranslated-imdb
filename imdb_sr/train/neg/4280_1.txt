This must be accompanied by a special rating and a warning: NOT RECOMMENDED TO NORMAL HUMANS. Also, it's obvious that a man is a misanthropic, hating everything - his country, his people, his actors, his job. And this hatred makes him blind and he more forgets the profession he has long known. This so-called "movie" is just a disgusting set of disgusting images, with no artistic value and expertise. It is an insult of good taste and good sense. Shame, shame, shame!
