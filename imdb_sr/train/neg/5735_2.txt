First, this is a low-budget film, so my expectations were incredibly low in that. I suppose that most people who watched the information for this movie wanted only blood, and that's basically that's all. Plot? It really does not exist. It's basically Pila, but in China and the whole hell much worse. Cast? There is no time. Special effects? It's absolutely terrible in my opinion ... There were commitments and the blood was often incredible for the quantities, spraying, color, texture, etc. I believe that the purpose of this film should be a brutal, shock movie. Now he had great potential for a bigger budget, but a bad script, bad dialogue, terrible acting, what looked like video footage of the camcorder, and just incredible "up" made this film really terrible. whether the movies are worth the chances against some reviews, even "b-rate" movies deserve some opportunities (blood tracks, for example, were the latest I saw in relation to the reviews that paid off), but that was simply horrible. I hope that people who think about this film will read my comment and decide against it. I am for brutality and shock, but the overall unrealism and really terrible acting is a terrible experience. Save your time / money and some other chance, you will not be disappointed.
