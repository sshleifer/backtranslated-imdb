After I heard so many people who were rebuking this film, I thought I would run it. Except it's incredibly slow, which does not bother me while I'm waiting for it, but it's just not. As many others have said that there is so much inconsistency and so much of the film does not sound true. The reaction of the four men goes from shock, the fear of finding the body to full indifference while fishing. Certainly they are the types of people who would go for a happy fishing, then they would only report the body and say they were discovered only after their fishing trip .... why on earth attach a body for a tree, go fishing and then tell everyone that you found the body 2 days earlier? It's hard to watch the movie knowing that the behavior of the main characters is so inconsistent. As for other citizens, I would think that at least one of them could show curiosity about who actually killed a woman! Only the body, naked except pants ... which scenario leads to it? If she was raped, then why is she still underwear? If she was raped with clothes, why remove them? If she had not been raped, why then remove all her clothes from the rags ... leaving yourself with evidence to get rid of? I really can not imagine any realistic scenario that would lead to not killing someone to steal their clothes so that you can fill up your confusion for sale! Oh, it's good to watch, but just and just because, despite the bad scenario, the acting is strong.
