I gave this 2-star film just because Dominik Monaghan really made an effort in his acting. Everything else about this movie is extremely amateur. Everything related to the direction of this film was very bad. Not only should the director think about what he is doing for a lifetime career, but maybe you should watch several movies. Since Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, putting him in the movie of this caliber makes him horrible. Whoever was the "actor" who played Jack's best friend should never stand in front of the camera. I did not expect much from such a small movie, but perhaps it takes a little more time and effort to invest in characters and their surroundings. Do not waste time and money on this movie (like me), you will be very disappointed.
