I must say that I first watched this movie about 6 years ago, and then I actually enjoyed it. I recently bought a DVD and after a second look I wondered why I liked it. The acting was terrible and as we usually have stereo-typical clans in their fake costumes. The act was at best horrible. Tim Roth did a good job like Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange meant. The line was good, but the execution was only bad. I'm tired of Scotland looking like this in movies. The brave heart was even worse, even though it's a film that only saves grace. But seriously, people did not say so in those days, why all actors must have accents from Glasgow? Just another movie that tries to capture the essence of already tired and boring stereotypes. I noticed that the only people who say that this film is good is the Americans, and to be honest, I see why they would like it, I know they have a love for men in Kilts. However, if you are thinking about buying a DVD, I would say that you spend your money on something else, like a better movie.
