I have nothing to comment on this movie. It's so bad that I had to put my first comment on the IMDb site to help some viewers save time and do something more interesting, instead of watching this "movie" ... everything they do, even looking at the walls is better. And because I have to write at least 10 lines of text, I tell you that there is a low-budget movie, bad acting, actors without names, stupid stupid like a wolf, and so on ... And the story does not bring nothing new, special effects were made in the style of the 80's. The film is almost as bad as the film "Megalodon". So have fun! ;) (I do not watch this movie)
