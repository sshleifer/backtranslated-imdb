This is a low movie. There is no real plot. We are never familiar with motivations, besides wealth. The characters are some of the worst actors ever made. It seems that the threat is supernatural, but then it is under the control of these three elderly people. Why they do what they do; to scare other members of the group? I do not know. There is a fog from the fog machine rolling in the corridors and it looks like everyone is scared. Does something work? I do not know. He has some nudity for himself. I'm always surprised to see this in the movies of this old one. Things are settling at this moment. In any case, people run around like chicks, ready for the ax. They do not have a plan; no resources; no nothing. There are about five stupid climaxes in the movie. Who are these people and "is" there a ghost or a demon. What happened to other people? I challenge everyone to do it with any kind of trust. What a mess.
