Thanks to the boring, dimensional scenario of Neil Simone and the stupid direction of Robert Moore, Chapter 2 becomes a sharp showcase for Marsha Mason who received the third of the four Oscars for the second chapter, giving the same performance here in Cinnderella Liberty (73), Goodbie Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and Only Wen I Laugh (81), only this time she has no child to drag him. The second chapter is the third and last feature film for Moore previously directed by Neil Simone Cheaply Detective (78) and Murder of Death (76). Caan is miscast, the characters are mono-dimensional, the dialogue is overly analytical, and virtually no details of the establishment. The first half is less than a stunning, happy, sweet romance between the brilliant Caan and Mason, and the gloomy second half makes you long for the first half. Locations in New York, as well as Joe Bologna, and painfully Caldera Valerie Harper are irrelevant, but at least they provide a welcome distraction. And the last and the least, there is a terrible song that plays during the loan.
