This film is a massive Iavn that proves that Americans do not have a Farce. Even when it's already written for them! The original movie "Hodet Over Vannet" is a witty comedy of errors I would rate 8/10. It's not just about language translation, but certain absurd chains of events are totally ignored by looting the film of the original smart farsical nature and turning it into a cheap "oops there goes my pants" to the style of farce.
