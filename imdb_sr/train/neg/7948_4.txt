"Seventh Sign" lends a lot to "Rosemary Baby" and "Prediction" (it actually connects two stories). Even his title is reminiscent of Bergman's "seventh seal". However, it begins well enough, with all the signs scattered throughout the country, and in parallel with that, apparently a different trick with Moore's husband who is trying to save the poor boy (who killed his parents who were their brother and sister) from the death penalty. Time, both Christian and Jewish religions call for salvation (even a wandering Jew is involved), making the lines sometimes inadvertently ridiculous (Have you ever been to a Sunday school? But they taught me that God is love!). IMHO scene, is a brief dialogue between priest John Heard - who does not seem to take things seriously, a shame that he has no more important role because his relaxed acting is priceless - and the young Jew. Demi Moore probably recorded the same desire as the former husband Bruce Villis: saving the world a movie for all that.
