I just did not enjoy this movie. But then I loved Babe, pig in the city, and I was spoiled by talking about animal films that are extremely well made in every way. The animals were not cute. Everyone was irritating the special guinea pigs of Chris Roek, but then what could I expect, it's Chris Rock. I believe I smiled once or twice in a couple of sweet lines, but that's it.
