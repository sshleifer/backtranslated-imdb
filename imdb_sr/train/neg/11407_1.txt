This film is a perfect example of a great book that was destroyed by the film. Jacob Have I Loved is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. There is no story, stories disappear, and editing is terrible. Above all, music is straight from the synthesizer and it sounds incredibly terrible. The role of Bridget Fonda is decent, but the acting of all others is totally amateur. I would suggest this film to someone who is learning to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a movie because he is full of bad scenes, bad transitions and acting that should have been filmed! Read the book and do not waste time with this movie.
