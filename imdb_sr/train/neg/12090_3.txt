Although I can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film through intrigue, I certainly thought that it was a painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played too much to look for the majority of viewers. The enormous holes in the script, such as a comment that the mother never explained "your father died today", makes it even more difficult to figure these characters. This won the first place in Cannes in 2001, this is a shock. Perhaps the French were starving for a film noir that year and were desperate for something sadistic like this film. I perceived the long scene as a means of keeping the viewer as unfavorable, but when I agree with the inability to connect with the main character, he went too far for me and kept me away from the story. <This is only a movie for the most interested movie movie fan and one who does not expect any pleasure to watch the movie once it is finished. I loved films such as "Trainspotting" or "Rekuiem for a Dream" - which were far more disturbing, but at least gave the viewer something in terms of editing and pacing. To watch these teachers slow and painful silence after the scene, it just got so redundant that I found it boring - and I really wanted to like this movie at every step.
