Meet Peter Houseman, a professor of genetics at the University of Virginia. When he does not go into the field, he leaves his mind and throws his panties on classroom lectures. Dr. Houseman works on a serum that will allow the body to constantly regenerate the cells, enabling people to become immortal. And I would like to be immortal if I look like Christian Bale and have a sweet female love that only the VU can offer. The assortment of old and ugly university professors does not care for the popular Houseman and cut off funding for his project due to lack of results. Because of this, Peter uses himself as a guinea pig for his serum. To my surprise, there are side effects, and he, understand this, metamorphosis! into something that is embedded in our genetic DNA that is suppressed "for millions of years." He also slept with Dr. Mike Salli after all the day he knew. She has a son. His name is Tommy. He's an angry little boy. Metamorphosis is not a horrible movie, it's just not well produced. All the while I watched this I could not go through the fact that it was filmed in 1989. It does not help packing it with movies from the 1970s, while Metamorphosis is part of the classic 50s classic. There is basically no difference in the quality of the film. The last five minutes are pure bad film cheese which, at least, saved me from a smaller rating for me. Pay attention to computer terminology such as "chromosomal anomaly". No wonder Peter's experiments failed. Your computer can not write! This is a decent view followed by a path to your local tavern.
