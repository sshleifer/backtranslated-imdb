Until the last few minutes of the film, I would give the film a score of 7 or 8 stars. However, the end is so awesome and "Hollivoodized" to completely undermine the first 80% of the movie. . Captain, Gene Hackman, is all about launch, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, has first confirmed the launch commands. The problem is that the captain and the first officer must simultaneously launch the launch keys. Hackman is determined to launch and Washington is firmly fixed until finally there is an armed rebellion in the submarine. In the end, the error is detected and the missiles do not start. Cool. However, there comes a piece that simply does not ring. After returning to the mainland and going to the review board, Washington and Hackman (who just spent half the film trying to kill each other) are shaking hands and they are all friends! Huh?! Too a boring ending for a movie to be worthwhile for me.
