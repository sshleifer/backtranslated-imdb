This film began with some kind of plot, and then it is abandoned due to the endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward. It was impossible to remain preoccupied with this film. This film is a very cynical bunch of garbage made by some people with animation skills, but completely lacking creativity or the ability to narrate. It's a shockingly bad effort coming from a big studio. It is clear that in Disney there are problems of morality and motivation, not to mention the complete lack of control and quality control. This management allowed this film to see the light of the day and speak of their inability and despair. This film joins my short list of "the worst movies of all time".
