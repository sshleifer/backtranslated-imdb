First, this film is not a comedy; unless you force yourself, you can hardly be laughing. Secondly, the film is slow and boring. The acting is not bad, but it's not special. There Lucki Luke is a comedian about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting in a small town ... you will be much laughing if you read this instead of wasting time on this movie. Religions and dogmas are not the best source for a good comedy and this film only confirms this rule. There is a similar subject comedy "Domestic Teachers"; This had some good moments. My last comment is: Do not waste your time and money watching this uninspired and boring movie.
