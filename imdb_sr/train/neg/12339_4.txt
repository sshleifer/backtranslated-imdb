This comedy has some funny things inside of you, surrounded by many uncomfortable things. Almost every scene with the castle slaves and their stupid fools is a waste of time. And the plot is so messy that it makes you wonder if they actually had the script ready before they started to record, or simply made up everything when they went together. (* 1/2)
