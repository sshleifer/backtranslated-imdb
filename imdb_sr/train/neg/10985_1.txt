I do not know what Margaret Atwood thought she would allow this film to have the same name as her book. I was always a big fan of The Robber Bride and I was so excited that I learned that the film was working. I am aware that the translation of the book into a movie is not perfect, but this film was the worst ever. The names of women are correct, and some of the backs are correct, but that's about it. I feel like I've lost a good deal of my time trying to get through this movie. This was supposed to be a mini series that will tell the story as it is written. Actors for Rose, Tony, Charis and Zenia were well selected, although I was initially skeptical about Maria-Louise Parker. I wish they had a better scenario for work, because it had nothing to do with the book at all.
