This film is an insult to all submarines. It was stupid. Apparently they wrote monkeys. The acting was absurd. If this is the view most people have about the navy, then I cry for our defense. This film was terrible. I put it under "Voiage to the bottom of the sea" as far as submarine films are concerned. Gene Hackman must have really had to borrow money for this shit. Denzel Washington had to be tall. It makes little sense in the plot. And the end. Should the rebel be rewarded for his crime? Only Hollivood would think about this garbage. If you have not understood yet, I did not like that. And if there were not any professional comments, I would not try to make it.
