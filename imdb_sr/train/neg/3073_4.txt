On the back of the DVD box, Ellen Page co-stars writes in this film. It does not even appear until two-thirds of the film ends, and then in a smaller role. I do not consider this as a secondary role, but rather a "substantial" part. Also, the plot has many inexplicable elements. Some examples are: why is the main character casting off his eldest son? Why did her youngest son drive her head in the train? He says it's a bet that does not explain anything. It is obvious that the scriptwriter does not know the definition of a bet. This movie is not worth the rental price in my opinion. Save your money and watch it for free on TV if you think it needs to be seen.
