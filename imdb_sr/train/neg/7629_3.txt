I gave this movie a pretty good chance and it gave me that. This is a little more than a black-and-white excuse to get out of the audience even when egotist Bogdanavic (who was better with TARGETS) gets "great performances" of tons of ham in their debut. Many teenage sexy clich√©s come out of this movie, such as Doing the Teacher's Vife, Impotence, Doing the Ugli Prostitutka (which is very inconveniently shot and stuffed things to a complete standstill, not that things really went anywhere) and thinness. I guess this film should be funny because of all the sexual stupidity, for me it was just embarrassing. I was seriously having fun by cleaning my nails but watching this mess.
