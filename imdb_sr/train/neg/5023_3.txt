Nobody, but no one, could chew a landscape like Divine, Ruth Elizabeth Davis, and "Elizabeth and Esex" is a great example of why. Although sometimes this part is being upgraded, watch her say when she says Raliegh writes lyrics to the songs that her ladies will be waiting for. ! On other occasions, she deals with the deadlyness of the script. When Elizabeth must be vulnerable, she is weak and cunning. This has the additional effect of undermining its authority: when it explodes the chimney and closes it to pronounce justice, it's hard to grasp seriously. in Elizabeth's heart, but is completely incapable of conveying the complexity and pure evil of man. It also does not help that Essek is poorly signed. Why is he the hot head who wants to overthrow his queen-even when his loyalty is sworn-except that he is only a bluish, therefore, more "worthy" ruler? And why does Raliegh betray Elizabeth by intercepting her and Essex's letters? It's not in danger of being in favor, and we know where Essek (and his head) is at the forefront. Why then does he risk his own head by acceleration of the inevitable? What did Curtiz do with all $$$ who got it? He does not even try to hide the fact that his battles were recorded on the sound stage. He had to finish with Elizabeth for the first time in Tover; everything else that follows (especially the final scene between her and Essex) is unnecessary. The costumes are fantastic. And is it me, or is Bette like Susan Sarandon?
