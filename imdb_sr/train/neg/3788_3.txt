There's a lot to love here. The actors are in the first place, and the script provides a good dialogue that best reflects the ambience of a firmly connected, sympathetic family. However, for this reason, the film does not sound true. We see that Leo, who has apparently only learned about his HIV positive diagnosis, essentially reacts in a way that is not in line with the atmosphere of support he finds. Likewise, the film ends somewhat sharply avoiding what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family have to face in the light of their love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is as impressive as the rest of the actors in general. Unfortunately, screenwriters could not decide whether they wanted to get an insight into the effect of HIV on a functional, attractive family, or what is the destruction of HIV on the victim - so it just points to both. While this film gives food for thought, it leaves the viewer to want much more than it brings.
