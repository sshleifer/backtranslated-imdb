The effect (i) without cause is not possible at all in the real world, but in the world of Hollywood treatments, it is not only possible, but also necessary. The Haunting received computer processing by the courtesy of the first-rate directors-director, who once showed the promise (Jan de Bont-Speed), but has since produced a series of large budget garbage (Tvister, Speed ​​2). > The actor is superfluous in a movie of this type and seems to understand it. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones act like they want anywhere, but not in this movie. Lily Taylor is trying to add something to the procedure, but what might be unknown is because half seems to be missing. Events only happen, good and bad spirits appear without rhyme or reason, and then the story just ends with an unsatisfactory non-event that was supposed to end the previous 90 minutes of incompatibility. Not even the reason to see it for effects, because we all know that everything can now be put on the screen. Why not watch the effects of serving a good story, and not just for themselves?
