Last night at 9:30 am in my friend's caravan, and we were so excited to watch South Park (a new episode). The thing is that in my South Park country it is broadcast at 22:30 and we decided to kill time watching the show now broadcast, the father of pride. I'll start by saying that I was only watching episodes. The first time I watched it, I found it to be nothing but rude for nothing, so I thought, "Holy shit, I have a football game tomorrow, so I have to stop watching dumb caricatures." But yesterday I tried to give Father Pride another chance. I consider it to be a complete replacement of Simpsons, only replacing yellow human characters instead of lions. Another thing is to wonder why she got a TV-14 rating. I think that the Simpsons are much more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in this show is several homosexual (infertile) jokes. Sympsons are also much more violent (witchcraft specialties) and rough. I also heard that the creator of the series also directed Shrek 2, but I have news for him: Shrek 2 was much better and I think he too remained on the family theme. However, I have to admit that Father Pride has smiled three or four times (he even laughed once). All in all, I do not mind the Father of Pride. I do not hate it, but I do not like it either. I've seen better than Simpson. 3.5 / 10
