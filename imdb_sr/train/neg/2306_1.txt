I wonder what the people who saw this in seeing me that I am not. This film has a very difficult tracking and / or staying at the store. If someone tells you it's a comedy, do not be fooled, that's about 98% of odd odd drama and 2% of comedy. All the actors turn into a great performance, which can not be denied, but it seems that he lost something somewhere. I do not know if the original script was good and it had to be edited or what. This had potential, and instead, it was really a flop. I would really love an hour and a half invested in this movie, but the place to rent videos does not return in time. Save money and see something else.
