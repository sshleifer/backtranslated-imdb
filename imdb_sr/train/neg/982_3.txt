The real star of this funny story is a magnificent technique. Visual eye treatment, the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart. I was intrigued, initially, by the idea that Dietrich and Boier left religion in order to "find" their ability to love. What follows is a big disappointment. Boyer is the only real actor in production and he feels his pain. Ditrich's stunning wardrobe outperforms her performance - sometimes her face is scary to watch - harmless mask. As a monk, Boier held the formula for a monastic liqueur (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse) - when he leaves his "marriage with God," the reaction of his colleagues monks holds the shock and fear that keeps organized religion. The viewer feels that Boier was completely free from his past. However, the path that follows is too predictable.
