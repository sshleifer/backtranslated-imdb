The film is really slow. There are some nice pictures, but it can not surpass the fact that the film is actually boring. You have sex with a lot of watermelons and sexual relationships while eating a watermelon and maybe a little more. It may sound interesting to someone, but believe me watching it for 2 hours is not at all fun. Although you laugh a few times, but it really is not enough and can be more than despair and disbelief than fun. To disturb boredom, the director tries to insert several video clips into the movie. These are truly colorful pistons of absurd songs from the 50's, but it's hard to say exactly and they try to be funny so hard it's really sad. Several times you have the feeling that the plot can develop into something, to create a powerful scene, but in the end it just just gets out and that's it. Alongside the clips, almost no dialogue, let alone music. The editor tries to be genuine and artistic at all costs. I personally can not recommend a movie. I believe art is something that should not be bored. During the screening, there was buzzing around the cinema, which only confirms my short overview.
