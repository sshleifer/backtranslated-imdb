!!!!! MOGUÄ†I SPOILER !!!!! You would think that a story that includes Archie Grey Ovl - an Englishman who presents himself as a red Indian - included a huge amount of humor. In fact, I would say that the only way to treat this kind of film is this way, when an incredible man against the gullible public is treated as a comedy. However, Richard Attenborough committed something similar to the crime by making GREI OVL a serious drama. Even worse, he made an extremely awesome movie. Pierce Brosnan does not have the charisma needed for the title role, and the romantic background between gray owls and ponies (played by equally wooden Annie Gaupeau) lacks any kind of chemistry on the screen. But in order to be honest with the actors, he did not help them with a script that failed to show Archie as a ravenous guy who deceived everyone to believe he was an American. Producers and scriptwriters made the biggest mistake in the fact that the film center around the entanglement of Archie was an Englishman - that's why I wrote "Possible spoiler" that it does not really reveal to the end of the movie that the title character is English, but it's obvious that everyone who watched this the film knew that there was no surprise in advance. Yes, I agree with everyone that the landscape is beautiful and has a deep picture. an ecological message that is not really a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first important ecologist of the 20th century, if the truth was said. It should also be remembered that with the exception of SOILENT GREEN (and possibly TWO TOUCH if you want to classify it as a green message), it was not really a big environmental film. In fact, most ecologically-sensitive films are sized and includes GRAI OVL, a movie that has not surprisingly had a serious problem finding a distributor
