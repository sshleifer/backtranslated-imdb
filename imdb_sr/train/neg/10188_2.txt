This minor, gentle movie is exclusively for teenagers in old male bodies, desperately seeking to relive their hormonally challenged teenage years. How ? Burning gas and equalizing a quick, ruthless car (or airplane) with freedom. The plot lent heavily from Mr. Rogers' neighborhood (if it was my oil conglomerate) and Logan's race was heavily sedated and lacked a clear style). In the main role of Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith, this film is set in the post-gas crisis world where an all-powerful government does not want you (* ahem *) to drive your car and burn gas. Something contrary to today's Enron-and-Bush government, which attracts oil, drives a SUV. Only this contrast makes the movie funny. But wait ... there's more. Although the film is set in the future, we do not show any signs of future technology, except for bicycle return, golf and horseback riding. You believe that the future looks ... just like today. The same clothes, the same suburban houses, the same green lawn as today and when the film was filmed. There are no solar panels, no windmills, no concessions for alternative energy. The act is straight and odorless. Even scenes that could have been big or shifty, mirroring, honor, romance, horror ... all fluttering from a paper doll under a briefcase. Continuity is missing - a flying fly Burgess Meredith's characters change color and configuration from moment to moment while directors insult our intelligence with incomparable images over and over again. Even a stiff car and movie fans should avoid this film as a monthly ride, unless you enjoy bouncing Ekon executives who try to make the movie empty as a helicopter.
