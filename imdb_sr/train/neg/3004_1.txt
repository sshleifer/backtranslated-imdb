What a horrible movie. The act was bad, the pacing was bad, the cinema was bad, the direction was bad, the "special" effects were bad. You expect a certain degree of badness in the slasher, but even the killings were bad. First of all, the last event that set the motive for slaughter lasted 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could have removed 80% and explained what happened quite well. Then, the victims were called to "re-gather" in an abandoned school where all utilities were still included. One of the victims thought it was a little weird, but they rejected him and decided to continue to break through. > There is no reason to watch this movie, unless you want to see some breasts, not really good breasts. This film makes Shovgirls practically indistinguishable from Citizen Kane.
