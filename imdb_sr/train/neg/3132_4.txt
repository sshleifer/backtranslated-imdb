I saw not such an incredible rating on the IMDb, but I still went to see it, because I am a big fan of Bible material. The first thing that bothered me was a bit more than the Indiana Jones movie, but Casper Van Dien did not even see those Jones movies (but should). I believe he tried everything, but the script just stink. Music tried to be Jones' style. It's a great job, but for such a movie it seemed to me too much work, as the video part did not deserve exactly that great music. Robert Wagner gave his best acting skills, he did a good job, but somehow the script crashed. "Jokes" are an old school, about 20 years old; only a cynical smile on my face. There are some really bad camera angels, SFX looks like domestic and unrealistic. Kevin VanHook probably had a good idea about the story (in my opinion, but I love such stories), but things simply failed in the end. Maybe you should put it on paper when it was still fresh in your head. When I (in the first minutes) saw that the film would be one of those low-budget films, I hoped that at least I would 'hear' a good story, but sometimes movies only disappoint.
