First of all, I would like to say that user comments have left me tears in the eyes of laughter. One comment that bad SF movies become good comedies is on track. The MST3000 has made it possible to live out of it. If you look at ANGRY RED PLANET as a feverish dream of a ten year-old comic book reader from 1959, you will have a lunch on this baby. All the elements are here: pseudoscience, sometimes logical, more often hilarious infantile. An adolescent boy's attitude towards sex, with a "gigolo" captain (a good call to that, guys!) Looking at the sturdy "scientists" with so red hair, it's a miracle not to trigger a fire alarms. The funny concept of Mars as a planet that is so exotic that everything shines red, but an alien monster has a mouse face, and the blob alien has an eye around which turns like a toy. Comic Relief, an overweight astronaut (!) That sounds like he never finished 8th grade in Brooklyn and has a psychotic fixation on his gun. And of course, the very fact that the alien is a dangerous evil. If these people met E.T., they would bake it in two seconds! "OV" really! Do not misunderstand me. I rated this film as low. However, it is never bored (unless the scientist explains everything - just to make it all sounds more and more funny), and you have to admit, in your little core, it makes you jump several times. Well, then do not admit it. I suppose you've never been 10.
