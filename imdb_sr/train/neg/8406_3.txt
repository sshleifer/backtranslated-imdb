An indelible line of short-lived emissions. After watching the episode in which this line was presented, my fraternal intramural football team started using the line to break our assaults in attack. Instead of Ready / Break, our quarter said FUDBAL and the rest of the team responded to the IOU BET! A fun way to break the crowds scared by our opponents on the heads, because only a few of them watched the show. Using this line we added a unique element in our season that I will never forget. That year we had the best season while studying at college, and in a small way because of the fun we used. The show was rather stinky, but lives in the memories of the Pi Pappa Phi intramural football team at West Virginia Tech.
