Students who are cleaning the convicted home are being persecuted by an elusive killer. The dorm that hides the blood (called Pranks) is a slightly mixed bag for slipper lovers. Film production values ​​are fairly low, and the story is, in most cases, quite routine, and even there is a creepy ass that moves around the red herring. In fact, much of the story is quite forgetful, except one or two brutal murders. But the movie is really better because of its surprisingly intense climactic (in the atmospheric environment) and a rather shy, unconventional conclusion. Actors are mostly shiny. Stephen Sachs is the best of all because he has a pretty good character. Also look for young Daphne Zuniga as an unhappy student. Through all this this is quite a standard B slasher effort, but the finale is worth the enjoyment and for this viewer saved the film complete ho-hum. ** from ****
