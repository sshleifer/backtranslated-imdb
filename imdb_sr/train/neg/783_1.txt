I was watching this show and it just was not funny. Maybe it was the first episode. Lately I realize that ABC today plays a lot of stupid performances and goes downstairs as a station. All the characters in this show are pretty bad actors, but even if they were good, jokes and scripts are pretty scary and they would still be broadcast. I would say that I believe this show will be canceled, but since ABC is doing quite nasty for the quality of the shows they play, perhaps this would only be kept because it is compared to them.
