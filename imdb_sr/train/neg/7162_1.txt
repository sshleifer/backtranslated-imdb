This movie takes what could have been a good idea, a mummified witch from 2000 years ago and it is completely destroyed. Nora and Jim are alcoholics who go to Ireland to dry. They're going to stay with her and her uncle. Uncle discovered the witch of 2000 years old, which is preserved in peat. He is alive and she takes on the form of Nora. It can not be killed conventionally (there is more damage). Nora, however, is working out a way to do it. This is a gothic horror movie that has been done cheaply. It's a huge mess. I have to ask why someone would want to make such a bad movie. I'm tempted to learn sorcery in order to make him disappear.
