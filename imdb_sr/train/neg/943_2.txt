Here's an interesting little movie that strictly gives the term "low budget" with terrible name. Our physics teacher who has about nine children creates a strange serum that causes a "molecular reorganization". The pupils were hopelessly killed by fake coincidences of submarine sandwiches and school supplies. It sounds like the resurrection of classic B-films from the 50's, right? Nope! This is not an example of a high campus entertainment, which is a way, VAI off the mark. The glamorous exhibition of chest and crowd provokes our desire for pleasure, confronting the horror that should have had 99.44% more. Fun at the bottom of the bouquet in the best edition, backed up with pints of red blood and dead student bodies. Such horror films would be extremely disastrous GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) by the work of an intelligent genius who has a master's degree in film production! It's automatic "F", so it's easier!
