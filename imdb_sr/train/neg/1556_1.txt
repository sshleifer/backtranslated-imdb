I was China in this movie. I chose the screen name Sheeba Alahani because I was a model at that time in Italy and could not properly say my real name, so I chose Sheeb and then added the Alahans because it was similar to Alohalans. I've never acted before (and it shows), but it was so much fun to shoot. Every morning they gave me "lessons about acting" (which obviously was not useful). They called my voice (thank God). David and Peter were a blast on a set full of humor and jokes. This film was never deliberately taken seriously, it was a tax for writing off to internal information. I give him 1 because I have a sense of humor, but 10 for the fun in which I "acted".
