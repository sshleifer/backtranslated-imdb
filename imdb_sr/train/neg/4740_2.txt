I am so offended by this film, it's not even funny ... And I thought that "Mulan" is unbelievable! As much as my expectations from Disney were low, I did not even think that they would do anything stereotypically, but so far. There is no respect here for any real Chinese culture, only the Hollywood tradition of random martial arts. I appreciate that they tried to make Wendy a normal teenage girl ... teenagers - especially Asian teenagers - are much less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life. And from the point of view of culture, it's almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are wrapped in popularity and fashion, but they are quite rare. Even those who are still quite decent scientists. Another stereotype, maybe, but quite true. Because Chinese parents are working. That's how Chinese values ​​work. If they wanted to gain authenticity, they would have made Wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a relationship of love and hate with her family. Asian culture does not refer to meditation and obscure, naturally oriented phrases that sound wisely. We do not go astounding all the time, and we all do not know some form of martial arts. We are PEOPLE, and I would be grateful if someone would write an Asian part that does not portray us as a sad caricature.
