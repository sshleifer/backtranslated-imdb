A wonderful television mini-series is completely destroyed by a 45-year-old woman who desperately tries to get out like a 16-year ingenue! There is no exaggeration - this is the real-life character played by Ali MacGrav when the movie opened just before the sudden attack in Pearl Harbor. This mini-series of TVs is indeed the most classic example of the title of this post and the one I invoke whenever the topic arises. The best-shot "global" drama of World War II TV has ever produced. If you have a stomach - or a decent ability to quickly rewind - you may be able to enjoy the late Robert Mitchum in very strong performance. I am delighted with some comments related to the love story. Have you watched the film closed eyes? Or they are older, who never cease to impress me with their "selective memories" and "selective vision". I'm Boomer, so do not even think for a moment that I'm some kind of humorous young punk. 45 He'll always watch 45. Get used to it. Deal with it. Age is graciously damn. Winds of war could have been ... so good. How many would you like to talk about this mini-series, some 25 years later, is ACTUAL ingenue in such an important and critical role? Right now, with the constant downgrading of old bids, it just overturns most of the great aspects of The Vinds of Var.
