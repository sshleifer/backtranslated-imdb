I really hope that Concorde / Nev Horizons was not trying to make a serious horror, or even an action movie when they made Carnosaur 3. The movie is stupid from start to finish. Even humor in C3 is ridiculous because it's bad. Definitely high water level in the genre 'It's so bad is good'. If you enjoy the worst of the worst, this is for you.
