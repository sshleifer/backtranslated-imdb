There is no spoiler here ... There is no complication to ruin. Madchen Amick is a living proof that a person can live in acting - no talent is needed. The only bright spot is a few really good liners that Alice Krige delivered very nicely, but again, she is Alice Krige. Her soft, dreamy voice is the only hint of how ridiculous these strange creatures can be. She is incredibly angry with this incredible complication. How they made her to agree to this project remains a mystery. Screenwriters needed to be cured when they sent this script. It has big problems in continuity, superficial stereotypical characters, writing horor formulas, and it just does not make any sense whatsoever. Creatures, although they have neat skills such as "smoke", the question of where they come from and what they are, are never explored. Do not waste your time on this.
