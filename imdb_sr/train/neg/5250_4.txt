I absolutely love the book written by Robin Klein, so I was very excited when I heard that the film was based on the book being made. But I was very disappointed with the movie when I saw it because I did not catch what I liked about the book - absolutely ridiculous funny Eric and the interesting way she looks at the world. From the very beginning of the film, I realized that things are not as I imagined in the book. So, I just went for a ride. It was not that bad, I guess. Miss Bellmont was completely different from what I imagined to be! I did not think she would smoke and drink - Jean Kittson, who is a game, is hilarious! Sam, I thought that the movie and his actors / actress were doing a good job in it, but unfortunately, I'm so fond of a book (one of my favorite books of all time) that I could not help but feel dissapointed
