I had a little hope for this, because I like Tim Roth. I was not happy with this movie. I loved Ang Lee The Hulk a few years ago and I realized that it would have more bang. First I was very disappointed with the performance of John Hurt. It looks like his eyebrows are redone. His performance was not convincing. He was not as good as he expected. Tim Roth is cool as always here. The gammy thing did not exactly hold the original story I do not think. I suppose the best part of the movie was the end. She had some cool action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This is not so long, but sometimes it's boring. I remember a while ago when Valmart had this movie really cheap for sale and I always wondered why? Now I know. I was hoping to blow myself up, but I did not.
