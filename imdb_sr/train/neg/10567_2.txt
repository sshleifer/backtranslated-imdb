I thought this film looked like a case study on how to avoid making a movie in most cases. Since I am the director of the film, I give him 2 for consistency. The problems remain from the beginning to the end, and the action is extremely predictable using parts of the majority, if not all of the previous successful war stories. Computer-generated graphics were exaggerated as watching video games in dots and it seemed that the director did not try to add a little realistic quality to the story. I am interested in the budget to get an idea of ​​what it must do, but I did not find that information. a production that pulls the viewer together with a story, and their imagination is not engaged. The actors were not bad, but the plot requires more innovation.
