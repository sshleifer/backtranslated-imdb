I discovered this film on the IFC, and I thought it would be interesting. For "tiny" love stories, some of the stories really took place in this movie. The fact that none of these women had names almost makes you doubt that actresses have been talking about their real sex life, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Vitt. I have to admit, I want to start seeing some more romantic views of the first sexual encounters, as in "Strike!" "Some might think that re-enviations and memories will improve this film. I think things would get worse. It does not have to be hardcore pornography to get my attention, but somehow I just expected more.
