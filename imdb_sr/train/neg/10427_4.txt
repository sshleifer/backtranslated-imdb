Well, they say lymphomania leaves you unhappy. I do not know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she is certainly in sexual intercourse with men. She continues to explore, tries to find "more data" so she can see what she wants from life and men in her, although she seems to have a pretty good idea in her age so far. (I can not agree, however, with anyone who says that the Young is too old for the role. If so, we should get so aggressive.) For the most part, this film has left me cold, although it's not the worst of my type you'll ever see. And unlike the recent 'Eyes wide-closed', at least something happens in this.
