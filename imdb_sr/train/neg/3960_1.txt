Hi, maybe because I'm not a theater master or a sophisticated film guard ... I think this film is "boring" and "stupid". This film I rented for Charles Bronson and the title ... but boy what a waste of time ... I'm just looking at the two guys sitting in the vault and talking ... <br /> <br /> on this DVD was so "dark" ... It's hard to watch the movie "Darn" ... I realize it's a 1968 movie ... but it's put on DVD then some digital remastering should be done. Also, I was completely surprised to see these high ratings on the IMDb for this movie ... as I said before I'm not sophisticated like other people who commented on this movie before.
