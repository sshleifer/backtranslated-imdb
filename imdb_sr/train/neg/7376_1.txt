Steven, what have you done, you hit everything new. It's strange because Steven's last film senator was directed by the same director who did this garbage. The man in the shadows was good, it was devilishly bad, so bad that he was not even funny Stephen is barely in the movie and feels as if he is in the Kamay show and is in the movie, he was already called halfway. As for the action, let's just say that the magician from the Oz had more action than this garbage, because there is hardly any action in the movie, and when it finally arrives, it's a bored depressingly bad recording of the so-called action scenes. Seagal barely kills anyone, unlike his films in which he plays the army of one man, i.e. Under siege 1 and 2 and outbreaks. the shop is so confusing with so many holes for works that it sometimes does not make a scene. anger is better to be good what kind of damage I lost 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten better luck next time
