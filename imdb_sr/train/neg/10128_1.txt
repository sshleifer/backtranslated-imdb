he was my hero for all time until he left with {if you can call him a movie} I went to the show to watch it and get out and not only I'm looking for money back, but I'm looking for double money that is so bad a hero and the thing is a hole was ............. I can not believe that Steven Segala's career hit so low that he was reduced to making fourth-rate films with five secondary actors. I watched him move, expecting to see him blind to some people in the way he usually does. When it is reduced to the use of one judo piece between the blades to pull out the opponent, and the man falls as a brick tone, something is wrong. The action is amazing as a movie, and even for a movie if you apologize for the visions and read this story as a novel, you wondered why you even picked up the book. Steven Segal goes through suggestions and seems to be just because he is required. It does not show effort and enthusiasm, and in some cases it does not appear at all. I hate to repeat the comments of other people, but the use of shots for scene scenes and for visual shows flights are pathetic. The state of those scenes that are fragmented is clumsy and the scenes themselves have deteriorated over time. A film of a clipper that shows President John F. Kennedy's murder killed is more stable and cleaner. My sincere opinion is to tell you not to waste time watching this movie, it is not in accordance with the standards of his work in a glittering man or outbreak. I read a review saying that the film had a budget of $ 12 million (Segal paid 5 of that amount) and that the film was still in the budget. I have to agree. No wonder this is a film that is directly transmitted to DVD, as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie.
