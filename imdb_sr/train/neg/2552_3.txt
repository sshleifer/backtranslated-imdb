This is documented, not, it was shot as a documentary, but I guess it's just because they got out of shaking camera and touch. This was just published in the UK on DVD as "American-style pie" comedy, but it's not even that. and with a quest to get there, a friend finally laid it down. Throw a few dwarfs, also on the same type of search and you have an unusual story about drunken teens trying to reach girls. Considering the 18 grade, this has very little nudity, practically zero sex scenes, I generally assume that the rating for curses is enough. If you love the rough behavior of Jackass without humor, then this can be your thing, if you have any brain cells left then I would probably have avoided this!
