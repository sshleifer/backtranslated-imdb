Alicia Silverstone (pre- "Clueless") plays a modern teenage crime obsessed with trying to solve the brutal murder of a local girlfriend. Pat Verducci has written and directed this B-film, which is not particularly well-made, but is surprisingly serious in terms of its leading character. Silverstone is attractive and successful in making an interesting young woman here, despite the fact that it is a kitschy underestimation of the image. Support (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Boven) is not bad, although violence in the last act is exaggerating. Not an infertile camp fest, but nothing particularly memorable. * 1/2 of ****
