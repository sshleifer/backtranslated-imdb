Okay, if you saw the Ring, you basically saw Grudge. He tries to be scary by having only a strange work with the camera and loud noises, but that does not work. The plot, if you can call it, is weak and quite full of holes, for example, how would the care center know that Yoko did not appear at work when people who lived in the house were not there? And it's not clear what the character of Bill Pullman had to do with anything. He just got somewhere out of nowhere to upgrade the plot. It did not make much sense what happened to the original family. Who hung in the room, little boy or dad? Is Yoko alive or dead when he found her? There were too many questions unanswered and it was too boring to think about it more.
