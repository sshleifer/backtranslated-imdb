This was a great idea and the landscape was nice, but it ends there. It looked like Set Set Off was absent with the West. The action did not make sense. There were so many characters and there was not enough time to develop their personality. There were too many unnecessary things that were going on, which did not relate to the plot, nor did it help to keep the story going. There were also long empty moments in which the plot could be researched, but it was used for silence or unnecessary conversations. The scenario should have more sense than directing. I had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie. But in my opinion, the casting was excellent. If you're just looking for sweets, then this is a movie for you.
