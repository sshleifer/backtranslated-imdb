A recently published letter from a woman who claims to have a military background contains a comment "Women's life is not worth more than a man." This mantra politically correct is not true as the history as well as biologists shov. The societies managed to recover from the huge losses of their male population, sometimes at an astonishing speed. Germany was ready to fight for another war in 1939, despite the 1914-1918 war, in which more than two million of its men were killed. In the war of the triple alliance of South America (1865), Paraguay took over the three neighboring countries until it almost completely erased the entire male population, but fought for the stalemate in the Chac war in 1932 against a much larger Bolivia. No society, however, was or could not survive the loss of its female population. Only when it comes to the life of a nation, women are sent to fight. Israel faced this situation in 1948, but since then it has never considered combat units to defend its forces despite the popular image of an Israeli soldier. "G.I. Jane" is Hollywood hair.
