Oh my God. I decided to go to the movies with some friends, wanting to watch one of those gentle, good Christmas films, and I went awry. The movie failed. Point. Paul Giamatti, which I consider a good actor, played his character and went horribly, along with Vince Vaughn who has always been my favorite favorite. They are trying to turn the Christmas movie into a new style. Somehow bad, mixed with good, but everything turned out to be very wrong. It was not so bad for the first ten minutes, but when we saw Santa, it was over. It was not better, the rate remained the same, there was no development of character, and certainly one of the worst Christmas films ever invented. Do not look at it, whatever you do.
