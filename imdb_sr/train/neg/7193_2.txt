I had absolutely nothing to do last weekend, and tagged with my friends to watch a movie ... any movie. And since the only movie we did not see was Inspector Gadget, we decided to get into it. This is a movie that can attract only children. Oh, it's not that I do not enjoy movies directed at a younger audience. But this film did not have absolutely anything for my attention. If you do not have anything to do at home, go to bed. Better than spending hard-earned money on this. Go see the movie if you are a child or if you are a parent with a child :)
