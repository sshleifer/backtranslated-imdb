Why I spent 1.5 hours of my life watching this? Why is this film made? Why am I even commenting on this movie? One reviewer said that this film was patient to watch and that it was not for everyone. I can not figure out who this film is. maybe after he gave up the acid attack, SOME, YOU CAN SEE AND REALIZE. It's incoherent, it's not experimental, it's easy and simple trash. The film does not follow the plot line, only when you think you have something, so ... you do not know. I think the ending has brought the finalization of the film (without bored intentions), the viewer gets a glimpse of what might have happened. I do not think I put a spoiler here, not that it matters. This film is another one that should not be missed in the film world.
