He made an unfortunate mistake watching this film at Edinburgh Film Festival. It was well recorded from the very beginning, but this is the last positive comment I have about the film. The acting was terrible, I wonder if the real gogo girls were hired? But the plot that was really funny was actually ridiculous, and not boring is the only reason I gave this 3/10. ** Spoilers below **. I just want to mention some of the scenes that really forced the audience to laugh: bad. A real eye opener. Entering the bus scene: a girl enters the bus. But, according to music, the world ends. Rolling below the clothing line: Wow, this really shows the skills of the writer of the shop. In the room, followed by raw meat and selling skills. Why would not she force her to carry out all three "sins"? At least the film could be a bit shorter. Run down the stairs of a shopping center: watch one of the girls fly down the stairs that lead the meat that eats Dau, without waiting. she * just walks fast trying not to break her nails. Blood-Running Run: This is definitely my favorite scene and the fitting end of the movie. A half-marathon in red, finished crossing the stairs and across the bridge, only to be unrealisticly sent by a passing car. Not only that, but the suicidal girl in the movie takes over, and now this is true for you. old and their friends. Unfortunately, since we got to know the director at the presentation, this is not the case. But if you are in a sarcastic mood, and you like the laugh with a few friends ... then do not even think about it yet.
