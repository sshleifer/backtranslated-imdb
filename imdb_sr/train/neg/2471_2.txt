I remember when I was young when I was in the camp and camped under the stars. There was always someone there who would have a good story to tell that there were forests that surrounded us and that they would always be cursing me. Well, when I found Vendigo at the library, I checked in the hope that I would be one of those films that had a supernatural being that haunted people in the woods like stories told at the camp. Well, to my great anxiety, I was so far from the truth. Vendigo is really bad. The story begins when a triple family drives into its winter cabin, which resembles your usual suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods, and encounters a deer. Well, it seems that local Redneck actually hunted this deer and are quite upset about our city people. The film spends too much time following the everyday activities of the family, instead of reaching the point of the film. In the last 15 minutes, we have something that includes "vendigo". My suggestion is to stay very far from this movie. They'll let you want an hour and a half back.
