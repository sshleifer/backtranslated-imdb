This is one of the worst things that ever came out of England, so it's a lot of talk. The tension when we need to find out if Lembach stays or not is incredible. She looks upside down by the beautiful secretary Sheila in the underwear for the picnic table, after being caught by Dr. Rat Face. This film has some views of London, although none of them is good. There is also a point where almost one car accident that returns your pulse to normal. There is also a watch that is teleported, and the fear of a woman who does not return the clock is parallel with the horror of the "Sixth sense" that is just a lot of tupi and the British. Add on a fierce battle of pistols between the British police and Doctor Rat, which results in nothing, plus the electric shock of many people, plus the cat and you have ... ummm ... British movie. The MST3K version is pretty good although not one of the best.
