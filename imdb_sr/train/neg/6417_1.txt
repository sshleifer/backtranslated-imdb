How comments such as those that were the title of high school even succeed on this site, this was the dumbest movie I've ever seen, it was funny how any moron can sit there and say that just because the movie makes you jump to it's a good movie, it could be the most deceptive thing I've ever heard, I could sneak behind you and go "Boo" and it will make you jump, but that does not mean that I'm qualified to write or direct a movie, not to mention "They all tied together in the end" is not a good reason for the film to be good for the price. What kind of movie would it be if you did not connect everything, I guess it would be half the film, not the whole movie. So, in essence, this idiotic girl boasts them for completing the film, so I like how young people today keep the media and production companies at such a high level. No wonder the political system of this country can be pulled out with everything they want, we have such idiots as they come to our country, what would happen if this girl does really finish something that one day, it's a scary thought. Experience life and watch a real movie once, try Shavshank Redemption or Na rivi, or something like that, and do not comment that it's "boring" after you see it, just use the little brain that God gave you to analyze that little bit.
