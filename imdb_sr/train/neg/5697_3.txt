This is the most basic type of traditional ghost story, which has not even been largely revived by the use of Irish sites. That the great M.R. James has ever come to this thin story - does not James actually have a story called "Thin Ghost"? - I would not make any effort to publish it. Orson Wells appears in the cramped sleeves as a service for old friends, producers of this film. His presence and film industry in the joke would earn this Oscar nomination. This is yet another proof, if necessary, that the Academy's awards were never a guarantee of merit.
