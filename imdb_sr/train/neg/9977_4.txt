This kid is pretty bad, but in no way does it make him a type that outgrows adults and can distort experienced thieves at every step. No, he's not that bitch because he's a kid with serious emotional problems. A loving couple who wants to be adopted is quite elated to adopt him, and while his husband is a little more willing to give this child a chance, his mother is not. Through the bizarre figure of Michael Richards and the always boring Gilbert Gottfried and you have a pretty bad movie with a few laughs in it and there. In fact, I prefer the continuation of this film because I like the fact that Ami Iasbeck has returned as a different character, because there are one to many characters in this film that are completely inconspicuous. Even the boy is, in the first instance, quite boring in this, and they cooled him down a bit. The action is simple enough, although since the future parents are going to adopt that child who thinks that the great way in which the orphanage throws out the party as they leave, they soon realize that they are also a little brave. Add that this little hell comes into contact with some sort of prisoner. I'm not sure about this character, first I thought it was his real father or something. Not so good, but I will choose this in front of Culkin's kid any day of the week.
