Nut case kills students, can a new teacher stop madness?! Believe me, you will not care. Find out that this movie is simply not high art. But worse than that Splatter University does not qualify even for ridiculous garbage. The Splatter U is so badly made - the story is meaningless, the characters are discarded, and the whole movie does not have the essence of imagination. Needless to say there is no tension or atmosphere or fear. This move is not even brave enough to insert any nudity (for the cheapest excitement of all). So, everywhere around this endlessly bad slasher is not offered anything in the way of fun (even a cheap laugh) and only becomes a complete boredom. The bottom of the barrel - even fans of slasher who want to think twice before watching, let alone pay for this movie. BOMBA outside ****
