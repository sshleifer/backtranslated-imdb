All the funny things that happen in this sitcom are based on the fact that the main character is Jim or a bad father, a bad husband or generally enormously selfish. How can that be funny? Of course, the character in the sitcom must be wrong, but Jim's character is wrong in an extremely impolitical way. And why this? I guess that's because "now it needs better". Jim is not stupid, he can take care of things and has the opportunity to do it. But he decides it does not work. It is a conscious choice, when it decides not to play with its children, it does not go shopping, because it does not want to buy "ladies" and that is the choice it makes when dropping its relatives. Other characters seem to be just in the series so Jim can have someone to whom it will be a jerk. If Cheril's character was a real person, she would have left him many years ago, and would not stay with the dead for eight years. But, unfortunately, she is just a catalyst for Jim's weird extreme selfishness of the middle class.
