This film starts slowly and then narrows. After I watched for about an hour and saw that nothing was happening, I went out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Hope. No story. The characters are vague images of the boring people that any of us know. The producers of this film could be sued in court if they try to sell it as a "mobile" image. No movement. I could tell the same "story" with a few photo labels. The script is a joke. It's horrible. I doubt any doctor in the world could save him. My biggest regret is not that I lost 60 minutes of my life watching "Love in Time of Money," but I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to come out, but I waited too long. Instead, I watched about 20 people coming out before me.
