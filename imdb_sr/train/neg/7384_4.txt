STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning Marshall Lavson (Steven Seagal) is assigned to France on a recovery mission together with three new recruits of young strike teams after disobedience with a direct order from above. However, the night before the strike, all found grusomels killed by the killer with apparently inhuman force. When the French police are undergoing an investigation, he goes to search for the person responsible, only to discover a corrupt fraction of the army dealing with a deadly new drug that changes DNA and gives them a scary new force. > Bad cover. Bad address. Poor post-production interference. And a bad trailer. Pretty bad movie. But, I must say, I do not think Attack Force is his worst. I know it will make me unpopular with most of the other reviewers here (maybe not Steveday!), But I think a lot of criticism came from all the bad news that went before the movie, not the real quality of the film itself. Br /> I must say that there was nowhere near as much of the duplication or editing of the rope as I believed. It was shooting (why he sounded like Martin Sheen with the problem of a groin!) He was pretty scary and fairly common, but he was not used for such a big segment of the film as I thought. The action went pretty smoothly, bearing in mind all the confusion with the original finished movie called Harvester, which continued. Also, as the other reviewer noticed, the film has a nice Gothic look, a new touch for the Seagal movie. Absolute low point of killing was the complete and complete absence of any exciting action. , with only a few badly recorded battle scenes for any fun. I need to be honest, though, I'd rather watch this again from Flight of Fury, today you die or go out for murder. **
