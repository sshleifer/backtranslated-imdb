Okay, when I looked at the performances for this movie, I thought it was really scary and I was very excited to see him as the group I was with. Now I live in America, especially during these elections, I see some very scandalous things, but I must say that those reviews were at the top of the list. I do not see how many people can be scared of this movie. I just noticed two real jumps of the scene and I just jumped on one. The whole movie was extremely predictable and maybe it was for me some jump of the scene. As far as the sound effects are concerned, they were so frightened so much that I was at best a comic. Oh and uhh catboi where did this come from and why? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be a weird lust. How is it afraid of someone? I can easily make that noise. Do not get me wrong. I've always loved all those bad, bad scary movies that you just laughed the whole way, but I did not even think that this one was for it that it was simply bad.
