The abbreviation "F.P.1" means "Floating Platform # 1". The film transmits the building "F.P.1" in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which will be used as an "air station" for transatlantic flights. Based on the contemporary novel Curt Siodmark; It was filmed in German as "F.P.1 antvortet nicht" (1932), in French as "I.F.1 no repond plus" (1933), and in English as "F.P.1" (1933) . Soon technology has made non-stop ocean travel much more desirable. Stars Conrad Veidt (like Ellissen), Jill Esmond (as Droste) and Leslie Fenton (as Claire) find love and sabotage at the Atlantic platform. Karl Hartl directed. Veidt is the funniest to watch; but, he is not convinced in the "love triangle" with Ms. Esmond and Mr. Fenton. The younger co-stars were spouses Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak. Both the concept and the film did not grow old. **** F.P.1 (4/3/33) Karl Hartl ~ Conrad Veidt, Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton
