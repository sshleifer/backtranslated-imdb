You can not sleep that night. I got up, turned the tube and this movie was turned on. Film makers bite more than they could. It was equally ambitious in scope as well as "Forrest Gump". But Gump was reading as a fairy tale in which an extraordinarily happy man leads us through time. TGMB only relies on tired clich√©s to tell the story. Almost like Broadway musical where actors have to stab him. The purpose of each character was to fill the archetype of the stupid 60s. Take on how we are familiar with Finnegan: Hugging your black maid and receiving a framed MLK image. Criminei, talk about heavy hands. Why do not you just give him a shirt with the inscription "I Heart Black People"? Sunshine: "Is not the free love groove, man? Oh no, I did not have my period." Maria Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not to UCLA." Uh, sorry? In the 1960s, there was nothing square in LA. Instead of taking the time to show what made Berkeley unique, we just hear how the scream screams not to go there. I can not even remember the name of a black kid. He was just a propeller that he used to show how racially tolerant the other kids were. The thing is, the pieces from the period do not have to be that kind of. Take "Dazed & Confused". See how we're familiar with the football hero, Randall Floyd. We do not see him first on the soccer field. In fact, we never see him playing football. We met him in class, inviting his nerd poker friends to a party. In the "stunned" feminism is not an accidental by-product of a chicken that has been picked up. It's much more organic, more serious than that. She is sophisticated in a woman's room through a flip discussion on Gilligan's Island. Serious ideas can grow in the most common settings. But the real life is like that. Some of the warm comments here indicate that the topics in this film are still relevant. I agree! That's why I feel so disappointed with this piece of pornography Babi-Boomer.
