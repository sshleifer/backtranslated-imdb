What did Franco Zeffirelli mean? Was Hollywood responsible for this travesty, or can I be comforted by the idea that someone who did not speak English as the first language completely missed the meaning of the classics of Charlotte Bronte? I think I can not improve the comment I read below, so I will only paraphrase it: "Jane Eire is a great big book, the scriptwriter should have read it sometime." It is true that the two films of this film are unfortunately wrong. But they reduced the actors, because the scriptwriter omitted all the best scenes. A dialogue that suggests that you understand Jane and Rochester have a meeting of minds and a common sense of entertainment ... deleted from the script. Proposal for marriage, guitar ... disappeared. Allusions, half jokes, half honestly, Jane as a villa from old England came to save Rochester in her despair ... eliminated. the end of the novel and Jane's interaction with the Rivers family. But it is inexcusable that the surgical removal of love from one of the best love stories ever written.
