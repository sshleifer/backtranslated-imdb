I usually support independent art and I try to be very comprehensive and tolerant ... harder to support everyone, because their efforts are worth ... But this film just goes away from every understanding and tolerance of constraints! Imagine the following situation: 1. Consider the REALLY VORST film horror that you have ever seen in your life. 2. Think about some great, attractive ART for DVD box of this movie ... and a promising story ... 3. Voila! you have ZOMBIE NATION. See only if you really do not have anything else to do. It's all better.
