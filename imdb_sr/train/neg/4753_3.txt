Директор Ф.В. Murnau was wisely stuck in a quiet film medium that he knew well to cover this story of the natural island life in the southern seas. Documentary style works well in the first half of the film. Landscapes are beautiful, and everyday life activities of the islanders are interesting for observation. Still, the film loses momentum when it begins to concentrate on the narrative story of two convicted lover. The story just does not get so interesting, despite Murnau's good handshake. He won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, although the award was probably supposed to be for the best landscape. You can not really confess to the DP recording at such a great location.
