For my life, I can not understand why they would want to make a movie about Jerry Springer Shovu. It's so tricky. In a way, unfortunately, it's a pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I recently saw this in the US. It's pretty bad. I will admit it. Jerry makes a terrible job of what I think he meant as an act. Or something similar. Jamie Pressley's in it. It plays basically. She needed only her mistress, Kid Rock. Then it would be perfect. So I would recommend skipping "Ringmaster". Just watch "Shov Jerry Springer". It's more pleasant than this. 2/10
