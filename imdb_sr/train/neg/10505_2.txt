If you liked "Blair with", you'll love this one. It has the same bad work with the camera and sound, and has the same non-existent complications and uncertain moments. Tarantino and Rodriguez '' From Dusk Till Dawn ''. He is an icon and a very good actor. No, seriously. This film is definitely the worst movie I've been watching for a long time, and I've seen a lot of movies - bad ones. I can tell you that most horror films enjoy in some way, but this is just a waste of time. and hot action with all sharp plastic teeth ... No, I'm just kidding. I must have missed it before I hit the "form for voting". Hold on, though there are sexy girls with teeth on the covers!
