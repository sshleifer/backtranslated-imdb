that's incredible! Fidani (who was also a priest) was one of the cheapest directors of the whole world. This film stole the original title of Leone's "Duck and Sucker!" but tell the boring story of agent Pinkerton against the killer "Testa di Ferro" (incredible Gordon Mitchell, stuntman). Everything is poor and crazy in this pelicula shot in the lazy landscapes of Lazio. The story is both bad and crazy at the same time. Fidani was not able to ingenuos at the same time. There was some sort of crazy illogical things in the story (such as the discussion in Sheriff's House and the demeanor-like look of Butch Cassidy!?!?!?!?!? Yes, really Butch Cassidi, portrayed as an idiot). Terribles nuit americaine, absurd attachments, illogical plot, bad acting and fugue look of one of the most talented tales of Italian television, Renzo Arbore. Ah, of course: Klaus Kinski. That it is awesome and terrible, but I'm sure he was in it just because of money for playing with iron horses) 2 out of 10 but ... DO NOT WRIST !!!
