Charlotte's deadly beauty and deadly punches make the film cooler than it would otherwise be. The story is so poor and Charlotte's character dies in such a dumb way, wondering if this is the end they thought of this movie. I wish someone could say that there is an alternative end, but I'm afraid not. Regarding the rest of the cst, I would say that they simply did not act well; although the guilt should have been put on the poor script. This film reminds me of Rush Hour 2 where Zhang Ziii dies in an absurd way, because she was the only one who stole the show throughout the film. I could give this movie 2/5
