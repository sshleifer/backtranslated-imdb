This was a blind DVD purchased. He completely killed the good buzz I had when I played. It's comedy with bubbles, but it's mind. skualid. The plot is ZANI! But the characters do things to each other so small and upset and appropriately fictitious that I finally conclude that it's depressing to watch. Maybe the box led me to expect something more than an uneven, silly movie. (I know, I know, the quotes on the box and the Oscar nomination do not mean anything.)
