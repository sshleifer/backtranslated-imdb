Lindsay Anderson was a big European film maker, while David Lean, Ridlei Scott and Alan Parker made spectacular films that include Visson's Anderson movies. through the whole movie whose primary function is to entertain the audience What you think of IF is reduced to what you think about British filmmakers. I think that the cinema should be a universal medium (the best Brit film is the one that tries to imitate Hollivood in my opinion), if you want to send a message, try to pony ekpress, and I think the film is dated, pretentious and too set in the sixties. In 1968 there was a year of love and years of student rebellion in France. You can only imagine every French leftist who loves this movie, especially the highlight. French filmmakers of new waves will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes, but the international mainstream will reject it, and many will like it very much.
