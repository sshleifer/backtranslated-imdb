The first time I enjoyed the Apprentice. But now with Season 5? (or is it 6?) things get simply too fatigued. I once liked the performance, but it became Donald Trumps's own ego fest. I gave him my company for which you will work, but come on! Some things say that you "shot" is just an insult. After watching the show, I would not want to work for him. not because it's arrogant, pompous, or such. It's just that the performance is unrealistic and the way in which it manages things, it seems to me to be merry. Good Entertainment? YES, but as strenuous as the back flank becomes so arduous ... his non-teamwork is not his personal, only business. Watch out for the rear outlet.
