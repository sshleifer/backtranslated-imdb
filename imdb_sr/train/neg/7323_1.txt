Well, unlike previously written comments, I must say that the only good thing about this movie is the fact that one guy in it looked like Jason Donavon who reminded me of my youth. I have no idea how she got any awards, and although I'm sure a lot of effort was made to make it, everything was unsuccessful because the final outcome is the one screaming by the side of the soap opera in the early nineties. The action did not exist, the cinema was hopeless and the performance was at the level of performance at the level. Unfortunately, it was long and the sub-parcels were incredibly unrealistic .... for example ... if your best friend slept with your ex-boyfriend of 6 years after only two weeks after you were disbanded, you would not all other best friends. It was all fantasy. That is all! Oh ieah, and the odd 90's house / soft core indie is um numbing!
