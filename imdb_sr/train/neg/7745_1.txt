Where to start? special effects should be called special defects, when the director shouted "action", I guess he also told the actors to perform the worst performances they could remember. Maybe he was upset with the producers and wanted to ensure that they would not recover a single cent from their investments and that the work would be a case study on how not to make a movie. Or maybe he hated an art school and wanted to be an accountant, but his family did not let him. The only thing that is certain that anyone who employs him in the future is because he is in love with him (so his objectivity jumped out of the window) or because he changed his name and deleted all previous previous references.
