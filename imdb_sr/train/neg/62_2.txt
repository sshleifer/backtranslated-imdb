SVING! is an important movie because it is one of the remaining films from the 1930s. Many of these films have just made it worse that they are invisible, but this one is in pretty good shape. It is also a good opportunity to see many of the talented black performers of that period right after the climax of the old Cotton Club - a time now almost forgotten. Unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has some wonderful performances, it is also a mess. The main story is very similar to Hollywood musicals of that time - including a primadone that will ruin the performance and surprise of an unknown one that comes from where they will save the day. However, writing is sometimes divinely and somewhat untidy - and it designs images of black America to make some people a little humiliating. This is because before the plot begins, it is treated by an untrained bum which lives from its strenuous woman (a popular stereotype of time) and when caught with hussi (which, incidentally, completely overcomes this role), they have a struggle that It looks like a scene from VVE Smackdown! And, a lady wants to cut out another lady with a flat razor - indeed! Later in the film, when the primordial behaves disgustingly, her husband is struck in the face and everyone is crying! It seems that the movie, sometimes, wants to address the lowest common denominator in the audience, PLUS can not even do it well - with some of the worst performances I've seen in a very long time. However, if you can look at the past bad production in almost every way (with stinky characters, bad acting and direction and bad writing), this can be worth rubbing so that you can see excellent singing and dancing dance - as well we see the forgotten black culture. Just do not say I did not warn you about the acting - it's really, really bad!
