The truth is that a film based on the novel Harold Robbins will not win any awards. This is no exception. "Loneli Ladi" is pure B pictures in the budget, acting and performance. Technically, it looks like a movie made for TV. The operation is very uneven. Joseph Cali is particularly awesome. Anthony Holland is a shame. As one reviewer said about a certain performance by Katherine Hepburn, her range ranges from A to B. Mrs. Zedora manages to reach G. The rest of the actors are solid (and are lost in their roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserved better. However, the whole thing can be very fun in some way. As Robbins approaches, everything revolves around sex and nudity. If you are looking for some fun ... and you are not too sober ... this could be for you.
