I saw this movie when it was first released. Recollection of how bad it was left for me for almost forty years. I did not want to believe my own feelings about the movie when I saw it, so I consulted a movie review published in the city's main newspapers, he confirmed the next day, the reviewer wrote that the film was incoherent, incomprehensible and unkind. A little research reveals that the producer was the wife of the star Leslie Caron, so the smell of nepotism suggests the beginning of this horrible movie. The list of films by many capable actors - Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Glorie Graham and James Sikking suggest, among other things, that it promises. But the death of this film can be attributed to his terrible scenario. The "Mystery" implied is so vague and so little revealed in the film that the viewer has remained confused from scene to scene. The film seems to be separated between a detective mystery and a spy thriller, but it never settles down. The feeling of uncertainty is completely absent. The main characters keep on playing dry, senseless guys in a way that does not cause any empathy. Cinema is a pedestrian. The result is that an unhappy viewer loses interest in characters, plot, and, finally, for the film itself. I'm a little surprised that there is no version of this pathetic movie to buy. I hope that if the TCM finds the imprint of this film and feels compelled to broadcast it, it is surely brought to 4:00 am slot.
