This can sound crazy even to people who remember these performances ... But I remember it's a live action. I do not think I've ever seen a cartoon. or a movie? Maybe. I remember clearly. The guy was in the building somehow like a salon. He even had a red jacket. It was dark and he turned into a red car and there was that guy on the other level who looked at him. The car / tip turned and broke through the big window of the shovroom type and walked out onto the street. And then he continued to untie. That's all I can remember. I really hope that others remember it too. If not, maybe I'm still crazy. But I hope I'm not.
