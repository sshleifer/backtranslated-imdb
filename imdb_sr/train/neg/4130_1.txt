The top candidate for the worst movie ever made. It seems that the character Joanna Pakula has I.K. of 3, which is only one smaller than the writer and director. The script would not go through high school hours; "jokes" are minors; concept of corn. These performers are obviously desperate for the job. I stayed to the end just to see if it would get worse. Yes. Life is too short to spend any part of watching this movie.
