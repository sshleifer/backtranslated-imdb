This film is nothing more than a religious trait that promotes classical Hinduism and a new era of occultism dressed with Western images swallowed by those who do not know about fundamental religious comparisons. The basic tenants of Hinduism contain elements of reincarnation. (Some characters appear in the present and in the 1600s) are obviously reincarnated. God is an impersonal force. Animal life and plant life are the same. (This is paneism). Redfield tried to mix eastern mysticism with Western Christians. His attempt at syncretism can deceive or confuse those who do not seek the truth, but this film is a bad excuse for any ultimate reality. As an ad from Berkeley Barb earlier spoke for $ 10.00, it will show you how to start your own religion. As one well-known prophet said: "Use force Luke".
