I really do not understand how people shot this movie and thought it was worth anything they invested in him. Even more confusing are those who watched this movie without the feeling that they were cheated for 88 minutes to do something valuable such as cleaning under the couch or reading the Leviticus. First, they could surely find the right Irish, and some pretty women who could fill their lines better than the washed, exhausted porn stars that sprayed through this movie. But, up above - but strange, it's not as worrying as you can think of seeing organs drawn from the hot (earlier) narrow bodies of the left and right porn stars. Probably has something to do with the fact that after their terrible inhuman behavior you just want to die of pain. So, if you do not care about the following: - Acting (seriously, everyone's sucking. I've never seen it before, all of them were sucked in). -Plot (some shitty horror films are distant linear, or at least surprisingly, the movie makes no sense unless you're as ruined as the writers obviously were). - The theme (Nothing can be learned from this movie. Nothing is scared in bed at night, nothing that might think or understand, or explain to others). - Soundtrack (crap, shit, shit. Music as plain and boring as a script). - Scenario (There could be savings in this movie, but no ... nothing is comfortable here. Even the rocks are fake). So, yes. If you do not care about it, and you are just an angry teenager with a bad taste in music and "women," this movie is for you. Positive comments: Interesting cinema occasionally, wasted on other elements. Very realistic up; again, lost. But the intestine is classical. I agree with the mutant-disembovelment solves the false accent problem.
