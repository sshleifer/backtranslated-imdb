I thought you might have to watch a movie that boasted actors, including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrevs. But, I made a mistake. Totally pretentious nonsense from start to finish, both O'Toole and York have acted wildly. I watched him twice and I still have no idea what this is about. I have the feeling that O'Tool plays Laird Scottish mansion with drinking problems and likes to reunite childhood games with his sister (York). He also barks. But in addition, your assumption is as good as mine. The film has no feature for the purchase. I can only assume that actors and directors were blackmailed to make this gloomy, non-aggressive, twisted ass. It is clear that this is the search for a talented actor and director. Risible.
