I am a great, great fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shalhouba. I care less about Stephen King, but I love some of his works. It was said, I needed PEOPLE 1408. *** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER POINT **** I walked eagerly. I went out disappointed. This is not an actor's fault. Shalhoub and Jackson have very small roles because the premise of the film brings Cusack into the "type in a locked room" scenario. This was not a bad movie, but I can not call it good. It was a messy mess that had moments "I, it's just wrong", combined with the moments "ouch, it's just painful," and the moments "oh, now it's just unhappy" with very little continuity-the connection between them . Eisen's father appears once, and there is no apparent connection with the rest of Mike's private life that appears while trying to survive the room. The previous commentator described the argument of Olin / Enslin as worth watching, and I very strongly agree. But in addition, apart from some smart musical characters (Enslin's room is almost playful, and gives him a chance to get out before he raises an ante ... at that moment gives him an hour countdown and a titular line of carpenters. "We've just started. ") It's mostly" stuff jumps at you when you least expect it! " a type of horror that was fun when I was fourteen, surrounded by friends of my age, holding each other in the summer as Jason lurking at Camp Cristal Lake. The rest of the film was "let it revive it, its painful experiences" mindgaming "," animate the pictures in the nasty ways of the clich√© cheese. "****** END SPOILERA ***** Expected better than this film with the name of Stephen King, as well as the actors I mentioned above. We never reveal the origin of evil. We never see it that evil was defeated, although we can assume that it was defeated. And the end was just sighing "What?!" moment. Wait until it comes to the cable. I did not want to pay it as a matinee, but with I feel a little worn out because I paid the price for opening.
