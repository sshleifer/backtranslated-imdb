I can not believe that the film carries this movie. It was SO BAD. I was totally cheated by the art bok. DON'T BE FOOLED !! It's not worth your time, I promise you. I do not know whether positive reviews for this film were a joke or what. I'm so disappointed. :( Description on the back of the box does not match! The girl who has a voodoo on her is a stripper, and the synopsis on the back says she is only 17. People who write the description of the film even try to make it Those positive comments had to be a joke they had to be. If anyone really loved this film, then I lost all faith in humanity. And do not even start with a story in relation to the title, or the fact that it is a whole film taken at 2 locations, or that police officers did not even have the proper uniforms. Who cares about the uniform of police officers? Compared to Statku film, the uniforms were visible. <br /> <br /> This film is an insult to the zombie genre and all its fans.
