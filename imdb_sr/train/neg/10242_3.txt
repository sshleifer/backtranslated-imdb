This film was made by a bunch of whites who went to school together. There is nothing wrong with it, except that it looks like a bunch of white boys who went to school together. 90% of actors are white men of the same age. It's almost as if I watch a crowd of guys in a camp of guys who turned the camera on themselves. The film does not have a plot. Simply repeats the same action of the blood bath after bathing. There are some funny scenes and comedy. But they do not buy a flat monotony. Graphic scenes from cartoons are used to cover things that were obviously beyond their budget or resources for it, which was not good. All that can not be done with the white guys running around the beach covered with blood is done by cheap animations. I went to see this movie after I saw a trailer, which makes it look like a Tarrentino piece. Well, the scene trailers are as good as they ever got. The rest of it only repeats the same kind of earthly, meaningless comedy. It works sometimes, but it gets bored after these same things come over and over again. It's more like a series of Satudai Night Live sketches than a movie. It's kind of a comedy. I can see where the story's story is intriguing. But in this film post apocalyptic America is similar to Medeville in England. In fact, Vheatlri says that ideas about the stories came from that era. He's planning to make Part 2. I suppose he thinks Tarrentino or maybe he's parody. At the opening in LA, Vheatlei mentioned that he would bring almost the same part in the second part. They asked him if he could take into account a more diverse role in the next, to which he replied, yes, of course.
