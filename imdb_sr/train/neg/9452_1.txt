I was glad that I saw this when it was in production. But it turned out to be the biggest downhill. Far from the haunting world of Dr Seuss. It was vulgar and rude, I do not think Dr. Seus would approve. How Grinch stole Christmas was much better. As far as I understood, there were some subtle adult jokes, but my kids still need to catch them. While the Cat screamed vulgarity in the hat, they caught a lot more than I'd loved. I grew up with Dr Seuss. I hope this real Dr Seuss is right.
