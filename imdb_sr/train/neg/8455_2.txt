"Arahan" does not add anything positive Kung Fu genre. Comparing this confused film image with inspirational craziness and the quality of Steven Chow's films is a mistake. First, the fighting scenes are nothing new. Everything presented here has been done earlier and better than those Iimou Zhang, Toni Jaa and Jackie Chan. Fighting in intelligent moving images requires logic. There seems to be no point in giving blows that do not have a detrimental effect, as in the "Matrix" sequences. Ziii Zhang was so easy to work in the "House of Flying Daggers". The background of martial arts well serves Kung Fu films. Being inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake (see Aia Ueto in "Asumi"), unless you are a very talented director who, as "Arahan" proves that Seung-van Rioo is not.
