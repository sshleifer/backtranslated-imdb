Confused clutter from start to finish. As they were talking about Beatles songs, there was a secret message if you played LP backwards. If you had the patience to watch movies from the end to the beginning, you would have reached the same level of disappointment. Apart from this psychedelic undertaking of flashbacks and false starts, the clearest characters were film guards, out of revenge if the film was not sorted. Both of them did not mind. Exaggerations, shouting and threats took place in the comic strip. I think that one dimension was exaggerated. Well, maybe the types of artists went their eyes, enjoying the fact that, unlike them, we did not just get the plebeians. I'm afraid there's nothing to gain. And two cardinal sins of every bad movie from start to finish. A non-existent and pathetic story if you want to call it that way, and by far the worst, not the one that you care about.
