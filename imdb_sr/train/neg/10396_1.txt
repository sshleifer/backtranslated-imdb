As a filmmaker, and I have a slightly dark and subversive sense of humor, I thought I was ready for a treat when I took home "Mi Vrongs ..." (not that the DVD cover gives nothing, but opts for ambiguity I quote from the controversial director Chris Morris, "short film including scenes"). I should have known better, and avoid this rude (and often offensive) piece of duplicity. The scene in the church is reflective for watching (especially because we are all well aware of Morris's distorted attitude towards pedophilia from his notorious TV series, Brass Eie) and serves nothing but shocking. How this film is labeled as a comedy I will never understand. The commentary of the runner sounds like a new idea in principle (since I was a runner, it's often an interesting and unsurpassed perspective in the process of filming the film), however, this unfortunately is not the case here. Instead, we are treated by some public school pupil talking about dogs on the film, before we conclude that there are not really great movies with dogs. It's all very interesting, but not a single celluloid frame. Saying that this movie is not going anywhere, this would be an underestimation. He is too dependent on his pronounced style, at the expense of complicity, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer unusually upset and unfulfilled. His overly simplistic message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - and is obviously and poorly illustrated. The film has its moments of pseudo-Kafka Surrealism, but after all, it does not manage to convince, to entertain, to enlighten itself and just end up as irritating. If you want to see a really big piece of short film, I strongly recommend "Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life," by Peter Capalli.
