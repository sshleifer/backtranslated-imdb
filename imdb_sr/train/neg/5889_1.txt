First of all, I firmly believe that Norwegian movies are always better. From the boring emotional films of the 70's and 80's, movies from this site have actually begun to contain little humor. Imagine ... Comedy is real! Movies actually started to entertain and entertain, unlike the long, dark, depressing, and boring. Film after film was praised by critics and played a lot of money. This has become a norm! Then came United ... MINOR SPOILERS * It's just not funny. Not once. Never. But the thing is ... We think it's funny. Because we're used to Norwegian movies to be funny. Especially with actors like this with a couple of really funny comedians. But .. They do not say or do anything funny! Where is humor? Show me humor! Is it an awkward clerk played by Harald Ey? Is this a totally funny unrealistic football coach? Are these comments by Arne Scheie? The movie is simply not funny! But this is not my main speech on United. This is predictability. (And here I'm afraid that Norwegian comedy stopped because I saw it in many other films.) You only know all the time that it will end well. All the characters are exactly as they were presented at the beginning of the film, and in the end everyone gets exactly what they deserve. There is no place to surprise! All in all, I can say that I was sitting with a bad feeling after watching this movie. It was a movie that made me realize that we probably needed a new blood in a Norwegian film ... again! Rating: 1/6
