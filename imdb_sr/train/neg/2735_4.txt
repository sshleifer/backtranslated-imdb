I thought it was not the best episode of the re-cap episodes I've ever seen (although my watchlist handed me the tissue in anticipation of Brendan Fraser's moment ... * sigh). It was nice to see Coka outside the continuously fragile "Cokism State", he is these days, at least for short moments. I also enjoyed trying to include episodes on the length of the hair (or height, in the case of JD) and the youth of the earliest episodes. Can I also see how Zach could be on the right track for Chevi Chase / or is Matthews Perry? the chemical slip that caused the prat-fall (already recognized at Conan). A little note, the song (now jammed in my head) from the dance installation launched by the janitor was "Diner" by Martin Secton.
