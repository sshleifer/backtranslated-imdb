There was a cartoon "Bugs Bunny" under the name "Babi Buggi Bunny" that was FIGHT this plot. Finster looted the bank with a small face, and the money in the carriage rolled and fell into the Bug's rabbit hole. He dressed himself as a baby to enter Bugg's hole to get the money. The scene in "The Little Man" where she looks in the mirror in the bathroom by shaving cigar in her mouth is right from the cartoon. This was a hilarious 5-minute cartoon; not so much the whole movie. If you are really interested in this, buy DVD Bugs Bunny. It was much more original for the first time (1954). In addition, you will get a lot more classic cartoons about Bugs Bunnies!
