First, let me say that I'm a great fan of Ashlei Judd; so I was curious to check this, her debut role. No argument that her talent is obvious and that her performance is excellent. I suppose I can also see how professional critics loved the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that films are intended to entertain us, and that is where this film fails. By half way, I found myself thinking: "How many more have we got to look at the boring store, stand idly by an abandoned souvenir shop, rearranging goods?" It looked like it was forever! Then, I thought, maybe this is one of those films in which the director is trying to put the audience in a relaxed state before being struck by some dynamic event. No such luck. The movie continues with a gentle, boring, awkward story all the way to the end. I do not say this because I'm an action addict. I love all kinds of films, especially romantic comedies. But I expect to have some fun. Add the fact that cinema and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor's bad home movies. Depressing! I just do not understand how anyone could love this movie. The value of zero entertainment. The longest 114 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
