I rented Hybrid on the weekend. What a disappointment! The stupid lame attempt of tele-movie. The guy who got the lead was weak, and when he worked, he looked a lot like eating these sweets ... with his butt! The spear contacts he wore were great, although I feel that the actor rely too heavily on them, as there was nothing threatening in his acting at all. The wise American Indian fish must be one of the most stubborn hackers ever seen. Talk about an acid cow! She smiled once for the whole movie, and I think it was because she had sex. And the scene of sex was lame. Maybe the blowing of the curtains also showed, if you can dig it. Finally, and this is my great hatred for pets. cold sharp teeth on a guy. They could not be seen in the movie. :(
