My friend gave me this movie. My friend is now in the hospital, while a team of doctors tries to remove the DVD case from his *** from a surgical path. I stopped excited about the looks of another movie about Michael Chabon. After all of his novels gave me lots of fun and the previous adaptations of the scenarios were great, but the boy, I made a mistake. I guess the castings went like this. "Tell me, do you like a fish?" "Yes, I enjoy the fish." "Wonderful, you are employed. Have some money." Then there is a script. I read Chabon, for whom I hope he blinded himself before he could see this piece of dong, and it has nothing to do with his novel. I'm not sure why he was annoying me like he did, but that may have to do with the fact that listening to the speaker of the injured 90-year-old hunter on a drunken duck with right skull dysfunction would be fine. One-stage massacres from the 2nd degree were floating. This is the real line from the movie; "If you tell me something you've never told anyone before, then this moment becomes unique!" Unikue? Whether? Really? Of course you did not. Please, give me Imodium. I'll have a whole. The director is ... well. I have nothing. Maybe Ravson Marshall Thurber just said his grandmother had exploded or something like that. Hold on to directing comedy. Do not adhere to directing commercials. This film is so horrible that it struck me so hard against the wall that it got me back to the Stone Age. I'm giving him 2 stars because I do not want to be the guy who watched a movie with 1 star.
