This movie is totally shit! Avoid this celluloid waste at all costs, it is wandering and incoherent. I am proud to lead the depths of the seventies of the last century from everything from Salt to Salton Kitty. I like to be shocked, but I need a clear story. However, if you are watching a mate horse to take away this film is for you. The saddest part was that bloody jeweler with functional waves. I think it's easy to get through, not to mention the acting, and the sound record is badly called. Please, I know that the cover is interesting (what looks like gorilla that hands reach for a woman's naked naked) but you do not waste time and money because you will not get it back.
