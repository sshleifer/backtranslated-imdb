In the distant Galaxy, the planet is called Ceta. Her people adore cats. But the dogs of men are waging a war against these feline people who love and have no choice but to go to Earth and eat people for food. This is one of the stupidest f # @ k! Ng idea for the movie I saw. Leave this to Ted Mikels to make the film more incompetent than the already low standard set in the previous films. As if enjoying playing the Limbo celluloid game. How low can it go? The only losers in the scenario are the Americans. Mr. Mikels and his stupid mustache with the steering wheel actually have people who still buy this shit. My Rating: F DVD Extra: Ted Mickels' Comment; The story behind the creation (9 and a half); 17 minutes, 15 seconds behind the scenes; Ted Mikels filmography; and trailers for "The Vorm Eaters" "The Girl in Golden Boots", "Doll Squad", "Ten Violent Vomen" (with nudity), "Bloody Orgy of the Devils", "Corpse Grinders"
