The brides dying in front of the altar and their corpses disappear. Everyone is worried, but it seems that nobody can understand why and how it happens, nor can it prevent it from happening. Hang on with me. White Lugosi is responsible for drawing out the spinal fluid from these young women to transform her old woman and keep her alive. Continue with me. Finally, the authorities realize that one has to engineer death and disappearance, but of course, they can not understand the incredible motive. Let's ignore the absurd pseudoscience and move on ... If you can pass through the first twenty minutes of this mess, Lugoshi will treat you as a laboring assistant in the lab for disobeying one of the brides he killed, explaining that he sleeps in a suit much more comfortable than a bed and other vague parodies of real horror films (a type of budget and complications). Anihoo - a journalist follows his nose to the culprit (and unusual police are not visible!), And then the party really starts. The camera and the acting are fine. There are many well-trained, very nice people in this film. The director is fair, and the script is a bit better than the material he deserved. Still, this movie fails to maintain the interest of all, except for the strongest b-film fans. The best thing about it ... In the end it ends, but not fast enough.
