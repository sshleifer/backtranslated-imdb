Paul Naschi has made a number of horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to move from pretty good to unobtrusive rubbish; and unfortunately, Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to this. The plot is just your average story about a witch, a wizard or (as in the case here) a wizard who has been executed - but not before swearing by revenge for those who did it ... etc. Etc. one thing leads to another, and soon the executed expert can not calm down again. The action is slow, painfully boring, and the film is constantly feeling absurd. The characters print a bunch of bickering and never serve a movie in any way. Paul Naschi wrote the script, and if you ask me, he should keep acting because the dialogue is extreme, and only serves to make the film even more boring than it is already. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschi in Blue Eies of Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil, gives a boring direction here, who likes that dialogue does not help any movie. Sometimes such films have a certain charm about them; but Horror Rises from the Tomb does not even exist. This is a painfully boring film that has little or no interest.
