In a word ... insignificant. I give her one star for the hippie sex scene and a sweets woman, otherwise I forget it. Corman's worst effort, at least none. Ben Vereen should have his name permanently down. I can not believe it will now be on DVD (from May 15, 2005) with "Vild In The Streets" - another retro stinker. This morning I woke up sick in a bed with a cold, decided to watch a movie to cheer me up a little, scan the digital channels ... the premise looked interesting enough because I like to watch B-movie sci-fi, hippie culture and rebel teen flicks. It looked familiar to Ben Vereen in the actors, I thought ... why not? Big mistake ... it was a horrible beginning of my day. Only when I looked at it, now I know why the familiarity has entered the recesses of my newly discovered brain. I remembered seeing the upcoming attractions for this film as a 14-year-old girl (I'm 45 years old), at the beginning / mid-seventies in Sombrero, a local art theater that no longer exists ... the whole theater laughed hysterically and even loud She wept as much as this film looked bad. Act: horrible, story: horrible, cinema: almost-terrible, music: horrible, audible: terrible, directed: a joke. If you decide to watch this after my warning, remember ... "I told you." "Gass-sss" is the perfect title for this movie ... you feel "gassed" after watching this filthy movie - or maybe they'll take you to the "gas" brain drain room. I've seen domestic Super 8 films that disgrace this movie. Definitely a new addition to my top-top movies of all time ... there's up (down) with "Tentacles". Ted in Gilbert, AZ
