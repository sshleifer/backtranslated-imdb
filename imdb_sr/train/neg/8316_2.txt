Cedric Kahn's films are based on character rather than on action (I mean L'Ennui and Feuk rouges), so it's disturbing to see this series of really professional car lovers soured by some strenuous attempts to character Succo. I do not think Stefano Cassetti is an interesting actor; It reminds me of professional athletes who are persuaded in films, such as Bret Favre. This empty look looks like a really wicked deer that is caught in the headlights. The real actor would force us to think more about Succo personality than to admire his skill in carjacking. A little acting here comes mainly from Isild le Besco as a student needs a Succo storm. Interview in the police office is a miracle of mild stubbornness with a little fear of the future affiliated. Le Besco apart, few can recommend this film.
