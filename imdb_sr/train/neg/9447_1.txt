Most movies can easily pass, even if I do not like the movie. I am the type of person who recognizes great movies even if I do not like it. This is the first movie I could not watch. The cat in the hat is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. The act is fine (Miers is as good as a cat, only it's really boring). The silly songs the cat sings are boring and monotonous, even for children in the audience. The action is getting distracted, and viewers have to suffer because of poor dialogue. "Witty" parental remarks are repugnant, not ridiculous (I recall some horrible comments about how the hoe is compared with, so, the type of person that people call "ho"). Although the film was really short, it seemed to have been FOREVER. Do not waste your time. I know the little kids who hated this movie. If children can not stand it, I do not know how to do it. I'd love to watch more about this movie, but I do not want to waste my time writing this review about it. I hate it! So, in short, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! Watch a good movie! 1/10 star - the lowest review I've ever given to the movie.
