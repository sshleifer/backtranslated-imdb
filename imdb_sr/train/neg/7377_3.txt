Although the plot was very detailed, and the story was understandable, the fact that Steven Seagals's voice was renamed in another version of the movie was disturbing because you were not sure who was speaking. There were many parts in which he began to speak in his deep voice, and then the next voice of the other spoke for him. I do not know the reason, however, if he had difficulty with his voice during the production of the film, I think they could record events that did not contain his own voice when he recovered. This film estimates 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the film. When paying a movie regardless of whether it was in a movie or on a DVD, this film was not worth the price charged. I was a longtime follower of Steven Seagal and all his films he had been working in the past years. To this day, I think this is one of the worst we've ever seen
