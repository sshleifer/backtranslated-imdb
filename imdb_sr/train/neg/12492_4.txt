This is one of the films that has excellent video boxing but wrapped camry work and unknown actors who speak with poor dialogue. It's so dark when there are murders, you can hardly see it, and the movie is hard to understand. It's Vanessa Sanchez VCV (Tigres in VCV before it's folded) and she's a good actress. I love a low-budget movie, especially those that have errors because they're fun to watch, but Severed unfourtunatli is not one of them. This movie is fine to see if you like the voodoo and cut heads, but this is not a hit, but if you need something new to watch then rent Severed.
