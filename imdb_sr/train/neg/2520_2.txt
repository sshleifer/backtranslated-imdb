OK, this movie had a terrible premise. Be serious about the movie that just went through an apocalyptic war, but still have the money to buy huge robots and push them against each other. Each country decides instead to invest in the reconstruction of its own country, rather it will fight robots that no one can afford. Here are better ideas, to rely on our most capable resources, athletes, to fight in our battles. Everyone says what about the director, what about him. A real good movie, a bad movie. There is no reason to give this film a bit of credit for the director, maybe he was sleeping? I enjoyed this film thoroughly, because it was so cheesy and funny that I had to laugh. In fact, I did a good job of watching him, but apart from the cowboy mentor who turned out to be the killer (believe me that no one would see this guy as a killer, so that surprise, no matter how lame). anyway, jungle Jim. I was sad when I saw Mst3k did not do this. I give a grade of two stars because nothing can be as bad as the "manos hand of destiny." No budget is not important, I've seen a lot of reasonable movies that did not have anything for budgets such as cube. The story was not even convincing and I saw better performance in school plays. They were inconvenient to have eleven-year-olds from any high school. In any case, pick it up, it's a fun movie to watch.
