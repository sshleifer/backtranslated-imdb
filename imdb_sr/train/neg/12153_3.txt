Feeding The Masses was just another movie trying to earn some money from the zombie folly that takes place, mainly due to the popularity of films such as Land Of The Dead and Resident Evil. It begins at a television station, kept by the army, and reports that Lazarus' viruses (zombies) are close to closure, and the city will soon be free to re-operate. The problem is that this is completely wrong. The zombies run furious and only a small minority of people are aware. Among them are Torch (Villiam Garberina), camera man, Sherri (Rachael Morris), the chief host (for some reason listed as Shelley on this website) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), their military escort. Baklja and Sherri are against lying to people, but the station is run by a secret service (or some other government agency) and they are highly censored. This film gives itself a spot on the back of the bok-cover "We keep the FEEDING THE MASSES at a higher level than the three" Dead "films by George A. Rombero." The source of this quote has lost ALL credibility with me. Allow me to say that this movie is BAD. I do not mean bad as I expected more (obviously I was), but I think bad that I could not find any redeeming qualities in the film. The operation in all parts is either processed or too wooden. Did anyone remember their lines or read the tickets? I can not even imagine the best part of the movie or the best actor / actress. It really was not. If I had to somehow nod to somebody, I would tell Roger, the military escort was probably the most interesting figure, but that does not really say much. I should recommend that this film be transferred to the film, despite the good looks of the box (it was originally drawn to me in the movie). 3/10
