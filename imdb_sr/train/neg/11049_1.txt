If it is g. Cranky estimated this, I would be tempted to just copy his review and put it here. But, as it is not, I will have to do it myself. The only thing that gives this film 1 instead of 0 is that Malcolm McDowall's acting is excellent. However, he can not even save this film from a disaster. The director had to be confused when he worked on this, because it was just a conglomeration of scenes that were thrown together with a very small continuity - recalling the bad films of '70. Worse still, the actors and director seemed to be fictional as they moved, which probably showed how much the original script was bad. The corporation called the Prokate Corporation, which creates a crew of unnecessary people to carry a dangerous cargo on the old container / slave ship in Nigeria. This ship's computer is a baby that is kept in a glass jar and is twisted into one of the crew via USB 12 or something like that. The company was supposed to be called Prostate Corporation because the fun value of this movie is equal to the same name. I honestly can not find one scene that I could say that made it well and made the right meaning in the context of the film. I was only looking at him for the end because I had a bird flu touch and this film reminded me that there are people who are actually worse than me - especially Malcolm McDowall. I will not hold it against him because he is a great actor and every big actor has the right to a bad movie in his career, and this is a doosie. So unless this is the only movie store you hire or you are a male and you are a doctor do not do prostate examinations this week and somehow you feel this is a bad thing, then give this really wide shelf except, Of course, if you are really interested in the community, buy a copy to support Malcolm, and then use it as a drinking pot.
