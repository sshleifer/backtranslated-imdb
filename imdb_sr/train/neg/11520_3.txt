I did not enjoy this movie at all. For one I found it rude and vulgar, for no reason. And I also thought it was a misogynistic (against women) also, it seems that the film is not about anything, and I did not find any character iconable. Really, there does not seem to be any point at all.meie I'm missing something, but for me, this movie is pretty much a waste of time, when I was able to make myself more productive and pleasant. Like I use my face as a pad. James Garner is in this thing, such as C.Tomas Hovell and Shirlei Jones, and James Cromvell.all are lost here, and I'm sure this was a low point in each of their career. Jennilee Harrison (from the later Three's Compani) is also in the movie, and it is nice to see her in no ditsi role.but else, she can not rise above the central scenario. For me, Tank is 3/10
