(aka: TRINITY IS A MUCH NAME) This sequel looks like it was done to take advantage of the outstanding European success of the bok-office THE THE CALL ME TRINITI, only this time Joseph E. Levine and paintings by the Avco-Embassy want to use it in America. It's a shame that they did not get far because Hill / Spencer's paintings had only marginal success here in the US, and this boring, exhausted film does not help in any way. Triniti and Bambino swear to their dying father (Harri Carei Jr.) that they will become successful offenders and worry about each other. Later, they connect with traffickers who smuggle weapons from a monastery and who mistakenly think they are a few federal agents. Everything ends with the fall, despite a few funny scenes, especially the one in which Trinity and Bambino are in a fine French restaurant and do not know how to wear it. Sharks with sharks were mildly humorous. The original music sung by Gene Roman sounds like a righteous pop song like Bobbie Goldsboro in the early '70s. quite good. I'm not sure if I would like to buy a CD soundtrack, but others can. The movie could have half an hour of it and would not drag on so long. . Looks like a lot of chewing here. In fact, I lost interest in it about 2/3 times. The DVD is also terrible, with a constant noise in the sound surface and a bad print that seems to be sent to that big bang in the sky. Great step in relation to the previous film. 4 of 10
