I was very dissatisfied with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but this may be worse than both titles. First of all, I did not like animation, very Saturday morning caricature, only worse in some scenes. I liked some characters, Thunderbolt and Patch, but other characters, such as Cruella, were central. Cruella was really evil in the original, but in the end she lost her quality. What she said was nothing to write about the house and her animation was kinda ugly. Also, her companion Lars was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger seemed to quit smoking overnight. The voice talents were very good, although it was especially Barri Bostvick like Thunderbolt, with the exception of Jodi Benson, the accent that ruined it. There were some good moments, but the whole mess seemed to me silly and very suggestive for the extended TV episode. All in all, an extremely disappointing sequel to the most discerning Disney movies from the 60's with the Jungle Book. I'm sorry, I can only give this 3/10, but it was not my cup of tea.
