This is a story about the two who found a copy of 'Funky Monkei'. Finding it looked strange at that time when he realized there were still posters for a movie at the local Cineplek Odeon. After watching classics such as "Everi Vai Vai Ali Loose" and "Project Ks", these two guys realized that the films with the apes are excellent. These guys have been traveling for a long time while watching this movie. There was a monkey that was replaced by Stunt MAN when action sequences were needed. It was obvious that the monkey was not trained at Shakespeare's school. Maybe the replacement of a monkey with Ben Affleck would help the guys think. Perhaps a strong assistant would assist Jackie Chan or maybe even Hulk Hogan. Luckily, this film had incredible martial arts and Jet Li as Matthews Modine. While some may claim that Matthew Modin is not approaching Jet Li, tricks from the camera prove that he is just as good. When it becomes apparent that an untrained chimpanzee can not withstand the film, the film rely on Matthews to be a real star. Have I mentioned that there is a kind of little kid who develops a relationship with Modine and a monkey? Is there a possibility for a child to learn self-confidence, and even pick up a girl in this movie? Even Matthews Modine should be jealous of this (because the use of the line for raising 'I'm the second guitar for a monkey' does not seem to work with the ladies.) Soon after watching this movie, the two got a phone call from Matthews Modine who told them 'Seven days'.
