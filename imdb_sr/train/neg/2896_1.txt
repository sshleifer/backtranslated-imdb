I could not stand to sit through the whole movie. Do such families really exist anywhere? There have been many comments describing this family as similar to LLBean models and the like, and I think it's a great description of how they behaved. in high school is called a "pig", which, of course, grew into a beautiful plastic surgeon with 20 years of Harvard (but only to do well in the world - not for money), and she moves to Steve Carrel at the first meeting. Then I stopped watching ... If you can completely break the disbelief for two hours, then you may enjoy this sentimental, self-inflicted loss of time.
