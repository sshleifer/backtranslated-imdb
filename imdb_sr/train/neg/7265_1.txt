You just saw it at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it at all costs if you do not have a sleep problem. This is a film filled with pretensions - opens with a small quote from "Hiroshima mon amour" and from there it's all downhill. Working with cameras - imagine a child trying to imitate Vong Kar Vai. The storyline - Smokey Robinson and The Miracle "The Love I've Seen in Mirage" has spread from 3 to more than 2 hours but filled with repetition. For pain that disturbed the ass, this film ranks with benches in the Methodist Church in which my parent dragged me when I was a kid. I want 2+ hours of my life. Promoter Julianne Hernandez hinted at watching with comments that the film was "controversial" - that is true only for the narcotic effect of the film.
