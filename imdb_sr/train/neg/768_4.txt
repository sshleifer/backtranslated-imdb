I agree with most of the Columbo fans that this movie is an unnecessary format change. Columbo is a unique policeman with unusual police methods. This movie looks like a remake of other common detective drama from the past. And this is disturbing, because Columbo is not an ordinary detective. In this film there are two parts that left me intriguing. First, I can not understand the title of this movie. That's wrong. Perhaps a better title would be "The Vanishing Bride" or something like that. Second, Columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering reason (at least viewers) why he does it. I am glad that Peter Falk returned to the usual Columbo. <br /> <br />
