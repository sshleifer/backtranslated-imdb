VOV! Why would anyone make a sequel to an already outraged film? Half Past Dead was a bad movie, but at least he had an idea of ​​what he wanted to be. HPD2 does not know what it wants to be. He just exists on the screen for reasons I can not explain. Spoiler: The whole movie is this: Tvitch (played by Kurupt from Tha Dogg Pound) is being transferred to another prison where there may be a box filled with golden bricks. A riot erupts between rival prisoners, one of them is killed by a guy named Cortez, and Cortez plans to escape. During a spouse's visit, Tvitch's fiancé and Burke (acted as Bill Goldberg), her daughter was abducted by Cortez and held in a execution room. Burke reluctantly fights with Twitch and they end up in trouble with idiotic prisoners as they learn that Cortez has his own loved ones. Opinion: This is the most necessary extension of the Universal Soldier: Return. The scenario is awesome, the acting is terrible, the dialogue is a joke and everyone in this movie is caricature. Look, I know it was a low-budget movie, but it's not an excuse for these guys not to make an effort to do what they do. Nobody in this "movie" does not believe in the characters they play. No one in this movie can be seriously regarded as an actor, Kurupt should be ashamed of himself, his character "Tvitch" is quite similar to knee-doll who spend most of his time posing while Burke or other prisoners pose. the film is being played as if he had to take the PHD (a pretty huge landfill). The scene of the fight is poorly choreographed and pathetic, and for the action movie HPD2 is quite boring even when the action is going on! Let somebody say that this movie is somewhat decent, stinky and the main reason why people are and they despise Follivood.
