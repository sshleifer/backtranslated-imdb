If this is the first time you have experienced the wonders of cinema, if you have never seen a "moving image" before, you will think that this movie is a child of gods. But if you've watched a movie, TV show, even Barney Dinosaur, then you will not be very impressed with this movie. Dinamo was more realistic than the dinos in this film. Now I love B movies. I just watched "The Giant Gila Monster" just before I watched this trap, and I loved it a lot. Works like a B movie. It has a diamond dialogue, sharpens the acting, sirens effects and honest Gila Monster as a monster! Carno 3 simply does not charge much B film. There is something worse, and that Polchek is a few times near to be ridiculous, but this film is dissatisfied, almost ... flabby. It's a small engine that can not watch dinosaur movies. I'm not saying you should not watch a movie. Some people can watch rubber drying on the sidewalk and have fun. If you are one of these people, then give this movie a shot.
