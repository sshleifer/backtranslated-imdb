Well, you know the rest! This must be the worst movie I've seen for a long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some payment bills when she took over that role. The main role play (me) a complete stranger and I imagine it disappeared instantly in the dark Bruce Lee led the martial arts martial arts in the early 70's and since then the combat scene has to be either based on martial arts or at least brutal if street fighting techniques are used. This film uses quick cuts to show martial arts, however, even this can not conceal the fact that the lady does not know how to throw a blow. The average 8-year-old boy would have broken it up in this display. We are sorry, the only mystery that has been shown here is that this did not win the golden raspberry for your year.
