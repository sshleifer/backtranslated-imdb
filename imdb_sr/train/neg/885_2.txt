Anthology is always a risky business, and I think that this venture should boast. There are many talents here. Many talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I could not enjoy this film based on the three questions I had. First of all, the segments are incredibly different in tonality and quality. And unfortunately, some of them are confronted with others. Second, several segments seem to me underdeveloped. As seeds of good stories that never come true. I'm not talking about happy endings here (or even about the final period), but they miss even the basic development or even the tough settings that attract you. New York and its inhabitants are properly displayed. What you have left are high quality short films that may be of interest to some, but will leave the average viewer unhappy.
