"Tashan" Vijaia Krishna Acharie is an exaggerated, stylized, product. He is sure that this is one of the most picturesque films, but when it comes to content, even masses will reject this. Why? The film scenario is an amateur and two-year-old baby. The script is king, without a good script, even the greatest director of all time can do nothing. Tashan produced the most successful production banner 'Iash Raj Films' and Mega Stars that appear in it. But nothing on earth can save you if you are a bland script. Thumbs up! Performances: Anil Kapoor, veteran actor. But how could he have mastered such a role? Akshai Kumar is a great actor, in fact he is the only saving salvation. Kareena Kapoor never looked so hot. It looks awesome and leaves you, everyone standing. Saif Ali Khan does not get his money here. Sanjai Mishra, Manoj Phava and Iashpal Sharma are lost. 'Tashan' is a boring film. Failure of movies at the box office, if you hold on to it.
