First, I'd like to say that I'm a fan of Chris Rock. I love his other films, but this film is just like my abstract. The biggest bag of shit ever. In the beginning, Chris Rock plays an ambitious comedian who was scared in a comedy called Apollo. On the way home from the concert, while riding his BIKE, he sees this woman he loves and is hit by a truck. A little later, he chooses the body of an old, white and selfish millionaire. Then he dresses as an outcast musician while trying to repeat the scene from the original where he comes out as a jockey. Second, he returns to Apollo and tries to be a comedian who tried to be in his previous body and begins to breathe white populations and tries to be black. Do you get my enthusiasm? This film is horrible that it's trying too hard to be like an original and in this process it comes out as a sack of shit. Just listen to my advice, do not even watch this movie.
