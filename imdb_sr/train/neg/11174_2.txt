Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Tea Leoni? Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My mouth was wrong. I dropped everything to watch this movie on the cable. For 30 minutes, I had a problem staying awake. 60 minutes and I pressed the recording button and fell asleep. I ended up watching him the next morning. It should not have been bothered. What a loss of a great actor and idea that could have been an interesting story about "The Day in Life ..." Cure insomnia if you have it and watch this movie. I guarantee you at least an hour and an uninterrupted sleep. Dialogue horrible. Continuity does not exist. Working with the camera could have been done by Super 8 and it looks better. This film was a total disaster.
