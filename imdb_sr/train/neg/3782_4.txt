Here's the good news. "Spirit" is to be the most visual incredible animated film in the current edition of the home theater. Artwork and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend that you give this film only the appearance of the image. Now for bad news. I really mean that when I say animation is the only thing that this movie is about to do. You may recall that last summer, "Ghost" was hardly banging "Lilo and Stitch". The first person who claims to be because Disney is well established and has a better advertisement, can write me a four-page essay entitled "Why," Lilo and Stitch's script did not stink. "For all the incredible new the animation technology shown in "Spiritu", the story is almost * astounding * boring. There is a lesson, and (not to say) that it does not only apply to animated films. You can have the most interesting visual effects that ever fascinate the eyes of the mortals, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, we do not care about your character This is a bad film making Simple: The animation is still amazing: I just can not wait to see what someone does with more imagination with it.
