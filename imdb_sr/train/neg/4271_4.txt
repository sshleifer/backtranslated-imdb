A typical thriller, who worked many times before. A simple plot plot; Officer Liotta becomes obsessed with Russell's wife, and he's trying to dismiss a good old Kurt so he could have it. This is beyond the foreseeable, not even trying to induce you to guess, the plot is complicated and there is no thinking here. I guess that's the only reason I'm watching how it's evolving, but nothing is not real or interesting. There is nothing to say about this film, it's not particularly bad, but there are no good points. Russell plays Russell and you know what you will get when you see him in the movie. Ditto Liotta. The stove has a boring Cher-eskue voice. I read the draft plot and I could see the film in the head, it was so obvious and established. I looked at him and he rolled in front of my eyes just as I imagined. I did not even feel emotion at all. I have no feeling for this movie, as if I had never seen it. Given this, it's a pretty nonsensical movie, is not it? However, I will give him 3/10 for some reason.
