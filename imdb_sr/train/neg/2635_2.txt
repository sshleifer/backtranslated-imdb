I was willing to fight a lot from the late spring / summer action movies, but this was mainly due to the fact that most of them have a reasonable income (for example Cool special effects, interesting complications, comical value, Steve Buscemi, etc.). This film, however, did not have any of this. All we got was a cheap excitement of a few minutes of décolleté Eva Longoria (the question Makima is cheaper than the movie ticket). There is an unpleasant lack of complication, uncertainty, stories in the background, character development, continuity, etc. I would embark on specificity, but honestly, I'm already - maybe I'm glad to forget - most of the movie. All the while I was in the theater, I was amazed that I did not just spend the afternoon watching Season 24 on a DVD. Save money on this, people. Unless you really, really, really love décolleté Eve Longoria.
