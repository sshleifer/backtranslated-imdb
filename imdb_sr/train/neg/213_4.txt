Yes, indeed, he could have been a good movie. Love fight, (I'm sorry, poetic licenses, but it's not a triangle!) An interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The picture is sometimes weird, sometimes OK, the images look crowded and dimmed. Sound needs more attention (usually done in Romanian films), and light and color filters are sometimes poorly selected. Soundtrack is short and does not help the action. About acting ... I'm sorry, but the best actress is the landlord. Others behave immature and can not convince the viewer. The act is poetic when it needs to be realistic and realistic when it should be poetic. It's an adult picture, which the children said. It is only bothered if it is extremely curious.
