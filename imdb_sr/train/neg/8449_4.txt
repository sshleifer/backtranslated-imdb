what an absurd story, murder for murder, allegations of sex for children, homosexuals and a Catholic church ... ... an absolute joke. How come most of the television dramas based in the UK, the seat, and so on. He has to include a binding gay, now he's really boring. Everyone accepts that there are gays in society that have only other minority groups, but we do not want to get deeper into our throats (I will transmit this) in every show. In addition to the above, the drama went from what might have been an interesting story in the pantomime, the priest was pedophile and there are gays that play everywhere, oh, just to be completely PC one of the gay couples was black. I was surprised when ecclestone even thought about when he read the script.
