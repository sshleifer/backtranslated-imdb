I love comics. Although I have a problem understanding the stories? the visual style is unique with all the dirt, dust and decay. I thought I knew what I was. Surprisingly, I realized the main plot? but some extremely bad decisions are made due to their visual style. I mean - really bad looks "CG folk actors" - in the vicinity? ??Why?! It did not work at all! Horus - and other Egyptian gods - were successfully made in Montenegro and very close to the comic version. I think that with the right actors this movie could be a cult film. What a shame.
