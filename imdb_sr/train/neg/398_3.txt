Come on guys, some earlier reviewers have recently written a novel that comments this episode. It's just an old TV show! This episode of Star Trek is significant because of the most serious baby (Ieoman Barrov's) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was shot in the right location in the open. Unlike the LPG series and Voiager series that were completely limited to sound phases. This use of outdoor location (and babe) gives the correct depth and almost film quality to an ordinary episode of this moment. and a very famous performance. Apart from a few exceptional exceptions, e.g. "A City on the Edge of Eternity", "Task Land" and "Tomorrow is Yesterday," the old Star Trek series has to be a serious moth-Saved and thrown out of a boring misery. Half a dozen good episodes from 79 is a pretty bad average of blows. This is typical of the boring things that Gene Roddenberi had produced at the time, contrary to the popular opinion of where some people worshiped the country on which he walked, he made a lot of trash! He does not deserve to be talked about in the same way as Irvine Allen. Just look at the Enterprise Enterprise Bridge from a modern point of view. They used an unstable plywood for the floor, coffee tables with plastic backrests and a cheap cardboard above instrument plates. The paper is clearly visible on the paper! Every cost is spared or what!
