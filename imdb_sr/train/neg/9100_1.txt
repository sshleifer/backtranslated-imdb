Christ, oh God ... One looks stunned, unbelievable, and perhaps disturbed, because this awkward exercise in the careless head takes place with all the wit and skill of the paralyzed turtle Galapagos. Can such things be? Does this film really exist, or was I the unconscious guinea pig of a blurred international drug company, sipping coffee unaware that it was burdened with a dangerous hallucinogen? I've seen a lot of movies and many bad films, but nothing has prepared me for it; In the end, I was nonsense, a creeping wreck, grabbing my carpet with teeth like a dog, ridge on the walls, curling up until my lungs were painful. I desperately wanted to be gracious (for whom this call was addressed, I do not know) and longed for the desire for soothing balm Ozu Iasujiro. Dear Jesus Christ, memories ... sometimes they come back to me. When I am the most vulnerable, when I am the least able to deal with them. I tremble, I break in tears, I bite my nails until my hands are covered with blood, but I can not expel horrible flashbacks from my mind. I'm crazy. I'm damaged. I am the armor of a man. Other user comments suggest that I am not alone in the fact that I have gone through this terrifying experience, which can only mean one of two things: a) the movie works, in fact, there are, or b) I I am only one victim among the legions of the international conspiracy of truly malicious proportions. What is quite amazing is that some people enjoyed their temptations, or at least they were not left traumatized by it. Maybe they are part of the operation. Damn, maniacs! Damn them all to hell !!!!!!
