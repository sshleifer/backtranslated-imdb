This early vehicle Pia Zadore followed the well-known formula of Harold Robbins: the ambitious main character of decadent struggles, following the road to the top of a randomly chosen but glamorous world, in this case the film industry. But despite the fact that he is so formative that he is completely predictable, this film succeeds at the same time to be totally unbelievable. Zadra (that the actress calls inexperienced to be charity) never assures her as a scriptwriter. One could expect a film about creating a movie that would have insight into its own industry and creative process. But the script does not give it any of the features that make the writers interesting film characters: respect, skill with words, the relation of love and hatred to their own creative abilities. Her face is empty like a donut hole. And this is just the taste of the incompetence shown here. Cinema is so blurry that sometimes it's hard to see what's going on. And the scenes never converge, so everything looks like a series of random moments at bad Hollywood parties. Avoid.
