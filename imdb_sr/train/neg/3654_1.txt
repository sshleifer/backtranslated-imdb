In the 17th century in Japan, a samurai was living who set the standard for centuries. His name was Maieda. He was sent on an epic journey all over the world to buy 5,000 mushrooms from the king of Spain. While at sea, a violent storm swallowed their precious gold with the intention of buying weapons and almost taking their life. Maieda has to struggle with all the prospects of surviving and securing the fate of her beloved Japan. Shogun Maieda is an action adventure epic on several continents. Christopher Lee (Star Wars, Trilogy Lord of the Rings), John Rhis Davies (Trilogy Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones Trilogy) and Toshiro Milfune (Seven Samurai, Blood Throne), Shogun Maieda (Kabuto) is a masterpiece of the film. The Osaka winning team won the Bob Ivi screen bringing exciting battles / action sequences such as opening the battle against the Eastern army, attacking the Maiedin ship carrying invaluable jewels and the final conflict between Sho Kosugi and David Essek. There is also a fine musical piece by the famous composer John Scott. Director Sho Kusugi was not even nominated for an Oscar for this film dealing with emotional conflicts such as the death of the Maiedas family, a quest for love and acceptance after grief, and all this is solved extremely well. Very recommended masterpiece of cinema. Note: All of the above is the opposite of the film about which one is in question.
