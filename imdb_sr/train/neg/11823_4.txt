TOM BROVN'S SCHOOLDAIS Image ratio: 1.78: 1 Sound format: Stereo By the late 19th century England, young Tom Brovn (Alek Pettifer) is sent to a public school in Ragbi, where he undergoes the reforms of a radical new headmaster (Stephen Fri) and takes on the role of a schoolboy of Flashman (Joseph Beattie). Already the subject of numerous screen adaptations - the most important version of Gordon Parry from 1951. - Thomas Hughes' evergreen novel gets treatment in the early 21st century, thanks to screenwriter Ashley Pharoah (TV "Vhere the Heart Is") and director David Mooreu (FORSITE SAGA). It is pleased and appealing, but it is also pretty stable and boring, and is distinguished only by Fri's sincere performance as the new main person who decided to remove some of the most suspicious "traditions" of the school and introducing a possible new star in the 14th Pettifer, talented a kid with such charm without any effort and colorful look that should take him to Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, this is typical British TV food, the kind of thing that managers want to fill in with a 'prestigious' product, even one that's as incomparable as this. The UK Radio Times publication described it as "incredibly weird" and raised a fuzzy eyebrow to "all that fagging and brutality and a handsome, disgusting criminal who is struggling with the life of cute boys." Pretty much.
