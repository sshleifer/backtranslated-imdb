Give me my money! Give me back my life! Give me some credit. This film was a cause. Useless and long-lasting. What a loss of energy and totally meaningless. OK. I understand the premise and idea sounds, but leave us alone! Next time give me the money and let me spend it. Lost child, mother remorse, blamed husband! Cliche ies ~! Presberi se! I'm sorry, but this film was a total loss of my time, money and my being. I'd rather watch how they cook eggs! There is no real explanation as to why this happened. Prison? Why? Loss? Obviously, but why? The actor deserves what I'm doing here Oscar and cinema Do I do this only for wages? How much did this film make? This fool hired a copy. He said enough
