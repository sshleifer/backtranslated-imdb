Stephen King's adaptation (written by the king himself) in which a young family, a newcomer in rural Maine, learn about the cemetery of pets near their home. Father (Dale Midquiff) then finds out about the Micmac cemetery behind the cemetery for pets that has the power of resurrection - only, of course, everything buried there is not entirely right. it begins awkwardly, insultingly and incapable, and it continues for some time, with the absolute worst element of Midkiff's worthless performance. It's getting a little better towards the end, with a really disturbing final. In fact, the entire film is really disturbing, which is why I can not completely reject it - at least it has to NOT make it unforgettable. Honorable performances by Fred Gwynne, the wise old neighbor and Brad Greenwich, because the distorted spirit of Victor Pascow is not enough to really use the film. Br /> Follows the sequel that was directed by Mari Lambert (is it strange that she had not had a mainstream film work since then)? 4/10
