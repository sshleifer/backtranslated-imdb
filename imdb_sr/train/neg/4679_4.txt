What a horrible movie. Do not misunderstand me, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but apart from a few interesting pieces, the film mainly deals with hysterical submarines who shout, cry, sweat and generally get amused when something goes wrong. /> Take it with the simplified parties to make sure the audience still understands what's going on (the scene Denzel Washington explains to the radio service provider that he must be like Scotty in Star Trek is nothing more than a joke) and you do not have a triloger who does not deserve acting. Just hope that the real nuclear navy of the United States is not in the hands of such a scenario! <br /> <br />
