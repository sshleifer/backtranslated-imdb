*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** From the very beginning, this fantastic film sets a record: it's an instant classic. It does not take long to realize that this film is big, bigger than the 'Police Academy 7'. The size itself left me without text while I was going out of the cinema and I went back to the counter to buy another ten cards. This is a movie that simply requires multiple viewing. First watching will surely leave you with that weird "Ha?" feeling, but do not feel embarrassed - this is happening to the best of us. The story is so deviously wise to ask about the mortality of its authors. What looks like a simple story about an idiot infiltrating the FBI turned out to be an allegorical story that works on several levels and teaches us all about truly important things in life. The complexity of the plot structure will confuse you at your first viewing, but do not give up! Only when I was reviewing the sixth or seventh screenings I discovered some hidden mysteries of 'Corki Romano'. And watch the unexpected turn in the end, otherwise you will be completely unprotected when it's revealed that FBI agent Brick Davis is the FBI's most wanted criminal, Corki is not a real FBI agent, Pops Romano is innocent, Peter Romano admits he is illiterate, and Paulie Romano comes out of the closet as a homosexual. I'm surprised, I can tell you a lot. The comedic talents of Chris Kattan are unmatched because he leads his character Corki Romano through a labyrinth of completely unpredictable situations. Recalling John Reynolds' performance in Manos, the hand of destiny, Kattan takes on countless personalities and deals with all the scenes with perfect comedic time. However, Kattan does not only deal with comedy. He is a master of drama, while controlling the feelings of the audience with the smallest facial movements. His facial expression reflects life itself, in some way. For example, in a scene in which he faces the faces of his brothers, you can see the expression of social injustice and alienation that is clearly reflected on his troubled face. At this point, it's hard to find a dry eye in the house. Scenarios David Garret and Jason Ward are the true heroes of 'Corki Romano'. With the story of such proportions, it is easy to understand why two experienced writers have to be busy ending this ambitious project. Their skilful narrative and unorthodox structuring makes "Pulp Fiction" look like the central skit of Saturdai Night Live. The story of Gareth and Varda is so convincing and attractive that you are attracted to your hair, swallowing you completely, shaking and spitting you. At the end of the out-of-the-world experience known as 'Corki Romano' you find another person with different views of the world and different ideas, and with just one question: Why, God? Why?!?
