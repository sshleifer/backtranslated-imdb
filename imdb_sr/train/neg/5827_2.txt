Do not get the impression from other reviewers that this movie smells because it's ambivalent to the Japanese whaling industry (which, morally, is not worse than American meat or Scottish haggis), stinks because it's pretentious, a kind of self, and it's modern art is a bad name. However, there are some stunning images, but there are stunning images in the average bus ride if you use your imagination, so there is no reason to go and see this nonsense. What is happening in a movie happens very slowly and often accompanied by an audio background that sounds like a cat that is destroyed, and then, just when it thinks it's over, it starts again. I saw him in porn cinema in Rome that was engaged for the weekend to show Barney's films, which is a wonderful and clever way to recover what was once a local stroller from dirty old men in a sword. brigades, but if modern young things and a little bit older Bjork beard fans were honest, everyone might have had a lot more fun to have just shown one of the porn!
