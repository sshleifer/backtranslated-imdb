!!!! POSSIBLE MILO SPOILER !!!!! As I watched the first half of GUILTI AS SIN, I could not believe it was made in 1993 because it was played as JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas cloned from the mid-80s. It begins with murder and leaves the audience to say: "Is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his lawyer?" But in the film half film shows the early 90s, turning into "lawyers" manipulated and persecuted by her client "type of film that ends in a funny way, and KRIVICA KAO SIN has even more funny ending in this regard. This is a very bad thriller, but the most opulent thing about it is that it was directed by Sidney Lumet the same man who brought us the classic courtroom of all time 12 ANGRY MEN
