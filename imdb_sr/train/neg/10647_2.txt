The last Tarzan film starring Johnny Veissmuller (which is a surprisingly old year after "Tarzan and Huntress") is bad, despite all the trivia that can be added to make it look better. It is obvious that RKO tried to forgive Veissmuller, shooting in a beautiful landscape in Mexico, with the top star of that country (Andrea Palma) and multiple award-winning cameraman Gabriel Figuero, and the introduction of the renowned composer Dimitri Tiomkin's Result. Although it cost less for filming abroad, it looks more expensive than any other RKO film in the series, exploiting Acapulco beaches and real pyramids like Akuatania, and impressive decorations for all scenes related to the temple of the god Balu (Kurt Neumann should have remained as director, Neumann worked well with Tarzan and Amazon, Tarzan and Leopard, Tarzan and Huntress, and ended his career by directing the classic "The Fli" a year before his death; while Florei became televisions who is a director after the career of several exceptional films. If Veissmuller looks tired, the chimp that plays Cheet is not as good as the rest, but the worst character is Benji, a disgusting poet singing horrible songs (which have Caribbean air at a location that should be Africa and recorded in Mexico!) Boring and decisively suspicious taste, there was a sad farewell to Veissmuller Tarzan.
