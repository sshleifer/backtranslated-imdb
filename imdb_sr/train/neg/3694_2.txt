That's no doubt Rajkant's worst movie ever. The first part is held with a good comedy from Goundamani, but it is progressively worsening and worse and completely illogical. Our hero also digs into the saints of the same name (Baba) through a banal and completely lame one liner. The first half of Rane pronounces his usual set of oneliner and style, and in the second half he becomes a quasi-saint after being led by a beggar through a cross-dimensional portal to the Himalayas, where Babaji (and not the known saints he had previously excavated) gives him special powers without an obvious reason except karma). This really gets interesting, is not it? The rest of the film is about how he spent his magical benefits and power and struggled against politicians and related black magic. Usually predictable shit with hasty implementation. Oh, and the black magic never worked on our hero because he accidentally had param Vir ... er ... Shakti Chakra with him. The bad guys and the usual bad guys politicians are clich√©, overburdened and in the end, totally insignificant for a plot that does not go anywhere. But despite all the faults, it was fun to kill time with and yelling Baba about a liner during public events. It's also fun to watch others crap about this movie. It is said that AR Rehman composed tracks for his movie via a mobile phone. So he considered it important. Rains is very popular in Japan and has included two characters (one of them is called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) Japanese origin in this movie just for that. But the way they are shown, trained and treated is absolutely pathetic. The Japanese can stop watching Rhino movies after they see it. This film was probably a promotional material for Rhine's entry into politics, but the results of the film itself would have killed any of his political dreams. It's fun if you turn your brain.
