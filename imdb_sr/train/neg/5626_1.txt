I caught this movie on Sunday. I thought it was so bad that I looked at the IMDb to see what others think about it. I was not surprised by the amount of stupid people who enjoyed this hair. However, I was surprised when I looked at comments in order to read the Hated It categories only to find out that there were no. I was shocked by that; I'm always looking at hate as they are always those who hate the movie no matter how good it is. Somehow this movie managed to remain unharmed by the haters I say not to, and proudly announce that I hate this movie! I know I should explain in detail why I hate this movie, but to do it, I would give this film more respect than it deserves.
