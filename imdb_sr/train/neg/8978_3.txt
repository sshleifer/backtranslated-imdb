If John Waters wrote and directed a "1000 Household House" after hitting his head with a heavy object several times, the result would probably be something like "Bloody Market". The first half an hour is mildly fun, but then reaches into a kind of impeccable glop of constant screaming and people who do other things with genitals with electric cutting knives, cutlery and pliers. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is incredibly disturbing, and Terri West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad as what works in front of the camera. Perhaps the best thing about "Blood Shield" is. is that it will not take many viewers to forget about it for a long time.
