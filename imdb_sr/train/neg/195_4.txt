Slow and pervaded by inaccuracy. Too much to watch his faults, this is still an interesting display of the famous and heroic siege of Alam during the struggle for independence from Mexico. James Arness as Jim Bovie. Brian Keith like Dave Crockett. Alec Baldwin as Colonel Travis. Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. This project for TV is also played by David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.
