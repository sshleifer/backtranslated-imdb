This is definitely not one of the better movements of Lucio Fulcias by imagination. The plot is pretty bad, a millionaire is killed, and his spirt calls his daughter to find out who did it. But the biggest problem I have with this (apart from knowing who killed it within 10 minutes of watching a movie) wondered why anyone would care? The father came as a great jerk to everyone he encountered (including the daughter he asked to help him) which was hard for anyone who killed him. But no one really looks at Fulci for a good story, and that would be like looking at pornography for the incredible writing of scripts and acting. Usually his films try to compensate for this by adding excessive scenes up, but even that is missing in this movie. If you are looking for a good Fulci, see The Beiond.
