I'd rather have 20 root channels than to go through this movie again. Prince of Annoying, Miles Berkovitz, lost nearly two hours of my life with this piece of cynical pseudo-cool. The only fun thing in this mess is the disgusting grin. Samahe's nose and throat. Berkovitz takes a big concept and mixes it in the dust. It is thrown and badly done, in an obvious attempt to make it obvious or ridiculous. It is neither one nor the other. I rarely feel that film is a loss of a movie (or strip), but this qualifies for that difference. If the date suggests watching this movie, run it.
