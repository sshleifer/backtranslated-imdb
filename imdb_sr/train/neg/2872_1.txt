This is by far the worst horror / thriller I've seen in 29 years. If someone offers this for you free of charge, tell them NO. This movie makes you stupid because you knew that you watched it. Action is not even the worst part of this movie ... ... its acting, camera work, lighting and sound. There is absolutely nothing for this movie. Whoever paid for this film is now broken. I hope the director will never get a green light for another movie. In his defense, this film was made quickly to try to capitalize on the shooting of a real killer of BTK, but I saw a film about the weeks that looked like Oscar winners over this.
