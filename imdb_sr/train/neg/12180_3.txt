This film is absolutely horrible, but it can sometimes be ridiculous, although this humor is totally unintentional. The action was out of laugh. I do not even think that the two-year-old would be persuaded by the senseless idiocy that filmmakers tried to applaud together in the story. However, on the positive side, some of the horrible senseless complications provide a lot of humor. For example, "Vov, Lada Hogbottom has a huge rocket hidden in her yard!" It gets worse (but even funnier), but I'll spare you. The acting is generally funny. Most of the children's roles are sweet, but not very convincing. On the other hand, Annie is pretty scary. Adults do not take their role seriously at all, but it's generally a good thing. If they tried to be persuasive, the film would be even worse. Which is hard to imagine. Once you pass through the overall jerk of the movie, there are actually a few moments that are almost immobile. The scene in which son of a son, Lada Hogbott, runs with a maid is surprisingly hilarious, although it is an unpleasant disappointment when the police are caught. Character character, although very small, represents the ray of sunlight that almost, but never penetrates through darkness. Nevertheless, there were several redeemable parts that made it almost visible without starting to bleed internally. Judging by the good parts, the film would be about 5; Unfortunately, the rest of the movie hardly deserves 1. So, I give it to 3. It's pretty generous, I would say.
