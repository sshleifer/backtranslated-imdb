In the past, Vipul Shah made a really impressive work as a director. 'Vakt - Race Against Time' and 'Namaste London' were fun and interesting to watch. 'Singh Is Kinng' was fun, which he produced. His latest film "London Dreams" comes to be the weakest career. London Dreams has a central story, and that is how success turns friendship into hatred. I agree, there is potential, but when you look at 'London Dreams' you are wondering what's going on? This movie has perhaps the worst peak lately. Vipul Chess writer puts Vipula Shah on line. The first hour is boring, the other clock is better; but again the climax is terrible. How can someone forgive a person who has decided to destroy you? I will not. Ajai Devgn suddenly decided to go to India and ask for forgiveness from his diaper, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When it comes to India, Salman salutes him with the bajaj fair and says that he was the cause of the whole fiasco? Is Vipula Shah's intention to show Salman's character as a GOD? If so, then you have completely failed. The only question I want to ask Vipul Shah is, would you greet the person who destroyed you with such a great reception? Write down what you feel, do not deceive us (the audience), we are reasonably reasonable to understand what is good or not. This is a musical, but the music of Sankar-Ashan-Loy is terrible. No song remains in your mind. Salman is wonderful. The film carries on its shoulders and really, really well, in emotional scenes. But his figure is again shown as God, which in the end makes him look like a retard. Ajai is equally good, but Salman completely overshadowed him. Asin is futile, and what is a great talent like Om Puri doing in this movie? Rannish hams, although Aditia Roi Kapoor stands out. Brinda Parekh is as good as a vampire. All in all, this dream remains a dream!
