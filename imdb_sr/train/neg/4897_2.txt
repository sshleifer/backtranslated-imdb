This film comes as an ultimate disappointment in Tsai Ming-Liang for me. From each frame the laziness is radiating. So, I will not analyze it in detail. But some observations: 1. If the space is drought, why will we see the cityscape with floral green trees? I wonder if this meant something in the metaphorical context of the film (in which thirst informs the craving for intimacy, and the watermelon trivial replacement, sex). Or it's just a matter of bad film making, not worrying about being coherent. 2. We do not know what happened to the porn actress, why she is unconscious or, probably, dead. It seems that the question does not matter until the message of superior alienation is successfully (= bombastic) delivered, but in retrospect, its inertial body proves that a cheap dramatic trick, an excuse? equally unreasonable and exploitative as the activity in which it is used. 3. The film does not say anything that Antonioni did not sound better 40 years ago ?? and without the undue humiliation of his actors. 4. Music numbers (recycled from 'The Hole') felt like the idea of ​​high school students about artistic counterpoint, performed at the high school level skills. If this is true, the point is exhausted.
