I'm in bad movies, but this has nothing to do with it. In spite of the fact that the morons have said above, it's NOT funny. I know comedies and underground films, but this is so boring that the director / writer should be banned from EVER, and that he does not direct anything except the local cable access EVER again! To love movies and comedy means to despise this movie. Maybe I will never understand how much this job was peaceful and boring. If you like this movie, you are as sober and nothing here. ZERO! If you want to compare underground movies, see "Kentucky Fried Movie" or early John Vaters. The film begins with the definition of satire and I defy everyone to show me the satire. The rule for comedy is OVO ... If FUNNI can say or do anything, but if NOT funny, you are not satirical, you are not nervous, you are just pathetic and this movie is simply not funny. ZERO!
