Arthur Askey's great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his audience. His juvenile jokes, silly poems and stupid dances dashed well because he was able to get involved in folk and draw them into his walled world. The lack of a live audience for him was a significant drawback and he was never completely comfortable in movies. He has his moments at The Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, was adapted to take advantage of his talents, but Askei's performer had to be seen to be appreciated. Askei's support in the film is not strong, it includes a regular associate of Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a young couple; Linden Travers crosses the top as "crazy woman". Also on board, Peter Murrai-Hill, who was off-screen married Phillis Calvert, as the nominal leading man, who gave a completely meaningless reading of the work, and lead lady Carol Linne, which turns into an equally insignificant performance. It was left to actress Kathleen Harrison to steal a film without delay as a woman who likes parrot and breaks on Dr. Morland Graham's brandy.
