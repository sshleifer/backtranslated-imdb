The first ten minutes of this film about making an international film in Belgium are fine: you see real chaos on the set, the producer at the edge of the nervous breakdown, cool was the director (Mickei Rourke), bad You already saw everything, but it's done well. But then! The rest of the film's time is just repeating: the same ten minutes over and over again. There is no climax, there is no dramatic development, there is no good acting, even a bad acting, it only continues and continues. Mickey Rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his f ** ked career in a scene where reality and fiction meet. Overall, this is 12 good minutes. <br /> <br />
