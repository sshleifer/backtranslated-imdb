This film is one of the most fatterful bad action movies ever made. Dolph Friggin 'Lundren with a Japanese accent is funny enough, but add buddi buddy buddy to mik, eccentric and over-the-top criminals, cliched love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time, and you have a cure for suicides who enjoys life and, until watching "Shovdovna", never thought about killing with a fan. I do not know if only I, but the entire homosexual subtext is not too subtle. There are constant references to male genitalia, and not to women. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about the masculine parts of each other, and in fact, before going to suicidal behavior, Brandon tells Dolphie: "If we fail, I want to tell you, you have the greatest ... I've never seen it." /> Now, would a normal man tell someone else? In the film about the action no less? And do you want it to be your words _ Later, there is this jewel: Dolph (in connection with the criminal): "I would like to cut off certain parts of his anatomy . "Brandon:" Man, you have a fixation. " As the guy from RuthlessRevievs.com pointed out, "Unfortunately, Dolph does not fit," I have a fixation? I have a fixation! You are the one I have decided that his last words should be about my cousins! I just cut off his ears and nose, man. "This is reluctantly stupid and fun if you are someone who enjoys receiving root canals from dentists without a license, without a novel. It's about a couple of great fun for the whole family!
