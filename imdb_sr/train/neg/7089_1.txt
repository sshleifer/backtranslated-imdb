A sexually obsessed chef leads a double life: one as a "happy" married man with a ten-year-old child, another as a sex offender. Most of the documentary film follows him for five consecutive days, and he was told that Nastasya Kinski was a clinical sex therapist, listening to his story and intelligently questioning him. Nastasjina's role is very restrictive and she is the only main adult character who does not take off clothes. If she had, I would rate this film with a big fat "F." As it is, he estimates F +, which implies that it is still a failure if he does not like being bored. It is probably much more interesting to spend ninety minutes of cleaning the garage. The "Sexual Addiction Diary" belongs to the category of films that are once seen, and one wants it to be.
