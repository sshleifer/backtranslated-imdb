This staggering loss of money production is film proof that the rich and famous can be as stupid and scattery as politicians. From the (stupid) piece of Tennessee Villiams and directed by (with his dead hand) Joseph Losey and starring Tailor and Burton and Noel Covard - this project shot on a spectacular mountain island in the Mediterranean must look like a safe fire winner when introduced to the Universe in 1967. The result is so absurd and boring that it almost defies belief. The film is visually spectacular, but it is the force of nature that made it possible to set up the fact that instead of betting, a real home is used. The bursting Tailor, Burton's crazy wandering, crazy dialogue, Noel Covarda, laughing at himself, funny stories and drawing devices and absurd costumes simply irritate the viewer. BUM is a disgrace, a waste of money and talent, and a clear proof that praised famous people can be idiots like the other planets of the planet. Not even fun. Just terrible and crazy shocking waste.
