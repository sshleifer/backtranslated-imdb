Let's hope this is the ultimate nightmare. This is the content of a good thing that has failed. Okay, there is still some satisfaction, but only in the brightest sense. Rachel Talalai was there for the duration of this franchise, she was in production staff and even produced. I do not know what she meant, but this debacle comes with a boy with video games and a guest appearance by Tom and Roseanne Arnold! I wish I had a clue about what she was thinking when she wrote / directed this disappointing piece of garbage. She even tried to divert her audience from the fact that this film was nothing more than an overly popular popcorn movie, instead of resembling a horror, with a fictional use of 3D endings. Are not your spectacles beautiful? And you can protect them! That's equivalent, you just spent $ 9.00 to enrich me. Here are 10 cents. Now, do not you feel special? Sorry, but for me it did not make me feel special. And Freddie had another face lift. I think this is the worst. All the beautiful art that has entered his "appearance" in earlier films has been replaced by an apparently cheaper, less detailed set of prosthetics. Looks like ... less like a burn victim that should be, and more like having a skin disorder. The change in lead makeup so far in the series is at the same level as the change of the main actor. But wait! They did it and did it. I guess it does not matter. But it was important to me. Freddy is no longer Scari. He's just ... another low-paid monster like Leprechaun. It's more ... a dark comedy than the horror classic that this series promises; burdened with what you just hope the writers thought were witty lines and smart reparti (unfortunately, both accounts were not enough). So, there's nothing more to say than grab a popcorn and get ready to smile, because there was not a scary or tense moment in this movie. He estimates 3.2 / 10 of ... Fiend :.
