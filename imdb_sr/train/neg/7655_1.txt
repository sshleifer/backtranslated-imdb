We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. He did it unthinkable. Perhaps he is the only director who has two films in the lower 100 on the IMDb! He's like some kind of movie crap. No matter how little talent exists, and no matter how badly they are, it keeps them going. I know, he finances them all through a kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to continue filming films despite absolute, total failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe. It would not be so bad except that video game developers retain their best features to this type. I really enjoyed the Sam's series in the dark. Even the newest, New Nightmare, was good for several hours of play. There was a good movie from Edward Carnbie's adventure, but that's not it. Now Uwe Boll caught Bloodraine and Hunter: Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine how this guy will cut through adaptations of movie games if he is not stopped. Someone has to take his credit line, or it is necessary for these video game publishers to realize that when he makes a bad movie from a game that kills franchises, nobody is interested in that title anymore. > Think about whether House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark is a more viable game title? No way. The new House of the Dead game comes out for X-Bok and no one will worry. The address is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll. So, if any of you are working for a game publisher, or you know a game publisher, or have access to a game publisher ... please warn them. This film is not even worth a look. I can not separate what I did not like in this pile of fertilizers from the rest. Literally, it's all about shit. Writing, acting, music, CG effects, editing. I thought that if I wait until it appears on a DVD and then I rent it with low expectations, I would not be disappointed. Boy, am I wrong? Never underestimate Uve's ability to extract a large bunch of bulls.
