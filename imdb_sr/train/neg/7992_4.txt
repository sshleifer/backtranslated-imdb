I remember I've seen this movie on TV for a long time. I remember the premise of a movie about a bunch of hotel users who were attacked by ants eating a man. What I did not remember was HOW IT WAS !!! Recently I caught this movie on television late in the night. I'm sure it was a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existence and can never be found anymore! Suzanne Somers (at the height of her career playing Chrissi at Three's Compani) plays a tourist at Lakevood Manor. Workers in the construction industry set up a pool and accidentally harass antenna nest. Or I should say, * MYSTICALLY FAILED MUCH STATE * !! One of the workers is actually attacked by ants. One minute they get them off the clothes one by one, in the next minute they cover them. The following scene shows the skeleton in the dirt. If you thought it was quite unusual, you should see Mirna Loi play the trolleys who are pulling out of Manor from the helicopter! I could almost imagine her relief from getting out of the movie! The final scene depicts Suzanne, Robert Fokorta and the third guy sitting on the floor of the hotel room with their back together, blowing through straws and covered with ants. It is basically a movie. There really is no "catastrophe" or "big star". The intention was at that time to be a "grand-scale" television event. Happiness is if it is thrown at 4:00 am on local television. If you want to catch Suzanne Somers in her best bet, then watch Three's episode. If you want to see Mirna Loi doing something to put bread on the table and pay bills, then watch this movie. 0/10
