Well, Steve Irwin. You have to admire a man who is not just willing to throw himself into a river that is obviously filled with crocs, snakes, lizards, tone of fodder from the above-mentioned reptiles, and mud, not just everyday but with enthusiasm. He never managed to get me to do it, but he managed to get his wife to get closer. This film does not belong to my parallel film category category - movies for people who just had their teeth drunk, have a migraine, or do not have a film experience and therefore love a peaceful spot (currently well-filled with Disney movies). It's too noisy. Well, Steve is too noisy. He is so happy all the time, and he would shorten himself through a teenager of bliss (now I hear: "this film was STUPID") or Tilenol with codeine. I'd say he's catching his enthusiasm, but if he did, I'd have a room full of snakes, and that has not happened yet. I agreed that they are beauties, but I will not even lubricate them. The plot is really predictable. The bad guys were so bad, for a moment I thought I was buying into a consumer electronic store. But the film was filled with animals, both Steve and Terry, for which I looked at him. That plot (if you could call it that way) really was the reason to throw another crocodile into the truck. My expectations were low and I remained so. I was hoping, however, that there would be a bit of a sequel, where Steve and Terry (working on their acting skills) have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur. I still can not believe we will not see Steve again. I hope Terri and the kids will continue to be included in the Australian Zoo and the detection channel, at least. I can not imagine seeing a crocodile, and some Irvin family member does not tell me how wonderful it is to be a crocodile. Crikei!
