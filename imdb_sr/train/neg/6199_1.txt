First technical inspection. The scenario is so slow that the 25-minute story has been uncovered for up to 1 hour and 40 minutes. The dialogue is so straight and truly one-dimensional. "Glam" is pathetic, it seems that they have really raised pupils outside of the class to read a few lines from idiotic management. As for the whole "point" of the story, namely "the war is bad" (oh, there is a shock!) Really does not exist. Without the exit "let us shock and get a great publicity" scene nobody would talk about this film. It's so bad that I actually do not mind thinking about the better things that this money could use. Believe me, I've seen some bad movies of "Emperor New Clothes", but the only thing I can say for them is that they were well shot and well-made while the camera wavered during the two scenes in this! Read all other reviews - avoid at all costs and do not talk about it.
