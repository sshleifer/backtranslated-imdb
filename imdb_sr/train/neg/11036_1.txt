It must be the brightest TV show. This is probably an escape for Jim Belushi and all his bad films. His brother sucked all talent from his younger brother. I hope this show is canceled and I never talk about it again, except in negative use. Jim has to retire or something. Please leave them out of the air. If I have a joke from this show here, I vomit and rinse my eyes with a toothbrush. I'd rather be taken away from the devil myself than watching a full half an hour of that program. I still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running. We all know deeply that we want to record our TV screens when we see Jim's face. In conclusion, I do not pray anymore.
