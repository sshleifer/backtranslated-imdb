Same old and old about Cheu. She completely ignored the really interesting facts of Che's real character. Sodeberg repeated the same boring story of Che. Blesava's seductive story about an Argentine rich man who was so shocked by poverty was Robin Hood who fought alongside the poor, until the CIA killed him. Yes, yes, I've heard all of this before, BORING AND UNTRUE! Che Guevara's reality is very different and far more explosive! The facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messiah, who openly wanted to impose Maoist tyranny on the world. He was so fanatic that at the heaviest time in the cold war he even begged the Soviet Union to destroy New York, Washington, or Los Angeles and bring the world to an end. CHe urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear attack on US cities. By the end of his life, he stated that if his finger was on the button, he would push it. When Khrushchev relaxed and literally saved the world, He was angry at the "betrayal." If Che's recommendations were respected, you would not read this review now. To make the killer maniac become a pop icon, he would make a much more interesting film. It's unbelievable that no director was brave enough to show the right side of Chea and his posthumous media transformation. WHO WILL BE A OCTAL FILM FOR WAR! I thought that making an independent film involves taking REAL RISKS AND BE GROUNDBRAKING! They only hold "safe topics of counterculture", namely "Che cool", "Vall Street bad", "Republican = Nazi", "Bush ek Hitler", "NRA is worse than KGB", "Christians are fanatic and stupid" , etc. ... ad nauseum. Oooh, how funny, how it blows. Tres anti-mainstream and nervous. I'd like to have real coyotes and get in touch with an independent film oligarchy! It would really be bold!
