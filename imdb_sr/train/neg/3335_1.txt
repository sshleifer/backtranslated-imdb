This film story of the cannon is the worst of all and it is a positive proof that a five minute fairy tale does not make the whole film. Poor Sid Caesar as a futile emperor seems to look so stupid that it's hard to watch. Like a cunning tailor, Robert Morse has no charm. Neither his unfortunate nephew (Jason Carter) "songs" are terrible and only slow down what is complicated. There is practically no direction, and the auxiliary characters add very little. Lisette Anthony is as beautiful as the Imperial daughter, but her voice is obviously called for some reason, a fate shared by many of the smaller players. And the movie creeps with the rhythm of the snails. Hans Christian Andersen must have turned the salva into a grave when it appeared. It can be honestly said, at least about this film story, not a surprise that she went straight to the video oblivion.
