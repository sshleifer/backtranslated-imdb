I admit I was only watching a few episodes, but each one looked completely different from the other. It seems that after the first season, the producers decided to completely refresh the show, cast characters, introduce new ones, and re-write the entire dynamic display. As you probably already assumed, the show is about the unusual Unpredictable teenager Holly (Amanda Bines) who moves with her high sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) in New York. Enough enough premise: odd pair + fish from water + high jink. While I miss sitcomi once, this show unfortunately misses the trail on the funny many times, and it's sad because they have a decent talent. In addition, they insisted on changing the performance (Val lived with the acting team of a season, and then he suddenly went away and opens a bakery? What happens when things change drastically, you get the feeling that even * shows * knows that it's bad. I mean, brand new sets, characters written off and new regular lines! On the side of the note (this is just a hassle), I know this is a television show and it's not real at all, but Val and Holly end up living in a huge attic duplex (there are stairs) with a terrace ... in MANHATTAN ! Are you serious!?
