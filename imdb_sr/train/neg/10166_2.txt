If he wanted to be accurate, he should have picked up some Frisco natives, not a bunch of NI players who knew nothing about Sucka Free (not Sucker Free). I lived in SF all my life, and people do not speak here or do not act the way actors did it. Everything was over dramatized, and the only cat I saw from the bay was JT Big Figga with her little camera as a benchmark. There is no shock that he was the only one in a movie that was really dressed like cats here (ie His Varriors jersey). I never once noticed that someone wears gigantic or craft equipment; Instead, he fitted them into some sour-made SF or Oakland jerseys that are not even sold here. HP does not have bowling alarms, Black and Asian gangs do not carry their heads or bracelets with colors of Africa or the Chinese Olympic team, nor any Chinese gangster wearing Iao Ming jersey and trying to sound black while shooting hoops. Furthermore, while the iuppie community now attacked the Mission, all that was shown was a white type and a self-proclaimed "100% West Coast Borikua". This is not New York! The Puerto Ricans are few here, and the Latinos in the Mission are very, very different from the one shown here, which was no doubt from New York. Also, HP is not the only black neighborhood in the city. A precise display would show the drama between HP sets in their own hood, as well as Fillmore, Sunnidale, Lakeviev, etc. This film could have been much better that Lee had done a little more homework and had a better story to work.
