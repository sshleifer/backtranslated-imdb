Since I'm a big fan of Corman's horror films, I expected from his Westerner a bit more than I got. Well, I had a good time. I had almost as much laughter as watching the Blazing Saddles Mello Brookes. Take a look at the spectacle of moving rubber tires in the old West Prera. You can kill time by counting if it happens that otherwise a boring scene happens. And horses, of course, also have gears in them, considering fast speed. Look at the queen of the bar room in the traditional wild saloon, working on a number that resembles a particular fashion dance from the 1920s, decades here before the style is invented. I hope the salon around them will not be crushed. At the center of all this, the main actors are doing a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Haies are really good. Special praise for them that they did the best they could with the material that seemed to be mostly erected with the 'John Guitar', but not exactly impressed in the same way. But there really is nothing wrong with this ridiculous West. Just like in a bad old horror movie, it may not work in one direction, but it will still be able to give joy. That's one of the reasons why Corman's business likes me and I dare recommend you to experience this movie if you have a chance.
