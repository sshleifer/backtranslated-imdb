I have no idea why they made this version of "Persuasion" when they already had that nice mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I guess they wanted to make a feature-length version, but of course there was a lot to be done; Unfortunately, what ended up on the floor of the separa was wonderful humor and humor, leaving a movie that was a mere melodrama rather than a fun exhibition of English manners and customs. Also, the characters were shallow and uninteresting. They had a poor Anne who rushed up and down the streets after Captain Ventvorth was a stupid modern adolescent (and if you happen to be a stupid modern adolescent who reads this, let me tell you: running for a man like a woman in heat is not cool). This is something that a well-fed wife of Napoleon would never have done, and especially this stupid heroine. Some have said that they found this antique funny; my reaction was not laughter, it was already anger. The very idea of ​​such a distortion of Austen's work is under contempt. It was terrible.
