I've seen a lot of bad movies. I love bad movies. Especially bad action movies. I saw (and enjoyed) all the films of Jean-Claude Van Damme, including the one in which he is his clone, both of which he plays twins, and all three of which are cyborgs. I actually own one in which he plays a fashion designer and fights in a truck full of durvins. (Hey, if anything, he has a great ass and you can almost always see him. With a DVD you can even pause and zoom in!) So you can trust me when I say that this movie is so bad, it makes Plan 9 look like Citizen Kane. Everything about Snake Eater is bad. The plot is bad. The script is bad. The gatherings are bad. Fighting is bad. Stops are bad. FKS is bad. The acting is spectacular, terrestrial-time nasty, very likely showing the worst performances of each so-called. The actor in the acting team, including Lorenz Lamas, and that really does say something. And I would be willing to bet everyone who is involved in this movie is bad in bed to rise. SPECIALLY Lorenzo Lamas. It manages to be unintentionally ridiculous, so it's not a complete loss. However, I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either an innocent idiot or very, very uprooted. I could sit through it myself because I had to watch something to turn me away from the rinse of my urine from my laundry. It did not much help, but it was better than nothing. One point for Ron Palillo's knee as a gay pencil.
