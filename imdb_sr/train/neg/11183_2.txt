"The People I Know" is an awkward person for whom nobody has to work hard and nobody cares about it - despite the efforts of a talented actor. Pacino is performing her usual tour as Eli Vurman, a former public agent who has gone through moral corruption. But, unlike Michael Corleone, it is impossible to have an emotional investment in this character, his dilemma, or his fate. The film follows Ellie's preparations for the benefit of a liberal political cause, while hindering clients (Ryan O'Neal, good in the signed section) of the latest "dirty laundry" - in this case, a TV actress embracing in wrong people. Tea Leoni brings her usual star to this accompanying role, although her script does not do much work. Like Eli's daughter-in-law, Kim Basinger manages to sympathize despite the incredible plot mechanics. This film is strictly for those who like to watch Pacin to mock him and enjoy the other principles. Unfortunately, between scenarios and directing, "People I know" is strictly amateur. Hence his limited theater edition and a quick trip to DVD. Consider yourself warned.
