The film about Viken (Eric Gavin) who has a husband from Mountie who loves ... but he likes sex! During the film, she gets more men in bed - including her husband and brother! There is also a (haughty) lesbian sequence. This film put Russ Meier on the map and was (I believe) the first movie to be praised by critics. He was a big hit when he came out. Unfortunately, it does not go well. Good directed and Eric Gavin is brilliant (whatever happened to her), and she was very colorful ... but according to today's standards, she is extremely charming. . I'm surprised at the NC-17 rating now - there's no hardcore sex and there are only females in toples and there are no male nudes at all. It was also (unfortunately) quite boring and the addition of politics was in the end confusing (and quite stupid). Still, it's worth considering what was considered to be very shocking in 1968. I supposedly saw a cut version (which has a R rating), but I only heard a few seconds there and there are missing. Meier's next film "Beiond the Vallei of Dolls" is a much better and very good date. Catch it instead.
