I do not know about you, but what I love about cartoons Tom and Jerry is (often violent) interaction between two characters. The man in Manhattan sees Jerry leaving Tom behind him to have an adventure in New York, and, as far as I'm concerned, this definitely suffers from a cat's lack! Great apples could be for other T & J fans who commented here on the IMDb, I could not wait for this self-contained waste to finish, so I can watch the next cartoon on my DVD. In fact, the only part of the whole episode I truly enjoyed was when Jerry almost "bought the farm", he was surely hanging from the end of broken candles, hundreds of meters above the road.
