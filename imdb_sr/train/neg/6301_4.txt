Despite the supreme work of supporting actors and intelligent scriptwriter Alan Plater, this film suffers from a fatal flaw - the lack of a central character / actor's charm. One of the characters describes the character of Richard E Grant as a "coward" and, unfortunately, perfectly sums it up. There is nothing about him or his performance that it would be plausible for his girlfriend and the publisher of a higher class to spend so much time and emotional effort on him. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and completely boring. Part was looking for an actor who can make you love him even when he is following - Evan McGregor, for example. This irritating and totally unpleasant effect. All I wanted was to shake him and tell him to get over himself.
