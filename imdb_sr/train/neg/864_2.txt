Although there is a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from, this Sukubus is often referred to as the best Jess Franco film. Even the legendary director Fritz Lang includes 'Succubus' in his favorites. So, maybe that's me, but I thought it was a terribly boring and overly confusing film. The opening is great, and Janine Reinaud shows how SM plays the stage. From here it's all downhill, unfortunately. Reina's character is a maneater who eventually kills her lover in some kind of trance. Franco had a decent job budget and spent it well in beautiful locations, beautiful photography and a fascinating musical scorecard. This could really be his biggest film, that there was not a silly and uninteresting story. It should be psychedelic, but I would say that sophomoric is a better term for describing what is shown here. Half the time, you have no idea what's happening or what's been said, and even a short 80-minute duration lasts for years. This is by no means the best Frankish movie. I would not even recommend it to be stubborn fans of exploitation. If you're looking for a superior film Jess Franco, try to get your hands on 'Las Vampires', 'Terrible Dr. Orloff' or 'Female Vampire'.
