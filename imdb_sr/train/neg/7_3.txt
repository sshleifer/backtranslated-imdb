This is a really new party. Although there are many bad films. In the genre Gangster / Another scene it's hard to have a convincing story (these movies are not, I think Sebastian's motives, for example, can not be any more far-fetched and exhausted clichÃ©s.) Then you should also set the relationship Character that is convincing (this film is not.) Surely Tristan is dragged from his family, but why is it again? what is the deal with his father that he must seek permission to leave his age? interesting picture, however, to ask about the lack and the need for rebellious behavior of children in the higher class family. But this film does not go that way. Although there would be a potential judging by the random Backflashes. Has not he been down and out, why is he doing it again? So, there are some interesting questions that are set here for a solid social critical drama (but again, this movie is simply not, because of focusing on "cool" production techniques and special effects and does not give characters the moment to think and, above all, force the story along the road where they want to be and does not pay attention to the fact that the story breathes and evolves naturally.) She wants to be a drama that does not glorify abuse of substances and violence (these days it would be politically incorrect, right?), but on the other hand it is nothing more than a cheap action fi m (as there are so many) the average number of actors and Vinnie Jones who managed to completely destroy what was left of his reputation doing what always works. All in all, I .. just ... I can not recommend it. br> 1 for Vinnie and 2 for installation.
