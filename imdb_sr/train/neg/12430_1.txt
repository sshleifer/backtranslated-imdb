Home Alone 3 is one of my least favorite movies. It's a harvesting cream, or if you're inclined to be cynical, because it's up there (or below) things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it could have been worse than the two, since the two of them at least occasionally laughed at their stupidity. This always tormented me with pain and clanged when the credits began to roll. No other movie brought me to pain. Now I will point out why this film is so incredibly terrible. First of all, the plot is ridiculous. It turns around the car chip on the remote control (?!) Which is lost and how the terrorists want it. Stupid thing. The follow-up action is similar to that of the other two Home Alones, with boobitraps and all that, but watching these boobiripps, instead of being ridiculous, is incredibly unpleasant to watch. Once I laughed (or even smiled), I was constantly rattling and hoping that the terrorists would catch the child. The bird, instead of giving it a comic relief, was unbridled and boring. The acting, as it does a bunch of no names, ranges from the poor to the horrible. There is not a good performance here. Alek D.Linz is absolutely unsuitable and immature as a kid, while terrorists act (and judging by their films, they look) because they are quickly picked up from the street ... and well, that's it. I can see some people who say: "Man, it's for kids. Man, kids can like you, but they can get a lot better. See Monsters Inc. and Toi Story before you think about it. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (who are shit-seeing these criticisms for more) are better than this! So, in short, this is an incredibly horrible movie. It's obviously recycled for the money, because it almost completely unraveled the first two; the only thing is to completely offend the first two. No man, child or anyone else should find any reason to see Home Alo no 3. Ever. It's bad. 0/5 star
