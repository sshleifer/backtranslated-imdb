Well, basically, the film is burning! Wizard Blair meets Sean Penn's thoughtful fantasy about going to Iraq to show the world what the "war on terrorism" really is. The script sounds like he wrote 8th grade (no offense for eighth grade students); the two main actors are exaggerating in the whole film; they used the wrong type of camera and the wrong kind of film (I do not know anything about these things - but it just did not look like the real documentary I was watching), and worst of all, Christian Johnson took a great idea and made it shit. It reminded me of the time I tried to draw a picture of my dog ​​and ended up with a very bad thing like a figure that looked more like a gigantic shit. I'd rather watch Blair-witch VIII than go through it again.
