Simply put: the film is boring. Cliché clichés is confirmed and stories never come together. It seems that the director was unsure of making a movie or a documentary. The main action is very thin (the CIA agent is ordered to kill the prince of oil, catch him, then warn the prince (why?)) And that is why some elements have been added to make the film more interesting. Thus, the child dies, which results in the father's "natural" answer: the free counseling of a person who is indirectly responsible for the death of his son. The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and holds him around, why, nobody knows. Some children become suicidal terrorists and blow up the boat. All in all, this is one of the worst movies I've seen for some time. I did not entertain myself or intellectually disputed. I did not laugh or cry, I did not understand, nor was I forced to learn more or to take some reason. It did not mean anything to me, which in my eyes is the worst that can be said about the movie.
