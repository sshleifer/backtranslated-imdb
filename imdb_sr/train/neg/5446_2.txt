For faithful fans of Duran Duran who want to watch a good music spot, skip this one. The producers decided to become creative and make this video from the '80s some of the science-fiction stories, including the evil Barbarella from which the band got its name. What makes this idea unsuccessful is that in the midst of some of the great Durant Duran songs of the 80's, there are confusing and boring cutting scenes that show that a fictional antagonist is trying to stop the band at one of his concerts . Not only good music is constantly interrupted, but we must suffer from a cheap merger story led by evil Dr. Mario. It's almost too much to submit. 2/10
