Direction must be a problem here. I recently heard John Cliff talk about working on a skateboard for Favlity Tovers. He should have attacked his car with a branch. The first branch was too weak and not funny. The other branch was too stiff to make it funny. The third was weak enough to be ridiculous. This kind of attention to detail is missing in "Corki Romano". No matter how uncomfortable, this comic piece was not fixed and did not stay on the floor of the cutting room. One of the values ​​I can find in this movie is the study of a very wrong film that somehow escaped into distribution without having corrected it. The number of reviews that praise this absolute time loss drives my suspicion that some people are paid to promote titles. I can not figure out how someone older than 9 years can evaluate this title more than 4, MAKS. I mean, come on, 5 is average. I can not even imagine anyone, even those who earn money, judging him even on average. And, hey, I actually love the Three Stooges and I can even tolerate Ed Vood!
