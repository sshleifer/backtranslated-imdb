How is it possible that no journalist or critic has reminded us of similarity to that other better Flemish film "Congo Express" (1986)? There are also some characters in the Congo Express together, without any interaction: Jean, (de Congolees), a worker, two taxis, a street singer, Roger, Gui, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star, and Luc Gubbels is not. This should not be the reason for perversion of the fault in the script (if there is a script) in any case the wind blow. The joke (the only!) At the party around the ice in the fridge was taken from that great flamboyant film "De Vitte (1934)" where De Vitte puts too much salt on potatoes. Some accidents happen in the film, but there is no explanation. Tom Barman brings us a movie that is more like an experiment for watching TV than a movie theater. Another missed opportunity for a Flemish movie theater.
