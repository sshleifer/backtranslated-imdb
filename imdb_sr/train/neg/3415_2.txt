In a standard way, this is a really horrible movie. However, he estimates the almost perfect result on the unwanted comedy scale. I can remember a few real comedies that make me funny how I watched this movie. The spirit of Andy Griffith dressed in Native American Garbance dance sends me into hysteria every time. I would not waste gas or energy in a video store to rent it, but if you accidentally lie on the couch at 3 am and come on TV, take a look at it.
