If you enjoy the original SNL and show you then avoid this film at all costs. When we first got out, my friends and I waited for more than an hour to enter a sold-out movie house. At half the film, the theater was 3/4 empty. We refused to go thinking that it would be better. When the film is over, we are the only ones left in the theater. The film lasted only one day in all theaters and then disappeared from sight. In interviews with Mr Mike, he declined to comment on this film. The film was an internal joke about SNL episodes that appeared immediately after filming and closing in one day. We all tried to contact "Mr. Mike" by telephone and mail in order to get a refund, but they were completely ignored.
