In one sense, it's like the 'Wizard of Oz', with Paris in black and white and the Riviera in color. But this is allegedly about possessive love, destructiveness and moral decadence, while in fact it is about designer dresses, River River pictures, many big expensive cars, and musical and dance interludes suggested by Vincent Minnelli in one of their days. It can be watched, but it is an extraordinary example of the desperate, dark material of the chart and glitzy style in the opposite directions. (Was it a model for Talented Mr. Ripley? Does anyone feel affinity between Jean Seber and Meta Damon?)
