Isabel Allende's magical, lyric novel about three generations of aristocratic South American family was vandalized. The arrogant film that resulted - mainly thanks to the magnificent actors of English actors, who were completely incapable of taking away the ailing Latin melody of Alendina characters, and the Scandinavian director's hand - was so uncomfortable in his skin that I returned for the second time to the theater in order to be he convinced me that I did not miss something important that could change my mind. To my disappointment, I did not miss anything. None of Meril Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close, and Vanessa Redgrave could not get rid of the trap set by director Bille August. Everyone looked perfectly stiff and resigned, as if trying, as little effort as possible, they expected to disappear unnoticed in beautiful weather sets. (Yes, the film was art directed within one inch of your life.) It is interesting that the designer is allowed to put KFC products in a prominent place in a scene that takes place around the 1970s before KFC was created. At that time, he was known for his original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even pardon, what is it, in fact, the Kentucky Fried Chicken in the military dictatorship in South America in 1970? American fast food chains did not hit South America until the early 1980s. The House of Spirits should have been a film event in 1993. Because he was so clubly and slavishly loyal to his vague idea of ​​what the novel presented, Miramak had to make him an artistic film. As a result, it was neither an event nor an art. And for this, Isabel Allende was supposed to file a rape suit.
