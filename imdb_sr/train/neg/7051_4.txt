Film about solving the problem of growing up and loyalty to yourself, Blue Juiceu is a candy for those who love surfing and Cornwall. Sean Pertvee is the true star of this film, while more famous Catherine Zeta Jones plays her girlfriend, and Evan McGregor plays his drug addict. For those who do not like surfing or Cornwall at all, you will see that it takes a long time before the movie thinks it's interesting. The start is slow and it takes too long to make long recordings of only a little interesting landscape. Plus, too many main characters lead to the fact that most of them are one-dimensional. Action is an interesting idea, but due to shallow characters you have no idea why they act in the situations they are in. Only Evan, Sean and Catherine characters make this movie worthwhile to be on the video cassette, which is why it was only released on video in the US after Evan and Catherine reached the mainstream fame.
