This is another production of North East Florida, recorded mainly in and near Fernandin's beach and Kingsley plant. I was quite surprised that the company managed to take over the main street on Fernandin's beach as long as it needed to take street scenes. The film is beautiful and pretty bad. Tami Erin is sweet, but exaggerated. Eileen Brennan exaggerated even more. Good for young children, or for those who like flakes in high doses. 4 from the Miller-Movies formula.
