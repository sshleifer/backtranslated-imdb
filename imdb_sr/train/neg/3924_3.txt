A really horrible, pretentious, endless movie. It seems that Bellocchio's director is in love with the beautiful face and figure of his actress Detmers - who can blame him? But perhaps, it might just have been to focus a bit more on a good and interesting movie. I hate when a movie about sex is an "artistic film" just to become "more respectable". Frequent, occasionally sexy sexy scenes are the only reason for the existence of this film. Whether or not it's worth going through the rest of the image is a strictly flavoring thing. (*)
