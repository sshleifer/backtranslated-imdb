The worst movie I've ever seen since Gingerale in the afternoon. I suppose this is a horror / comedy. I mainly predicted every scene in this movie. Special effects were not so special. I believe that I could come up with such good effects from what I was lying around the house. I wish I could say something good about this film, but I'm afraid I can not. Even Coolio should be ashamed of appearing in such a party. After a bit of thinking, I have one thing to say about this movie - it's over.
