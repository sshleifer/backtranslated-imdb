In the future, in 1985, a government commission headed by Hovard Hessemann will hold hearings on the first uncensored television network. They sample the program, which plays as a series of skitches. I can call good jump films on the one hand, not my thumb. "Amazon Women on the Moon", "Kentucky Fried Movie", "The Sense of Life" and "Mr. Mike's Mondo Video". Pay attention to how I did not mention "Tunnel Vision"? The reason for this is that this film is a cinema-like death. None of the sketches is not even funny, or even the least smart. It takes some sort of great incompetence for those who deal with the film so that no laughter can be taken from me. frontal
