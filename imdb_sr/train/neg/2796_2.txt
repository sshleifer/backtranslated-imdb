Mostly, On Demand delivers pretty horror horror films, and offers only other horror films that everyone has already seen, and already have their own opinion. It was either this, or Invisible (I love Mark Vahlberg films), which I did not see, and in fact I was in the movie watching my mood, which does not happen often, because I've already watched all the movies a million times, and that's a lot of movies, and I do not have much interest in new films, and the boy, this film made me regret it. I do not want to put any spoilers, I'm just going to tell you that only FEV from very small actors in this movie is half decent. I think that the main girl, dead who kills everything, is very boring, but convincing; I'd take her for a psycho bitch every day, so she's okay, though she's lame. Blood is not that big, only a few murders, or I can say "wounds" are fine, but you do not see much and there are no body parts in the film to make the injuries look more convincing. At the end of the film, I begged my girlfriend to exclude him, and as a member of the band, parts of 'shooting' were not interesting either, although what happened really happened when they were filmed. I'm done, if you want to watch this, make yourself.
