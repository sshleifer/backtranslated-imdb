Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very incredible couple in a very inconvenient film. The film shows that Ustinov was released from prison for embezzlement. He convinced Robert Morley to leave, in order to take over his identity and start hacking computers at a very fan company led by Karl Malden and Bob Nevhart, another unusual duo for movies. Morley sounds just like it did in 1938, "Marie Antoinette". Maybe he had to return to that genre. This film is at best funny. It's hard to believe that next year, Maggie Smith completely changed the way and gave a breakthrough Oscar performance in "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." Smith seems obviously a stupid head here, but at the end of the film, she is the brain of clothes. It's a shame that writing did not go with her.
