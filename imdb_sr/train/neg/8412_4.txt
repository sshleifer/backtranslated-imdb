I just saw DreamGirls yesterday, and I was really pushed. Despite all the Oscars, this is nothing special. Anyone who was really impressed with this film never made any effort to see any of the true movie music classics. In addition to the great musical and dramatic performance of Eddie Murphy, Dreamgirls is just a glorified TV film with no style and talent. Just a bunch of amateurs singing on each other! Now, the first half hour was good, but it made me nervous that the great performances of Edvy Murphy were shortened and interrupted by the assemblies. These were the best songs and the best performances in the movie. And part of the movie "Rising to the Top" was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any momentum. The remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless, messy mess that was neither real nor fantastic enough to be interesting. He was also visually boring and included too many sounding tunes. Condon did not try to convert any melody into big shows as I expected. Each number in the second half was only one big plan for other people who "sang" one another. And the way they shot at Hudson's big "loves me" number was criminal! Kondon just shot her on stage - without drama! God sucked! And pay attention to everything involved - so that the "dialogue that sings" could work on the scene, but DO NOT WORK IN FILMS (see the unfavorable failures of Evita and Phantom). All this "Teeeell iouuuu something Efff-ieeee!" Shit was to be left on the floor of the assembly. These are not "songs". Again, the film - besides the amazing Eddie Murphy's performance - was nothing more than a celebrated TV movie. For a PR film for this movie, it must have been megabooks! I wonder how much money was spent to pretend to be "one to win" an Oscar? On the whole, this film is, apart from Eddie, NOVHERE NEAR from the Oscar film! (except for Eddie) I would rank it up there from Grease 2. BIG disappointment, especially after all (very extra $ I) hypo!
