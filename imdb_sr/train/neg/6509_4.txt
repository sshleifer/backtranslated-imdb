Sean Bean is great, as well as photos, locations and costumes. However, the plot is somewhat confused, and the conclusion is flat. The story was replaced by Cornwell's novel, not for the better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better read than seen. Sharpe was too tightly entrenched, unlike his literary alter ego, who seemed intelligent and decisive in spite of his fears in his new role as a promoted officer. I really enjoyed the short scene in which Sharpe stumbled upon the "real" officer, and after a brief break and a penetrating look, he pushed a surprised and frightened policeman back. He sets a tone for his later trials as a commanding officer. Rating: "4" of "10."
