I saw him at the UCSB's loud festival and was shocked to receive the gold reel award. I was not the only one, since the audience had mixed reactions to the piece. I thought there were many other better moves there, but then I learned that the judges were deeply entrenched in the field of film theory and other artistic shit. While cinema and editing are in line with many other short films, narration is nothing more than your average student work. It seems that "serious" student films should include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal combat and eventual suicide - Nick and Kate are performed and include all three. Please, be original! Oh, and maybe it's the opinion of my outsiders, but the guy from Montecito sounds a little fake. Does anyone else think so?
