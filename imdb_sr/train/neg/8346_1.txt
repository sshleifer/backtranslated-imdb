The address was supposed to be a walker. The guy spends 90% of the movie walk. He does not know what he wants or what he is. Pass life through the stealing identity of the people for nothing. It does not get any benefit, there is no money, nothing is pretending to be another person. No body could understand why it turns out to be someone else. It was clear in this film that he loved his father and that he was a good son. But the rest is bullshit. Perhaps the director is looser who would want to be someone else. But what he really needs to do is get the right job, because after his film, I do not think there is a chance to become a film producer.
