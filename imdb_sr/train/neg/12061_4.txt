Charles Bronson plays Lt Crove as a police detective who announces the war to the pimp Duke (Juan Fernandez), who kidnaps a daughter of a Japanese businessman who is a man who sexually harassed Crowe's daughter (Ami Hathavai) in this crazy but stylish-led thriller of revenge. Knights may not be for everyone with some disturbing themes, but it's well made and really fun.
