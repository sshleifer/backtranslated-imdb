I watched the dinosaurs all day and had the same basic problem all day. They do not believe in firearms. It does not seem to be about them or anything like that. Bullets _bounce_ off dinosaurs! Maybe it's because they died out millions of years before finding gunshot, and the laws of physics were completely different then ... Aah, no. Come on. If they are close enough to work chemically today, they should be vulnerable to fast (even subsonal) lead missiles. It's so simple. Watch, the hardened reptiles on the planet today, alligators and crocodiles, are completely susceptible to the basic fire from the rifle. They are nothing magical. You can shoot from the gun right through the heavy scales on their back. They do not take punch bullets or anything special. Small bullets break through them, they just do not kill them. Some (but not very large) bullets are preferred because the challenge (like most games) is to kill an animal with one shot, so it does not start. (Hunters believe it is immoral to allow prey to escape and die unexplored.) Most animals, including predators, are easily repelled by shooting. Between noise and pain, even from a deadly wound, most will escape. The exception is the big bears, who are so fearless that they are just furious because of the fatal wounds. Cape buffalo is considered very dangerous because it is well known to be filled when wounded. We saw a video of the big bulls of the bunch of bison that saved calfs from the whole lion pride. A big cat will run if it can, but if it can not, it is charged as the final act of despair. Where T.Rek could fit into this spectrum is not known. Their behavior was simply not observed. With these larger animals, safe hunting becomes a matter of applying an appropriate large and powerful projectile, and / or applying a few of them quickly enough to counter its charge. With T.Rekom, of course, this could be a serious problem. I saw the T.Reka skull (they have one in the center of the museum) and carry a gun that is large enough to be impractical. Chewing doors with much smaller fires could be a more sustainable approach. Small bullets would still shoot them, they would not just refuse just because the animal is too big to kill easily! So, here we have Cortez and his people (this is probably the famous Mexican campaign) captured by American natives and scheduled for the victim on the pyramid. It seems that all of these human victims were about to quench the bloodthirsty T.Rekes who terrorized the continent of the day. Instead of eating their hearts and feeding the lizards, Cortez and others tell the Aztecs to let them go and kill them. Okay, maybe they do not have M-16 like the guys from the "Carnosaur" series, but they have quartz, females, sharp bars (big, made of trees) and swords. Maybe it's a little less uneven than a soldier with a full car, but they have a few guys and I'd bet on them over the dinosaurs. Oh, wait, there's a cassette, about 4 inches. It's just a map to break the Tiranosaurus skull! So they laid a trap, with a group of people, a cannon, pointed rods in the cavern, and lured the first T.Reka into it, using a pretty brown girl like a bait. Cortez points out that they will not have time to recharge, so they will have to close the range until they are sure of their goal. T.Rek completely ignores their repulsiveness from quake fire, and we see both arrow arrows _i_ cannon ball _bounce_ off! Forget. End of credibility. A crossbow bolt would beat Cortez's torso shield, and a four-shot cannon ball could penetrate through the hull of a wooden boat! I think that _hhale_ could endure a cannon of 4 inches?) And here is T.Reka, he still stands, does not even bleed. So, Cortez takes him into the canyon, where he falls on the pointed rods, which (by magic) penetrate and kill him. Iaaai, pinch rods! Dinos is not completely unbreakable for the shooting - they manage to get out of the second pistol. This starts, so it's not as bad as a bear or a buffoon, at least in movies. They kill another dinosaur with a bomb - made of zucchini full of powder and gemstones. My money would still be on the cannon. Its engineering function is to concentrate all the energy of the barrel in one direction - according to the target. The bomb is a much more diffuse application of force. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _. (Consider: a piercing bomb against a fire.) A pile of lighted guns will simply go to POOF. (Believe me that.)
