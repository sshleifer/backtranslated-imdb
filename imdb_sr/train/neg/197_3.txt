While there was a big Western James Arnes, this film fell as the worst Alamo film ever made. The story was terrible, inaccuracy through all this, and it's just untrue to get started! Continuity was thrown on four winds. Has anyone caught the order? The Mexicans were stupid enough to fire the cannons that apparently had mud and bars that still flowed out of the pipe. Come on! Then there's a funny Hat Brian Kit! The buyer must be absent or something like that. Or just out of their minds!
