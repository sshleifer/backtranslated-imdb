It seems that several people who watched this movie watched him only because he was shot near the place where they live. How is it for the bell to support? If this film was shot near the place where I lived, I would not mention it in my review. It's scary! A few reviews indicate that this film is a fake or a language in a horror movie, it's not even that. It's sad to watch this movie as a comedy, because it is not only a bad attempt for a horror movie, but also as a comedy. I laughed at how incredibly bad the movie was. This movie has two good things for it, a mask and a weapon of choice, unfortunately it would be more interesting to watch an hour half a mask and a weapon that lay on the table and then watching this garbage. The social comment behind the film is also ridiculous, malicious and stupid. Do not bother with this movie, but you've lost time reading this review and do not lose anymore on this movie. Arrggghhh! It was frustrating that such films are even made. I expected that the entire acting team would be assigned to Alan Smite, the name used when a person, usually a director, does not want to be attributed to the film because he is so bad. nothing has been repaid in this movie, I spent $ 1.19 on rent and I feel I was kidnapped. Avoid. 1 of 10
