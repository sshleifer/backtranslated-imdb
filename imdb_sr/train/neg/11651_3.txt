Given that this film has been compiled in less than a year, its shortness can be explained (81 minutes - including final credits, so about 76 minutes of a real movie). But what can not be explained is the lack of humor the previous film possessed. The pickups are quick and sometimes even funny. The only real ridiculous parts are the quickest cry on Nike basketball places, the display of James Voodoo in the image of MacDonald Sid in Ekorcist, and pieces scattered over the film. Very inconvenient was the takeover of Charlie's Angels, who, as the first Scari Movie and Matrix scene, basically reconstructed the scene without much humor inserted into it. Today's youth may not be able to connect to the jokes of classic movies about supernatural horrors of the 70's, such as the Exorcist and perhaps the Poltergeist, in the '80s. Al. I hope that for a horrible movie 3 it will take a bit of time to merge, making the translations more pleasant. One thing though, the film has more than the last look for the promise of the young actress Anna Faris (for which I will admit that it was extremely hot below). Just for her casting and acting ability, I give this film "3" from "10".
