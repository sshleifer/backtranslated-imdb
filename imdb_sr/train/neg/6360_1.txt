Can I get back my $ 13.00? I'd rather watch "Hidro-Electric Pover Comes to North America". Again. This is a movie with one voice. The same voice, which comes from every person's mouth regardless of age and sex. In order to listen to this voice again, I would have to charge at least $ 150 an hour. And I do not take insurance. The strange sight of Vill Ferrell turned into Voodie. But I do not think imaginative throwing is enough. They should wait until they tell the story before they try to make a movie. Unless it works just for money. And if that's the case, why not just reissue the All-Rap version "What's Tiger Lily?"
