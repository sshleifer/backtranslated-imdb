It's one of those stereotypical mtv generations of dance films, and I do not see where all this is 'your bad' trash. The acting is horrible, it follows the same story as all the other 'dance' movies there. It's horrible! The name should scream and not look. "How it moves." Since movie titles ignore grammar? At least some dance films had half a decent dance scene, and they do not even deserve an hour. I give him 1 out of 10, just because there is no zero. Seriously begging anyone who has an IC over 60 not to look at this, not to spend his money. 1.6 / 10 should say everything. This film should not even be filmed.
