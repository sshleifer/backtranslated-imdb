Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stand Ben anymore. How is this man allowed to still film movies, that's beyond me. I can not understand how this happens if I do a job in the way I do in a film that gets fired and I own a company ... I would have to fire myself. Gosh! This film was just ordinary, couples, a stinking bunch of POOs, which must be vapoorized if possible. I have to say something else that the 10-line text line in the commentary is idiotic. What's wrong with just saying a few things about the movie? I will never understand why websites will need a short novel written when it sometimes needs a brief comment.
