I agree with the previous comment, what a disappointment. I rented him thinking that it would be a good movie since Mira and Olivier are in it. I was surprised by their performance, they expected more because they were good actors. I thought it was a slow start, but it worsened. I even laughed at some bad moves! when it should be a mysterious movie. You can even guess who's the killer in advance !!! For what really happened? I'm sorry to say, but do not even bother wasting time and money. Barely !!!
