Frank Sinatra was far from an ideal actor for Westerns. He was an excellent actor, From Eve to Eternity and Man with a Golden Hand are proof of that, but he did not have the physical structure of the Western hero, you identified him as an urban type. But he tried to do his job well in Johnny End, the fact that the film was a failure at the box office is not his fault. I blame it on two factors: a) the story was too unusual, especially in the fact that Sinatra acts more like a criminal than a hero during the film. In a genre where people expect a certain pattern, in order to separate from it, the film must be very good. b) The story is not convincing, it's hard to believe that the whole city will allow Sinatra to do everything he wants just because he fears his brother. Also, when a man shows him a special case that will open the doorway so he does not have to pull the gun, you wonder if it will make it unbearable, why not everyone has adopted it? I do not think this film should have been withdrawn, because it is certainly worth watching any movie with the Sinatra, and despite its shortcomings, it is still pleasing
