Voodi Allen, when he is at his best, has one of the sharpest pencils. It can make an acute observation and make it around the impact line like no one else. However, when in the worst case his films can stink pretentiousness. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" have this stench from opening to closing. The setting is one of his more intriguing ideas for some time. Four friends sit in a restaurant and talk about whether the essence of life is comedy or drama. To resolve this argument, a man connects the beginning of the story and asks the other two men to argue (one comedian, another playwright) whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy. The two men then continue the story and the film shows the stories they are tweaking. Now, when I first heard about this movie, I realized that they are telling the same story, the genre (comedy or drama) changes only according to how you watch it. That would be interesting. However, stories share only one major element and several side elements. These are quite different stories with great disagreements. The drama is so stiffly sketched and pretentious that it can only function as a self-parody. If this is the point, then it has failed, because these elements prevent the audience from feeling any emotional investment in any character. Comedy is a story that has moments of success, but they are still short and short-lived. Vill Farrell is apparently thought to be a stand-in for Voody, but he could play this figure much more convincingly without adding Voodie's pussies and handkerchiefs. Voodi is the best in Voodi. When someone else tries, they do not play the character, they model a recognizable actor. This kind of thing just attracts the audience from the story. My favorite Voodoo Allen movie makes me leave the theater a little lighter in spirit than I walked in. my money back.
