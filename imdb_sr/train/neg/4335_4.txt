The film and acting are not bad, and Jai Hernandez is doing a good job by playing Calito Brigante, but the movie forgets that this is a precondition for a hit movie. Producers of this sign obviously did not watch the original Carlita's path or at least did not care about continuity. This film has been overtaken, which means that the original film has already exposed some history for us, and this film should end where the original begins or at least leads to it. None of Carlit's close-up old friends from the original do not appear in this movie, they are not even mentioned. Luis Guzman, Pachanga in the original, is in the movie, but plays a completely different character. The original took place in 1975, and the bubbling takes place in 1969-70. Given that this film takes place less than 5 years earlier, do not you think that one of Carlit's long-time friends would appear? In the original, Carlito began exiting the prison after spending five years in prison. It's just a few months between the end of the previous and the beginning of the original! *** Semi Spoiler *** We know from the beginning of the original, Carlito spent 5 years in prison so that when the sign gives this Hollivood a happy ending, it is an insult to the intelligence of the fans of the original. What happened to Gail? This is a lack of continuity that this film made directly on the video edition.
