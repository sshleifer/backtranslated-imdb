Mostly I like to watch Burt Lancaster films - especially when it's necessary to craze with his impressive presence on the screen like in Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, was occasionally his biggest weakness, because rarely, if ever, he underlined nothing. And this is the lack of subtlety that really hinders the rainbow. Now I understand that his character should have been some kind of shoemaker, but as Katherine Hepburn could fall under his spell it is completely inexplicable. It should be smart, but it does not look like Lancaster's blarney throws it on the screen! In addition, the story may be one of the most attractive movies I have ever seen, and it's too obvious that this film is based on the show. It seems to have been mostly recorded in the sound scene instead of the large open West as it should have been.
