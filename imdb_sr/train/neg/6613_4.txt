I am a big fan of Mr. Ram Gopal Varma, but I could not believe he made this film. I was really disappointed. Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag does not come close to real Sholaia. This does not leave a lasting impression on the viewer. Ram Gopal Varma does not create chemistry between characters. There is no friendship between Heero (Ajai Devgan) and Raj (Prashant Paradise). There are almost no scenes with more than two people in the frame together. The sequence in front of the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal is extraordinary. Amitabh Bachchan should not be working this movie. Ajai and Sushmita sen tried the best they could but did not use. Modulation of the voice of Rajpal Yadav - ineffective and quite meaningless. Mohanlal did full justice and again proved that acting is all about the expression of the face and body language. The rest of the head was below expectations. The comedy adapted to the original sholai falls into this film. that this Aag was made. But there's no fire.
