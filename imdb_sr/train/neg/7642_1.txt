It seems that everyone is just rumbling about the subject, and they do not notice how the film was shot. The deaf, the dumb guy is good, the winner wins - that's good, the aspect of cricket is great, but the film is average. I think it could be much better than it is. The action is too predictable for a movie that is not based on real life. I'm sure the movie could have been more interesting. The songs were there just filled, and I had to literally pass the scenes where the same thing would appear from different angles. Good acting. Vatchable.
