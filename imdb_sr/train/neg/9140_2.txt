Uh - I do not know what to say. This is a movie that could be really good with a bunch of stoned spectators. Some of the actors reminded me of John Waters' early offer. Perhaps I should take it back - I do not want to offend Watter's ability as a director / narrator. Especially I liked a lawyer who used a "full faith and credibility" clause. It's "full of faith and merit", by the way! It also reminds me of "Conrad Bois", where he is the main actor and writer, director, film editor, etc. multinational companies like those that are probably best left to professional film professionals who would have technical capabilities (although some, maybe some stunt) were able to pull things that way.
