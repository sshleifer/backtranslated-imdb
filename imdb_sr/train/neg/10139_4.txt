You must give it to Steven Seagal: no matter what his other flaws, he has a good taste for women. If you choose a Seagal movie, chances are that there will be one or more very beautiful women in it. And usually, they do not function like pure sweets; they get involved in action and fight, shoot with weapons, kill with knives, etc. "Flight of Furi" offers the duo Ciera Paiton (who has a very sexy face, with juicy lips in accordance with Angelina Jolie) and Katie Jones, and finds time to include them in the fight and a bit of lesbian affection! And if it seems that I spend too much time on the story about them, that's because the rest of the movie, although passable, is so inconceivable that it's hard to find much more to talk about. Ironically, the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself, who seems to be unable to even try to pretend to be concerned. This is a military-type stockholder, it is very hard to fight in him, and he does not fit into his role (pilot hunter on a cask, "the best in the world", of course), which can explain his almost offensive sleepwalking.
