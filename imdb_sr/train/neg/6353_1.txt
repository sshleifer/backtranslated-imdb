For the comic writer, Vudi Alen really allows the viewer who pays to settle down with this scathing attempt of character development. There are some fun moments, but no more than one who would listen to their tennis balls for drying. Vill Ferrell spends his time in this movie that does not show his usual funny delivery. Amanda Peet did well, but again, she did not have the place to move in this otherwise personal movie. The film is so hard and boring that it can not carry it, but that it was worn, Radha Mitchell did it. If you enjoy movies that take place on one scene and do nothing, except to show that their writer can sometimes write several lines of quick dialogue, then you will like the movie.
