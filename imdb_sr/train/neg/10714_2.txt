For the two smirked comedians, the film was terrible. They quickly passed it and it was never better! Loss of time and waste of money! Tina Fei is a great writer, I thought she would be so great in comedy. The reviews were so big, but they only showed the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought that the chicken was a chick. What about that. The film was very slow and boring. I will not recommend it to anyone at this time. I'd love to get my money back for this! BOO from us here in Arizona. Thank you, but thank you. Whoever does this kind of nonsense to make people think you're pregnant. I thought it would be so funny, that I had my children and helped others to have children. It could have been more in line with reality.
