I was horrified by this spooky movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And so damn music. Really promising! Indeed, after ten minutes you really start to sweat and feel uneasy, because you start to fear the worst. This film has an atmosphere of real nightmares, and what's worst - it all comes out. For an hour and a half, I try to fight against total boredom and fall asleep, but the monstrous music kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a really scary picture - for your eyes, your ears, your intelligence, and most of all: your wallet, since it thought of spending precious money on a movie card for this cheap amateur homevideo is the greatest horror of all.
