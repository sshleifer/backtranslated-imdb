I started to watch this high-expecting film. However, after one hour I gave up this film because it just embarked on a lot of unanswered questions on me. This has already started in the starting line and it has gotten worse. Why would Hollander bury under the statue? Why is a Italian comedian present? Why did a farmer's wife save Hollander? Why, after he was saved, does not he run for his life, instead of starting to make love to the farmer's wife? Why did the farmers' wife not save Hollander at a time when the farmer would not be here? Why did you supposedly illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why did the Italian commissioner know about Dutch gold? Why did he hide it in a septic tank in the midst of the poor farmers' property? These and many other issues arose, and none of them received an answer in an acceptable way. I suppose I miss the meaning of this film and I do not associate with the story in any way.
