This must be one of the most appreciated Spanish films in history. The lack of subtlety and complexity and the overall political correction make it very childish, with only good / bad characters. The world is simply not such, and good films show complex characters with opposite impulses, dilemmas, and so on. However, what I hate most about this movie is Father Bol's friend. The director is trying to teach us a good lesson: tattoo artists with shaved heads are not always bad guys, in fact they can be better than an average dad (wow, this is like ... philosophy, or something). Thank you, Achero. I will propose to you the Nobel Prize for Literature.
