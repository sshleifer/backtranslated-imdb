Sacred @ #% and this film was still warm and juicy from the crowd with which it was made. I tried to watch this pile of volatile waste, but it was easier for me to cut my wrists and put in a shovel Lisol cleaner floor than to withstand more than half the shit that was on my screen. I ranked this below under everything I've ever seen on a movie or TV, and it's saying something. Once I was a witness of cow shit in the field. I watched a crowd that smoked an hour and a half, who knows ... maybe moved or something like that. Well, that was the time better spent than watching this mess. The acting did not exist, the plot was somewhere else than on this film. I think I saw early in the place where the plot managed to escape and ride in the background on the back of an old truck that went to Portland in the hope of becoming Shiver Steven King. Please tell me that the director receives medicines that are so desperate for him. It's pretty clear that he needs heavy drugs and I'm willing to give up the money needed for the reversal of lobotomy. Bach ... I can not give this overview of the full blow he needs because nothing that can be painfully can never be done fairly in the squeaky word. Let me just say that if you are looking for a motion to pass for some time and see this Chilton on the shelf, go to your car, start the engine, and then push both fists straight into the fan until you feel the feeling. your bones vibrate more. Make sure you have a wallet in your hand and because you'll lose money anyway. You might also have the privilege of spending it yourself. By the way, I was watching this after my "friend" sent his girlfriend to see. He came, SHE is also. What's worse, having to watch this $% & @ thing TVICE! I've heard their married ones now and he can visit his balls once a month. I hope it was because of this movie.
