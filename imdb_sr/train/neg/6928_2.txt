All other comments have already said what I wanted to say. I thought this was the first in Italian, I'm sorry about that, Italy. I was not bored because I was waiting for something to happen. Who did this song about Dr. Tarro and Professor Feather when? Was it Alan Parsons? I saw this on the Brentwood 10 package and the quality was expected, horrible. A lot of traces and stuff. The film was a coherent mess. Stupid music and clueless characters. The main guy was supposed to know in the first minute that the doctor was better than the patient. I thought that the "doctor" who leads the "fighting" scene will never stop. I had some nice babies. It seems that these stupid movies always throw away a naked fish or two, and that's what makes you. I gave her 2 for some women. The dance people who danced from me wanted to get my eyes out. Poe probably made about 3,000 rpm in his grave when this thing came out because it was free based on his story.
