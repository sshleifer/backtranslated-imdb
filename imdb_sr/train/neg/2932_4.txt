It's not that he cares, but I'm not a friend of Simon Pegas. If I did, there is a great chance to throw us out if he continues to make such slaves. The trouble is that he has found a successful formula like a messy guy, a regular guy in the neighborhood, in Shavn of the Dead, Run Fat Boi Run, etc. Here his character has no noticeable character, he is rude and disgusting, and thinks he is ridiculous when he is not honest. When he was transferred from New York from London (and I assume this link is intended for viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he is equally not in the place with his new colleagues. Still, is it strange when he hires a stripper among his cheerful chips to appear at the editorial meeting and vengeance on his boss. However, Kirsten Dunst gets kind of warm, although he did not do anything nice. Oh, and because he's a superficial man, at first glance falls on Megan Fox, probably because her character is shallow as his. All this makes the foreseeable conclusion of the film, although I do not see any viewer expressing how it reflected their life. It's a shame that on paper this is an actor who supposedly is worth watching. Pegg, however, plays herself, Kirsten Dunst seems to be walking only on the move, without creating chemistry on the screen, and Megan Fok is not stretched at all. One big plus is Miriam Margolies, like Pegg's landlady in New York - now if she was on the screen for longer ...
