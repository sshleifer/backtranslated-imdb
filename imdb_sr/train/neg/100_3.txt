OK, it's not the best movie I've ever seen, but at the same time I could sit and watch it DVOKRILO !!! the story was pretty scary and during the first part of the first short story I wondered what I was looking at, but at the same time it was so terrible that I liked him cheaply, laughing to the end. Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this film, the only thing that betrayed him was halfway, and he stopped his silly name. he sees him in the land from which he is going.
