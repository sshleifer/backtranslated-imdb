Surprisingly he had a plot! ;) I saw movies with less complicated (I do not want to mention Asian movies, but ...). I thought the camera was not bad at all for a cheap movie like this, and the atmosphere was not bad. There is no real reason for most of the things people do and the way they react to what's happening. Although I think that many films, in this case, of course, was terrible. Filmed some movies so bad only for single scenes. The acting was bad, but I saw it worse. The film was bad, but I saw it worse. Watching this movie is the experience of boredom, laughter, death, sadism, horny and fun at a low level. I gave her 3/10 because it CAN be fun if you do not expect a good movie and if you are in the right mood.
