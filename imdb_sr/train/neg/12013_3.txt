I should have realized that no film with the Poltergeist lady in it would be good. It actually starts fine, but during the first scene of the murder you find out that the movie you are watching is film in the movie. People sit in the cinema watching this movie. One girl in the audience is so boring to turn around and strangle her. A little weird, but far from good.
