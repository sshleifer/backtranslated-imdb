First and foremost, I completely disagree with a user who calls it a "spoof". Crispin Glover is very serious about his film. He personally presented the film on the projection I saw in Chicago. For years, he worked on the film and is the first in an imaginary trilogy. "What is that?" is an attempt by Crispina Glover in an artistic film in the spirit of those who adore Herzog, Linch, etc. crispin glover. "When he finally came out I was watching an on-line trailer and reading a synopsis and I was foaming on my lips with anticipation ... I went to Chicago to see it and that was a big disappointment. what a grandma smokes, and puppets for dancing, would stay with something much better, but only about 10 minutes. Just watch the trailer, have fun and leave it on. There are some striking images and fantastic juxtaposition and phrases, but the lack of focus is disappointment.
