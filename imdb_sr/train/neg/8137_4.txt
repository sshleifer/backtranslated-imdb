Stevart Moss plays a scientist who works on his work with his wife, and he has the feeling that he was chosen for that role because of his ability to turn his eyes in his head ... imagine an audition for this .. "can you ... no, that's not right that, thank you, next! ". In any case, he bites it with a bat and then either turns into a kind of creature of a bat and kills people or ... is not. Because no one else sees his strange transformation, but he himself seems to think he is changing because his wedding ring appears when his hands turn into claws, etc. he actually turns into something to the very end. This has some good location and some sort of decent atmosphere, but unfortunately none of this can make up for a silly story and wonderfully bad acting. It's fun on a "bad way" way, but it only relies on evil. 4 of 10
