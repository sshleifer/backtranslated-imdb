I watched this video at my friend's house. I'm glad I did not spend money on buying this one. The video cover has a scene from Capricorn One in 1975. The film begins with a few rocket exploration videos, most of which are not related to flight. Sibrela Smoke Rifle is a short video of astronauts who are preparing a video transfer. He arranges in his voice, instead of listening to us what the crew had to say. The video ends unusually with the screening of the Zapruder movie. His claims about radiation, protection, star photography and others make me believe that he is utterly ignorant or has some kind of ax about NASA, astronauts or Americans in general. His science is bad, as is this video.
