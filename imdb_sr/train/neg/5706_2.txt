This film is like a thousand films "cat and mouse" that preceded it. (The following may look like a spoiler, but in fact only describes a large class of films). There is a passionate, wise main character, his stupid, but benevolent assistant with his bad attempts at humorous comments, initially hostile but soon softened by a lovely lady that causes an inevitable "incredible" love story, loved ones taken hostage, and of course carefree evil opponent with his brutal servant. Everyone has already seen the tone of these films, and "National Treasure" is like everyone else, with just a little modified cover. Every step of the story is easy to predict (and I assure you that I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed). I am very tired of the feeling of being deceived for money after leaving the theater from the Hollywood movie, and if you've ever felt so, pay attention to my warning; Stay miles away from this movie.
