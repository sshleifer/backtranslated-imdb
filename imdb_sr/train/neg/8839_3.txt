Good try and good ideas (redemption of a prostitute, human beings who help one another ...) but a bad result ... The director obviously tried to mimic his French counterpart Tran Anh Hung by recreating the ambience that should show Vietnam ... The only problem is that this Vietnam long ago went away and when the "scent of green papaya" had a historical background ... trying to design such ambience (muted sounds and a slow pace of life). ..) in modern days leaves a sense of lying. In addition, it quickly creates a sense of boredom and the outcome becomes apparent. I can only assume that the action takes place in Saigon or Da Nang because there is Harvei Keitel, a former Marine in the movie, probably stationed during the war ... But in southern Vietnam no one or very few people are talking with a clip of Northern accent shown by actors ... Seriously weird even for a poor Vietnamese speaker. An old poet with guba ... very suspicious (not a disease for people in his condition), a peasant girl who can read and write elaborate Vietnamese poetry, ... even more dubious ... <br /> < > <br />
