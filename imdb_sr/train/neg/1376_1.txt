Of all the films (and I'm a graduated film, if that's worth it to you), this is the LARGEST film I've ever seen. I know there are some worse people I have not seen before, but I've seen this, and this is the worst. My friend and I rented him one night because Denise Richards was on the front page. Talk about being young and retarded. She's gone! Her role was incredibly small! How did she do it on the cover? IMDb is not even quoted in his filmography. This film was so bad, we wrote a small message to the video store when we returned it and put it in the cabinet. He read something like "Please, save your new clients from watching this complete and totally bad movie!"
