Incredibly. That's what you would say if you went through this movie. Simple, incredible, incredible. In fact, it's so incredible that anyone was stupid enough to leave the money to make this monstrosity that you just can not believe what you see. These are, my friends, what's really scary for this movie. Someone thought it was a good idea. Well, here's another stunning original story: a high school student (occasionally seemed like a college college), a whore for Mom, lives in a park trailer, and an "artist" who is going out, because it's "being completely different. " Well, of course, this poor, ridiculed boy was eventually killed and here is the original piece, his soul is inhabited by a scarecrow (under which he is killed by the newest mom of a bitch). Then it goes around with the standard killing of all the people who hurt him. Avvv. Here's the breakdown: Good: - An incredibly funny movie, even if it's not what obviously drunk directors want. - This and a sequel on one disc in Val-Mart of $ 5.00, so it's just a little overvalued. It did not hurt, did it? t Help: <br /> - Violence and blood are some kind of sub-standard. One person is stung by corn. - It sounds like they put a little effort into music, but that does not really fit into the movie and it's not very good. Bad: Bad - Horrible, terrible acting. - Another slasher sheep with sexy women - none of them removes clothes. When did it cease to be the base of low-trigger? - Funny story. - The scarecrow vows single-leaf battens that Freddy Krueger and Arnold Svartzenegger will turn red. - The standard love story goes nowhere, and it's badly made. - Some of the killed people seem to be chosen randomly? You never know who it was and then they were killed. And you just suppose they had to come. Ugly: <br /> - Extremely average price for killing, just with a scarecrow that kills instead of? Well, we're all that shit. - Are not they nearly as interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucki, or even Angela from the Sleepavai Camp series? This ailment. - The absolute worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life. The scenario is burdened with the level of retardation I could never imagine. I am serious here, it's a full step behind the horror. Do not misunderstand me, however, it's ridiculous like hell, but I've never heard even darker jokes even in Massacre Slumber Part III.This movie makes Jason K's look like Shakespeare. <Br /> <br /> < > - A man who kills a boy who becomes a scarecrow: The worst wig ever. A matching match. Memory scene: - The one in which young people from primary school throw their own witty dialogue: "Hey, let's find the little animals to torture them. Huh huh. "Act: 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Camera: 1/10 Character Development: 2/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 Dialogue: 0/10 funni ?? so bad that's good. My first rating for a dialogue in any movie (Dialogue: 0/10 funny, so bad that's good. My first rating for a dialogue in any movie !) Music: 5/10 Direction: 2/10 Cheesiness: 10/10 Crappiness: 9/10 Overall: 3/10 <br /> <br /> <br / > Another for only people like me who enjoy watching pure shit, or complete movie films. This is not a good movie at all Funny dialogue and characters prevent it from being really boring. Vvv.ResidentHazard.com
