Spoiler: A bunch of passive-aggressive people who have family gatherings. The scripts said and did things that people would never do, at least anyone with a little bit of authority. The hero falls on a woman she sees as her related soul in a bookstore on the day of the gathering, unaware that she will appear as a brother's girlfriend at a gathering. She tries to postpone her brother's claim, but she, knowing that our hero is obviously in love with her, ruthlessly teases him by wearing sexy clothes and acting like a stripper, rubbing his brother's excuse to show him how to stretch. At one point, it is actually disassembled and showered with it. He's trying to cover his eyes. His heart is broken. She thinks it's funny, until she suddenly decides not to want her brother to leave the gathering. The film is really pulling. The audience coughed and messed up their journey for a long time. Writing is inconsequential and incredible. We almost went out, but we kept thinking that something would happen to get things broken, but not. All the wonderful reviews had to be written by the paid shills, to fool the poor natives like me to see this shit. Comparing it to Little Miss Sunshine? Jeez. It's embarrassing to them, writers, actors, producers and theaters that let anything so badly fit on the screen!
