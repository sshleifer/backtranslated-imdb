Offering nothing less than a 1970s-old 1970s movie "Love, American Styles," adorned with flicker flashes, "Superchick" (1973) is a carefree piece of flakes that is somehow still entertaining. And the main character here, Tara B. Truth, it's really a kind of superhero. Stewardess (not stewards) who is so handsome that even the autopilot of her plane made a passage to her (!), And with the young man in every harbor, in this wing, the swing really put "lies". in "laiover". What is with her surgeon in New York, her play with gangster problems in Miami, and her creatively challenged rock star in LA, Tara is certainly busy. And when she does not exhaust these guys with all her masculine energies, as the viewer finds out, she will be able to take a class of karate, clashing mile, defend herself from the robber and rapist, attend the groove by the parties, and stop the attempted abduction on her plane. As I said, carefree fun, and certainly good for the night when you feel tired and you just want to find yourself in front of the tube. The future astrologer, Joyce Jillon, brings some empty charm to her role as Tara, and the movie looks pleasantly pleasing to him. The disappointing, enthusiastic 70 faves of Uschi Digard and Marie Gavin (called Candi Samples) are spent here in very small roles, but they can do what they do best - show their breasts! Although the painting is never funny and does not contain much thought in its metaphorical head, it manages to be consistently fun, and I suppose it is something. It is strange that the final points should draw attention to Mrs. Jillson's body, however; Do not think I've ever seen it!
