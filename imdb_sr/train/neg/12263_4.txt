Watching this movie, as I did for Turner Classic for the first time (quoted as "Dangerous Woman"), can only increase your appreciation for the Bogart-Astor version of 1941. Ricardo Cortez must have been paid by a smile. I hope he remembered his dentist and his salesman Brilcreem at his own will; they made him an actor. All women are good, but not better than that. Well, Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting are the "original" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman, who competently delivers many individual tics, but almost none of the atmospheres that changed the sets of their heirs in the roles, Peter Lorre and Sidnei Greenstreet. Humphrei Bogart and Mari Astor in some way surpassed the essential shadow of their characters in the remake; Here, Sam Spade and Ruth Vonderley (!) can not. This film does not stink; lying there like a big piece of ham. Its main value today is a reminder that big movies like "Falcon" from '41. On a scale from 1 to 10 I estimate 4, mostly for working with cameras and auxiliary toys.
