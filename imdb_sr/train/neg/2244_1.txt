I need to clarify two things at the beginning. First of all, we all know what this year's Oscar really was about this year. The academy showed people that they were not racists and they were never. They wanted to clear all prejudices about themselves. Secondly, it is kinda absurd to make remarks on the show, because indeed, what differences will be made? But it's fun to write about it. This is the year when I became saturated with Oscar! I will never watch the show again. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crowe won the "Gladiator" when they were the right winner, Ralph Fiennes should be "Sunshine". If you have not yet seen this movie, watch it and you agree. "Eies Vide Shut" when it was announced did not receive nominations. As for this year, well, the bad choice was everywhere! Baz Lurhmann does not get nomination for "best director"! Are iou joking !! "A Beautiful Mind" is for "Best Make-Up" ???? "Training Day" gets nomination? The film was terrible, and it seemed that Washington did not even turn around in the show, everything it proved was, knows how to use four-letter words! For this he received a prize! Cut the tongue and bet that he almost played! I loved "Gosford Park", I really am, but why 7 nominations? And how on earth they could not give too much to Altman! I mean, come on, if we just give reward to people to clarify any bad feelings, what about Altman? The man has been in the public eye for over 32 years and no Oscar! There were many, many things that tortured me about this year's Oscar, but I'll live with it until I have to watch another show again! The highlight (and only) of the show was when Voody Allen first appeared in a prize show. It will fall as one of the greatest moments in its history.
