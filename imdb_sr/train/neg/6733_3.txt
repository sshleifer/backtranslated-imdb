The title in the title is appropriate, although insufficiently expressed. This movie not only cries - he screams loud enough to break the glass. The filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone made breakthrough, humorous tensions that striven for a semi-documentary feeling. Here, they were filmed at real locations in New York with real-life acoustics to raise credibility. But the naturalism of the soundtrack serves only to intensify Stones' unreasonable dialogue and the mouthpiece of the tortured butterfly Inger Stevens. In performance completely without modulation, Stevens plays the wizard electronics wizard James Mason (who is exhausted and boring); Both are held in captivity by extortionist Rod Steiger (looks arrogant and boring) and his slim cohorts in a scheme to blackmail the airline with a deadly bomb that Mason unconsciously helped construct. Here's another effort to get an example of a criminal master so brilliantly careful about every detail, yet stupid enough to hire addict drug addicts. Stones's idea of ​​the tension of nail nails is to capture hysterical Stevens with the rapist Benzedrina, Neville Brand, filling the frame with his sweaty, slimy kiss. But working with cameras is so lead and Brand so (unusually) shy that the effect is barely pale, much less uncertain. Stones, a square pair in the heart, do not even have the courage of their own lack of conviction. The movie, ending with the bare Steiger, who drives Stevens' driver on the underground track, is as clunky as his incoherence. With Angie Dickinson as Steiger's amoral girlfriend, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobei and Barney Philips.
