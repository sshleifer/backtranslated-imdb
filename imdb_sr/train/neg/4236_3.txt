Well, if you love pop / punk, punk, ska and then a little modern psycho bill, then watching live performances is the only thing worth watching. This film has tons and tons of bands, along with President Trom, Lloyd Kaufman as a half-lead, and a lot of stupid scenes of death. Sounds like it's good, is not it? Well, deaths are still coming, and many times on many different Varp Tour bands and fans at the event. Some of the deaths start stylish, but then they are recycled over and over, to the extent that they are completely repetitive. Almost everyone is dying from breaking the head or pulling the bowel out of the stomach. Gore seems to be from Andreas Schnaas "Zombie 90: Ectreme Pestilence"; but this is a "diluted blood type", but now this movie is really decent, and it gives humor - something that this movie is terribly missing. Of course, the movie was shot by Doug Sakmann from Trome, has excellent low-budget potential, and is trying ... but too hard. Everything is overly imagined to be ridiculous in this movie, and that's what stings it. Everything is trying to be too comical and stupid, using deliberately bad behavior, excessively meaningless dying and doing the same thing ... over and over again. It's basically "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker", "Board President", or any movie you made with your friends: it's ridiculous to those who did it, and that's all. Great potential, great idea, great use of effects - but it's the same thing ... over and over again: playing the band, the band dies, the fans are dying. Everyone dies, blood is scattered everywhere, the process is repeated. The question is for these types of films - basically "bad slap" - are they trying too hard, or not trying at all?
