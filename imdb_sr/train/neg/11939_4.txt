Let me tell you something about this movie. I saw it twice. I was a kid for the first time and my movie was pretty fun. I really liked it. I thought it was funny and interesting, and the main character was kind of cool. I saw it again a few days ago. It was scary. Really. I do not know why I thought it was funny, but now ... I was not laughing at all. Nothing was a bit fun. It was stupid. The story was bad. The act was nothing special. There are great actors in this movie, but the acting is still central. What is worse is the fact that this film is racist. Really. Do not misunderstand me, I usually do not complain about racism in movies. However, I've seen people complain about the lack of blacks in movies such as "Temple Shaolin" or the fact that the only black guy in "Street Fighter" is one of the bad guys or ... Whatever, you get a point. People see racism everywhere. I wonder how they would react to a movie like 'Meteor'. Why? I'll tell you why. There is no Asian in this film. There are no white guys among the good guys. In fact, there is only one white man in the whole film and he is the leader of bad guys. All the good guys are Afro-Americans. Do not misunderstand me, I do not care if a good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green ... What I care about is that we can hardly see the white person in this movie. This is the only movie I've ever seen. It's just not realistic. If there is only one black man in a Japanese film, as with the Street Fighter, there is no problem - in Japan, most people are Asian. But if there is only one white man in the American film, there is a problem - in the United States, most are white. It's like shooting a Japanese movie with a wholly white actor and just one Asian as a bad guy. It's just not real. This is it. I'm giving the movie 4/10. It would be 1/10 if I did not have fun with him as a kid.
