Lorenzo Lamas plays a CIA agent who sees some exotic beauty named Alec, takes her daughter and urges her to fight her former employers. O.J. Simpson is also on board to give some acting credibility to a not-so-talented ensemble. I must admit I am not a fan of Lorenz Lamas, nor his films. He stinks. However, compared to O.J. Simpson and Lamas' comatose husband Kinmont, Lamas looks like ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I only saw the CIA for renewing interest in the trial of O.J. You see, Simpson, because if your parents had cable and extra channels, you would not be able to avoid this movie. In 1994, you could go to the Amish community, and some moron would play it on your portable TV. The film itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intriguing, although the shocking value of O.J. Simpson jumped after the balls and exchanges would be a liner that would provide some unintentional humor. Also, where did Bobbi Knight and Kobe Briant do this complete camp class? <br /> * From 4- (bad)
