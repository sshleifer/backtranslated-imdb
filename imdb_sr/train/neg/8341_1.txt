I love horror movies. I can even appreciate most cheeses (to face, 9 out of 10 horor films these days are cheese), but this was just funny. Terrible acting, horrible writing, completely hollow and incredible characters (no Meisner actors here!) And a complete lack of enough body number. I wish I could save 79 minutes of my life that I just spent. At least the Crook brothers are appropriately named. The only good thing in the whole movie was to see Alicia Silverstone want to be hit in the face. How ever this has been done to Sundance is completely confusing. Most of the action was absolutely unrealistic, even by film standards. I mean, come on! Who would have hurried to take a cheap snapper 10 seconds after the fucking stalker left his home threshold? Lame.
