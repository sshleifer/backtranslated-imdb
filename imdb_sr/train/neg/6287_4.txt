I read about this film in a magazine and I was intrigued. A woman who sees her own drive one day. Well, I thought, this could be interesting ... </ i> ... ... but it's not. First, the title. The Broken? Faulty ... what? What's broken? ... oh, wait ... I understand, the title itself is "broken"! VOV, smart! Unfortunately, this is practically the only thing that supports this. The premise is not that bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland did much better in the "Mirrors". Cross between Invasion and Snatchers and Body Mirrors, and quite central to it. A more appropriate title would be 'Boring' because it extracts every scene for bloody years. Or maybe it's "confusing" because it does not explain anything, either in the narrative or in the story itself, just some vague idea of ​​evil copies and something, full of cheap fears and scenes used for death, but nothing tangible. It's just messed up. On the other hand, acting and special effects are pretty good, but again, it's not a difficult role. After watching the movie twice, I still feel unhappy, maybe a little confused, and not in the way EA Poe or Stephen King. Do yourself a favor, and do not look at this. Simply put, there are better trillers.
