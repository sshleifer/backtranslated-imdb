Maybe not, but it's terrible. He can not even save him fantastically. OK, I admit that it started quite funny, but it seemed to be lowering as soon as those girls in the house of the general jumped. Bill Murray turned into a hasty, witty guy in an arsehole screaming people on the street who were not ridiculous, as if he was too busy to be ridiculous. His character stole the weapon (RV? Come ...) and ended up as a national hero after he came to another country and killed God knows how many soldiers, for a laugh. One good thing is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US military and shows how arrogant and imbecile they are, although unintentional. In fact, I felt disgusting that this kind of propaganda shit really can be freed.
