I found this to be the ultimate loss of time, effort and money. I know that Disney always shows a lack of creativity when filming straight-to-video movies - but re-plotting the plot of the original film with a "new perspective" is the lowest ... it will still be only releasing original movies with new animation and new songs and calling them "new" version of the movie we all love. " Nathan Lane is again surprisingly returning to his role as Timon. Timon and Pumbaa animated animals from the world of the original "King of the Lions" go on a narrative journey to tell us the original story in the way it really happened ... as they see it. Naturally, Timon is now a hero story, iadda iadda iadda, blah blah blah ... Musical sequences are chromatic and animation is shit. Vocal talents are impressive for the video function, but again, when was the last time you remembered Matthews Broderick, Vhoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane who are in some real commercial substance? All in all, if you like the original, hate this. It's disgusting because it's unfair to children and adults. And that's about it.
