This film was different in that it did not show the typical gay stereotypes I used to see. But that does not change the fact that the story is completely missing. I'm sure there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves on the screen, because black gay characters are rarely seen, and when characters are usually not fully developed. But how hard it would be for a writer to really write a story at the beginning, mid and end. Or about the story that was focused. It seems that in this film it really does not make sense, and even though it's a low-budget film, it's still not an excuse for a lack of story or complication.
