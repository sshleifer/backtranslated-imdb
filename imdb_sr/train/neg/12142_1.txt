Please, for God's love, do not look at it. Now I say that I know what you mean, can not it be so bad? If everyone says it's as bad as they say, I have to watch it! Do not do it! It will be like watching a terrible accident with little babies and gasoline tankers! You will be scarred for life ... the picture will never leave you! I could only watch half an hour before I became violent. The act is the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen Barbie! If you risk to take your eyes off and rent a movie ... do not say I did not warn you! The cover and the story are a trap !! Zombies? Satire? Shaun of the Dead was great! This movie must be the same ... right? NOT!! Writing = shit of directing = playbacks = no acting. Are not you yet convinced? Then your soul will always be tortured forever !!!
