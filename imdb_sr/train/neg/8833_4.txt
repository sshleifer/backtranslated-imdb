Without the mistake of actors (they all dealt with great performances), the whole story was not well performed. The movie opens a big zinger: a crazy old guy forces a young girl's girlfriend from the road. But then, we are forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with a whole new group of characters ... and we do not know until 40 minutes are completed. It turned out that they are the ones who eventually discover the girl's body ... and the story goes from there. Although the story starts at that moment, it really does not go anywhere. After two hours I wondered: is there any sense in that, or was it just that the characters fight with the accusations of racism and stupidity about how they handled the discovery? The story was ultimately unsatisfactory and was incomplete. Although she is acting well, the film does not have a strong enough basis to recommend it.
