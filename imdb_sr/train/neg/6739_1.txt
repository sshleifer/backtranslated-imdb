You wonder why someone would try to re-create successful movie actions that have already been seen, as is the case with this movie. "Wedding Date" is one of the best examples of why not try to even try to turn up under the mask of a new story, something that should have been released. If such a project takes place with the approval of a large student study, then it all goes with big stars and great production values, so people will come in the stars. Well, this is not what happens in this wrong comedy attempt. It seems that the problem is the way the screen writers transplanted the story to London, when this is basically the usual American situation that the environment can not fix. Then there's a problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroonei? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar! Since Kat and Nick have no conflict from the very beginning, the viewer is not drawn into a movie the way creators thought it would be. It is clear that Kat will fall for Nick, and vice versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best asset in "Junebug", encounters a shallow girl who is willing to maintain her lie and not to be a pure man who loves her and will marry her. For all interested, loans at the end of the film last for almost seven minutes!
