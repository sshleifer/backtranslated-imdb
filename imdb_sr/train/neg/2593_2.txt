American Pie: Beta House is somehow in limbo between genres. On the one hand, it's a comedy without complication and a few truly smart jokes. On the other hand, it is porn that is too soft to actually involve viewers. Basically, Beta House is a collage of sexual scenes - some humiliating, other self-benting humor - with a few thin dots that are thrown in the attempt of cohesion. The characters are barely two-dimensional, most of the development relies on the knowledge of naked moods, and the "important" scenes of the scene are so distant that you wonder why writers even felt the need for a story. In any case, I did not enter this film without expectations. I loved the original three American film films, and the thought of Band Camp and Naked Mile were solid. I thought Naked Mile was pretty good enough to be released in theaters, and when I saw some of the same characters return to Beta House, I was excited to see this war. I was aware that there will be numerous scenes of divorce and sexual humiliation in various forms. And that was good for me, because in the past these scenes were supported by the story and were well integrated into the plot. However, in Beta House it's almost like the writers forgot why the formula in other AP films worked. They spent too much energy working in the nudity that they forgot to write the story. This film is a disappointment and not even worth the rent of one dollar. Jokes are lame, the story is nonexistent, and the porn-aspect is too loud if it's all that you care about.
