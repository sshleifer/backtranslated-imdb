This is only the second time I stopped the video / DVD part. I was ready to give this film an edge in the beginning, although I managed to be a shallow, clich√© and stupid ... And without any, boring and pretentious. It was as a special edition directed by this weird boy of the ninth grade who thinks nobody understands ... creepy and sadly, with a voice narrative, only a deceived adolescent would think of poetry ... and singing, and ... no, really, the suffering of a poor child ... Enough, already, especially when it turned into a dreary, clumsy, and offensive Clockvork Orange ripoff. And did I mention singing? This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly I was least forced to sit. I do not recommend it to anyone.
