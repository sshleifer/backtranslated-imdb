King Maker is a film about a series of real events that occurred during the Portuguese occupation in Indochina. Although the costumes and artistic lines are praiseworthy, the film still fails to impress the viewer. In particular, the treatment was extremely bad. Some actors are trying to put down tears and accents, both real and false, are extremely irritating. The story was also too stupid and too stupid to be true and it looked more like a lesson from history. The film could not even capture that kind of imperial and centuries-old air, and it looked like an unsuccessful attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth. The final word? Costumes and artistic directions give the film a glow of fresh air, but the execution was extremely poor, and the actors could not even give natural burst emotions. In short, the film sounded more like a hullabaloo than a script.
