What happened to Petar Bogdanovic? Once a brilliant director, a sledger ... now scratching down the bottom ... Is it the same man who directed "Last Imagery"? Here, he takes a somewhat interesting (though strained) premise, and turns it into a chewing gum that loses taste at the time you take the first bite ... Dunst is not bad, but Izzard is wrong as Chaplin, and all other actors seem to be thrown out their "looks" and not because they were right for the role. A pity. I will again rent "Paper Moon".
