A unique bunch of cow balloons. I'm terrified that this movie has even been made to me. Hip-hop and old westerns do not mix. To which target audience these people thought when they planned this ride. Not only is the concept and complication of jokes, but the acting is terrible and the fact that some decent actors were even in this humorous film makes the whole career a laugh. A chick from nonsense should never be forgiven and deprived of any remaining dignity she had. After reading the first ten pages of the dialogue, she was asked to ask which of her friends play this sick joke. After some research, I found a list of some other actors who transmitted this film: Jade Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandi, Monikue, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah and finally Marge Simpson. <br /> <br> Simply put, I'd rather stare at an empty TV than watch this movie again.
