Despite mysteriously positive reviews and high ratings, this is a horrible movie. It's just terrible that I feel obliged to warn you about how bad it is. The film was set in the last period of Raja, at the time of India's struggle for independence. What follows in a ridiculous plot just fills me with an unbelief. What the characters do and how they act, does not convince me that the characters exist in that era. For example, would a young married Hindu domestic assistant from a local village have an affair with her married Englishman, knowing that the discovery of the affair would mean an extreme social outrage and shame if not a death penalty. ? It's unlikely, but maybe more. However, would the same young Hindu Housekeeper, in the conservative Indian society of that time, continue as Britney Spears in the heat, to participate in hot sex outdoors during the day in an open view where they could be discovered at all times? It's not just bloody unlikely, it's a retarded line of complications. Such idiots, combined with poor acting, led me to leave the movie for an hour in the movie, so I did not watch the other half of the movie. film. You could just hope that the end will be more intelligent than what I saw in the first half.
