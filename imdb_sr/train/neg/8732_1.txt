The action refers to the death of young children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the murders. During the film, she seems to have some problems with her daughter. In the end, the serial killer is caught. That's it. But before you find out who is ready, you have to see the horrible acting of all the actors. It's amazing how bad these players are, including Hopper. I could go on like this, but that was a lot of my time lost. Just do not watch the movie. I warned you.
