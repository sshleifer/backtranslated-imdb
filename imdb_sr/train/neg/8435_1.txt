Very disappointing movie. In the end, I did not care for any other person anymore. I enjoyed watching Ving Rhames in a very small part, and Villiam Macchi was as good as ever but still not worth watching. It starts strong and only becomes weaker and weaker. Insomniacs will like it because I'm sure they will sleep them.
