Yesterday I downloaded this movie through the website. The quality was good! I watched a high-expecting film (although I knew it was a failure), especially since the movie has a superstar Amitabh Bachchan playing the role of a villain. Although at least actors like him would do something valuable to their roles. unfortunately, Mr. Bachchan failed to impress as a criminal who proved that no one can compete with the magnificent trial of KHAN's AMG Rgv in order to revive the past that revived the royal! Sholai, the old breakthrough in Indian cinema with the acting star, cult dialogue, elegant cinema and a brilliant soundtrack that continues to hit the present generations. A good actor like TALENTI Ajai Devgan is futile and his performance is Prasant Raj, a newcomer does not know what the acting is. Nisha Kothari has proven to be one of the worst actresses I have. I do not know how RGV is still in Urmila & Abhishek seen in the song without excitement and passion Mohanlal tried the best he could and Susmitha Sen Rad worked with me in this movie It was a total assassination of the original Sholaia
