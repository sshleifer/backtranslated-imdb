There was no knock on Korman because he was very fun at Carol Burnett play. He was also good at playing secondary characters in films by Mela Bruce (I think "High Ankieti" is falling). He, however, is not a person who can take a film in the roles of a duel or less. This is essentially a "Gremlins" underlining, following the tradition of such films as "Critters" and "Ghoulies". It's not a very good move, coupled with "Ghoulies," but with a much lighter tone, because it's not as close to the dark as the movie got. In fact, this is too light and sparkling, and unfortunately, many of the jokes eventually fall. Although I gave him 3 points for the result, it's just because there is a movie that is even a worse Gremlin feat. If you were watching Misteri Science Theater 3000 you know the one I'm talking about ... about the infamous "Hobboblin". This guy has a guy who found some critics in an underground place (I've seen this movie just once, so I do not remember that everything is clear) and it starts pretty friendly. However, this creature quickly becomes hostile and of course it appears more and this is a film. More flaws than hits in the joke department, and it's also really awkward to see that Korman plays the role of an evil brother. It's best to skip this, but then you might want to check it for hits only.
