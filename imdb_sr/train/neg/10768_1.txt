This film makes the Canadians and Britons to be dark, cretinous idiots. Men stoner / drink, then shout / beat each other in almost every scene. Women are superfluous for the story? I do not understand what they are here? they carry out every scene by causing a mess, or even worse, melding around like hypnotized cattle. Obviously, Canadian women are either baffling vulgar rogues or clumsy hippie fish. It's a standard girl, her boyfriend and his evil mother ridiculous that we saw in countless movies. Each character is a Caribbean, infantile stereotype. Not to mention that everyone looked like they needed a shower! And the idea of ​​any scene that implies sex with George Wendt? shudder ?? It's enough for anyone to do it! I was watching the movie because Samuel West was in it? but I can not understand why I would accept such a role. Maybe he needed money. Ian Tracei is a wonderful actor - the only one with an obscure buyable moment, but his talent is lost here. What about the rest of the plot? three imbeciles are trying to get their drugs back? zeva - or Karl ?? who is dead, but who is actually a lively character in the minds of those who are left (almost like Rebecca in the masterpiece of Alfred Hitchcock, although I am ashamed to even think of comparing these two films), why are they trying at all? Karl is so upset that the circumstances of his death are met. By the end of this poor film, I thought it would be better for them to go on that ship!
