When the CLASSIC LASER was opened at Radio Citi Music Hall, I was stupid enough to believe that it would be a warm heart like some of the first Lassie films. Not. The story was terrible, Sherman's songs were far below their usual level, the characters were uninspired, and JAMES STEVART and MICKEI ROONEI both saw much better days. At that time I was also interested in seeing what the contribution of ALICE FAIE would be because she was absent from the screen for so many years and she was always so attractive in her earlier roles in Fok. Alice was also disappointed with a dumb scenario and an unpleasant photo. Another disappointment. Nothing original here, nothing interesting for adults to enjoy - and clear, there is no magic gift for anyone. You can skip this without missing something.
