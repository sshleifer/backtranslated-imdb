Nothing in this movie is funny. I thought the room, giving the man a libido randi ram, was interesting and should provide some laughter. VRONG! Simply, nothing is funny in the movie. For example, the main hero who makes the passage in the skin in the heat in the middle of the farmyard is not ridiculous, it borders with indecency. They play with the bestiality in this movie on one level, and that's not funny. We all know that dogs will eat anything, anywhere, anytime. The main character who does this with everything, everywhere, is also not fun. It's becoming a cliche. Rob Schneider, I suppose, is acceptable in that role. By that, I think he is not a bad actor, but it's hard to comment on quality with broken material. However, Coleen Haskell, the other half of novels guided by human beings (whether counting animals for which the main figure is interested as a romantic trail?), Seems to be a disgrace to the whole thing, as well as it should be. It seems to work in some type of vacuum, separated from all other actors in the film. See this movie only if you want to bore you a tricky, boring, repetitive material.
