I have nothing to say about this movie. It could have been a great tour for Peter Sellers, but this is one of the most tragic failings in the history of the film. The fact that Sellers' final film made it all the more painful. Terrible script, direction and shocking wooden performances all terribly come together to make this one of the most incredible horror films ever made. > I want so much that I can even find giggling or smiling buried somewhere in this crowd of gnats, but it's a lifelong, humorous disaster. The truth hurts. Peter, why could not you stand there?
