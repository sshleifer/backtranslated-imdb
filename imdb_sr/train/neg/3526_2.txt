(Spoiler included, some would say) This film can not be taken seriously. In some parts it's so terrible stupid that I just can not laugh. Try me in the order where Stalone's character jumps about 20 meters with full climbing equipment or (and this is really my favorite one) kills the bad guy by stabbing him into a stalactite. Yes, what sort of ungodly power did he collect to accomplish such feats? I do not know, but he really gives the reality for money.
