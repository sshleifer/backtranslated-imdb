This film only circles, and the viewer does not know where they are. At first I thought ... mmmmm, it might be somehow cool movie this, but just pull in and continue, and in the end you do not know what's going on. The main female is a good actress and she plays well, and the psychopath is creepy, but after a while she does not care what will happen, because this film only retreats. Too bad, that could have been much better. Still, I would say that the leading woman and psycho, will have a good career in front of them, but will they remember this film, because they recorded them. known, or because they regretted the film they had ever made.
