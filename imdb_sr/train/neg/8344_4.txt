After reading all the thrilled reviews of this film and a few who give it so. I finally decided to put in my worthless cent. I agree with the majority that if there were not Lauren Levis and Chris Ferri, it would be a disaster. Recorded in Mariette OH. north of Dogpatch, where all the real talents escaped to the south-I-77 years, at least as much as it allowed a tank of gas. I laughed at the reviewers who subtly claim to be a bit better than the majority, claiming they were following the plot without the hint of confusion. This fairy tale of the Krok brothers is like an old board with skipping in it. As an American, I understand the difficulties that filmmakers face. Traveling in Romania would certainly delete the budget. Let's face the whole movie that was a loop from Claire at the gas station, Claire on the way, Claire beneath the stands, Claire at home, Claire in the cornfield, Claire at school. Claire here and Claire over there. He almost became monotonous and would not have been the best actor in the acting team. Josh and Jeff must make a living, but they do not write a two-page script and turn it into an hour, twenty speeds. Before you write another script about ghost dreams, watch an episode or two Ghost Vhisperera or something similar and take a little background. All the actors except the above mentioned and several others were engaged in their first and last film. Also, co-director Jeff appears as well as all his films. Just like Alfred Hitchcock, eh? One thing the movie had for this is that the camera looks like a fixation on derrier Lauren Levis. Well, with all the happy sarcasm, I still recommend a horror movie just to see this young actress in the formal time of her career (I hope) and that Chris Ferri has established himself as a criminal worth watching.
