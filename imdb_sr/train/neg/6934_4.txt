OK, it's obvious that ppl thought it was a good movie of 1955. I'm sorry for the fools who still think so ... His absolute stupidity. The story is fair. .. funny. The characters are absurd caricatures - but this film is not meant to satiate, I'm sure it meant that it was a serious drama, was not it? Dean and others are too old for their parts. People say that Dean is great in this movie, and well, maybe he also played his part the way he could. His character should be 16 or 17 years old. But Dean was a 24-year-old when he made the film. Seeing him torturing and throwing small spouts as a four-year-old boy ... his pathetic. Natalie Vood is a beautiful, but early scene at a police station where she cries and sneaks are very unpalatable. It sets a bad precedent for a movie ... and for the rest of it, you feel like you're bothering every time one of these bad emotional scenes comes up. Perhaps it's good for her time, but, really, his dick. Must have just been striking about Dean's death, which overwhelmed the reputation of this movie.
