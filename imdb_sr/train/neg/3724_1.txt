I saw this film twice through the Pentecostal church my family attended in the Nanaimo BC 1970s. I was 6 years old, my brother 4, and then when I was eight, my brother 6. This film scared my brother and I shaped the way we looked at the world with distrust. It was not just a movie, but also a philosophy that affected so many "Christians" about the "brand of beasts" and enthusiasm. This film, the church and the indefinitely negligible education, lead to serious paranoia towards the future. For years I have lived under the delusional influence of the church and the fear that I will be forgotten by Christ. I am now 40 years old. He went through years of counseling. I once explained to the psychiatrist this film and the system of believing church and family. I was tied up for a mischievous disorder. Actually, I started to believe that, my brother reminded me that this cult philosophy really happened. I'm not afraid of the future anymore, I reconciled myself with the fear that the church injected into its members. I used this experience to fulfill a specific purpose, I'm closer to the license as a psychologist specialized in the childhood trauma.
