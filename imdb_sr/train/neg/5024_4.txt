There is not much to say about this. Gamera is some kind of fire breathing. He was released from a nuclear explosion. He moves towards the soil and begins to destroy objects, tanks and other garbage (oh, yes, power lines. I almost forgot). At one point, early in the film, he gets acquainted with a little boy, and instead of just throwing it out, or crushing him, he puts him on the ground. For sure. Since then we have to look at how these fat faces appeared and escaped, appeared and fled, appeared and fled. For some reason, Gamera is able to hear this kid from 20,000 feet further. Oh, well, the plot is to try to get Gammer to get to where he can put him on the rocket and shoot into space. As usual, the monster is bulky and uncoordinated (a guy in the Gamer suit). The Japanese military (with the help of Americans) spends enough ammunition and firepower to solve state debt, and, of course, does not help. You should know this anyway. We saw many monsters going to Tokyo. Let's not let this go because they can be fun, but that's not very good.
