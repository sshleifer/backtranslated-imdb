This is a movie of immense appeal to a relatively well-defined group (which I am not part of). I went to review this film without knowing what to expect - in the end, I disappointed him. The history of the terrible dysfunctional (often distorted) Hungarian Jewish family is not my cup of tea. Such an epic saga should really give viewers a little more in the end. In the end, images like this relate to the human condition - this picture almost does not leave a new light in any of its significant aspects.
