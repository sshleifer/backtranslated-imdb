The original film (dated 19 years old) did not show any "monster", but only asked scary "things". This version, however, shows every aspect of "spiritual patient", including unnecessary special effects. The "Mystery", as shown in the original movie, was the most terrible thing: a man simply did not know what caused strange things that had happened. Pointing on the face of the "old man," this gentleman disappeared altogether. Worse: special effects (crying wooden children's faces) is ridiculous. This is a stupid remake, apparently spectacular to be as awesome as the original
