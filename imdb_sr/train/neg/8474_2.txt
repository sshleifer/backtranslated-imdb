The opening scenes move fluently as frozen velvet. The attempt at dramatic dialogue only makes me want to have better control over quick control. Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or wicked disgusting creatures. This vampire tries to seduce his prey by mimicking a lost puppy. I usually counted the bodies, so there was one cat (which is not counted) of a rogue, a girl who fell from the sky with a sword in it (whatever it was) and then a plot. Foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm, but the use of the bite sound in the vampire apples that bites the victim is simply stupid. I loved Varlock, but this film was so bad that we turned it off, and it was so unforgettable that we rented it a year later just to turn it off again.
