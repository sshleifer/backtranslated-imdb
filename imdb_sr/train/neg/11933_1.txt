My child makes better videos of this! I feel scrapped from the $ 4.00 spent on renting this stuff! There is no date on the video case, obviously designed by Vellspring; and, worse yet, there is no production date for the original movie that is nowhere in the movie! The only date given in 2002, which led the tenant to suspect that he was getting a recent movie. This film was so bad from the point of view that it was obsolete and unimportant for any period of time, but exactly when it's made, that I'm stunned to allow anyone to separate the time and cost to place it as a video. This could be of interest to students studying the counter-culture of the sixties, anti-war, anti-establishment, adjustment, inclusion and abandonment of culture; but when you read the back of the video case, there is no indication that this is what you get. If you still make a mistake in renting, it's probably best to look at the medication, so your mind will better match the wavelength of the mind of the director, Fassbinder and Fenggler. Regardless of your state of mind while you watch it, I can tell you it does not improve after the first scene; So, knowing that, I'm sure you'll quickly fall asleep before the end.
