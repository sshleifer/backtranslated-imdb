I saw this film in the middle of the night, when I was going through the channels and nothing else I could watch. It's one of those movies in which you stop seeing what it is - just for a moment! - but after twenty minutes you realize that you can not turn it off, no matter how bad. One of those films that are somewhere between it is so bad that it's good and so bad that, well, it's just plain bad, worth seeing just to experience confusion, realizing it's both! Excellent average night-time, at least for incredible tennis. Do not even ask yourself why no one can say that Chad Love is so obviously male, because the logic is not applied.
