"Tapeheads," a scant, occasionally funny feat in music video, may have been a perfect comedy short film, and the stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are without effort in the swing of meaningless chaos. They play two half-healthy guards in Los Angeles, which are launching their company, Video Aces, making hilarious spots for groups, parties and a dying star. It is a shame that the filmmakers had to invent a blurred side story to impose a run-time (phenomenal movements involving a distorted politician and his supporters who do nothing but take away the main power of the film, sending music at the end of the 1980s). Still, Cusack and Robbins create several originals: nerdy, but loose, street smart, without hypers or posers, these guys are on the same crazy wavelength and never descend. They are the real thing in comedies. * 1/2 of ****
