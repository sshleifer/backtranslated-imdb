I was not familiar with the American television stations, when I turned it on cable television, I first thought it was just a cheap sci-fi movie, and then after a few minutes I started to think that this could be a smart satire on the worst excesses of Christian fundamentalists , and then it came to my mind - good sadness, these people are serious! It's been a long time since I saw something so unintentionally hilarious. I hesitate to write this review because of the fear of the believer's insult, but then I saw other criticisms and I thought, hey, they can accept it. A hard philosophical riddle: how to make a movie that criticizes movies without actually showing what you are criticizing? Answer: Make it so that the only people who will appreciate it are people who hate those movies you criticize. I suppose that some liberals (ugh! Spit when you say it!) Could be offended by the disdain of filmmakers against those in the audience who are not obsessed with the myth of J **** C *****, but I have nothing to do - it was so funny !
