... when he reorganized Broadvai BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). The transformation of Bing Crosby as Dan BROOKS did not help a scenario that was dated at age 34, let alone 50. This sad movie has entire scenes erected from the original, and many of them support their roles, unless they are dead. Though the older one seemed to be not important to the director. It does not appear that cars and clothes in the 1934 wallpaper were not linked to the standards of the 1950s. Even der der Bingel singing can not take this effort. We have rated both original and remake IMDb Four **** Stars. Frank's touch has long since disappeared and everything that remained was CAPRA-CORN. But that did not stop Mr. Caper. After the 50's of the last century making some educational documentaries, he completed his career by transforming LADI FOR A DAI (1933) as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961). Again, a fine shot at IMDb Sik ****** Star Effort has been omitted from the original Eight ******** Stars. Sometimes it is better to stop, while you were still ahead, immediately behind UNION STATE (1948).
