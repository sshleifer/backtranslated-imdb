From the point of view of the action and movement, this film was terrible. I found myself looking at the theater at the theater, hoping to end and get rid of the 80 long minutes that he did graciously. Basically, five characters appear in the movie, Son and Father, sons of a girl, and two male characters from the age of the son who appear, and then disappear without context or explanation. It seemed that the film and the scenes point to a homo-erotic, but nothing actually happened to discover it in one way or another. There were some great scenes. At the beginning of the film, the son's girl appears on the window in front of her room and they go into a weird conversation. Photography and acting gave incredible seductiveness to the interaction between them, ending in admitting that there was another man who was "older". End of this story.
