You know the story .. Beautiful kids alone in the woods, when BAM begins to cut them. So this shit does not differ. A crowd of children returns to the cabin where a man leads twins. Brother disappeared years earlier. Suddenly, the "UNRELEASED STAR" star cuts, and their only help is the doctor / biker. The acting was terrible. The creature looked very sophisticated. And as all the films are working these days, they're trying to get you to the end, and they do not! There is only one bright spot for this film LOST Maggie Grace as a leading woman.
