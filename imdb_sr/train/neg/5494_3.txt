Cheaper and ugly, this movie did not even entertain kids in the audience, except for a pretty fun joke for VC. Christopher Loyd has passed his lifetime and is actually quite tired of this role, although sad writings are not helpful by writers. Elizabeth Hurley is a shameful amateur in an allegedly comical role. Jeff Daniels and Darril Hannah avoided humiliation. There is really no reason to shoot this movie, especially because it's inevitable to compare it with the often brilliant improvisations of Robin Williams in Moor & Mind. <br /> <br />
