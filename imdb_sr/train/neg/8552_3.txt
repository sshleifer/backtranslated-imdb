... just look at the poor character of Robert Webber (a great performance, once again!) trying to fight a machine gun from one of the terrorists. It seems that everything in this movie is a little wrong. The biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action a firm foothold in the early 1980s (the fundamental difference between this film and the far more fantastic, ironic and, therefore, timeless Die Hard). The story comes as an unsuccessful attempt to glorify SAS commandos. Ideas like when a commando shouts a "head", all good guys do it and all the bad guys do not work so they can refuse ad lib (with a good save), that the main character is not masked by gas masked commandos, even though he wears the same clothes and wears a weapon From their arsenal, it seems unlikely and difficult to take the film seriously. And it just happens that it's trying to be more than just fun. VC-mirror ... I do not mind the critique of the Pacific Movement as a shield for criminals and quarrels between peace fanatics and settlers, even the leader of the government in But this political commentary is pretty sloppy and uninspired. This is greatly regrettable because the film has an early appearance by Judy Davies, she plays the main fanatics and seems to have done extensive studies on the topic. In any case, her performance is higher than the performances of others and somehow I think the film is flawed.
