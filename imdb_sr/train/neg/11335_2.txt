I recently watched Belle Epokue, thinking that it could be wonderful because he won Oscars for the best foreign film. I was a little stunned by the predictability and simplicity of the film. Perhaps the conflict I had was that from the moment the movie was filmed to date, the plot of a man who falls on beautiful women and eventually fell for a good girl is done so many times. In addition to the predictability of plotting, some of the scenes in the movie really felt uncomfortable with the story (for example, a certain wedding event). The film was sometimes a bit confident in its ideas and, in relation to Franco, it was set in film and the Church. The only film he had for this was the cat's mom, the landscape, and the figure of Violeta as a strong, independent woman at a time when women were not actually related to these characteristics.
