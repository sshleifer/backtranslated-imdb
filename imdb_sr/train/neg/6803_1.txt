When I get to the IMDb panel, I always get enough to see the "worst movie ever" post. After watching this * movie *, I think I will soon create my own post !! The starting addresses: great, some kind of lame zooming on the gas stove (yes, focus on fire = explosions = big action movie !!) Actors: I think Ice T is a cool rapper, even a good actor (sometimes, I insist, "sometimes"), but Steven Seagal as the policeman he plays is ... behind the word. The rest of the actors are ... so I do not know where these actors were employed but I am !! I bet my dog ​​would be a much better actor than them! Action: Hijacking.original is not? Action sequences: The first shot of the movie is an explosion. I told myself, well, cool! At least there will be some nice pyrotechnics. The rest of the film is mostly filled with low recordings from the aircraft ... Dialogues are hilarious, music is pure shit, the end is happy (I think I was happy at the end because the movie was finished !!!) < My cousin who watched the movie was thrilled (I'm 22, she has 42 ... well). He was on the verge of shooting a movie and burned it. Maybe the next time I watch it ... (who said never ???)
