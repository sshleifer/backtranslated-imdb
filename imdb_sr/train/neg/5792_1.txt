Another thing for a TV piece of garbage! This is an insult to war film (I use the word movie in the easiest possible form!) I thought that Telli Savalas career hit the bottom when he transmitted that video that was shown on TV Tarrant on TV regularly, but then I I forgot he was involved in this! I tried to push her into my subconscious memory, but cable TV brought the memory of me hitting and screaming !! I love this piece (laughs sarcastically!) in a film that claims that the scene from Liverpool in the forties, but this is obviously a recording of the Zagreb cathedral at the end of the eighties. Also, the Commando steam train trains at the JZ (Yugoslavia Railways, or Yugoslav State Railways) on the locomotive side fairly clear, although the producers tried to reduce them. Why not just a movie in the UK, if that's the majority of the movie? Cheap waste and celluloid waste!
