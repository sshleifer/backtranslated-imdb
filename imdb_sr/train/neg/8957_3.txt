Incredible. Is there anything stupid of this? No chance. The nonsense in this film would be a disgrace to even Ed Wood, De Palme and Voo. If the first part of the series had a central dialogue, and the other had a bad dialogue, then this one had a dialog. Incredibly. But this time the story is also lowered to the level of dialogue. Despite acting and dialogue, I loved the first two films, but "Cube Zero" will surely kill the franchise. A complete moronic plot is thus apparently derived from the pencil of the frustrated left wing. Sometimes I wonder if such left-wingers even understand themselves what anti-democracy and pro-dictatorship are. In this film, they obviously target the US? democracy. Why do not they target Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc. In anti-war movies? Of course, most of these places will hardly produce a cube like this one, but that does not matter. Obviously: garbage writers like this are really admiring these types of regimes, whether they know it or not. I could even say that EVERYONE who constantly attacks US foreign policy, has anti-democratic beliefs in its core. Back to the film: besides being so stressed that it's no longer funny, the film has many obvious illogicalities. For example, for some reason, the two men who oversee the cube have done it for some time and are not aware of the pain and sadism the project implies, but the first one suddenly turns against the system! Anyone who has any idea of ​​human nature will see right through this idiocy. Or how about that cretinous character, the one-sided evil bureaucrat who speaks of being in a bad comedy, Mel Brooks. In fact, as soon as this creature appears, the film loses SVU seriousness, and thus every chance to be exciting: it really becomes a comedy.
