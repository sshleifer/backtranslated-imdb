I rented End Game, I never heard of it, but I like political trilogers so I thought I would give it. After some research on the film, I discovered that it was originally intended for a theater release, but instead went on a DVD. After I saw her, I think, "It's no wonder." The film is shocking in its irrationality. The characters and characters are superficial. I realized who was half way, but the end was a curve. I must say that I did not expect it to end in the way it was, but that's not the point in its favor. A more predictable end would be more desirable than that which is so bad. Perhaps filmmakers saw how much the film was predictable and decided to make a movie - even the one that made the movie even worse. I want $ 5.98 and my 107 minutes back.
