This movie has one feature to buy. At one point, after the character was attacked by a villa with an ax, his brother asks him: "Why is your dick there, Chuck?" After I suffered for almost an hour of bad film, this almost made my drink get out of my nose. Some of the acting is not bad, but the kids who smash and PJ Soles should be ashamed of this movie. The story is poor and nobody does what you think (or what common sense requires). Of course, there are many stories that do not add up. For example, in one scene, the ghosts of young children need to concentrate hard to shift the physical object in order to prove that they exist, which is a difficult task, because they obviously can not communicate with physical matter. However, a few minutes later, they all raised branches from the ground and defeated Zub in them. Obviously they can sometimes start and sometimes they can not. Go figure. Many blood and intestines, though ... a pair of lovely suckers. But this does not compensate for the shortcomings. If you want a movie about the Zuba's villa, go to rent "Darkness Falls". I think it's great, although many other reviewers do not share my opinion. At least it sets the mood.
