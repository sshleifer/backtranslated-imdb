"Ski Captain and the Vorld of Tomor" (an amazingly unmistakable title) is simply a bad movie; there is no heart, no deep ideas, nothing special about it. Yes, the CGI background looks interesting, but the result is that the whole thing is taken in a boring soft focus. In addition, the film uses music in the same way as "Gilligan's Island" or "Scooby-Doo" cartoons - NEVER NISHT. Terrible, simply terrible. There are no fresh ideas, just mushrooms and gobs and gobs and ... etc., Bits taken from older films and serials. There is no gate here, the film seems to exist because it can. Save money and your time. It's not fun at all.
