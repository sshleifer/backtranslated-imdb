Slackers, as they are called in this film, are three college friends, Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sava, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel), who just want to graduate from a university without a fair test, but make it a success. This continues until the end, when it does not like it, but the most sophisticated feature of Nathan (Schwarzman) reveals what they are doing. Nathan begins to blackmail to reconcile with his girlfriend of dreams until he can search for it in normal conditions. The only problem is when the trio begins to work on it, Dave falls in love with the wonderful and good-natured Angel (James King) Unfortunately, it's not a great genre movie. Schwarzman tries to watch the movie easily, because his performance is brilliant. The Royal show is average, I think she's only employed to be close with her beautiful look. Slackers reminiscent of American Pie with a different direction. Jokes are as shallow as in the American pie. But are not they all used? I think this film is a warning to filmmakers of the genre that they are running out of originality. All in all, a few moments of smile, but an awesome movie in terms of acting (except Schwarzman) and the theme. * from the *****
