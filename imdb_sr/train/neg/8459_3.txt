Some very interesting work with the camera and a story with a lot of potential. But she never unites as a bit more than student graduation work at a film school. There are two basic reasons for this. Haka, there is not a single character, even a villain who can be admired for his / her senses. Secondly, all the acting is terrible - even by veteran Villem DaFoe. The ham is so abundant here, you feel like you are at a picnic - but one of those poor picnics of employees in a company where you drink too much of cheap beer and get hangover before you even stop drinking. Then you eat a hotdog and vomit. Okay, I'm a bit rude to a young director who could still go to places - as I said, working with cameras is pretty good. Br /> But I feel cheated - a reminder for this film suggests that we will watch "Modern Western", and the DVD package has pictures on it that they suggest and that - but no one is actually connected to the movie creation seems to know that it's the kind of movie that should be made. This edition is what hurts; but even without it, the fact remains that we do not like these characters, we feel embarrassed for the actors, the story is hopelessly confused, and in the last analysis, we simply do not care. I removed it from the DVD player halfway. but the rental store would not give me the money. It really hurts.
