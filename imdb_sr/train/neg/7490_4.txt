This film was disappointing. She was incomplete and boring. While Alec Baldwin tried to present himself as a perfect and just prosecutor (not to mention the executive producer), the film never showed any defenders or attempted to challenge the audience with a real meaningful debate about how the country could of course no one wants to defend the Nazi point but that it was the point of the Nuremberg trails! Four hours of simple hitting the Nazi ... come on! It's already done! I really think that Alec Baldwin should only hold on to husband Kim Bassinger. . This film is superior.
