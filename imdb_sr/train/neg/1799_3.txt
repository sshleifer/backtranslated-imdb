Skippi from "Famili Ties" plays Eddie, a "metallic" starter to be taken. When his favorite metal singer dies, Sammi Curr, he casts a hat and drops all the posters on the wall of his bedroom. But when he later receives an unpublished record holding the spirit of his dead 'metal' idol. First comes up with ideas of revenge, but then he does not want to take him all the way to Sammy. What's not so far away that his main victims just go to the hospital. This film is extremely funny and has so much to do with the right metal, say, "Rock Star". OK, maybe a bit more than that piece of garbage, but you understand my point. And how can anyone be rooted in the type played by Skippi from the Familiy Ties. I have no idea. The name of Gene Simons is fine, and Ozzi Osbourne achieves coherence, I applaud him for it, but otherwise I skip this. My rating: D Richards gets toples, toples ectra at a party in the pool
