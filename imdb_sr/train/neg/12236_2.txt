It simply did not need to be done. This is also predictable and clickable. Chemistry on the screen that made the first "My Girl", so enchanting, can not be found anywhere, and the acting as a whole is stiff and forced. Writing also leaves a lot to be desired, some of the "unforgettable" lines such as "guarding barbaric customs" are just shocking. Where "My Girlfriend" has caused a genuine feeling of sadness and some really funny moments, like many sequels "My Girl 2" is trying to recreate these emotions generated by the audience, and unsuccessfully collapse. Perhaps I am hard on this film because of how good it is first, but I sincerely insult the quality of the original with the kind of stupidity that this delivery serves. It is certain that this must come closer to the "Son of Mask" as one of the worst extensions of all time. In both cases, the old saying sounds true; "If it's not broken, do not fix it".
