Oh, just what I needed, another film about England from the 19th century. Which is pretty much like ordinary England, nobody destroys football stadiums. In this vibrant environment of lords, lady and other randomly chosen titles, Charlotte Gainsbourg walklessly walk like Jane Eire, from a novel no one reads readily. in bed Mr.Rochester, where he tries to teach the French girl to watch an empty board all the time. One day, Mr. Rocketer (Villiam Hurt on an auto-pilot) returns to fall in love with Jane and all that, but it's still his wife's fruit cookie locked in the attic. Oops, that was not in the brochure. After some people were thrown around and some carefully spread the fire (they probably rented a set), the movie finally came. Everything seemed really authentic, that's something I guess. But again, nah.
