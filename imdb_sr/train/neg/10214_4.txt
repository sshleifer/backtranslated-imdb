Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good at The Mummi's Hand, returned for this very small offer of Universal Horror. But this time, instead of Vallace Ford being a comedian "Babe," Fuzzi Knight is replaced as a fool buddy under the name "Stuff". But the results are not nearly so charming, and the level of intimidation is virtually zero. Dick is a businessman who gets an idea to lead a search for goods on a remote island inside an old castle. Peggi is one of the gangs that comes for a ride. But there is a tall and skinny figure of John Carradine in a black robe and a big hat known as "The Phantom" that breaks the party in search of the funeral itself. This "phantom" is not very mysterious, and there is no effort to even try to keep his pretty average shadow character in order to create any tension or specter. It's always nice to see the lively Moran, but otherwise you can find it as one of the universal, momentarily forgotten errors.
