Good: This movie I liked because it was the first horror movie I've been watching for a long time and who really scared me. The act was not bad, and the killer "Cupid" was convincing and disturbing. Bad: The story and story of this movie are incredibly weak. There was simply not much. The way the killer killed his victims was very scary and disgusting. I do not recommend this film to anyone who can not handle it up. All in all: a good intimidation, but a bad story. ** From *****
