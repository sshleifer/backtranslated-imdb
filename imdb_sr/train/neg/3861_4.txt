I'm not the best rom / com fan in the best times. It was a bit quite good (Dream for Insomniac check), but this is only more than the same but less. . The only real laugh of laughter is when male strangers and friends instinctively help Lee's character. All I can say is RIP. I have 10 more films on the shelf that deserve you $$ 3 out of 10 (and just because I'm a big fan of Li)
