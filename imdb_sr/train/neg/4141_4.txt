Well ... the movie was a fun watch. The main problem in this movie is the fact that this is against everything that most of the vampire myths respects. Like vampires walking in the sun. Although there are parts that just make you enjoy the way a movie is made by a society. A scene in which the vampire is stabbed and screaming "This hurts ... It's really stuck." Then it looks like you might miss scenes, but get used to it after a while. And there are also random dream sequences that do not really help conspiracy. When I think about it, nothing really mattered, but I just got a bunch of friends and I watched it twice to get the full effect. When I think about it, the fighting scenes were delighted, and the zombies were just fun to watch. As I write more than that, I love this movie more. But you know, you can not expect anything from the Schindlers List, but its fun watch.
