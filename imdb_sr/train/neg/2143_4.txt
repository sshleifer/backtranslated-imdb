I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and I've always loved so much that the tape is a little out of the way. Accordingly, I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 comes on TV and I will be / I should have known better. This film joins the club of film sequences that should have been left alone. It's absolutely nothing of the original super charm! It seems to me, pretty rough, and almost brutal, from (not) Sing-a-longs to characterization. As I recall that a character tells a story through a song, the Soundtrack of this movie is set over the top, and it seems to have failed. Jacob's transformation into a human being is a great example: where he walked around eating an apple and adding a few tiny speeches here and there, he was supposed to dance around and sing about how it's great to be great! And in the dance hall, there is an old Countri dance music. As if the writers had forgotten where and when this story was set. Unbelievable football certainly did not fit. Even the works of art and animation in Cinderella 2 can not be scratched with the original. The work in this movie looks rather raw and less detailed. And we see part of the Cinderella's hoop skirt, which does not feel good. Sam film could be your own story, I think it should have been exactly that. I would not say that I hate him, but I think he had many shortcomings. It seems to be significantly lower than the beloved original Cinderella.
