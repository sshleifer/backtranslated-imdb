Chris Kattan is a great actor on a sketch in Saturdai Night Live ... but he should probably leave the film industry only if he does not get some kind of creative control. He plays a disturbingly vibrant character that basically separates itself as slightly retarded and at speed. You want to know only funny things? The things that were shown in the reviews. Yes, his interpretation of me is ridiculous. Nothing else is. Especially when you can say that he is very busy to be a physical comedian, he should not try, because he is one. Nevertheless, his 'demolition of the veterinary office' is a little revealing as bad. This movie made me develop a jerk. Avoid it at all costs and continue to watch SNL.
