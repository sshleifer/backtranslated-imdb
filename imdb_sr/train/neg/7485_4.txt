Of course, this looks like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Havn and John Cleese in comedy Neil Simon. Where can you make a mistake? Watch the movie, and you'll find out. True, Martin, the leader, is wrongly thrown. He does not do a big slapstick for which he is known, from films such as "The Jerk", but rather plays a unique character that does not work. Havn, with no one to play, he's terrible. Clayse is the only even partly entertaining member. Above all, the plot is pretty stupid. I can not say how many of it may have changed, but the characters seem to have no least common sense. They go through New York, they do nothing right, and unfortunately, nothing funny. Not only is the whole premise absolutely incredible, it seems to give a message that people who do not live in New York are not really great, the theme is repeated during the film. Seeing this, go back the original "Unmarried Couple" again.
