Visually speaking, this film is stunning. There are some wonderful black comedic moments. But in general, the plot is very clich√©ped, as is his apparent message. If you are a fan of over-the-top violence in mainstream movies like a hostel or saw, you'll love it. If you are looking for something at a high edge, get down. I saw him as part of the Edinburgh Film Festival 06 and I chose it just because I was looking for something disturbing. After all, it's not disturbing. Only grinding and uncomfortable sitting. If you really want to be challenged, go to see something like The Lost. If you want to be burdened, or tell your friends about a really messy movie, then this is for you.
