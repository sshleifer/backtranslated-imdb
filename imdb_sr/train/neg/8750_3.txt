Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), an ambitious filmmaker, lives in a broken flat in New York and relies on his mother to help with renting. She has a beautiful neighbor named Jennifer Beals, who may or may not be married, but whom Aldolpho would love to play in her movie. When Al unexpectedly receives a financial promise to finance his film from a strange man named Joe, he thinks he did it. That is, while Joe does not take Ala on the adventure to steal Porsche for part of the financial support. Will the movie be filmed before Aldolfo is totally free of moral grounds? And, will Angelica act in the movie? This is, according to viewers, a horrible movie. The scenario is insignificant, with complications that roam unwillingly. Beals practically cut all of their lines, and Buscemi, although sympathetic, is impersonal. There are a lot of rude materials and unforgettable characters for lifting. Finally, the production values ​​are very poor, so the film looks secondary at any moment. If you have time on your hands, it's still a good idea not to take the opportunity for this movie. But, if you're a proverbial verdict, just watch the damn thing. Beals, however, look great.
