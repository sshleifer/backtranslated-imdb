I am a great fan of the real genre of crime, but I could not sit through this bum. It was almost as if Dahmer was conceived as erotic, all the way to a pornographic soundtrack. There was no sign of what the Dahmer was kidding, nor research on who his victims were. Nothing but "See how this guy is creepy." And I have to give the film creators this way - their Dahmer is the strangest thing that ever shames the screen.
