I was excited to watch the Catalun movie at the Berlin competition. But after the presentation I was totally disappointed and angry. Too much blood, too much time, too much darkness for nothing. The Spanish civil war, like every war, was terrible. Revenge, very human behavior, which is not at all beautiful, is portrayed in countless films and shows, as well as the relationship of homosexuals and skepticism in Spain to Catholicism. But what Mr. Villaronga tried to do is a pseudo tragedy that can belong to the worst in the history of the film. It's really a pity to see Angel Molin in this movie. I do not advise anyone under any circumstances to watch this movie.
