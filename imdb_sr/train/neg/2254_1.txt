OK, people, honestly ... this must be one of the worst movies about a show business ever made, but I laughed stupid (which may be the reason I enjoyed it). Basically, it's about sex, sex and the way to get your personal 15 minutes of fame. Did I mention that sex was the main problem in this movie? If you have something for bizzzzare characters and simple fun, watch this movie when you get a chance (and you have nothing better to do). *** Attention spoiler !!! *** The funniest thing about the movie was the one who asked Jerry if he could marry his skin (!) In a show and a flash wallet with his love. pictures. Triple A for bad taste and fun!
