An inconvenient mouse and a lullaby really brought me and really do not have anything to do with the story ... That's something I would do my first year in a film school. Very sad. In addition, the story seems to have receded for no reason ... there were too many things that had just been thrown there, which had nothing to do with the story, which makes me feel that the creative team did not really know what they were or just needed to be shorter ... which would be a blessing, not a crime. Since I was just watching all the episodes to this point last week ... I should say that this was by far the worst, and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this.
