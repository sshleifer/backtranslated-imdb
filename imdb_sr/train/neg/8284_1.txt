Who wrote this? Some guy named John Cohen. I suppose this is the first scenario he ever worked on. Someone should have told him that you should write a dialogue that sounds like something someone could say. And who has directed this? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerri Marshall. My nut has fallen far from the tree. Somebody could tell him that you can actually record a scene in a taxi in New York City, and that will look real, and you will not have to play the blue screen for no apparent reason. Maybe he wanted to tell him that he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but I hope he learned that lesson now. And Jessica Simpson ... naturally she can not work. To hell, it seems that Jessica Alba looks like Audrey Hepburn, and still plays in this movie. Oh, wait, that's what her father did. Okay, so she got a role. That's really the only reason I can remember. Well, should I be surprised what's wrong? Not. Should I be amazed at how bad it is? I think that a lot of people would do that to see so much as I did. I think you expect the film with Jessica Simpson to be bad, but this ... is not only bad, it's completely the opposite of the classic movie. Think of Vanguard Allen's great film, this film is as bad as that movie. This is the Anti-Annie Hall. I'm so glad I did not pay to see him, I stopped watching ten minutes at the time I could not. There is no doubt that I would have left the theater earlier. In fact, I wonder how many of the 6 people who watched him in the theater really stayed watching the whole thing. The film starts with laughter bad, and then it turns out that it is so bad that it is becoming a kind of Chinese torture with water. And then, when the first act ends, you realize that it will only get worse, and that's when you either need to go or kill yourself. In conclusion, this film goes into a category that is so bad to be used at the site of boarding the water at Guantanamo Bay. Although some like to board water.
