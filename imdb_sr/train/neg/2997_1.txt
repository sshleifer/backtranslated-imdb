This was recorded from the beginning to the end of 1992 when the famous novel Conan Doile 'The Lost Vorld' was re-recorded. And it shows. The film starts promising enough, with a merciless organization that intends to take advantage of the lost world, and Challenger and the rest return to defending the prehistoric plateau, but then things go downhill. They are all stranded on the plateau, and we are left with a poor, boring, excessive transformation of the first film. Dinosaurs (which are rarely seen) are just funny. Do we expect to take that silly toy that should be a serious ankylosaur? And the tyrannosaur seems to be rooted on the spot. Make yourself a service and grab the silent version of the Lost World of 1925. Unbelievable in this era of CGI and other advanced effects, the version of the twenties is the best and will remain so until someone finally decides to do a decent job.
