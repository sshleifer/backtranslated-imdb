Great opportunity for Indie director to make an interesting movie about a rock musician at the edge of fame. It could have been a decent movie to deal with the traumatic past of John Livien and how he was tormenting his psyche. Instead, it's a ridiculous attempt to identify the life of John Livien with John Lennon. The hero of the suicide of John John Liviana was John Lennon, and she wanted him to become powerful and fruitful as Lenon himself. Instead of focusing on John Lennon's musical splendor and his wonderful ability to lie to others to learn something about his own life, it turned out that Lennon's inheritance is what is confused by the soul-dependent drug, which should look to God instead of man. I'm a big fan of John Lennon and this film reminded me of another "crazy" person obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's killer Mark David Chapman. Lenon was a man brutally murdered by someone else who had Lennon's identity crisis. Should we recall that? John Lennon devoted so much to the world with his music and sincerity, and I was refused to see another disturbed person, as the protagonist of this film, obsessed with Lennon, and not to show my good contributions to the world. Yoko Ono graciously respected John Lennon by making a monument in Central Park to give his fans an opportunity to pay their respects and remember John. Instead, the director of this film decided to use the site to try to kill the killer. I found this so disturbing and disrespectful Lennon memory. He was a man of peace who died brutally by meaningless death, and to see that such violence near this place felt like a once again terrible wound for any of Lennon's fans. It destroyed my film. It could have been a decent movie, but it left me bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon and his family rest in peace, and this irresponsible film does not resemble his evil murder.
