After a fairly long, partly pixeling scene of the show, we are heading for the races for this "Blair Vitch Project" - we are looking for a movie about the horror of three girls getting into a cabin deep into the woods to get away from the busy life for girls on weekends and smoke. They meet two guys who seem friendly enough to drink and talk about ghost stories, while some of them get up late in the movie. This is a rather slow film, with unnecessary extraction of uncertainty Scene, bad acting can not carry countless scenes in which nothing happens, but a foolish joke, and the film as a whole is a stupid, boring deadly nonsense. Nothing has happened until the last half an hour, and when I did it, I had to make sure that I really would not care. Eie Candi: Ashlei Totin shows T & A; Evi Lutzki briefly gets toples; and Jennifer Hart shows her right title <br /> <br /> My Rating: D
