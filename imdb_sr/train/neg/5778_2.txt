All right, I'm dying to see this movie. I stoked about it, "who is who" in the terrible country that is in the movie .... well, my friend rented it, brought it, and we started looking at it. It should be a comedy ... I never even smiled until 40 minutes. Is it related to the budget? Not at all, in fact, there are movies that cost BETTER ABSOLUTE NINS, and they are incredible (me anyway). Also, while I was watching this movie, I could not but understand the similarities (eg, STEALING) with a low-budget indie movie called "ACTRESS APOCALIPSE", read my review about it (RECEIVES this CTV movie). > This film ... he had the potential. He had a "star", a stolen parcel (allows shooting behind the scenes of shooting a movie ... IE ... "ACTRESS APPLICATION" ... seriously, it made me more and more angry \ t) ... it really could have been funny. A lot, a lot of jokes are falling. The acting is fine for what it is. But this did not happen, it was not funny, and the plot was completely stolen. I give him these two because it was not SOOO AVFUL, but that's the only reason.
