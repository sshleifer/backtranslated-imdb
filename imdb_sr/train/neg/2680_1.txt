Brokedovn Palace is not the kind of movie I would like to see. I did not like the film when some Australians smuggled drugs to Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of smuggling drugs. I would not go to that country, no matter what I saw this movie. In fact, this film stinks. I'd rather visit Germany to meet beautiful women. Germany is the country I tolerate. I'd rather be holding the United States instead. After I saw some of the movies in the theater, including a fake charge for drug smuggling, I left the theater and got money because I can not tolerate this movie. If you go to Thailand to meet someone who might be a drug smuggler, forget this!
