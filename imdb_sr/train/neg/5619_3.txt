Let me say that I fully agree with the basic thesis of the film, that probably there was no historical Jesus and that Christianity is a lie. In this respect, this film is a pretty bad business of proving this thesis. It does good arguments - the gap between Jesus' theoretical life and the writing of the gospel, fulfilled only by Paul's writings, which does not point to the historical Jesus - and then completely fails to argue them convincingly. He gives broad statements without giving evidence on which statements are based, and decisively ignores the counter arguments presented by Christian apologists. Intellectual dishonesty, emotional manipulation and the lack of serious arguments are obvious and stunning. The only Christians in the film who have heard in the film are the head of an old film director - who appears as a rational, rational person trying to cope with a chip on the shoulder - and various Christians who seemingly randomly found parking. I'm sorry, but the discovery that average Christians do not know much about their religion is not a damn evidence of Christianity. You can also claim that Jai Leno denounced the existence of Michael Dukakis in his segment Jai-Valking. Interviews with experts may be interesting, but the film is filled too much, let's be honest, the movie creator is just snarki. In the first five minutes, the film has already merged Jerry Falwell with Charles Manson and the left-hand writers behind him with the Davidians branch. And finally, the film becomes so self-controlled that there is no rational argument, only angry the ex-Christian who is fighting people and the places he blames for his confused childhood. You know, maybe that movie might have been interesting, but it's lost in the documentary about the history of Jesus, and it's so congratulations to emptying any kind of sympathy. This is Michael Moore's film without humor or film insight combined with Richard Davkins's book without wit or intellectual austerity. Skip.
