Five-year-old Michael sees his mother at death from the father of his serial killer "The Highwayman", who is later killed. "20 years later" Mike (Gordon Currie, from PUPPIES MASTER 4 and 5) invites seven of his friends to his isolated grandparents to "master their fears" at Halloween Night Night. Morti, a wooden doll of natural size, held by an Indian master on the attic, becomes obsessed with the spirit of a dead father and kills them using their phobias. The characters were thrown out of the window, drowned in the toilet, ate rats, raised in the air, etc. Morti turns into a dad and a tree, walking around and making stupid wisdom. Having found a girl who is chopped and put in a cardboard box, the characters stay in the house, they behave cheerfully, jokes joke and get sex. original Friday 13) is surprisingly beautiful as Grandma, but this thing is even more prudent and confusing than the original and full of fake fears, bad acting, dead characters, re-recording and boring distorted images. Plus, only two minority figures (Indian and half-blacks) are the first to die. BLAH!
