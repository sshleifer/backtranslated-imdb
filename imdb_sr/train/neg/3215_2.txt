The film has one naked scene: The man sitting on the edge of the bed with his exposed genitals hitting the middle of the screen. It's a pretty long scene. What is the point? I almost thought it should have been ridiculous, but we watched him with his mother and it was not funny to have that looking at us for what seemed like a full minute. No character is even cute. Audrey Tatou is cute, of course, but her character is an unhappy girl. I really would not recommend this movie. I expected to be charming and fresh, but he was depressed. I wondered if the director was from an upper crust, educated French family and looked down on these characters. <br /> <br />
