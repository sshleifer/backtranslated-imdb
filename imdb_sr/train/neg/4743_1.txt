To prove that this is a bad joke of DCOM ... </ i> ... ... we take these four sumo wrestlers, and put them in this photo cabin. How ... cosi !!!!! Hai! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh !!!!! How is it terrible ??? That's so bad, Disney Channel is releasing its money, once again, with those exciting, but still certain promotions of 10 seconds, keeping the viewers wondering, "WHERE IS IT WORK?" And then, suddenly, when it came, for example, this not only got more TV ratings than usual, but it was only once seen !!!!! Oh no!!!!! One time all !!!!! In addition, this film is about high school and things, and believe me, I will not go further with what's there ... <br /> Say ch ... smile !!!! ! (SNAP!) Avoid this at all costs. 0/10
