Do not be mistaken, this is neither horror nor real movie. I strongly advise you not to look at this 82-minute failure; The only reason he earned a star is the presence of Chris Pine. Nothing is happening. You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flicker of turning, a surprise of surprise, a complication that will appear - but not. We do not have time to develop - thanks to the savvy editors and sincere disgruntled writers - before we go back to the idyllic and playful (bring on teenage rock editing) state. The only thing that could exacerbate the situation would be to add a decaying symbol of an ethnic 'follower'. > Kris Pine struggles to keep himself above the surface while being drowned by the mischievous throw. Lou Tailor Pucci could not dry out if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves and combing the wilderness of Navada. See 'Way', watch '28 days later ', watch TV day ... but this; I beg you. To cope with boredom, unlike you who can take you to a movie, this movie is not a cure.
