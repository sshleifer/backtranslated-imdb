If you've ever heard these three words that you were told ... "Joe Don Baker", be afraid ... Final Justice is a low-budget action film based on a sheriff in a Texas city named Geronimo ( pronounced as Heronimo). He is an ugly, slim, rude figure who is looking for a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas. His partner is in the film twice. Very poor editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) ends in jail as 4 or 5 times in this film, making the plot go fast now. Plus, it shoots everyone like it's on a wild west. I suppose nobody told him that it was the 20th century. A female policeman was assigned to show him around Malta (which looks like Elaine from Seinfeld) and she is the only one able to withstand a peasant. Must be crazy! The strippers at the bar are the most funny characters in this movie. Their dance is shown through a movie and I began to tie up with sleazy women. Well, at least it was better than watching Gerons try to get out of something. The end is wrong and somewhat predictable, and I was happy that it was finally finished. You will never forget that last line of Joe Don Baker from the movie. It's so hard to imagine how he was in TRI Bond films ... very weird! Anyway, if it's for a laugh, then look at this at MST3K sometime. Also, I've heard other bad movies, including "Mitchell" MST3K version on DVD released by Rhino. I can not wait to see it!
