Vov. I do not even remember that much about that movie, except that it was a fusion. The plot is basically; the parents of the girl ignore them, so this guy PokeMon pretends to be her father. Am I the only upset of it? Then, this strange PokeMon is taking Ash's mother to pretend she's a girl. I do not care if he tried to make a girl happy, it's just rude. There was no real complication. The girl was just a coward who wanted things in his own way. She was playing with Unions, she was Ente's daughter, and apparently she could grow and shrink in the years with the gir, with the help of her "daddy." I think you can understand it as a hint rather than see it. (Or if you see it, do not expect much.) 1 out of 10. <br /> Seriously. If you want a PokeMon movie, rent "PokeMon; First Film".
