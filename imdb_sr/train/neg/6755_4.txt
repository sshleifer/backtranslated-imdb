Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she asked when she goes to a party at a pool with a handsome associate. When she and her friends and humorous friends say they belong to the 'killer club', Maddi takes it seriously and moves straight to 'Level 3' by striking a woman in the garage (for pushing a car) into the brain. But is Maddy the one who uses a plastic mask and kills other members of the group or has someone else lost her? The action of this movie (originally called MAKE 'EM BLEED) is very badly conceived, full of holes and spirits completely out of control before the nonsense ends beyond the left field. Some of the dialogues are completely funny. I had no problems with Rochon's performance, but the support was terrible. However, I managed to sit through this full moon full time. It has a lot of skin and blood and it's the perfect type of motion to sit with a group of your friends and disassemble them. Horror fans can enjoy Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (as Debbie's parents) and Julie Strain (early victim). Result: 4 out of 10
