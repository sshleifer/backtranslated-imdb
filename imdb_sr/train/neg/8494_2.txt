Expecting a combination of scifi and periodic film about Adi Lovelace, Charles Babbage, computer history, etc., I was disappointed with these films with meaningless pseudo-knowledge and a mixture of true and fantastic history. The impression is that her writer (Linn Hershman-Leeson) does not have a real understanding of mathematics, technology, or history that is the subject of the film, but rather works on some kind of vague artistic impression about them. This hit a painful place with me, for I have been irritated for a long time by the tendency of art to conceal and terribly misuse scientific terms and ideas to the point of confusion, for example: Emmi Coer: "information waves have half-life," Ada: "I'm not sure at all half the life is better than there is no life at all. "This movie seems even worse than it can not entertain - disinfects it. The only redemption value I can imagine is that it can attract the viewer to find out about the topic that distorts him so. I think it is more likely to promote the superficial perception of science and technology of any degree of progress that can not be distinguished from magic.
