I wrote at least half a dozen of sharp reviews of this impersonal little movie and nobody was published, so I have to say that someone on imdb.com really loves this horrible movie. The idea that a bunch of oil can revive a military tank that has been set up in the desert for more than a decade, and to rebuild a fighting machine, is meaningless. So is the behavior and direction. Upload it.
