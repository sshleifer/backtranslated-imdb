Watch this stinks! As everyone knows they are based on some Geico insurance advertisements; What nobody knows is WHY ?! These commercials were fun at first glance; barely animal feed for the series. (Speaking of Geiko Gekon - this is another story. Now it would be an intriguing series!) And why, in the name of God, ABC - as it was published in the press - actually agreed to buy the rights of cave people from Geica for this? After all, the idea of ​​cavalry fighting in the modern world is hardly unique to TV; Phil Hartman had a recurring role on Saturday night live as a lawyer without a frozen cave more than ten years ago. And this is the way this concept works best - as an occasional continuation. Or a regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (A 1960s series titled "It's Already Time" used cave people in the concept of the modern world. It lasted for one season.) One of the director of the show, who was also responsible for Geico commercials, they recently quoted: "We were so excited when we recorded our commercials because we felt like we had something unique and we had bigger stories." Wrong. In the bad TV anala, this is destined to take its place next to "I and the Chimp" from 1972 as one of the worst times. The main actor in the nasty Fiasco Chimp actually started hiding from shame after being abruptly canceled. There is no doubt that our friends from the cave will follow this example.
