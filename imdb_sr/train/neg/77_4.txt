I saw this weekend opening the film in Australia, expecting with great acting Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the final story of Ned Kelli will be in front of me. Unfortunately, despite the exceptional performance of Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was thin ... which did not inspire me to read "Our Suns". There were a few plus points, the support that specifically worked from Edgerton, a safe route from Jordan (confirming his talent at the show and in Buffalo Soldiers) as well as the production design that gave the real sense of roughness to the Australian bush, just like the Irish immigrants from the beginning The 19th century had to see this. But I can not feel that I missed another opportunity to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?) ... in what I doubt is the Hollivood concession and the sale of the picture in the United States. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers did not agree to lose a beard just to satisfy Universal ... I suppose I'll have to satisfy Peter Carey's excellent "secret history of Kelly". Banda. "4/10
