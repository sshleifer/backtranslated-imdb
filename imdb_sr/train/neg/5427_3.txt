A typical Goth Chick (Rainbov Harvest looks like a cross between the Vinona Rider in Beetlejuice and Boi George) gets even the people she thinks have hurt her with the help of an old mirror found in a new house she and her mother (horror) Karen Black, the only good thing about this travesty) to buy. The acting is pretty funny bad (especially when Rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror) and there is no fear or uncertainty. This film inexplicably emerged in 3 sequels, each one more than the previous one. For people who are looking for similar themes, but a far superior filmmaking, it would be a good idea to just look for the episode "Friday 13th Series", where a geeky girl finds an old damn compact mirror. It has more winter in the scarce 40 minutes than this whole franchise has provided over 4 films. My Rating: D Eie Candi: Charlie Spradling Ensures Mandatory T & A
