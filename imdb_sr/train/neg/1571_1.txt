Watching this movie made me constantly think; Why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes? There's a million options to slow down the car! In the "Speed ​​of Writers" movie, the least thought of a good reason why the car could not be stopped ... About this movie there are not many good things to say; all the usual narrative clichés appear, the actors are very bad, the story is like a leak like a sieve, etc. This makes this film a waste of time and money.
