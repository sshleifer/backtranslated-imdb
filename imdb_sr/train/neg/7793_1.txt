This is really one of the worst movies ever made. I consider myself a great zombie film fan and usually tolerate a bad acting, a "special effects" cock, a stupid story, and everything that can be encountered in sub-prime movies. This basically does not have a positive aspect and it has a third or fourth rate, maybe even worse. Some of my friends and I made a small movie during Sunday's holidays and definitely did a better job (without a zombie movie). This film is not even funny, not talking about anything else. Really bad and redundant special effects, zombies that look like normal people (except for the white extra skin that is pulled over their faces), WAY FOR MUCH FALSE (I really like realism, the combination of realism and Zombie movies is debatable, shown above is simple stupid). The camera stays quite long with feeding scenes, becomes boring, and can not help you wonder why zombies use WEAPONS (!) To kill their prey. I will not go into details of synchronization (others have done so). Although I'm from Germany and at least a little curious about the original version, I will not waste more time with this movie. Stay away from it, as far as you can.
