We entered this film because my husband enjoyed the original version of 'My favorite mars'. We had a 6 year old daughter with us. She wanted to leave half the film, which was good with both parents! The parts we saw were only occasionally ridiculous, mostly too stupid or rough. I expect this film to attract children from 9 to 12 years, if that's the case. Definitely not suitable for younger children. From what I heard, the original series was far superior and if you "survive the past," you will probably be disappointed.
