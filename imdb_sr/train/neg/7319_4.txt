when you get to the scenes that include Albert Bruce without his shirt ... try not to get stuck on the furry ball. I like Albert Brooks. I saw the majority, if not all of his films, but first I saw this film. Modern romance is an interesting topic of love. There are a few movies dealing with the love of love, as well as a modern romantic, although in 1979 the Cold Winter Scenes come very close. Both essentially deal with obsessed men who are too psychologically attracted to their women. Where - while the cold winter scene borders with the subject of dating, this film has a more substantiated basis with the theme of love, because both are already in touch ... and out of touch ... and again in it. And because the film was released in 1981, it's time for style concepts and the like. That's the main reason I love this movie. My basic rule when it comes to movies is: "If at least bullshit, it may have some historical significance," you know things in a time capsule. What brings me to the terrible scenes of Albert Brooks sans T-shirts. Man is a hair. Very hairy. It's like wearing a black curly fur sweater. And worse, it almost looks like a victim-hairy. It's not a pleasant sight and scenes with him without a shirt are continuing. In the early 80's, hairy men were considered normal and nothing shocking. But in 2009, looking at something like this is just an ordinary rebellion. Sorry, Albert! I wish that at some point somebody says "Hey, let's try this scene, but that you wear a simple shirt, I think you can scare people." It's really bad and I'm sorry the poor beautiful actress who had to deal with the bare body Albert Bruce. Probably for a few days after that she pulled out the hair from her teeth. Anyway, it's OK movie. It might have been better if I did not see Albert Bruce without his shirt for what seemed to me like 10 long uninterrupted minutes because it would forever hinder my watching this movie.
