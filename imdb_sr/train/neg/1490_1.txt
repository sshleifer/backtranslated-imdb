First, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie, and she's terrible. In this film, every horror moves the clich√©s into the imagination, and everyone is playing badly. Over-sex teen couple. Comic (not) horny jock. Snotti cool chick. Wrathful local guy. A couple of parental type. A girl who incredibly never dies in these films. The dialogue is so painfully awesome and delivered with the depth of a swampy pool. Almost like you want everyone to die earlier. I saw a rough cut in this movie some time ago, but somehow, this only worsened. Certainly, the funniest thing here is the ghost trying to eat Jameson's implants, but it hardly even appreciates even renting this dog. Avoid at all costs.
