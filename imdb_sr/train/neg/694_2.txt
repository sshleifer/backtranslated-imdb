These are the early 80's. There is a group of suspicious teenagers. And there's a maniac. Yes, this is slasherville. This film is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I do not even have the slightest idea. Unless your idea of ​​a big cup is to constantly hit someone's dinner with a baseball bat - in balance, not as a big joke; in fact, pretty rubbish, if the truth is true. But here it is. The film refers to a group of teenagers who are tasked with purging decomposition. They became aware that the psychopath is at large. In order to fight this development, they divorced and wandered in the dark. For most of them, it ends in tears. Pranks is a badly made slasher movie. The DVD edition I was watching was Vipco. It seems to be a bit of violence. This makes the DVD even more pointless, because, facing this, a film that is destroyed by violence is a waste of time. Only for slasher movies and videos.
