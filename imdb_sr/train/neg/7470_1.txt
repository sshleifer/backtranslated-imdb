In Sao Paolo, middle-class teens, Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel, just joined the university and go to a party with drugs and alcohol before opening the lectures. The next day, after the classes, Cristian's date came in his house the night before, and three friends rape a girlfriend. The girl is dying, the panicists decide to get rid of the bodies, but Cristiana's mother arrives, surprising Gabrielle and breaking the staircase, breaking her neck. The trio decides to throw out and burn the corpses at the garbage dump, but other tragedies occur during the night. and certainly the worst Brazilian movie I've seen for many years. A shallow, tragic and dark story is actually a black humorous comedy of bad taste. The scenario is not ridiculous, with stupid lines and dialogues, and boring, manipulative, and stupid recordings of interviews with moron teenagers in the beginning and at the end. The acting is terrible, apparently with many improvisations, but without talent, and I was disappointed with the presence of the promising Caio Blatt in this waste. Camera, framing, cinema and edition are amateur and of very poor quality. The sound is horrible and in many parts it's impossible to understand what the actors and actors are saying (probably it's a plus, since this movie is shit). Bang Bang is very real and is used to promote this central movie in the very bad marketing of sexual exploitation. My voice is one (terrible). Address (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ("Cats bed")
