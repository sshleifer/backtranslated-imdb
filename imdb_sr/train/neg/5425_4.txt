I have a Mirror Mirror mainly because Ivonne De Carlo was in it (I thought it was great in the American Gothic), but unfortunately it did not play a major role in this film. It starts OK and the pace moves nicely ... but in the end, it starts somewhat tedious and dull. This does not mean that this is a boring film, but it's just an average and nothing spectacular. I did not like the "posessive" side and there were no decent scenes. Plus, the 'main' story was very confusing and the ending made no sense. Nevertheless, I loved the story surrounding the Gothic girl and how she avenged her tormentors.
