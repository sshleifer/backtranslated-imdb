A bad two-character comedy-drama is rapidly turning into a polemic that is not-me-horrible-to-the-Indians, with poor special effects, exploitative use of nudity and ugly violence. It is sincere as the handling of politicians, which is obviously the field of car dealers, one of the worst films in the history of the universe. Absolute and complete dreck.
