Things become boring, often in this, in this mavkish jazz bio-fiction, written and directed by Spike Lee. Bleek Gilliam (Denzell Vashington) is a jazz bass player who works on creating a quintet that packs them in. the Underdog. His problems include an incompetent manager, saxophonist and two girls with whom he plays a musical mattress. The true love of his life is his trumpet and his music. Group manager, Giant, has a dangerous gambling problem and is proving to be an inefficient negotiator with greedy club owners and to be best dismissed, but Bleek remains loyal as long as possible. This will prove that he is canceled as an artist, but ironically contributes to his growth as a man. Like Bleek, Denzel Washington is as wrong as an ambitious baby trumpeter on every hand. It's too cute to focus so much on his art, giving patience and love to those who are close to him with a low key distance. He just does not have a fire. Veslei Snipes, who plays Henderson with a saxophonist, would be far more suitable for the role, but he would even have to enter into a relaxed scuffle of Lee's gloomy dialogue. Like Giant, Lee strikes trifecta with incredible performance that suits his writing and direction. Easy to try to mirror the crazy but sympathetic Ratso Rizza for Bleek's Joe Bucke, he cheers, and even "I'm walking here" from Midnight Covboo. In this case, you want the taxi to go over and finish it. Lee's script is all young argumentation, heavy hand and insulted insult with some necessary awkward editing that Lee needs to inject to stay in. Scenes between band members in the backstage and at the rehearsal are missing sparks and are surpassed only in the suspicion of Bleek, Giant conversations that have an ad lib look and go into circles. The completion of this tragedy is Lee's pretentious visual style. Tracking, zooming, and vessel tracking are lost and no significance for the scene. They just wander. Blues is Lee's love letter for jazz (which is implied by mountains of souvenirs disassembled by sets) and is all a sentimental trap that lacks passion and passion. Jazz on the movie is better served by Tavernier's Round Midnight and Eastwood's Bird, which are beneath the surface, reveal more side form, the pain behind it, besides offering infinitely superior performances by Forrest Vhitaker and doing the work of Decker Gordon. This Spike Lee Joint does not even offer a mild sound. It's pretty bad domestic.
