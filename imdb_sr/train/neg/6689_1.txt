I can only assume that the other reviewers of this "film" are shareholders in the production house, because it was probably the worst movie I've seen in the last five years. From the opening shot of a rabbi who laugh uncontrollably for no apparent reason, it was clear that the actors in this film would be killed in order to be considered "B-level". Both my wife and I were well in the mood before we started this film, and we sincerely enjoyed a fun movie about popcorn. We knew that we did not hire Citizen Kane, and we did not expect to see the most magnificent movie ever. However, after 40 minutes of the hardest immature garbage I ever saw, we turned it off instead of wasting another minute of our lives. If "comedy" is without laughter, terrible acting, thin plot and boring characters are your thing, then this film is for you. Frankly, Troll 2 is better - at least I laughed at the scene with sex with popcorn. I can not justify writing a longer review of this image because I've already lost almost an hour trying to find a joke. .
