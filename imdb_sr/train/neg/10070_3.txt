Roi Rogers plays Jesse James and his similar, gambler Clint Burns. George "Gabbi" Haies is a former friend of Mr. Rogers, Sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Salli Paine (Polly Morgan) are a worthy team, as are two journalists who are looking for tales of an elusive hero of a rebel. Naturally, the wrong identity / imitation is a complication of development, since Rogers essays have a "double role". Rogers is charming, as usual; But, there is nothing to boost its performance beyond the usual - any potential to achieve unforgettable Jekill / Hide effect is done by bad material. The best couple to watch are Mrs. Storm and Mrs. Paie as journalists of St. Louis Journal - they are the peak of the film. The songs are good, though poorly synchronized. *** Jesse James at Bai (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabi' Haies, Gale Storm
