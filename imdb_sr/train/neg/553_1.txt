After eagerly waiting for the end, I must say that I would like not to join the entire series in the first place. The last episode was all against the previous seven years. He destroyed everything. The trip lasted for 23 years, but Captain Janevai has the power to reduce her ... say, only seven years. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? The crew were dying all the time. Why only wants to save Seven of Nine? Others are not counting or what? The happiest part of the crew says that returning home is not the most important thing. As said, "the journey is more important than the destination". Incredibly. And on the final scene they are surrounded by other ships of the Federation and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing, returning to normal life. The worst end ever.
