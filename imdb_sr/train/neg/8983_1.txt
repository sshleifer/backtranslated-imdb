Ulises is a teacher of literature who comes to the coastal city. She will fall in love with Martin, the most beautiful girl in the city. They will launch a grim romance that will end with the tragic death of Ulis at sea. A few years later, Martina married Sierra, the richest man in the city, and lives quietly, happily surrounded by money. One day, Ulysses's apparition would have made her passion rise and act without thinking of the consequences. The action is quite absurd and none of the actors play a decent part. In addition, three quarters of the film are sexual acts, which are, still well recorded, quite tiring, as we want to see more development of the story. It's just a bad movie Bigass Moon, with lots of sex, no arguments and stupid characters everywhere.
