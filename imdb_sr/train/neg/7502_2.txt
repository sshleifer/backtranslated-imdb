I've always loved Spider Lee's films, but this was a total loss of 2 1/2 hours. I was expecting more about Son Sam, and I got a movie that had little to do with serial killings from 1977. The dog he was talking was ridiculous (you know that you are in trouble when all the filmmakers in the film did not dare to laugh). The whole movie looked very unconnected and not very interesting. Sex scenes were completely irrelevant to the plot. I do not oppose sex in movies, but it should have some point (unless it's a KSKSKS movie). All in all, we were very disappointed with this Spike Lee effort!
