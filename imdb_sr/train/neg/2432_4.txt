Not much about it. Action you can have pretty much in the first 10 minutes. Nothing too wrong in this movie, very little action for an action movie. There was occasion to explore emotions of characters from time to time. Whether action movie is a true genre for it, I'm still undecided. The sniper was one of the easiest films to watch without paying any attention, because it had a little complication and a clear plot. I guess I'm guilty of that, so with another clock or unadorned attention it can be better.
