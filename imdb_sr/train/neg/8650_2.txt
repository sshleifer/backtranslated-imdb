If there was no immature idiotic idiot, I know I insist that I watch this "documentary" that I would never see this comedy! This movie is full of bad scenarios and funny moments. One is where Afghan police / soldiers arrest Don Larson for shooting on the streets, while allowing the cameraman to continue recording his arrest, then drove off, still shooting, probably in his plush hotel. Then, there is a scene in which a car crashes into another car that is turned upside down and nicely parked on the side of the road without any evidence that it is in a collision or explosion. I'm surprised at the moment has the rating you have (5.8 / 10). I thought IMDb users had more meaning.
