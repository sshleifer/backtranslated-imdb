I first saw this movie on MST3K. And although I laughed with my jokes, I do not think this movie was so bad. It must have been hard to realize that it was quite a small budget, but it was very complicated in Hitchcock, and I can honestly say that when I looked at the non-MST3K version, I was really fun. This movie is shouting for Hollywood remake.
