I know actors and actors like to try different kinds of movies - hey, nobody wants to compete - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (Happy Birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloid should know better than this. "Angels in the Field" is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes and saves the day. Do I have to tell you how it ends? The film is just a modest escapism (examples of high escapism are various sci-fi films from the 50's). If these films had some political signature - or at least offered us a new look at life - then they would be fine; This is pointless. Far closer to the devil than angelic. Also starring Toni Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthev McConaughei, and I presume they do not want to accent this in their summaries.
