All right, I have to say that before discovering the 'monster'. saying that it really does not fit into that category, just a strange thing that had a boring cry! And I personally think Grandma could run away from this thing, but anyway. I actually embarked on this film, although the main character, a drunkard and a heroin addict, did not come as an appeal. But such scenes as when she escapes from the train, and you can see the figure on the door, it was a bit creepy, also where the guard was just killed, and the 'monster' put a hand on the screen. But then the disaster staggered from the moment the monster was discovered, it just became your average horror, with limited excitement or fears. I slowly became boring and I wanted to exclude this thing. As most people said she was cheering on homeless people to do it, especially a guy, he gave me a couple of cheap laughs here and there. I think this movie could indeed be something special, instead of becoming what every other horror is today! It's just boring and not worth the money. If you are looking for inexplicable fear here and there, or the foolish gest fest (which is limited, it's barely at all concerned) be sure to go, but for all of you serious horror watchers look somewhere else, much better movies there.
