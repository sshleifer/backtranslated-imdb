Villiamson's accent is difficult to pass. He talks incredibly fast, as if he is rushing to go through the lines. During solilooks, he behaves as if talking to someone, when he should talk to himself. All that and his bald spot just exasperated me. He was too old for this role. Reading Villiamson's other accounts, he might have gotten that role because he was crazy and the director decided to do something that imitates art or forced acting. When actors declare Hamlet crazy you believe it! Marianne Faithful was a stunning beauty and could destroy the role of Ophelia and still get a pass. The set is dark and ominous, but it looks like it was shot in a real castle, especially in scenes in tunnels / corridors where the dead king shines like a great light in the sky.
