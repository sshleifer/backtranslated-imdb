Of course I saw bad films in my life, but this one was so bad that I actually became angry at the theater. I wanted my money back. I wrote to the director asking him to give me a movie ticket, of course, that I did not receive a refund (or even a response), but that is important. On the scale of 1-10 I give this movie -42. Why did "Jeep" (Chevi Blazer) stop running from hitting a bat? Why did they hit "Jeep" (Chevi Blazer ?????) with a stick in the first place instead of breaking the skull of the ass? The action was skinny, the film was filled with obvious cliches, and certain parts did not make any sense.
