This is not transparent. If there is some kind of story here, it is so buried deep under the terrible faces and disturbing cameras that are invisible. There is a group of vampire hunters who go around doing their thing, and the vampires who kill them have small aliens inside them. They go out and speak like Speedi Gonzales. If you can imagine the blood and the covered house, the doll of an alien sock that screams in horror, while the cowboy fellow closes with a bovine asshole, well, that's what you will get here. These people are loud, disgusting, violent, and extremely annoying. Then, there are some anti-human people who stand in their CGI space ship so incredibly pompous that it can not be taken. These people make Hillary Clinton look like a right-wing extremist in comparison. Friends are with some vampires, or something ... who cares. Then there is the camera. You remember how everyone hated thousands of thousands of minutes from the recent Rolleball remake? People who shot this movie. It's enough for three really exhausted videos on MTV. Nuff said. This thing smells. For comparison, the Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
