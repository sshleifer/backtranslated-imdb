I write in the title that the story is ridiculous. Below I'll explain and explain why this, in my humble opinion, destroys this movie. The rest of the actors, however, do a very bad job. Keep in mind, this is not a complete mistake of the actors. The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones who have characters that have even the slightest space in the movie to really give any depth. All other characters have too little space in the movie to create any depth, or the character is so clichéed that it does not matter how many actors have tried. The director has a little complex, but looking just in the direction, I think he works well. But the story. This is a type of script that is bad in two ways. First of all, it's a bad film scenario. The characters are shallow (except for Gere's and Danish characters), criminals are clichés, and the actions of the characters are absolutely incredible. In addition, writers must have a plan where they want to return our views and ethics for a hundred years. It's a movie that says some criminals are still criminals, regardless of the fact that they paid the price they gave them. It is also a type of film that says, although only between rows, that every form of sexual deviation should be punished without trial, judge or jury. And of course, according to the film, everything that is not sex in a missionary position by a married couple is sexual deviation. So, if you go to a film school and you need an example of a bad script, or if you write scripts yourself and want ego reinforcements. Look at him. For everyone else, I recommend another movie.
