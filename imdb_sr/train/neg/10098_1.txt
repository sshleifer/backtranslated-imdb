It's not worth hiring a video or time or occasional efforts. Make-up that a child can do. * The acting is over ... bad director. * Editing was very upset ... many things did not make sense or looked free. * The sound is poorly synchronized. * Music was very unsuitable. * Casting was extraordinary ... it must be on the cracks. * Zombies who talk, let alone ... drive, dance, work ... just upset me. And a bad guy ... Holy shit! As he was terribly thrown like he was ... he was the best zombie of all. Which does not say much. Cover Art was good but very scandalous ... as well as DVD's main menu ... great artwork and music. DON "T BOTHER!
