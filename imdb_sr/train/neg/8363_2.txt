I gave him 2 instead of 1, because I think "Vild Vomen of Vongo" is worse. This is a practice of patience. It's like to clean your teeth from a bad dental hygienist. No complication. No logic. Certainly there is no acting (although the shark has some quality dialogue). We do not ask anything. We do not know how people got there. It is always strange that such things are even released. I agree with the previous writer that it's not even bad. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and will fill up so much space on the DVD collection. It's like paper. Or the bad picture you bought when selling hungry artists. Covering the cracks in the wall.
