According to IMDb, as well as any other website that has an overview; this "thing" does not have a director. Well, that would definitely explain a lot! Only a bunch of people who gathered to record some perverted pornographic sequences and put an ultra-thin story about devil victims in the walls of a hidden sanatorium. "Hardgore" is an excellent example of a wholly crazy 70's, because it is really made with minimal production values ​​and inspiration for writing. Horror films about Satanic cults were extremely popular during the early 70's and pornography, so why not combine these two? Here we have a simplified story about a young nymphomaniac dedicated to mental asylum, and from the very first night she was drawn into a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo-action. Really, a lot of dildo-action. A friendly lesbian sister tries to warn her, but her neck is cut even the same night. Horrible aspects are really poorly developed, going from funny non-intimidating Satanic masks to virulent cut-off attacks of the penis. Photography and acting performances are almost unbearably amateur, but what do you expect from a movie that contains spindle dildo and voice amputated reproductive organs? Leading Ms. Justina Linn is a pretty handsome girl with a fascinating body, but most of her stars (male and female) are disgusting and exaggerated hair slease balls.
