Many comments have already been published that tell me exactly how I felt about this film, so I kept it brief. as a versatile smart actor (in my opinion). Mike Miers, on the other hand, laughs by being dull. I loved him very much in his "Vaines Worl" and "So I Married a Ake Slayer" on the day - but I was never loved Austin Povers and "Cat in the Hat" just finished me. This movie was horrible - the gig was awesome! inadequate for children not only in adult content, but also in the fact that some of them were so outdated that they have not been entertained by anyone for 50 years! The action was messy, messy, messy! It is a pity that the children were very cute as it was "Mom". They could probably have chosen a better criminal than Alec Baldwin - but he could have pulled it out if there was no Miers of the ugly, disgusting, overly represented representation of the Cat. even a look at the script? Is it written? The other actors had one - but the Cat just looked like it wings! On the other hand, I would like to mention that the sets and props were wonderful !!! But, unfortunately, they can not save this film. Poor Dr. Seus - man was a genius! Do not ruin his reputation by adjusting his work in such a lazy, messy way! 1/10
