The Danish film "Slim Slam Slum" surprised me that I was the worst movie I've ever seen. I did not think it was possible to fill up my list of bad bad b-movies, but this deserves gold. It's not funny. Bad acting, badly recorded and the story is bad. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has three girls in it. I sincerely believe this film has the potential to overturn another Danish film "Styerner uden herner" as the worst Danish film ever made! And that's really something. Congratulations in advance!
