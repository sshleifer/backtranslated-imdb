I've heard of this novel long ago, many of my friends have recommended that I read it. I searched it at every place and finally found it. It is a book that every person needs to read, because he is genius because of his vision. I enjoyed every page. I knew about the movie and I could not wait to see him. When I was finally disappointed, many of the things in the book are not in the movie (I do not think this is a spoiler) that only makes the movie is not logical ... Michael Radford could be a good director, but a bad writer. Especially as the book adopter. The film is not dark at all, writing is really bad, the only thing that's good, even great, is acting. John Hurt is an incredible actor and the only person I could see as Vinston Smith. What makes me most angry is the people in the IMDb who called this "The Best Adaptation Ever", even without reading the book! Or know anything about writing on the screen! Brilliance stories can be understood only by reading a book, do not consider it as an alternative. As a book fan, I was very disappointed. The points that I have given for this movie are related to the acting.
