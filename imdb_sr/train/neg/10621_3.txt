I will not add a review of the plot, it's not very good. Very incredible orphanage in Bali. Cushing and Lee at their height. Some Beautiful Landscapes. Good for spotting the face, and I quote, "Look into your mouth, it's Cassie from Fools and Horses". Otherwise, a poor example of the British film industry. Fulton MacKai was far better at Fraggle Rock, Keith Barron was better at everything and Diana Dors did what she did best. ? It was free to watch the Horror channel before it switched to a subscription. I will not subscribe to this effort.
