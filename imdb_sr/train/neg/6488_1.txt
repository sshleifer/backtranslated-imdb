Yes, the subject is a real quote from the film and I think that's pretty accurate. I was so tired of dying with this senseless effort. All flashes and the like. It does not make sense after the first 20 minutes is just a bad movie recording. Of course, all fans of David Linch would raise a flag for this type of turkey to be "the best movie ever made" because it does not make sense and when it does not make sense, it must be art and art is always good. Right? I say wrong. This type of artificial capture is just a pathetic way to try to show that you are a good film maker. Anthony Hopkins as an excellent actor should only remain in the act.
