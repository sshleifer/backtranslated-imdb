The rise of Victor Vargas unsuccessfully collapses in what he is most trying: to be real. Unfortunately, there is no reality in this movie. The characters and situations feel completely skilled and fake. Reason? Bad directing. Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems that Mr. Sollett read somewhere that his non-verification of the film would give him an authentic feeling. Wrong! It just makes a bad feeling. Similarly, shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your movie, it only gives the audience a headache and draws attention from what is on the screen instead of improving it. Of course, what's on the screen is so painfully false, as if Mr. Sollett wrote his own script with the sole aim of trying to look "hip" to his friends from Sundance and show how "sharp" the film creator. All in all, the only lasting impression This film leaves you with what's bad director, Mr. Sollett. Next time, how about we take a few hours of writing and directing?
