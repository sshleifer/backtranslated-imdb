Well, this film certainly had a pretty good dose of hyps; From a rumor at the Toronto Film Festival to exciting comments on CBC Radio. A refreshing, crazy, hilarious indie movie obviously. For months, I was pleased with this. How can I simply say it? That was very big. The exercise in cinematic lameness that makes Adam Sandler looks like a comic genius. At best, it was mildly fun and in the worst case challenging a coma. The American script is poorly oriented and arranged arranged in an ugly mess. And what about the music that was 500 db louder than the rest of the soundtrack? It was the only really strange thing about it. If you want to see a really funny, bizarre movie in which aliens are, then try with Repoman. No comparison!
