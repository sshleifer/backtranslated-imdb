When I first saw a cinema movie 11 years ago, I adored it. I still think that directing and cinema are excellent, as are music. But it's actually a script that started to bother me more and more over time. I consider the writing of Emma Thompson self-absorbing and unbelievably original book; she reduced Marianne to the side person, the other violin on her too old, too serious Elinor - she got many types of 'focal moments' in the film, and it often seems that they are there just to show Thompson Sam. I understand that she cut off several characters from the book, but left out one scene in which Villoughby was redeemed in the book? For someone who is red and cherishes a book much before the movie, these are things that are always hard to digest. As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet like Marianne. It is not given the best scenario in the world for work, but it still draws it gracefully without too much sentimentality. Alan Rickman is great, maybe a little old, but he plays the role nicely. And Elizabeth Spriggs, she is absolutely fantastic as ever.
