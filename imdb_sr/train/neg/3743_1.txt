In the first episode, Jared Diamond pointed to the fact that other nations in the world did not have an animal for domestication, but the Europeans did it, and that explains why we managed to make steel and invent complex machines. But in the third episode he says that when Europeans in South Africa arrived too far to the north, they came across the Zulu and other tribes that were trampling on cattle and planting crops. So what explains their lack of technological, economic and artistic achievements if they had the key things that the author claims to be necessary for success? Diamond also claims that the calls in the form of large goddesses (brought to North America) black slaves) are our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can win 20,000 warriors and 400 non-war South Africans can win 10,000 Zulus without any casualties in both cases, then I think you have to conclude that the calls are irrelevant. With or without a microbe, we succeeded. He says malaria prevented European citizens from colonizing further north, killing "thousands" of Europeans without affecting the Africans. (I'd like to know real numbers, but he does not say that.) Then, in the end, says Malaria is killing thousands of Africans, and for that reason they can not catch us. So what is it, Jared? Has malaria helped Africans stop Europeans or hurt them? And how has Europe succeeded, despite massive pains in our history? It seems he is too eager to say that the reasons that the Europeans have succeeded because of nonsense. In times when the evidence threatens to overcome his difficult theories, he reluctantly acknowledges that perhaps the Europeans were successful because they worked for it. It is sad to see this obvious neo-Marxist reality in order to prove its claim.
