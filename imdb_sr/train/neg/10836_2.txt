"Magnolia" is an absurd, confusing acting showcase that adds very little. Like "Eies Vide Shut", "Magnolia" is a serene series of episodes without any concern for coherence. The camera passes through the corridor and the corridor, grabbing a gleam of sad characters. Where is the reason for taking care of these people? There seems to be a common theme of people who shout a lot, who can not worry about others (other than the characters of John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman), and self-destructive assholes who either fall or die. I remembered how much I do not like "Shine" because of the inconceivable monster of my father, played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unattractive characters here, why we want to spend time with them? Having said this, nothing is left around the "Magnolia". The ideas of Paul Thomas Anderson are abandoned on his canvas. There are two ideas, especially this bomb. Both are happening in the last hour of this 188-minute movie. The camera turns from one character to another until each of them sings one of the Aimee Mann folk songs. Cute, but ineffective, because we can not see what makes them all together. The other idea I invite can not be revealed except to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous. Especially Tom Cruise who performed the performance I did not know he had in him. A John C. Reilly is playing the most trusted and really good cop in recent memory. But all this does not give anything. When a secret unexpected event happened, the girl behind me in the theater could no longer hold her and said, "This is stupid!" My feeling is that most movie viewers will agree.
