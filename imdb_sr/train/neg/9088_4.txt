It has been said several times - not only for me - that watching Eric Rohmer's film is a look of dry color; It seems that Mr. Rohmer despises him (he does not deny it, but as he then could, he only became angry) that his new film, which could be his last, Inch Allah, set up so far is to watch how It dries. Those wonderful people who gave you Nouvelle Vague, Cahiers du Cinema have already named him one of the best movies in 2007, so you should be given the idea. The reality is not high on Rohmer's plan, so in the 5th century France we have on one extreme a castle that would not be in place in the Loire valley, while the only other apartment we see is a rude wooden cabin. The story relates to nymphs and shepherds, and as Rohmer often threw away with strangers that just happened, the overall effect is that the annual performance at school for pupils with special needs is recorded accidentally on film. The man is almost tempted to say, 'Go back to Godard, it's all forgiven,' but even this poor production can not make me say these words.
