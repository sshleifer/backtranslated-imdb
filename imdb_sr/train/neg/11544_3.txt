I really enjoyed watching this, because I love Danny Dieter and I think Gillian Anderson is a talented actress. The beginning was interesting. I like the connection between the two stars. Then he jumps quickly to the main plot, which is attacked by a group of aliens, and Dier is very bad, while Anderson is raped. They then decide to retaliate. It sounds good, is not it? Well, it's not. The story becomes boring and lateral, and certain things become really strange. I will not give any details, but things happen so I, for example, have no desire to see. I like to give all the movies a benefit of suspicion, and I really wanted to like this movie. Simply failed. I give her 3 out of 10, mostly for acting.
