I do not understand this. The film obviously has a pretty good budget. It has very good cinema. It has nice pacing, good editing and pretty good directing. Then WHY OH WHY did not hire someone to do a final transcript of scenarios, so it would not be that damn cheesy and WHY OH WHY hired such bad actors who can not get out of a paper bag? This movie could have been good. In most cases it looks good and feels good, but in the end you realize that the movie was not good at all. I would say that this is a good production, but a bad movie. It's really damaging. And eel? Come on, really!
