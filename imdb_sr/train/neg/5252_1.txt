I read some comments on the internet about this movie as "... harder than the hostel ...", "the camera never shows when it's really brutal ...". But none of them is true. The camera never shows, because it has nothing to show. The same scene is repeated a hundred times. Women lie on the table, the killer raped women several times, the killer cuts women into pieces (you never see this during the whole movie!). The police came and arrested him. The assassin is deceiving the jury. Movie over. In Germany we would say "Viel Larm um Nichts". All in all, one of the boring films I've ever seen. Absolutely not recommended.
