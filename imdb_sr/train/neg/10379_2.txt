The film begins in 1840 in Japan, in which a man kills his wife and his lover, and suicide. It's a very bloody, bloody sequence. Then jumps to this day ... so 1982 to be precise. Ted (Edward Albert), wife Laura (Susan George) and their boring little children moved to Japan because of her husband. They rent a house and - a surprise! surprise - it's just the house where the murders took place! Three dead men are around like ghosts (make-up is hysterical) and make life a hell for a family. Sounds OK - but it's really hopeless. There is a bloody opening and ending and nothing is happening between. There is an attack of giant crabs that is just furious! They look so fake - I swear I saw the wires pulling one - and they mutter !!!!! In the first 20 minutes there is a meaningless sexual sequence (probably just to show George's body), another 40 minutes later (but that was necessary for the plot) and really silly exorcism to the end. The battle scenes between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen to be believed. As for the acting - Albert was fine because husband and McClure were pretty good as a family friend. But George - as always - is great in a bad movie. She gives this movie a much needed lift - but she can not save it. I'm giving this 2 just for her and bloody opening and closing. Aside from this, this is a very boring film.
