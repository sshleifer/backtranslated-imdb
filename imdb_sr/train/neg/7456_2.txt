This may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close. Producers of this film stole my watch and my life, and I want it back! Chris Kattan is ridiculous about 10 minutes. His high voice and crazy noise start to stare, and then realize that the rest of the film is much worse. It enters a long line of ex-SNLs that tried the movies. Some were brilliant, some were ruined. There are not many middle ground in this category. Although Chris Farley was brilliant, then fine, and then not so funny, and then dead ... so I guess he hit the whole spectrum in one career. / / c
