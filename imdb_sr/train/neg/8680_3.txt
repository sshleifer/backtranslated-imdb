I just finished watching this movie and the VOV was so bad. In fact, the only thing that kept me was that it was so good, it was a little fun. The action of the characters is hilarious, from the hyper-dramatic way they fall into the shooting, to their incredibly bad acting (do bad guys just pull off the street, or are they actors?), Unbelievably poor delivery lines, to their inexplicable actions ( if you try to kill someone through the door as they enter, it's obvious that the thing to do is shoot directly on the knob !!). This film must break some record for the worst written and delivered lines. Working with cameras was also very bad - you can barely see what happens in combat scenes due to changing camera angles and trembling. /> I would vote "1" except that I like Chiba and assistant Sue Shihomi, and I have entertained several scenes: 1) breaking the criminal so that the bone pops out of the skin (it must hurt) 2) the king of drugs who eats a brown animal (ape) by hacking in a carcass with a butcher's chalk 3) Sonny Chiba performs an improvised eye operation on a type of finger. > <br /> I'm actually a great fan of Sonny Chiba, but this really is not worth anybody. I saw about 7 or 8 of his films and I came to the conclusion that the only ones worth watching (and they are great!) Street Fighter and The Killing Machine. I heard that the Executor and the Golgo 13 were good. I recommend keeping these ones.
