As one of the few commentators who did not see the first film, I found this to be a very disappointing movie. Yes, there is a funny uncomfortable type of humor if you can handle (high) morally suspicious premise. However, it does not work in important areas. There is a thin and senseless lot associated with the generous friend Gordon Sinclair who may or may not be involved in conspiring to supply dangerous electronics to third world countries - possible on free computers ... or maybe not. Unclear, long-lasting and unconvincing. The lack of any essential ending is so angry and what is present is pompous and completely illogical. The film feels half finished. Suspension of disbelief is extremely difficult when a very attractive teacher (Maria Doile Kennedi) is testified, which can draw attention to the unreliable character of Gordon Sinclair, especially when defending himself from advancement. Laughable. Later he gets worse in the film when he realizes his romantic ambitions, and then rejects it all for some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value. Little movies leave me to be deceived, but I have felt my time is stolen.
