The brides dying in front of the altar and their corpses disappear. Nobody knows why and who, but a research journalist (Luana Valters) notices that every bride wore a strange orchid and she goes on a conversation with her creator, Dr. Lorenzo (White Lugosi). Now Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping in coffins and injecting his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) into a fluid of young bride to keep her youth. an interesting premise and a short enough lifetime that should not be bored. Unfortunately, as it moves well, it begins to pull out halfway and becomes quite annoying with its clich√©s and predictable complication. There are some good things about it - White Lugosi is charming and evil and brilliant; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, sweet, durable and very dreadful countess; and I'm always the fan of Angela Rossitta. Luana Valters is also convincing as a reporter here. It retains a little Gothic atmosphere and sets are decent. But all in all, just did not manage to keep my interest in the whole picture, and for that reason I have to evaluate it badly.
