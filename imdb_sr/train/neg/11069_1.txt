I really felt cheated when I saw this picture. It looked like I watched this movie 101 minutes for nothing. I do not understand what they thought when they did this. Hardly happens in Jeffrei Dahmer's murder and there is no end to it. It was almost as if they left the film open to continue. It was like watching TV episode Soprana. It ends suddenly, and you know that the next week will be another episode. He also felt like I was watching part 1 in two. There are many options for what went wrong; they became lazy, they ran out of money, did not know the rest of the story, they wanted to make Dahmer 2. After they saw this movie they all sound very precise. I was watching Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the woods. Suddenly I hear music playing, then on the screen it says that it says that Dahmer served two years in prison and was attacked by a prisoner and killed at the age of 34. forest to death in prison. How about showing how he got there. How about showing Dahmer's trial. What do you say in more detail. I can not even explain what happened in this movie, because it went up everywhere. Actually, I found myself in disbelief, "That's it, is it the end?" I want to finish this review saying that there is still a good Dahmer movie. For movie authors, I would like to say, if you do, do it right.
