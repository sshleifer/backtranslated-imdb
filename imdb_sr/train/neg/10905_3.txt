The guy is a loser. I can not get girls, they need to be upgraded, picked up by stronger, more successful guys, etc. I must say Rob needs to pass Adam Sandler's part of his life. And get out of the pitch of Adam Sandler. There are two funny things in the whole movie. I could not finish the last 5 minutes. I was bored. "Animal" is a good movie. I usually enjoy Adam Sandler movies with the same plot. But this was too hard to impress. Jokes are very old. Well, believe me. This is not a movie in which most people could really enter. But some have done it, so I'll be good. 3/10
