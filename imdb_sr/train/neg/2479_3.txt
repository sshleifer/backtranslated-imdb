For Vendigo I first learned about many years ago in one of Alvin Schwartz's "Scari Stories" books: according to this story, Vendigo - after calling your name in the wind - dragged you, then pulled you to heaven and dissolved you. Although it sounds like a rather bizarre notion, Schwarz's story turned him into a rather coherent idea. Film "Vendigo" no. It basically consists of every horor flick: the family moves into a new house and strange things start to happen, anyone who hurts them requires it, and everyone better listen to the old Indian. I've seen these things so many times that I no longer try to count. In any case, avoid this. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Devey at "Malcolm in the middle") did much better than this.
