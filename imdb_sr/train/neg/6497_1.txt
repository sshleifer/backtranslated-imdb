In fact, I was hoping to get into this movie, so I took what was given to the grain of salt and hoped for the best. About 1/3 times through a movie that I just had to give up, it's simply a movie of mish-mash things that happen for no reason and everything is turned off. I love the movies that you're thinking about, but this movie was just a bunch of ideas that were together and they were never really connected. nowhere near this area except some trippi visuals. Saying art is concealing the fact that there is no obvious complication or story is just a way or justification why you lost 1.5 hours in the movie. The acting was good, but it can not save the lack of a story. I agree with one previous comment ... "it's like you are in the head of another person ... while they are on drugs", in other words, nothing makes sense.
