I saw this film when it was released, and my disgust for him was stuck with me all this year. Here's why: Greenava's goal seems to make every literary figure in Tempest literary. If a person says, "my heart will fly," a truly human heart would be shown, with attached winged pigeons, fluttering on the screen. This process makes some lush tables, but after all it's a light exercise. And it becomes deadly boring. I do not regret that other viewers have found in this movie, but it's worth knowing that not everyone in the audience was thrilled.
