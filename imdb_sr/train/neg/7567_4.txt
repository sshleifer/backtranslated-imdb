Story: Ioung-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she starts to believe she's actually a cyborg. At the institution she meets the Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a connection with her. If you are reading this, you probably already know how talented Chan-vook Park is. But "I am Cyborg ..." is a big departure from the famous and (unfortunately) stronger territory. I am a great fan of every movie or story that tries to do something else. God knows, we will all be subjected to enough shit in our local cinemas. The main thing in the movie that I should say is that it fails to say anything about a mental illness, or to create the characters that you care about. I've seen for years ... but strange is not enough. There's no heart in the movie ... just surrealism and confusion. Confusion seems to be the main theme of the film. All the characters are trying to understand their problems, but Chan-vook Park itself proved to be the most important.
