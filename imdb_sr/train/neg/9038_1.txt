This is Bartleby's terrible production, although not, as the other reviewer said, because it is "non-fiction", but because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book. She witnesses the story, almost painful. Looking at it, I could turn the pages in my book and follow them, which is not so much fun when it comes to adaptation. Instead, look at Bartleby's 2001 version with Crispina Glover. This version, although witty, brings new details to the film, keeping the spirit of the novel. What is important is the spirit, not the small things such as setting, the names of characters and costumes. The difference between these movie versions is like night and day, boring and hilarious. This version is a lesson about what can go wrong if the adaptation is handled by a bad, painful, stiff mind.
