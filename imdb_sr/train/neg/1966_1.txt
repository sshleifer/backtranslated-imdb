I was cheated to see this movie after I read a positive review from another site and the man was p.o'd !!! it took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up from the shelf, but I do not want anyone to see me. then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use the real money to rent it. I thought that all my stress would pay off until the moment I go home and watch the movie b / c, and the review I read said that the film is a pleasant surprise; What a joke! If you can go through the first hour of the film then you will have luck! b / c was not horrible until then. Do not bother with these people, you better watch the "falling of water"
