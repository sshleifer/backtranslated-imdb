I rented this only because I loved the first movie. However, calling him John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a trick that will prompt you to rent it. He was, in fact, an executive producer and apparently had nothing to do with filming this movie (Jeepers Creepers Anione?) A tragic story, terrible special effects, and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing vampire hunter all the time. It's not even comedy bad. What we're ending is boring, not including a movie with a horrible script and irresistibly bad and clich√©d acting. He just stinks at a low budget. Avoid as a bubonic plague.
