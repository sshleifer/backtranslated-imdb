SAKURA KILLERS (1+ of 5 stars) Maybe in 1987 this movie might have looked cool ... you never saw a * good * ninja movie. Cheesi'80 with music ... cheese dialogue ... cheese playing ... and put-over-cheesi martial arts sequences. The best scene is at the beginning ... with old Chuck Connors playing golf on the beach ... a few black ninjas trying to sneak in and seem to be too intent on hitting the ball to notice ... suddenly he gets into his a golf bag and ... no, I will not spoil you ... if you ever have an accident to see this movie, you will thank me. The story is a lot of nonsense about a stolen video cassette or something similar. A bunch of fuzzy Caucasian heroes are dressed in the way they ninja because "only ninjas can fight the ninja" or something like that. Strange, these guys do not seem to be fighting better after training than before ... well, the movie is moving pretty fast. Scenic battles may not be great ... but they are abundant ... and exaggerated sound effects are good for a few sneaks.
