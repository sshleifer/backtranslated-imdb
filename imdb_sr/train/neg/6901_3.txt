The most positive thing I can say about this boring local "comedy" production is that it is harmless. In fact, it's so amazingly foolish to wonder how dozens copied by the committee went through such a complete removal of personality. It's not funny, it's not fun, it's not insightful and it's not charming. It's just a stable, ridiculous, progression of four losers who have to change their ways-and their attitudes toward women-to be allowed to attend their best friend's wedding. With a procedure that would be more favorable to a local amateur drama society, the plot line so tired that the forty-third season of 'Allo' Allo would look fresh, and jokes that were humorous like watching the decaying vegetables, Sione's wedding, though has won ten nominations for the NZ Recently awards have been awarded. Fortunately, someone saw the meaning and did not win.
