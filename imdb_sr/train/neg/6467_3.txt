I still can not believe this movie. They have so many incredible things in themselves that it's hard to believe that anyone wanted to do it. How can you mix a comedy with robbery of a train, prison movie, city conspiracies, sex jokes and an FBI agent? You can not. In addition to frightening directing, the most notable thing are the actors. I watched this movie and thought: 'Is it really Marlon Brando? No, it can not be. (5 minutes later) Is this Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is true. (5 minutes later) This can not be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino. This film is bad for all of them. (At the end). No, no, no, this can not be Martin Sheen !!! Not for 10 seconds of such a movie. Then it was over, and I went down to the nerves. So many good, Oscar, usually convincing actors in such a stupid, stupid, horrible movie. I rarely wanted to know so much how they got to this. They could not get that much money. Just incredible stupid idiotic film. 3/10 1/4 5 (1+ - 6)
