Cafe Lumiere is nicely photographed zero. Not familiar with the director's work, I am well acquainted with the director allegedly honoring - Ozu Iasujiro. Although not even approaching Ozu in size, Hou did not announce anything about Ozu's depth of emotions and concentration on meaning within a closed space. One of the things he misses is dedicated to Oz's attention to character - even Hou did not "introduce" us into his main character (the perfect blank page). There are no middle-sized or close-ups of his people. One of the DVD supplements offers interviews with actors and gives us exactly what Hou is - a good look at their faces. to something like "Nothing that ever happened". It would be far better than this senseless exercise. Throughout the film, there are traces of the mysterious Taiwanese composer, whose works we hear on the soundtrack. But the traces, like everything else, do not give anything. Unless you're a train driver, this movie has nothing to recommend.
