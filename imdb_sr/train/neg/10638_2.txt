Proof that everything that Tarantino touches turns into gold. This is definitely plastic, all the way to the end. It is easy to see that without Kuentin's involvement, probably for years, they would sit on the shelf, assuming that they would ever be produced at all. It's about a woman who's fascinated by the death that's about to work after the crime, Angela Jones is unconquerable in this role, Villiam Baldwin is better than the serial killer who keeps Jones in business! All in all, pretty poor.
