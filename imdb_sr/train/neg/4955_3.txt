In the light of the recent and quite good Batman, Brave and brave, now is the time to take a fatal blow to that mistake in Batman's life. Being a great fan of the first revival of Tim Berton 20 years ago, I was able to accept different tonalities in the face, dark or stony. This is not only credible: too many effects, bad intrigues and so few questions. What is great in Batman is the diversity of his abilities and aspects of his personality: detective, crime fighter, plaiboi, philanthropist, etc. Batman shows him only in his karate for days. And by the way, how is it that the Penguin is capable of such virtuosity when he jumps into the air, regardless of his cunning wealth? And look at Joker, the blend of Blanka at Street Fighter 2 and the stereo-shaped reggae man, what kind of fan Batman can accept such a betrayal? Not at all. Batman is much better without the "The" article in front of his name.
