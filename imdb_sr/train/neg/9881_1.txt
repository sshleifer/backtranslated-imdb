De Debu's debut film remained invisible for eight years ?? and so it must be left! John Derek was a competent actor, but as a director, he is practically Ed Vood erotic movie? not that it is particularly explicit, since Bo (atypical sports dark hair) was only 16 years old when the film was shot! Jovan also wrote and photographed him; This last results in some decent recordings of the setting up of the Greek island, against which the narrative was placed? but planning is childish and the dialogue is terrible! The character of male leader Peter Hooten was raised with Bo's family: they grew up as brothers and sisters, but now, in the teens, the couple reveals that they are attracted to each other (but, as I said, do not expect any sexual fireworks!). Still, the worst thing about this is the fact that protagonists carry an obsession in a movie that is not only stupid in itself but irritates in their ruthlessness? Hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modern seaside resort and he is always expecting a cruise ship to appear in perspective (which, of course, is at the end); Derek is even more insane? is keen on owning a big antique bath !! To be sure, the couple is getting married to the end of the movie. In non-events are included the mayor of the city and photographer Lothario who wants to make a model of Bo (and which, of course, provokes the anger of jealous Hooten). Occasionally, for no good reason, we are even treated with excerpts from the presentation of old Hollywood classics in an open-air movie house to which the entire city is gathered (among the titles shown is THE PUBLIC ENEMI [1931])! At the end of the day, while Bo naivete in all this is undeniably charming, it is not enough to compensate for the excessive dullness and amateur behavior of the film.
