First of all, this film can be divided into three segments. A promising opening, with a seating of a cavalry by Cheienne. Then follows what can only be described as a long boring middle part, with the completely wrong Candice Bergen and Soldier Blue who travel together to achieve the security of the crew. Miss Bergen throws out four-letter unsuitable words every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just got out of the 1970s film Jack Nicholson. I mean, it retains zero interest, with zero credibility. The third and final part includes a totally free slaughter of an Indian village. This is so obviously exaggerated to put on an antiwar propaganda, that it comes as simply long, uninitiated and fictitious. Not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here's the idea. Why do not you actually watch the movie you're commenting on, instead of chirping your liberal nonsense. This is not a political site, but to watch movies. - MERK
