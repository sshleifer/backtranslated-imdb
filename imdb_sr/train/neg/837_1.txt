I saw and I liked the first two, really. Especially because another is not just an attempt to make another good as the first one. And that's the story that stands alone. You do not need to know the first movie. And I liked it in the films "Free Villain". But ... third, here is absolutely useless! I tried with my friend, because we both liked the first two. We decided to stop after a good half an hour. The film is fine, there are mixing parts in it. But why? Timon and Pumba were entertaining creatures in the first two films. What the Lion King is for me is: a difficult attempt to entertain the first film more than it was, plus to tell the story from their point of view. But why? I really would like to know. You know, the idea that the two of them sit in the movie watching the first one is really good. But what follows is mostly unnecessary. I suppose many people liked Timon and Pumbu, like me. However, for me, many parts were very designed, trying to be funny. No way, most were not at all funny, at least for me. Btv. What was the movie at all? Was it about Timon and Pumbai or b) an attempt to have more fun than the first film? I'm inclined to choose option b and I'm very disappointed with that. If you want to see stories like "The Story behind KSI," you should see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" by Tom Stoppard with Tim Roth and Garry Oldman. It's really funny and I'm not trying to extract more from "Hamlet" and then it has it.
