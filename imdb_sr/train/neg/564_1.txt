Producers made a big mistake throwing Mark Lester, who could not play or sing, in the lead. In addition to the very bad "acting", all Lester's singing had to be synchronized by the girl. I do not know why they were thrown at all because there would be so many boys who could play the role infinitely better and sing themselves. Shani Vallis was too old to play Nancy, which was supposed to be only 16. The current version of West End is much better than a movie in every way. Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and is certainly far better than Jack Wild ever has been. There was obviously a political reward for this old-fashioned musical so many Oscars after the turbulent events of 1968.
