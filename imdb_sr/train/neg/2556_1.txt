Well, everything was said about this movie and I hate it when I write reviews where everyone else has already said what it says. But the thing is, I've seen zillion movies and I'm working on writing reviews of all the movies I've seen. Well, I have to write something. The acting is stupid. It's really stupid that the news head expresses his sorrow over a plane crash. The nurse is a beautiful and professional assistant who comes to take care of the child. The three main killings in the movie are so bad to wonder how stupid the creators of this film are. They do not realize they can still be scary. We do not see how the granpa was killed. The dentist and his assistant made me feel that they deserved to die, but you just do not feel sympathy with them. Uncle Tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been better. We just hear him screaming and we can not see anything!
