If your idea of ​​entertainment is watching graphic images of people who have run over in a car (you can see a woman walking under the front wheel, weird when the car crosses over before she goes below the last point - and they show it twice if you missed it for the first time) then this is a documentary for you. I was not concerned about this very disturbing piece of voyeurism, but that was enough for me. Maybe the rest is even better. I wonder how long it will take TV networks to start showing blurry films. Perhaps the toys are based on the self-esteem of the beautiful. I already know that there are disrupted people in the world and that terrible things happen. I do not have to see evidence on television that turns into a party.
