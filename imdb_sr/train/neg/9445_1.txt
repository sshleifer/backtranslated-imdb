Shame Shame on UA ​​/ DV for what you are doing! I was stunned. Do not take the kids to see this movie. Humor is totally unsuitable for children - plus they will be boring and disappointed. Certainly * we all read Theo's wonderful book for kids and we certainly have expectations ... but this is a clean garbage. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would never give his "thumbs" to such a cowardly attempt to exploit the classic. What is the damage. Spend money on the book. If you have a copy, then buy a book and donate it to the Small Toys program. This movie is NOT worth a "free" viewing card. Hold on to the books. The TV cartoon version works well if you want a visual image - save your money ... seriously. SAVE your money - it will be on the cable day of the holy patty. Shame is the shame of shame for what they do !!
