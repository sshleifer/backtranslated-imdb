Truly, true, endless, terrible, terrible. But actor Claiton Moore (Lone Ranger movie) qualifies as an actor. He's the only one. One rare treat, five minutes, if you want the depth of the grotesque transparent special effects, Southern California calls the "Moon" (over and over again), and behaving so exclusively that it can be a hoax. . . except that it is clear that it is not - there is no humor here, except inadvertently. Dialogue can be worse than any of these other aspects, and costumes. . . Well, it's been said enough. Plot? What plan? A bad guy (well, a bad guy's head) and his supporters, including his earthly agent called Circle (listen carefully or you will suspect that it's a scam in the name of the founder of McDonald's Rai Kroc) and his incredibly incapable guns (which, however, with guns which never need to be reloaded, as well as Commando Codi, so there are numerous fire brigades). Enjoy.
