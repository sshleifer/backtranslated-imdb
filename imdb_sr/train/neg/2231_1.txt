All I can say after I watched Snitch is, please, stop Mr. Cahill. It is painful that you have no idea what movies you are creating. If you insist on filming gangster movies, I invite you to research. It's comical to watch movies with absurd gangs that even sound absurd when they speak. <br /> <br /> I laughed when the g. fu fashion. This movie was as difficult as a specialty after school. Who had the idea to wear hats that say where a certain gangster came from? I guess true gangs do not wear hats that claim to be gangs. It would be stupid in view of the new laws that add the length of a prison sentence if a person is associated with gangs. Snitch'd is the worst movie ever shot.
