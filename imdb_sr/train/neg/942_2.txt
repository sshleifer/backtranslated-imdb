I saw this late at night on the cable. At that time, I did not know that the girl who was charged as "Shannon Vilsei" was actually a porn star, Savannah, but she was so beautiful (and so often naked, thank God) that I actually sat through this nonsense. I like a cheerleading as much as the next guy - more than the next guy, actually - but it was far from cheesy and more rougher. The really unpleasant exaggeration of the complete incompetence of crazy scientists and directors, writers and special effects diminishes free nakedness, which is the only saving grace of the film. Savannah, before she turned into a plasticized Barbie doll she became a queen of pornography, is really interesting to watch - she is beautiful, sometimes turns into uncontrolled giggle, looks out of the camera, and laughs and looks like she looks really good , which is more than it can be said for the audience. Although Savannah and her colleagues spend a lot of these photos naked, she still can not hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid, poorly made and boring movie. If you know someone who has it on the video, or if it happens some evening, check it out, but do not spend money on the lease.
