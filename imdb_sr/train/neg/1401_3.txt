Someone mentioned editing. This is poorly arranged and what started out as something intriguing has become an incomprehensible mess. To begin with, let us know what you are trying to do with these experiments. Why are these people the best choice for the type of experiment they are involved in? And what exactly are they testing? Obviously there is some great plan that an agency will use. The acting is pretty bad. Everyone is emotional. Everyone keeps the secrets. They often mention that if there were no money, they would hang it. There is a disturbed minister who pronounces letters. Constantly. But, again, the biggest interruption is the absence of setting the terrain for the actors. There are some really raw elements. These small rooms and deck chairs. A terrible background (it was a background?). It was interesting, but it does not appear to be going anywhere.
