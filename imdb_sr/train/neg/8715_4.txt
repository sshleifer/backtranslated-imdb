Primal Species comes from the B legend about Roger Corman and as such, everyone who watches this needs to realize that this is a low B budget movie and that he knows it. they kill the entire army, they believe they are holding uranium, but they do not ... contain two Dines with a taste for human flesh ... Then a Crack team, which could be called Delta Force, is also calling. . Okay, this is not the Jurassic Park, and that Dino's are never seen clearly because it's obvious that the guy in a costume that does not differ much from Barney's dinosaur - just a little bit scary, but he comes on Boys this had about 1% of the Jurassic Park budget and as such do what they can. Is it deserving to be at the bottom of 100? .... NO NO !!! I think that almost half of the voters who give this 1 VAI VAI are overly rough, it's much closer to 4 ... it's actually much better than a whole lot of other films that are not in the bottom 100, and has a similar production value for the production of Sci-Fi channels . (again Films that get too harsh weather from critics here on IMDb) The acting is expected in the B movie, although none of the actors take it seriously, nor the script All in all this is a pleasant movie B - not for film snobbes ** from *****
