I was always a big fan of Voody Allen and I will always be for the majority of what he did in the past, but only a blind lover could ignore how dull, meaningless, pretentious, and most bravely acted this movie. Empty mental masturbation based on inconsistent basics. And what a catastrophic idea to rebuild artificially the "Allen-Clone" actor, that's putting into the mouth and gestures of Vill Farrell what Allen would have done at Farrell's place that he was 30 years younger. The outcome was obviously ridiculous. And let's not talk about dialogues ... what was supposed to be philosophical thinking turned into a reluctant mocking of intellectual thinking, unconscious of his comedy effect. How sad ...
