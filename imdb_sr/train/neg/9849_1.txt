This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen *! It's bad, even on TV Movie. The action is devilishly defective, and the famous names in this film are spent on confused, uncertain characters. I do not know how the director managed to keep that pronunciation of the film together - that's so bad. Written as 'Psychological Horror Thriller' - it's certainly Horrific. There is nothing exciting about it. And that could bring you psychological damage! The initial opening scenes maintained such a promise - possible embarkation on whether the soul is only one aspect of the brain, but the extreme ruins that followed the plane crash is incredible. No matter how hard you are, you do not care more about characters. There are so many ideas that the film is at best a collage of unconnected phrases by Chinese philosophers, and in the worst case scenario, the movie would make you go to Brain Dead! , and this is the FIRST, to which I will return my money. KLONITI.
