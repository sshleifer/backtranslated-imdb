First, let me give you some idea of ​​my taste in movies ... 2007 Comedy I enjoyed: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades of Glori 2007 Comedy I hated: Almighty Evan, Brothers Solomon, Happy Chuck I needed to follow my first instinct and shut down the "Hot Rod" after I arrived for about 20 minutes. Up until that moment I knew that this film would not make me laugh once. The script is absolutely brutal - I have no idea how this monstrosity managed to break 6 on the IMDb. Any person older than 10 years who has enjoyed this must be some sort of mental malfunction. This approach is not approaching anything with Vill Farrell, and it is clear that Andy Samberg can not carry anything longer than 5 to 10 minutes of sketches on IouTube or SNL. I do not know how they linked Ian McShane and Isla Fisher to this movie ... they owed their services or something. I came to know that this would be a stupid movie, but I thought that would be at least funny. I did not laugh so much. Usually I do not comment on IMDb movies, but this was so horrible, I just had to warn people. This is just the fourth movie I've seen that I'm compelled to rate 1/10.
