Some people think it was the worst movie they ever saw, and I understand where they come from, but I really saw it upstairs. Of course, it's about movies that I can remember (ie those I did not block) that were worse than this, were so bad that every sense that was involved in watching was physically hurting film. Movies that are worse than War Games 2 are those who want to get you out of your sight, or smash sharp objects in your ears so that you do not have another piece of your soul that has distracted you with horror. > War Games: Dead Code is not so bad, but it comes pretty close. Yes, I was a fan of the original, but I did not expect any miracle of this. We face the fact that the original was not so good in the movie, it was basically just a romantic film from the 80's of the last century that attracted attention. It was all I had hoped for. for, something bad, but that may have pulled my wires out. Was that too much for a search? Is it really impossible to do better than the original war games, even for direct video? Obviously it was too much to look for. Stay away from this movie. In the beginning, it's just bad, like "Oh, oh, this is bad, but I somehow enjoy it, maybe the end will be as good as the original." And then it gets worse and worse, and to the end, believe me, you will wish you did not see this movie.
