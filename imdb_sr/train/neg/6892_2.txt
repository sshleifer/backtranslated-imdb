Oh my God. This was a real big mess that just could not help. Jeffrey (Jon Heather) is a 29-year-old man who still lives with his mother (Diane Keaton) and does not plan anywhere. While his mother is not familiar with the rich businessman Jeff Daniels who may marry. It would be OK for a movie that Hadeder did not play his Jeffrey so boring, he himself has no chance to like him and only gets worse and worse. In the end, we should like him, but there was no reason for him to change from selfish rudeness at the beginning of the film. Keaton does not look like that. to even try and be in terrible form after 2007 'Because I said so. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Hedder and Keaton, and where should they believe that they are their mother and son? The only savings are Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris, although they do not seem very interested. Apart from a few small smiles, this film does not really deserve to be called a comedy just because it can barely laugh! If you're in the mood for recent Diane Keaton recording, watch Mad Monei or Smother that are much better than this insignificant effort.
