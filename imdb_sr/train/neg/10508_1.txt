I thought the horror of the horror was made with "Book of Shadows", I made a mistake. This movie seems to look like "Magnficiant Ambersons" in comparison with this piece of shameless, unexplored fecal material that has the courage to call itself a movie. I'd write more, but I'm still angry that I was an idiot enough to spend 3 pounds by renting it, boobs. And were these people English? and where the forest is> I lived in the UK two-thirds of my life and, as far as I know, there are no dark unknown forests in the middle regions. The whole balli thing looked like a national plantation of oak trees. These angels looked like anorexic porn stars (most of them turned my research). I still liked Judd being torn into pieces. P.S. I love and admire Tom Savini, but I CAN NOT ACTIVE
