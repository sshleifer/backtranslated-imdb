Yes, I'll just tell you about this, so do not read if you want surprises. I got this with the title of Christmas Evil. On a DVD called Silent Night, Bloody Night, there was another Christmas horror. While Silent Night, Bloodi Night (not to be confused with Silent Night, Deadli Night) had a lot of potential and was very close to being good, this was not very good. It started interesting enough by looking at a villain (if you can call it that way) watching children from the neighborhood and writing in books about who is wrong and nice, but after a while you look for some action, and this film does not bring. You need a character development, but this is outrageous and you're still not sure what the type is. About an hour has killed three out of four people, while the whole crowd looks in horror, and the guys he kills are not even targets that just mock him. This is one of many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to knock down the bad guys. Then he continues to kill this other, and tries to break into his house, squeezing himself into the fireplace. He immediately stumbled and barely managed to get out. Then he enters the cellar and tries to kill the guy by slamming him in his bedroom. He does not seem to kill a guy this way, so grab a star from the tree and cut his throat. What did the tree actually do in the bedroom at all? Oh yeah, the killer before the murder ceased to be amused and amused. Well, that's it, except that people in town are tormented with torches and unresolved part with their brother and that melody he wants to play. What was that all about? He kept talking about something that was never explained. How do you end up asking, and since I have a spoiler, I'll tell you. He ran off the road in his van and continued on, so we just say that he was chrome !!!!!!!!!!!!
