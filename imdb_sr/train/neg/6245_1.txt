The only thing that "Unpleasant Truth" proves is that Al Gore is still an idiot. These "indisputable" experts are not disputed because the answer to their hypotheses is mostly under the right doctrine. These are mostly fake scientists. The biggest source of greenhouse gases - CO2 - are people, we are exhausting it and if you are not ready to start sacrificing your brothers to save the world, there is nothing to be done. We have heard that the world will end up as a result of man for more than 50 years. Fools announce a timeline for their day of judgment and when time passes, nothing has happened. "Unfair truth" is just another means by which an insincere fraction of the American society can sell its kaka. And what about Ala about leaving a tobacco business for the death of his sister from cancer, it's a burden also. Al could not better lead his farm than he could manage the country. He lost money for the operation because he did not care about the farm when he could earn more on the tour. The only global warming that is not caused is the hot air that produces this gas-gas!
