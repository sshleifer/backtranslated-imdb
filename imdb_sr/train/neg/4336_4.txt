I watched this film and the original Carlitos way back. The difference between them is disgusting. Now I know that people will say that the bundle was made on a small budget, but that he never had anything to do with the bad scenario. Maybe I was just me, but I always thought he was bored to make another movie, playing key characters, and maybe I filled up a bit about life we ​​did not know. Rise to Pover is a movie that has Carlit's name. It should have been at least a few characters from the original film, the ending makes no sense in relation to the original. At the end of this film, he rejoins with his sweet heart, but how do we get him out of prison in the next film? And his wife is not even the same woman she talks about as her only love in the original. I would say that the film is a bit funny in itself, with a few decent bits, but it fades when it is held to its big brother. Do not be awake at night waiting for you to see this, watch the original once more if you really need a hit.
