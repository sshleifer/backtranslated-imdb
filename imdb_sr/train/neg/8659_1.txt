There are some things I can never understand. Like this movie. What if I created a really cheap and exhausting Dino and Crocodile Polygon model in May, and then continued to cut it and paste it into an amateur video clip that people scream and how they eat the same thing? How can anyone believe that a completely fake CGI dinocrock, which seems completely inadequate, would affect the events in this film? I know that his B-class, low budget and everyone other than the producers could do better than make a piece of crap that no one would ever see or go through. It just does not make sense. Are people really so stupid to sit through this? Obviously so. For laughter? No, this thing is not worth nor laugh.
