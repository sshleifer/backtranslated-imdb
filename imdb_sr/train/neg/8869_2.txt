With the release of "Farligt forflutet", the Swedish film industry really hit the bottom. Stefan (Jens Hulten) has lived a peaceful life with his wife Marie (Regina Lund) over the years. One day an old friend of Stephan arrived with a favor to ask him. Stefan will be doing a little courier business. It should bring a suitcase full of heroin through the customs of Sweden and Germany. Unfortunately, things in Germany do not work as planned and Stefan is now in great trouble. It's always nice to see a Swedish movie that breaks the traditional family-dramatic pattern. Unfortunately, if people involved in production have no idea how the movie should be written, captured or cut out, the result can only be catastrophic. The content can be concluded with: bad acting, incoherent plot and idiotic dialogues. The only highlight in the movie is the unprovoked sex scene with incredibly beautiful Regina Lund. This lasts for only a few seconds, leaving about 90 minutes of clean, say, what is actually bullshit.
