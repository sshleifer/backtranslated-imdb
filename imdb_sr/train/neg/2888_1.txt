To compare this dirt with an old, low-budget porno flick, it would be an insult to an old, low budget flick. Animal scenes have no meaning or represent this man and his crimes even in the broadest sense of abstraction. The Synopsis on the back of the DVD case says, in part, "an exciting conviction of the terror of the BTK killer". This is NOT retelling. Repeat suggests that you are told the truth about what happened or how or why. None of these things are true. I am an enthusiastic teacher of serial killers and I've seen some pretty shy movies about them and honestly, this is NOT one of them. This is not even about a BTK killer. Save a little time and a few bucks and rent a Dahmer. This serial killer's movie is accurate and true. However, if you just want to watch this movie for yourself, check it for free in your local library, and even then you will still feel cheated.
