When you look at another bad nightlife like Freddie's Revenge, you must at least give some credit for trying something new. And although the Dream Child is more comfortable, it offers absolutely nothing new in the series. Yes, there is a creative death as usual, as if the child becomes part of a comic and confronts Super Freddy, but even these scenes do not use their full potential, and parts without Freddie are just boring. This marked the official death scarcity of the series. It seems Freddy is now a comedy ... but why? My Rating: 4/10
