My favorite quotation of the Crov was when the car came down from the cliff, "The movie is so bad, even the car wants to get out of it!" This had to be the most amusing film. Ever seen. It was serious to scare you, which makes it even more fun! If it had not been Misteri Science Theater, I would not be here today! : -P
