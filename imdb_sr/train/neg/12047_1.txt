I had the greatest enthusiasm to enter the screening of this film. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex stories known to mankind, and it was one of the first epic stories I read as a child (even before Tolkien). I must say that it was a huge disappointment. They completely made a joke in a joke and turned the thing into a long soap opera. Elements that were faithful conspiracies were so sown so casually that the audience laughed several times on a silly scenario that was just talking about this battle of all battles. It was a great disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of almost Matrix's power, extreme ruthlessness and male lover in the original song) turn to "Fabio on the beach" in the form of Pitt (which with a good script and more effort could turn this into the most complex and original warlike figure Hollywood has ever produced). The actors were actually decent, trying to make the best of the funny scenario. It was actually a waste of so much talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean are pathetic). Compare it with LOTR or Gladiator and do not even hold a candle. There are many pieces for ladies to clutter, but not enough battle scenes for a movie that relates to one long battle and siege. I would not recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragging through dirt like one of the characters (at least they got that part right).
