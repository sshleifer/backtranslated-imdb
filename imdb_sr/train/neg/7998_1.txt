Not only was he always boring to listen, but he did not have any jokes. I swear, some fobi-asian guy who said jokes to jokes would be funnier than Leary's shit. (Well, maybe funny in a few minutes, but at least I'll be able to laugh at least once!) Liri claimed that he stopped taking drugs during one of his "jokes" ... he was obviously still on something; he was just a rat cheat, mostly related to drugs. One of his jokes was something like, "I would not use a crack, especially with the same name as my ass" - Oh, man, how did he get to that ?! I swear it's the only guy who needs to shut down f ** k up Denis Leary. Thank God I did not have to see him live. This guy is totally shit. If you are easily entertained by cursing, and "jokes" where you can invent yourself, then you waste time with this garbage.
