Never throw models and Plaiboi rabbits into your movies! "Star 80" by Bob Fose on Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to marry her sister after her murder in the hands of her husband with a low life, is more than 10 times more interesting than Dorothy's on the silver screen. Patti Hansen is not an actress. I expected to see some kind of lost masterpiece a la Orson Velles, but instead she got Audrey Hepburn in jeans and divine hairstyles. I could look at "Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Shov" again and again. I could barely sit. This film was not reported because of the brochure about Mrs Stratten's terrible death; I think the real reason is that it was so bad!
