This was one of the funniest and poorly directed films I've been looking at for a very long time. I never liked Spike Li, but I thought I would try this: a bad mistake. The film should show how Sam's real killings influenced the neighborhood in the summer of 1977; what really was, there were some of the most aggressive characters I suspect that they were concerned about drug problems, marriage problems, and so on, etc. shooting, and then returning to Saturdai Night Fever! What's even more funny is that Spike Lee's choice to appear as a reporter in the movie: Spike, believe me, you're not Hitchcock, it's out of movies, it's even worse. The funniest scene had to be a dog that spoke with a stupid voice, which was shown on the scene before it, where it should have been shot ??? Spike, what did you think when you made this movie? I do not mean my opinion at all. People who think they will see a criminal drama, take my advice and do not waste time and money on this loser. You better look at Jerry Springer in this case! Waste of the film, I gave him 1 out of 10: a horrible dude.
