I was excited when I heard someone filming a documentary about how to be a Puerto Rican. When I heard that it was Rosie Perez, I wondered ... could she know what it really was to be a Puerto Rican. As far as I know ... she was Nuiorican. Anyway, I was sitting in anxiously sitting with popcorn to watch. For ten minutes I realized that my initial fear was correct. Rosie Perez has little knowledge of being a Puerto Rican. This "documentary" is more of a first-hand, very personal account of how to be Nuiorican .. and everything that implies. She (like most Nuioricans I know) has a diluted, partial and sometimes distorted sense of history. (How they could not live here.) Yes, they are all proud. As you need it! But much does not know the roles and disadvantages of real culture, history, and political background or language. Everything has become very obvious with her participation in Viekues. Regardless of my personal understanding of this issue ... the least I know is what the fight is. She was arrested for something she knew little about ... and she participated only because it was "Puerto Rican cause". I really do not understand how embarrassing she is. For those of you who are not Puerto Ricans, please consider this as a partial report on the female journey of self-esteem and acceptance. Do not understand this as a gospel ... much is not true. Think about the source. Rosie is an actress; not a historian. This film is not and should never be, for other Nuioricans, the basis for their information. Instead, it's just a step to finding more information, learning and discussing what is reality. Not only the one who comes from this woman's eyes.
