and forget this. Completely. If you really want to see Madonna, buy the "Bodi of Evidence", at least Villem Defoe is there. . You will not miss anything. Bruce Greenwood is lost, Jeanne Tripplehorn is the backbone, and Madonna is so terrible, it's getting fun. Why they had to cut the original movie into this mess, I will never know; I suppose they thought it was "bankble." Madonna, as an actress, is certainly NOT. If you rent an original 1979 film, you will still enjoy it, and the actors in it can really act. 1/10.
