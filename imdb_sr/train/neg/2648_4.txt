I just finished reading an Anita Loos book, and the photo in the TCM magazine in MacDonald in her costume of the angel looked great (an impressive wing), so I thought I was watching this movie. I've never heard of a movie before, so I did not have any prejudice about it. I thought it was a sweet start with Eddie as a plaibo and MacDonald as a secretary who he does not know exists. The scene in which she appeared on a costumed party in her simple angelic suit with a non-cooperative aureole and wings that would not remain on her was very expensive. I even had a movie when Eddie went to bed and imagined her as a real angel. But after a while, it began to fall apart for me. Eddie remains "asleep" for the rest of the film, so it's all a dream. Whatever happens from there, it does not matter, because only dreams. The rest was much smaller and meaningless. I had to force myself to stick with that. And the final number on which MacDonald goes from a music number to a music number in a crazy hallucination was just plain weird. , I think it would be much more interesting. I wanted to see more of her true character. There were not enough music numbers to call it music. The first few songs were good, but the number MacDonald performed was like nails on the board. It's totally wrong for her opera voice. Even so, Eddie and MacDonald are still able to shine, showing what the real stars are.
