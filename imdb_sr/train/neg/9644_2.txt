First . In this film of genre, the first thing you need is good music, and that's where Mr. Sankar and his party fail. The music is completely pale and inefficient. On the other hand, there is AJAI DEVGAN, who has written the letter 'A' from his spelling, did a good job, but he did not benefit from bad films like this one. ASIN is like a doll that is used to entertain the public, although it is good to look, but its role in the movie is to dance, it actually dances the member rock band and I think that no rock band has no dancers as a band member . In the shell of walnut this film is a piece of shit shit t. Look if you want to be deceived.
