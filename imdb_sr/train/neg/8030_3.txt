Not too angry at this. The story is quite terrible and unconvincing. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, Bill nunns good. After that, it was pretty terrible. The team does not fit into the role, it finds itself with complacency, and Pruitt Tailor Vince is completely inconceivable as a trumpeter. It's an idealistic film and as a musician, it feels a little offended after watching it. There are no scenes from 1900 when they are practicing or playing with his colleagues, he is completely self-satisfied. It's hard for me to build any relationship with this kind of character, maybe I'm watching the wrong movie. If you do not have the true passion for life or the feeling of doing this, let's just let go of disbelief and watch this waffle.
