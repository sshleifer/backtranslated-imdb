I think I saw the above movies, so I give this 3, but it's a struggle to remember what they could be !! Maybe the Kstro (nasty and dumb) or maybe Creep (just stupid), but it's a fight for thinking about something worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's just say it's a poor siege man, starring Jean Claude Van Damme. The only discovery was the sight of Casper Van Dien - I was always wondering what happened to him after the Starship Troopers. Yes, he was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know. Judging by this site, he was stuck in hell of a TV movie ... Casper, be more selective .... please! !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I just turned around and there is half a decent movie called Criminal Law ... now I'm starting to be really angry over the last 1.5h !!!
