This film is a sequel to the "White Zombie", because it is made by the same man (Halperin) and has zombies. However, Halperin, George A. Romero of his time, can not deliver this. We have a man who can control the minds of people in Cambodia and seek to destroy the source of his power so that zombies can be sent for free. Also, interest in the evil man. Where this movie really stands out is in the pictures. The Cambodian temples and dancers are very fine and the zombie looks very powerful in its large number. Unfortunately, we do not see a lot of zombies in action and it seems that a love story plays an oversized role for a horror movie (although this later has a valid reason). <br /> <br> I'd like some zombies of the 1930s to attack helpless city people, but this movie simply did not deliver. And no great villain (like Bela Lugosi) did not wait to fight against our heroes. And the use of Lugosi's eyes? A good effect, but deceiving as it's never in the movie ... why not create it again with the eyes of a new actor? All in all, a movie that could be great with a small script that could be a powerful remake (especially if it keeps it in the same post-war time frame). If I can fix "The Hills Have Eies", then this movie has hope.
