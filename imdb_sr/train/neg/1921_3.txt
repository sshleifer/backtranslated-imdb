For some strange reason, the film world is powered by fashion. Someone makes a film about the killer, and suddenly the oceans of the world film are flooded by giant squid, octopus octopus and sea monsters of every type. A man is chased by a former lover from hell, and every movie character is being searched by a cop from hell or a helper from hell or a hell of a hell. Then when a big Hollywood company produces a large budget-loaded blockbuster on tornadoes, other film producers leap to Bandwagon, the fact that they do not have a budget to pull it does not stop them. NIGHT TESTS is the case. What hit me about a television movie is the fact that it's trying to hide your budget shortage by reducing ad breaks. Every time a tornado arises, the camara stuck in the horrified expression of the actors whispering things like, "Oh, my God, going this way" and "Running for Your Lives." budget for special effects. Unfortunately, the NIGHT OF TVISTERS budget should be increased to include better actors. Actors are by no means bad, but they are not impressive and do not have the skills to wear a motion-driven film. Where are Josh Hartnett and Elijah Vood when you need them? The last word about this is the TVISTER clone ..... that the NOTT was released a few months before TVISTER was TVISTER Hiped for several months as the 1996 Summer Blockbuster and NOTT has a sudden feeling of it which led me to believe that it was made and released to connect with the hypsom around TVISTER
