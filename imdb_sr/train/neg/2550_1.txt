It was a label "in the tradition of the American Pie" which led me to rent this film. What I got was a piece of Jackass-style garbage, with the main difference that compared to this Jackass movie seems like a citizen of Kane. 1 out of 10, because now I can not go beneath it. This is a lot of bad films that look like movie productions. I actually shut it off after 45 minutes, and it's very rare. But it was simply too boring, stupid, uninteresting, and unnecessary. Drop you on your head when you were a kid? Or was it the first movie you ever saw, so you have nothing to compare it to? Are you still a virgin and are your breasts everything you think? At least something must be wrong. My advice: stay away from this. Even if you are in a mood for a simple movie that does not require thinking, choose something else, or you'll surely regret it.
