I'm sure people on the border with Texas and Louisiana had to make a good laugh, or two, when Paramount's B unit recorded this wartime audience. A very simple area along the Sabine River, where the film opens, is the country of cotton, just like the rest of the Deep South or at least the Deep South after a civil war. There are no large cattle empires, they are far more western in Texas, than Richard Dick and Preston Foster could ride to establish their empire. The film starts with partners in a river boat. and when Leo Karillo tries to steal his services by not paying for livestock, they keep livestock. And that's the beginning of a big Ponderos as a ranch that starts. By the way, Foster marries Dick's sister played by Frances Gifford and quarreling with much smaller neighbors. They also have some further races with Leo Carlyle. After all, we orienteers who like Westerne are usually not tired of geographical trips and are still good west of Harri Sherman's manufacturing plant that produced all those Hopalong Cassidi vesterns for Paramount. The highlight is the flame, and I mean it literally, the fight with guns that might have been used on A production. But I would have nothing but western fans to look at it.
