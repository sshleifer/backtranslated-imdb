I do not know where to start. The acting in this movie was really terrible, I can not remember that in one movie I saw so many actors who could not play. Not only was the acting bad, but the characters were incredibly stupid. Then there is the action. I believe that even children know that when someone is shot, there is blood. But when someone is killed in Snitch'd for ten (!) Paths, there is no blood at all. Well, I guess I'm just me. To shorten the story (because you believe me, I can talk about this movie for hours), this is no doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. This film should be number 1 on the bottom 100 without a doubt.
