The action of "Edison" was decent, but one actor destroyed the whole movie. Justin Timberlake ruined a movie with all the lines he had spoken during the film. He is by far one of the worst actors I've ever seen, and he should face the same fate as the whole F.R.A.T. skuad. Whether it was an emotional scene, an action scene, or even a quiet scene, Justin Timberlake managed to destroy him. Do not waste your time watching this movie. Do not even try to download it, because pornographic porn would be a much better choice. Even if you're not good at it, you've done a wonderful job that deceived people to think you can sing.
