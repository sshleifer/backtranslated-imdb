I saw this film with the intention of not loving him. I'm certainly not. It is one of those films that appear to be made exclusively for Oscar: music through a movie in almost every frame, almost without profanity, set in a long time ago, sepia toned image, pretentious title, NO SEX, and a genius that explains everything that he thinks and concludes in sfk / cgi so that we (stupid audience) get it. One thing that entertained me was the fact that they wrote the PRICE price INEVAL! Instead, they call the Nobel Price (named after a person called Alfred Nobel) 'noble price'. How can such an error be made in such a large production, allegedly based on a true story. What a lie! What did you and others think about RON?
