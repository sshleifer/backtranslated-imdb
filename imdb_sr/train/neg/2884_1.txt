While I was working at the video store, I found that it is my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I've ever seen and warn your friends and associates about it. In a day of particularly fierce debate about the worst film, my friend dared me to watch B.T.K. The killer, even claiming that if you can not watch the whole movie, and I claim that my previous choice was the worst movie ever, then he watched. I lost. I believe that even in high school I recorded better videos than it was, and these were scarcely great performances of a young genius. This film is not only lacking in what appeared to be a production value (seems to have taken on a bad camcorder, but is surprisingly clear), but also plays (wood, hollow and pathetic does not scratch the surface), and generally feeling film. I remember a scene in which I heard glass breaking, suddenly, I was reminded of some poor performances in high school (I know that here too often invite the high school, but this film looked very juvenile) and in terms of the set, it seemed too fake, but just as if people were reading their lines from the script, they were not entirely sure what was actually going on. My review does not do this film justice, because I can not describe how terrible the time I spent watching this. It's almost ironic that I'm doing a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie.
