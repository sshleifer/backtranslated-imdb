My husband and I bought a DVD for Old School Sesame Street for our daughter and I must say, I do not allow her to watch new episodes on TV, because I think all the characters are boring. Baby Bear And Telli? Oh, God, how can anyone think of their "sketches"? Elmo? Relax, not every child loves him, once again, uncomfortable and does not teach my child. G. Noodle? what to throw away. I think that once I turned 'new' show for her, she and I stayed dumber than before. The performance is definitely wrong. I remember Iip Iips, Kermit's latest news, 1-2 small dolls, Mumford, magicians, Berta and Ernie, Grover, waiter, all of the GREAT EDUCATIONAL WINGS OF OLD SCHOOL. SS Sesame Street suffered a direct blow to boredom and drowsiness because Jim Henson passes in 1990. This broadcast no longer has educational, entertaining, and interactive sketches that once used it. I believe that the new versions are simply unbearably unpleasant and full of useless voting. Road to S.S. Producers / writers have another show for parents to sit there somewhere creatives, children who do not exercise, so they will get out of their hair. By producers / writers: I suggest you throw out old mupets and start recording similar content in relation to the first Sesame Street. God knows that I certainly do not want my child to speak as Babi Bear or Elmo.
