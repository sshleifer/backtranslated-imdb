Another trashi Grade Z kuickie from fertile Alberto Piuno. Tim Thomerson's 13-inch Clint Eastwood's cop from the universe catches an ugly flying head (!) On Earth and participates in the gang war in South Bronco! Gracefully short, but deadly boring, with the most beautiful effects of Women's Attack 50Ft. They should have fired an unbroken guy: Remember that Thomerson's sunglasses disappear and reappear in every other bullet. Funny bad, but that's why we're watching these movies, right? Sekel'Dollman Vs. Demonic toys are supposedly worse, if possible. 0 (from ****) <br /> <br />
