The opening line of Joe Don talks about this film. It is held on the island of Malta (the island of pathetic men) and includes Joe Don Baker in finding an Italian mobster. The character of Joe Don is called Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo) and everything he does in this movie is to shoot people and arrest them again and again. Everyone in the movie hates him, as everyone hates Greidon Clark. I liked Greedon's earlier painting, Angel's Revenge, because it was a shirt for boys of three years. Avoid this film at all costs!
