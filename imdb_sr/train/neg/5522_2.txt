I'm looking for the right words to describe this movie. At first I was inclined to simply go to more important things, because the film does not reach the level that deserves a comment. Nevertheless, I paused, confused how to describe such things and a somewhat intriguing challenge posed by the question: "What can we say about such a film?" Nonsense? No, it's not garbage, the garbage can be recycled into something useful. Glass garden? No, it's not a greenhouse gas, greenhouse gases help plants grow big and healthy. Finally, I encountered "Not even bad," the processing of the term "Even Not Wrong", which is sometimes used in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly defective and which is not even worth rectification. That's it then, Georgia Rule: It's not even bad.
