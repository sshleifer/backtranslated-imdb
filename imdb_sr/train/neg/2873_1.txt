This film contains a beautiful brunette named Danielle Petti. It has stunning green eyes and is found in the first few scenes and the last scene. She is the only thing about this film that is not repulsive. Perhaps she will not have the future as an actress, because this type of film is the kind of offensive disaster that kills career. It's not a good horror movie, or a good fake journalist report, or well done. In his production there is no skill. It's like a bad student film. The terrible elements of the story do not make you sick, that is the fact that it is so badly done that you are sick. I would give this movie ZERO stars if I could.
