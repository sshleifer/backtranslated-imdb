"Laughter, clown laughter" published in 1928, plays legendary Lone Cayney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito grew up in his youth (young and beautiful Loretta Ioung) into adulthood and appointed Simonetta. Tito raised a girl in a circus life, and she became a ballerina. While Cheney has been doing some great brilliant performances, I could not pass by the fact that Tito, who is now in middle age, has rays for young Simonet. Although she was not her biological father, she raised her as a daughter. Such a "ick" factor permeates the whole movie. Tito competes for Simonetta's feelings with a young and handsome 'Count' by Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta apparently falls on a young man, but feels guilty of leaving Titus out of loyalty, not romantic love. The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and it seems unlikely that no one in the movie tells Tito how stupid an old fool (until it is revealed at the end). The movie is worth the attention only because of Lorette Ioung, who will have a great career. While I adore Chaney's glow as an actor, this whole movie seems to me rude and simply creepy.
