One of the worst romantic comedies (no, the worst movies) I've ever seen. The boy (who works as a telephone psychiatrist!) It must be pretended to be gay to move into an apartment with a woman of his dreams. Happiness does not happen. So far, slow gai-bashing, and horrible dialogue. If you read Brad Meltser and as his cheerful dialogue, this film will appeal to you. Be smart. Avoid this. If you see it, destroy the copy.
