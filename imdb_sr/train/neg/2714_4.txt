The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordan Brevster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corlei, Charles S. Dutton. The NBC mini-series (later released on video / DVD as a feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes and white families and black families. The first half of the film is powered by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Villiers Tailor and evenly spreading the story between families. However, Dutton's character was killed halfway and the black family was completely forgotten in the boring, insensitive and extremely terrible second half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video / DVD release).
