I was very disappointed with this film. I thought that Scari Movie, although not a good movie, was very good and fun. Scari Movie 2, on the other hand, was boring, was not funny, and sometimes silly. Exorcist / Amitiville infantry is probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was excellent. Now, I admit I am in a disadvantage because I have not seen a couple of films that this parodies unlike the first, where I basically saw them all. But a bad comedy is still a bad comedy. Something that really hurt this movie was the time that destroyed some of those that might have been good jokes. Scenes and jokes pull a long way. The same jokes are constantly repetitive. For example, the bird that speaks. Well, it was funny first and maybe even another time. But that always kept to the point that it was boring. The routine between a wheelchair and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was fun at first, but it was constantly repeated and ended stupidly and even unwillingly. For example, "creaming" I suppose it would call Cindi (Anna Faris) was ridiculous in "Scari Movie" because Cindy gave her sexual relationship to a boy for so long, that he essentially had blue balls from hell and it was funny when she was 'cremated'. But this time was unwise and it was not funny. Bathroom and sexual humor were generally more entertaining and well-timed for the first time. Scat humor was excessive, although it was pretty unnecessary in another movie. Tori Spelling was boring and she really did not have room in this movie. But I enjoyed in Shorti (Marlon). Vaians), which in my opinion was the most funny character in the first movie. The scene with him and the pot was one of my favorites from another movie. Do not misunderstand me, I love Vaians family and their humor. That's why this film is so disappointing. . . they have much more comical abilities than endless jokes.
