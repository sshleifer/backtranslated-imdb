The DVD was a joke, the audio for the first few minutes was terrible with sound beyond synchronization and the Segals voice even his !!!! Pathetic! When the synchronization of the sound was better for about 5 minutes, a bad shop, lines and actors should get another job, because the movie business is not where it should be. While Segal had some good films in the early days, the latest joke was and should be a disgrace for him and for the company that made him. If Segal was the one who led the team, it is better to return to another party, because there is no talent in all this. This film is completely embarrassing for everyone involved in its production and shame for everyone who watched it. I turned it off in about 20 minutes. I will look for money back in Block Buster!
