Believe it or not, I have my DVD copy of this "movie" I bought at Valgreens for a big big dollar. I'm still not sure whether it was a well-spent dollar or a dollar stupidly lost. Pretty incredible scenery and costumes. Obviously a lot of thinking and effort has been invested in their creation. The set design is very Mexican in styling. I liked a lot. And Santa is impressive. One of the more impressive Santas in the moviemaker. I assume that the original intent and purpose of this film was to be something exciting and cheerful for the children's audience. But, somehow, it encounters a rather disturbed one. In fact, I was stunned as it was disturbed. Perhaps this is an English dubbing which makes it so distracted and bizarre. One of the reasons I like to watch movies in the original language they have made, and the use of English subtitles as duplication often gives unexpected wonder. Children's voices are at least called real children's voices, unlike women who pretend to be children, which sound very, very strange. Ballet in their long one? You're not? Neither did I watch this movie. Learn something new everyday. Is this movie really worth watching? It's tossup. I can not recommend him with good conscience to anyone, as this is quite disturbing in my bizarre manner. However, his unintended bizarre is what is worth watching. You decide what to do. I do not know ... for myself, it made me feel uncomfortable when I see demons who are constantly doing sweet ballet movements. That's wrong ...
