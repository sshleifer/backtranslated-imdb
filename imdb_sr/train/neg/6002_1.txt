"Sundovn: The Vampire and Retreat" is nonsense. The acting is terrible, the atmosphere does not exist, and the characters are uninteresting. The only terrible thing about this part is that most IMDb users gave 10. This is really scary. No worse, no tension, no violence, nothing. Bruce Cambell ("The Evil Dead", "Intruder") is completely futile, support is also terrible. in the mainstream society, but fans of hard-core horor or up-hounds will not enjoy this piece of shit. thinking, a real horror movie should be terrifying, overly bloody and disturbing, with no stupid humor, which usually destroys the whole concept. This one is not frightening, not bloody, not even funny as a comedy, do not waste your precious time.
