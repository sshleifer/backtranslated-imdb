Based on Tom Volfe's satirical novel, which everyone praised (I had not yet read it), Tom Hanks is a street street star who accidentally kills a black boy while he is lost in the bad part of the NIC Villis stars as a reporter who runs Hanks. The characters are very thin and it seems that there is no empathy not for anyone in this film, and there was not much laughter for comedy or satire. Melanie Griffith had her breasts during the recording so it's a fun thing to do is see if the boobs change her size during the various parts of the movie .. This will distract you from other things such as lack of script or humor. On a scale of one to ten.
