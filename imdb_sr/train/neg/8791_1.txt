Be warned! This is a shit that other shit can not even be in the company because it's underneath them! Okay, I got it, let me say something more substantive. I saw the ashes of time long ago, thinking that this is a fresh download of material that is based on the highly respected wolf of that novel due to the reputation of director Vong Kar Vai. Well, despite all this, the VKV has failed to adapt the novel to the screen by many fans of the wolf; These are mainly water drops, sweat, horse legs, etc. I could not sit through much of the movie. Fast forward many years later when I wanted to give Mr. Wong's movies another shot after they heard many praise, especially from Cannes. I was intrigued by his latest, in 2046. My friend told me to start Chungking Ekpress because this is his most accessible film. So wrong! I'm just p.o. that I was deceived to spend my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness. Some professional reviewers referred to this as meditation about alienation and loneliness in a modern large city, blah, blah, blah. It's all right if the director has a point of view with something to say why these things happen and say. But no, he just shows what he is. The Faie Vong act is very typical of the style of Hong Kong: mixed pronunciation, deer in the expression of a wide view, trying to be sweet and girlish acting; the rest of the actors are equally uninspired. I think it's the Word, the Author, euphemism for the director who is trying something new and different, which should be applauded, but not the one who has not yet mastered the art of film story, and that is what Mr. Wong the last 17 years!
