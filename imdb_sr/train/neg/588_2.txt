I am forced to write an overview of this IMAKS as a means of alerting others to SAVE MONEY. Almost every episode of "Human Animals" by Desmond Morris or "Nature of Things" by David Suzuki could win the presented material. Not only does the director fail to take advantage of IMAKS's amazing film fund from 65 to 70 mm and a huge presentation screen, everything on the screen is extremely unpredictable given the availability of such programs mentioned earlier. The viewers are introduced to the pregnant Heather, her husband Buster and their niece and nephew. We follow them continuously for forty minutes while eating, sweating, listening to music, etc. Although we have access to scenes within the human digestive tract and are learning about the natural diving reflexes of the baby, do we really learn a bit more of the graduates? Are we still interested in transatlantic Heather? Do we care? Avoid this movie at all costs. If you want to see the IMAKS function, I suggest that the image "India: Kingdom of Tigers" or "Space Station 3D". Trust me.
