I can not believe that the Muncie City is so hard to get the attention that they would be embarrassed by allowing this show to go there. This performance is like a slap in the real effort of the cops. Never in my life have I seen anything so stupid in my life. If they were charged as a comedy that would be one thing, but to say that reality is nothing but a lie. I only saw it once and I was horrified by what I saw. I wanted to see a little guy get in with a bad guy. What a joke would be. Nothing in the show was close to the real world. City Muncie, the chief of police, and all officers should shame their heads and never want to admit they are coming from that city. No wonder he did not stay on television
