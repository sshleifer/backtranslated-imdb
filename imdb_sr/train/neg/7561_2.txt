Anyone who is not familiar with the original 1973 British lion movie "The Vicker Man" left the film with the badge "Bad" and "Peurile". As a devotee of the original I left the impression of the Pure Poor. From the gloomy reality of inbred pruning teeth, drawing the power of law and order into a network of pagan barbaric rituals on a remote Scottish island, called Summerisle (original), near the Amazon colony off the coast of Maine in the United States, called Summersisle, remake rarely hits. It is, unfortunately, the case of what could have been "a classic remake" of a classic that has been unauthorizedly changed to satisfy the general public. Nothing more and nothing less. Gentlemen (or considering the processed context of the film) Ladies involved ... hang your heads in shame.
