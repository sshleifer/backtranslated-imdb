For Las Vegas Ladi there is really not much to say. It's safe enough, but it's a bit more than a boring 70s movie. The film is neither smart nor sexy as it wants. The plot is the reconstruction of a tired old story of a casino robbery that has been done to death. Except in the case of Las Vegas Lada, I think the robbery was planned by a 3-year-old. Plan includes three women ?? to unnecessarily and in a clear way run out of the Circus Cicus building, one to pose as a waitress just to blow up the lid at the first opportunity, and the other to stand and reveal the d√©colletes. That's pretty much. Intricate, huh? Apart from Stella Stevens and her above-mentioned breasts, other women who were involved in the plot are not particularly memorable. Las Vegas Ladi co-stars Stuart Vhitman. When Stevens does not interact, his participation in the film is highlighted as one of the most fierce fighting he ever made on the film. It's 70 seconds to feel like I'm always enjoying some nice Las Vegas footage around 1975. But is the film too boring to score more than 4/10? and that's probably exaggerated. In the end, Las Vegas Ladi is a waste of some perfectly good neckline.
