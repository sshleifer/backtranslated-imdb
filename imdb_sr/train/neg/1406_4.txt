This "movie" is more like a music video. In an interview in 2004, Kusturica said that when she makes a movie, she feels like making music, and when she makes music, she feels like filming movies. The best thing about "Promise Me This" is the music written by Stribor Kusturica. In the same interview, Kusturica said that dialogues in films like noise were for him. "Promise me this" has very little "noise". I loved "Life is a Miracle". For the first 30 minutes, it was like a music video, and later something, but it had a wonderful plot. "Promise me this" is not complicated. I expected this film with great expectations, because I read that the script was written by Ranko Božić - one of my favorite scriptwriters, who participated in "Life is a Miracle". Ranko Božić writes big dialogues, but for Kusturica they are "noise", and to my great regret, I saw only two dialogues that I could recognize as written by Ranko Božić. The second part of the script was used by the director to create his chaotic music video for the music of his son Stribor. Gordan Mihic (a man who wrote the scripts for "The Time of Gypsies" and "Black Cat White Cat") said in an interview that Kusturica never follows the script. "Black Cat White Cat" was the only script, which Kusturica said would not touch him. According to Gordan Mihic, Kusturica still returns the script, and if she does not, she does not make a good movie. And I think that's the case with "Promise me this." He had to follow the script of Ranch Christmas. "Promise me this" is written as "comedy", but there are very few moments that made me laugh. Comedy moments are in the same style as "Black cat wake cat", but they are not so funny. I think the difference was due to the fact that "black cat's white cat" was written by Gordan Mihić. However, I know some people who liked "Promise Me This" are considered very positive. Movie.
