This film was great when I first saw it, when it was called "Lost in Translation". However, Bill Murrai somehow turned into an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson turned into a mournful Latino woman played by Paz Vega and Tokyo, Japan turned into Carson, California. Instead of the meaningful conversation and the silence that we enjoyed in translation, we get meaningless blabbering into 10 items that borders with the boring. Instead of characters who were imagined and introspective as in translation, we get characters throwing meaningless advice on topics they have no idea about. As a character wearing tens of thousands of t-shirts and never been in a commodity house, Target expects to give advice to a working woman about how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant? Do not think it stops it. If she does not give her clothing advice, he tells her what to eat. The most unfortunate part of the film for me was that they were reportedly rushed to schedule a meeting, yet characters are constantly finding time to carry out another job, whether it's car washing, stopping in Arbi, or just laying it on the list. with your 10 items or less lists of things they love and hate. I always wanted to shout at them saying, "Did not you say you have to be? What the hell are you doing?" You were practically late a minute ago, now you are eating roast beef and thinking about your life! " Until I saw this film, I never realized that something could "insist on myself," but I think this film is doing exactly that and unheard of. The dialogue makes the characters raw and unfeeling, with the exception that I was sorry for both actors for signing this project.
