Drones, ethno drums, bad synthesizer, children sing. The most exciting "world music" imaginable. This is a tourist movie and bad. What really kills him is a coherent sequence. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc. Etc. There are no crossings, there is no visual explanation why we are suddenly ten thousand miles away, there are no ideas expressed in the pictures. Just a bunch of third-world recordings with "baskets on the head," as another critic said. He walked endlessly as if he had some deep meaning. If these guys wanted to make a third world music video, all they had to do was find hundreds of miles to the south of the scene where the best parts of Koia were recorded, and a movie in Mexico. It would be a much better environment for "life in transformation". But not. They decided it was a tourist itinerary covering half a ball and soothing filtered shots. The only thing that recommends this movie is not to suck just as much as Nakoikatsi. RstJ
