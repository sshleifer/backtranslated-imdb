Horribly meaningless, and worse, boring film. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, there are no signs beyond the most stereotyped stereotypes, and rely on an awkward central concept that is not particularly original or is dealing with an unclearly innovative way. Vill Ferrell was completely lost in what he hoped would be his answer to Truman's Jim Carey show, and replaces his usual routine screaming (though very funny if you refuse Talladega Nights) for, well, pretty much nothing. Emma Thompson is nothing but mildly irritating (some of the reviews I've read here speak of her Oscar nomination funny), while Maggie Gillenhaal has a good job with a very weak script that allows nothing but the establishment of her character as a former law student who left Harvard to become a baker because she liked to make people happy. Please. That eventually fell on Ferrer's "character" is extremely funny. The Forster's attempts to make a jazz film using computer graphics only serves to point out the uninsured material with which he has to work. > <br /> I had a choice or to watch The Prestige for the third time or to see this. I wish I had chosen Prestige.
