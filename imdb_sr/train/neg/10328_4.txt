I think the show had a fairly good concept for work. But the execution was bad. The scenario is bad and the acting is bad. There were many questions that could have been shown in a better way, such as the protest against homosexual marriage or the finding of a cemetery. The show can not be called a comedy because it lacks humor. It should be said that this show was barely successful in a certain extent in the lives of the Muslim community. So far, the second season is worse than the first. I had great hopes about this performance, but I was kind of disappointed. Still, I appreciate the CBC for putting this concept in front of viewers. Anyway, I want luck for the future.
