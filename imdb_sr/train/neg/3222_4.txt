I was very disappointed in the 1970 film based on the story of Bernard Malamud. This is basically a story of possible redemption, racial bias and lack of fulfillment of life based on distrust. If Moris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) only believes in angel (Belafonte), his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) will recover. The problem is that Morris basically gave up his life and only refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel. When he believes it, Fanny is improving, but in the end he has doubts and Fannie suffers accordingly. It would be very nice that the last scene was an English translation when Fanny spoke with Morris. Jan Kadar, who successfully led Miss Kaminsky in her brilliant Oscar nomination in 1966, "The main street store also directs this film. The fireplace in the film is mainly reduced to the scene of the bed, and its kindness in her speech, she really does not convey the desperate situation she faces, she constantly calls Ruthie, their daughter, who did not listen to them, marrying a Jewish religion, for most of the film, she does not understand Angel's look in her apartment. </ The scene in the pharmacy is confused and the scene in which Angel's friend s spotting with Belafonte in their apartment is unforgettable, but all We do not know why Belafonte is in danger and why he died. Those who watch this movie had to leave the theater in a state depression and despair.
