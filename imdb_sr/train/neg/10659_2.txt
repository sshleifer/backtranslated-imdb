Filmography: Excellent, beautiful camera angles (I do not remember seeing a movie recently, with good close-ups, right up to this). Crazy scenes with soft cameras could be avoided. NI is well displayed. I especially liked the corners upside down (a different touch). Music: Not impressive. Songs do not stay in the head even after watching a movie. Maybe I expected the same quality as "Anniian". Frustration. Actors: Kamal needs to slowly move away from hard-core action sequences. His age and stomach are really appearing. It should also avoid close romantic sequences that go ahead. It was very awkward to see a mature / old star who is still trying to play as a 20+ hero. Love can be expressed at any age; As long as we grow old, you can still express your love remotely (without touching the woman too much, for example, the love expressed by Rajinikant in "chandrmukhi"). in the movie. I'm not sure why she accepted it. Well, that's not my problem, I guess. Others simply have a little presence. Direction: I expected Gautham to surpass (or measure) your other. film "Kakka Kakka". He disappointed me. It took a long time for the release of the film due to various problems. Slides in several scenes. Even the obvious things fell from the famous director. All in all: Just fine movie. Too many graphics. DEFINITIVE not for children (and adults who expect some sort of "Fun"). Thk
