"Algie, Miner" is a bad and infertile silent comedy. The weather slapstick is completely off. This is a kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if they should be ridiculous or not. However, the actual quality of the film is irrelevant. This is obligatory watching movie lovers mainly because it is one of the earliest examples of gay cinema. The main character Algie is a feminized guy, who behaves similarly to the stereotypical "pansie" that is common in many early films. The film has a common homophobic attitude from that time. "Algie, Miner" is quite terrible, but fascinating from a historical point of view. (3/10)
