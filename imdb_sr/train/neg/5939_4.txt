I thought the movie was fine, but I was very disappointed that they did not capture the true picture of his life. I had expected so much that his mother would be Jamaican, to cure me. I just watched the film's start and said the film was not accurate. I completely lost interest just a few seconds from the beginning of the film. I'm very disappointed, it's like watching a biographical story about Mark Anthony and Arnold playing a role. I do not know what the writer thought he missed a valuable part of the film, which is sure that his mother played a big part in his life. I'll say that the movie is fine except for the main Fool !!!!!!
