When it comes to horror films, I am more than willing to suspend unbelief, ignore the values ​​of sub-parallel production and overlapping holes in the plot in the interest of good intimidation. These films simply do not have a good fear. You can not even enjoy the camp. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad direction, killings were predictable and poorly set, music was boring, camera work was bad, even costumes were bad. I felt very bad for the actors, who obviously tried, but who had to deal with a terrible, fictional dialogue and an obvious lack of direction. I doubt they got a rehearsal. It's unattractive to watch, and it's boring to turn over to a fictitious ending of "surprise", which requires immense endurance. It's pretty easy one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Usually I do not write reviews, but this was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This film is a total waste of time. If you have to watch this movie, do not miss the "Making of" -featurette. It seems that the writer / director is under the impression that the murderer of women is some kind of brave, shy move. He and actors spend half an hour deconstructing this movie as if it were a new citizen of Citizen Kane. It's like listening to a third-class group that takes you behind the scenes of their Christmas Selection. They really think they have created something essentially. It's sad, really? The only reason I gave this film "2" is because I think that "1" should be reserved for genuine crimes, such as "Manos: Destiny Hands" and "Space Rebellion." So, "American Nightmare" is not the greatest movie I've ever seen, but I must say it's somewhere at the bottom of the fifty.
