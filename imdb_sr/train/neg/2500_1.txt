Van Dien must abstain from embarrassment for remembering this ridiculously poor film, as well as every single individual. To be honest, it's pretty embarrassing to admit that I watched it from start to finish. Production values ​​are located somewhere between the original series 'Crossroads' and 'Closed Hole Block H'. Most five-year-olds could come up with a more realistic dialogue and a more likely plot. As for the acting, if you can imagine the most expressive porn movie you've ever seen - one of those in which the action is exhausted with some endless 'story' to explain how some pouging old peroxide blonde boom began to spit. mustache - you will have some idea of ​​the standard of acting in 'Maiden Voiage'. What's worse, you can not even get into sex scene quickly, because there are none. Terribly terrible film.
