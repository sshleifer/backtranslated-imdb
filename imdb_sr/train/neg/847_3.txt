The film is about two brothers who need to be similar - but in no way do not expect to be smart - one is a surgeon, and the other is able to write a computer code. Geniuses who like to call themselves sound very exaggerated by comparing it with personal characteristics that you can see from the title material. I really did not like the style of the film. I believe that the anxiety, confusion and deep blues that we bring exist for a particular purpose, but what I do not understand is why there is so much. The film is cheap on scenes and it tells the story basically without any human aspect. It gives an experience like comics. Regardless of what visually impedes the viewer, he somehow brings him into a blues with short dialogues, monotonous scenes, dynamic cut, music and sudden sounds. The story of the movie is very simple, most of what is happening is dramatically displayed for long minutes, mainly in the confusing effects of delirium simulation of drug use and dynamic cuts. I will openly say that this movie did not fulfill my testimony a little.
