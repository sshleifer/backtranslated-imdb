Burt Kennedy was a very good director, but you would never know it was a mess. Not only does this movie look cheap, it's cheap - most of the battle scenes were erected from the far superior "Last Command" from 1955, and this shot, taken 32 years ago, looks much more modern than anything in this image. Several action scenes actually taken for this film are unorganized, confused and incompetent, look just as hollow as the rest of the image. This has the look and feel of a bad student film (and the budget did not look much more). It runs like molasses, and the act is in most cases or ham over the head or comatose - although Raul Julia is better than most of the rest of the actors - and that's a lot of embarrassment. historical inaccuracy. On top of that, it's too long. If you make a boring movie, do it for an hour or two and end up with it - do not stretch it over three hours, like this one. If you want to see a good movie about Alam, see the 1960 version of John Wayne, or even the 1955 film from which this film stole his action scenes. It's hard to believe that six producers should make a bad movie. Skip.
