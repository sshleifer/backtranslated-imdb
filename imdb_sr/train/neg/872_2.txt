First, I expected "Caged Heat" to be in the same line as "Ilsa, Vicked Varden". Boy, am I wrong? In no way is this film used by the 70s, "chik in chains" or "women in prison". Of course, the plot consists of a crowd of women in prison, who wear street clothes (pretty funny), but NIS does not happen. Doctor to try to escape, and prisoners do not understand. There are 2 scenes for the shower, which I suspect are only recycled images, but no quarrels / no one is misled here - or anywhere in that case! In addition to the lack of conspiracy, unconvincing, insensitive and straightforward characters, a couple of prisoners who escape, are actually returning to prison to "release" their prisoners !! PUH-LEASE, the movie should end with escaped excursions in the sunset ... unlike this mess continues!
