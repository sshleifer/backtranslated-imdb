At the end of the film, I wondered, "Is it the worst movie I've ever seen or is it the worst movie I've ever seen?". And the answer is ... Actually, after you've looked at this movie and thought about its meaning, you simply can not find any meaning, and you can only remember two rape scenes that are incredibly brutal and useless. It seems to me that the director has tried to put that question in the head of the mass: "What are these crimes in relation to the horrors of war and extermination?" because I noticed that there are two terrible scenes that are directly related to the war and its horrors (in the first scene you can here that a raped girl screams and at the same time hear one of President Bush's speeches about the need to launch a war). with Iraq and another scene, pictures of three criminals dragging a sword into a female vagina are directly following the archival images of World War II, but as a fact, I really could not think of the relative gravity of these two different expressions of human horror, I was too shocked by what I video and felt. (I'm sorry, bad English)
