I have not yet read the negative professional review of this film. Looks like I missed something. The beginning is intriguing, the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with fictional stories. That's the best part. After three separate times, the film is divided into three themes. Then it arises boredom. Certainly, the thread with Felini's babushka making chewing gum dolls is at first glance a curious eye that opens. Unfortunately, the director here executed to death, even injecting a wild line that does not lead anywhere. Conclusion: two-hour inaccuracy on the plot. If you suffer from insomnia, take a look at the bed and you'll get a good night's sleep.
