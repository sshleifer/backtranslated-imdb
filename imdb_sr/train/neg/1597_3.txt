This film is classified as a classic on sentiment, not on any quality of film creation. It moves from incredible to incredible, from unreal to absurd. An incredible plot spinning around the attempts of two British soldiers and hinduists to rescue a third soldier caught by rebels Indians. In the later scene, we see a full regiment with drums and gadgets marching in ambush. In the British army, the sergeant does not order an attempt to rescue, and if you pass it, he does not only try with another soldier and an Indian servant when there is a full regiment. Indian rebels are so incredibly incapable of being ridiculous ... there are hundreds, but they can not keep their prisoners or kill two rescuers, of course not. At one point, we see British soldiers throwing stone blocks from the crowns of the insurgents, scattered around the mountain in an ambush ... one would have to have a eggplant to make the brain think it would do any harm. After Cari Grant was killed prisoners, he is lying on the floor and looking at a boy with water ... hardly the work of someone who was killed in the back. A boy's water bravely strikes a trumpeter (who comes from nowhere) to sound an alarm ... he does this by standing high on the wall so that he can see and shoot bad guys, and we shed tears while he kept trying to sound more notes while he repeatedly recording and the sound of the bells decaying into faint noise ... instead of blowing into the hull while hiding behind the lid, as anybody from half the brain. This scene was deservedly parodied with comedies. If they wanted to make Buster Keaton a comedy, they should have hired Keaton to do better.
