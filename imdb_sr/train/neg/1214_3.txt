One friend asked me once to read his script that was set in the film studio. To say that it was one of the most unreliable and weakest scripts I've ever read, would be an underestimation. But I never told him that. Why? For in a world where movies like "When It Comes Out" can be green lighted up and attract Oscar, such as Kim Basinger, a script that has no character, content and common sense is not a guarantee that it will not be sold. As many other reviewers pointed out, "When It Comes Out" there was a terribly insufficiently written film "Women in Danger" that abused Housewife Basinger by hunting four incredible hoodies on Christmas Eve. Every complaint is legitimate, from poor dialogue and bad behavior to insanity, but Basinger is such an interesting actress and premise is not without promises. Here are a few things that hit me: 1) I do not care how much we should think that her husband is a jerk, the house is messed with toys. Since when did it become child abuse to pick up children behind? 2) Slightly diverse gangs are rare everywhere except Hollivood, where they are usually the only race-balanced group on the screen. 3) Surely the movie is silly. But the same are countless "trillers" through which women are portrayed as crying, helpless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not, I found it refreshing to see a woman taking the best of her torturers. 4) I loved the end! 5) Although the former reviewer coined this phrase, I really think this film should be repeated with "Red Toolbok of Doom".
