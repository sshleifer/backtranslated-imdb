Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is that it does not take advantage of its own title !! In a TOTAL film, zombies and vampires fight one or two times. Moreover, we are never sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITIVE vampire. It could be argued that they were trying to "silence" it or make it "realistic", but that ends only bored. More than half of this movie takes place in a car. Scenes that are happening anywhere else are not much to praise. Also, there is no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened in the last 30 minutes of the movie. However, I will say that for a film that is so low in production value, the sound record was surprisingly convenient and instrumental (either with an origonal score or music from other sources). I am for independent films, but it does not seem that this is ever intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /> "worse than the scare killer."
