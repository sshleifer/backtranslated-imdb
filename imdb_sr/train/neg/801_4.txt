Despite their stereotypes, almost without a name and apparently low budget, I thought this film was fine; much better than I expected. At first, I was skeptical - the idea of ​​a computer virus that also could infect people seemed to me a bit ridiculous. But in the end, I thought that the film was well adhering to the concept (even if some of the scenes were a little cliché). Still, I could not help but think that Jenny Turner looks a bit like Gene Davis. Maybe it was just her face or makeup, hair and clothes she had in this movie, but she only kept talking in the background of my mind all the time. or a big movie of any standard, 'Fatal Error' is a fun movie that will keep you to the end.
