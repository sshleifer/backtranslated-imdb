I think it's a horribly produced and directed movie. Benicio Del Toro should not work on producing films, he should emphasize his acting and that's it. Steven Soderbergh missed the meaning of the idea of ​​a revolution, its ideals and the most important of Che Guevara's life, and so on. The camera is terrible, as if someone with 2 days of working experience is recording, music is ... I do not know .. is there any music in the movie ???? I will not recommend this piece to anybody. It only spends about 4 hours in front of the TV or anything ... I can not figure out how someone can rate this movie for more than 3 stars. DISASTER .... DISASTER .... DISASTER .... DISASTER Do not look please. Save yourself from this misery of "movie"
