That was not what I wanted to see. I bought this on a DVD and under the film I upset and turned off the movie for a moment. Here's what I did not like: 1 Shoot at father's 2 2 Tribes were really disturbing 3 dinosaurs (mostly) looked like a fake. 5 The quality of the images on the DVD was really bad. What I did: 1 Music Jerry Goldsmith. This music is really great. I have a bootleg soundtrack from this movie. Unfortunately, the sound quality is not good, but it's good for its time. 2 When we first see dinosaurs, they inspire some kind of awe. sweet when in the water and playing is 4 this funny scene with a tent. 5 Children who see this movie, I hope they will learn that evil always loses.
