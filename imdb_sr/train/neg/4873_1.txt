This is definitely a stupid movie about bad taste. Eddie Murphi plays what is written as a sitcom. It is surrounded by a perfect family, full of good family values. If you are looking for a politically correct entertainment, this movie is for you. But if you hate the idea that you are the only one who is not laughing at the obscene gags in a film theater full of corn addicts, it just escapes.
