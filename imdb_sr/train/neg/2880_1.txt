I've never seen a movie for so little time. The only salvation was the rewinding feature on the DVD unit. It was like watching a poorly-produced CBC movie. Obviously there were no money for lighting, shooting, sets, location, scriptwriters, editors, actors ... Oh, there was absolutely no story! I have to write 10 lines of comments ... Bad, horrible, horrible, miserable, torturous, vicious, gallant, tortuous, torturous, disgusting, disgusting, skinny, slim, silly, rude, stinky, stinky, rotten, nasty, all , and I do not know if I can continue to finish all ten lines of how bad this shit-o-matic work is!
