I read the James Haves book. It was pretty neat, it was not great, but fun enough. Without reading the book, I would not have the slightest idea of ​​what is happening, and it was still extensible to this knowledge. Literally, every element of this film is hopeless in a way that I can not describe. A half-digested fish could make a better film with matches and give a lipstick. Never before or after, like a movie, I did not feel so angry. The mattresses of the mattress came closest, but even they never reached such depths of the utter abnormal pain that this bilayer did. Since losing 90 minutes of my life testifying to this plague on the human species, now I am not able to even look at any James Haves book without anger. This is the depth of hatred I have for this piece of sh * t. No, it's unjust. Let me apologize to all the faeces to compare you with the evil impostor who is a rancid aluminum. Easy and simple cancer in the world of film.
