The acting is terrible. This film is made by Fast and Furious as a rewarding academy film. They throw a few breasts and asses in to try to keep you interested in despite an extremely weak and far-sighted story. There is a reason why people on the Internet do not download this movie at all. This film sank like an iron shit. DO NOT waste your rental time or even downloads. This film is and will always be PERMA-TURD. I'm stupid now that I watched him. In fact, this title should be called "PERMA-TURD" from now on. Call it a travesty and insult. horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, disgusting, horrible, horrible, disgusting, horrible, horrible, horrible, nasty, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, abusive, offensive, repulsive, repulsive, disgusting, scandalous, terrible, shameful, shocking, sick, horrible, terrifying, ungodly, ungodly, unloved
