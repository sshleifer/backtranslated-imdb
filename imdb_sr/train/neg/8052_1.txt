I was sitting through this party because I had not seen it before, and because the room sounded like it had potential. It was mildly fun all the way to the hurricane sequence. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house, but the trees in the background are perfectly upright, not the leaf moving! In fact, when characters move outside the house, the bright sunlight that illuminates the canopy is visible. At that point, regardless of the credibility developed by filmmakers, it evaporated faster than highly localized rain in their film. Too bad that all hurricanes are not like this, it will surely help our home insurance companies at Sunshine State.
