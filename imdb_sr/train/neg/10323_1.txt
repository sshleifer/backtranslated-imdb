I was excited to see a series that would, I hope, represent Indian kandi, but I discovered that this show is not ridiculous at all. Producers and actors are probably happy to receive poor and good feedback, because it concerns them, it's talked about! I was ready for some stereotypes and I have no problem with this because stereotypes exist for a reason; they are usually true. But there was nothing ridiculous in those stereotypical characters. Daddy's "fresh boat", who does not understand his daughter. A radical feminist Muslim daughter (who is by now a terrible actress), and a young modern Indian trying to lead her mosque as a politically correct (which is a pretty good actor, I only see him repairing). /> It is very fictitious and the dialogue does not run so well. there was so much potential for something similar, but unfortunately, I think it did not work, and I really do not care to watch another episode. Still enjoying watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy, she is always a treat and naturally in everything she does, it's a shame that her daughter in the show does not have the same acting ability!
