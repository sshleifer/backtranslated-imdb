The final song of Johnny Rivers was the only big thing in this film. Unfortunately, that's all I can say about this Western movie. I need to write 8 more lines for my comments to be posted, but there are more than 8 rows horrible in this Western one. I'm not sure if the film was a tribute to Hopa Along, or just a hoax. The hero and villain in this movie were too plastic. It's not real at all. Many actors who supported this movie seemed authentic, but the shooting scenes were a joke. The previous commentator thought this film was excellent, and in his comments he made a cheap record for President Bush. This was not democratic or republican west. It was just a bad western movie that was commercially sold. I wonder if he made money. Sometimes I thought I was watching a film made by college students. If that was the case, then it was a great movie.
