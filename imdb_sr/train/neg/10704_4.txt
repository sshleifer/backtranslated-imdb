That's Die Hard encountering Cliffhanger when the ski resort is surrounded by terrorists and it's up to a policeman, Jack (Crackerjack) to stop it. with a pretty good action, funny complication (as always in these films) and three great stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as a policeman and Nastasj Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you do not like stupid B-action movies, this is not for you.
