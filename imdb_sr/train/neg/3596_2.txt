To be honest as much as I can, the Devil toy (or Veo Blood or the Vampire Ecstasy or the Curse of the Black Nurse or ???) is completely boring. Does the movie have a good premise behind it? the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the body of a descendant through the help and help of a group of women dressed in black? but the execution is terrible. There are great, long moments of the screen time when literally nothing happens. The characters just stand and have nothing to do. There is no mystery, no uncertainty, no complications that should be taken care of. The acting is simply insignificant. Most of the acting involves a group of women below the average who dance naked and looking at the camera. They repeat that. It seems that this small plot is designed so that more naked women are less than attractive, so that they can join the dance. Although not as bad or meaningless as a dance or plot in something like the Orgory of the Dead, it comes close.
