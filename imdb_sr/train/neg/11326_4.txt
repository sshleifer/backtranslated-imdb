This is one of the two post-apocalyptic fantasy films that Albert Pjun made in 1993 - and that's bad. Apparently, all his energy went to "Nemesis", which was a fun non-stop action movie, and he had a much more expensive look. "Knights" are an awkward and messy, sci-fi lower part of the bar, which too often resembles video games (new opponents are constantly appearing and must be destroyed as quickly as possible). The only thing that rescues this film from the garbage can is Kathi Long; not particularly attractive woman, but undoubtedly brutally effective combat machine. Regarding Chris Christopherson, in view of his years at the time (58), I hope that his duplicate was well paid. (* 1/2)
