Before watching this film, I expected a fictional drama based on ideas from the book; Instead, it is a book, interrupted by dramatic scenes illustrating various "diseases". It did not bother me much, but it hindered my enjoyment in the film. One story, or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book that were interwoven through a movie, in my opinion, would be more desirable. If you base your movie on a psychological text, you must find a more interesting (and preferably accurate) text from this one. The film draws in parts where this is more than a video encyclopaedia of sexual psychology of the 19th century and it would be extremely unbearable if it was not of sexual nature (because "sex = interesting" for most of us, even for me). Fortunately, there are several stories with the actual development of characters that attract us. But, disappointing, Krafft-Ebing's sexuality theories in most cases remained without controversy. I was hoping to use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology, which many still hold. So, in the end, what do you have? A detailed catalog of several fetishes and orientations, with some mildly interesting stories that portray the temptations and troubles of several "sexual deviants" before he is cured. For most films, the film moves with the speed (and mood) of the furrow. And, as a film that is obviously a little budget, cinema and acting are not really top-notch. Although I was * pleased with music, costume and interior design. I felt that the subject of this film is right in my alley, and I still feel that the film is below average. Deserves 3/10; 4/10 if I feel extremely generous. I can not imagine anyone enjoying this if he had not already had an interest in sexual fetishism.
