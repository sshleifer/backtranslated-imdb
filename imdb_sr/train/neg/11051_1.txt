A terrific film featuring D-lists of Canadian actors who seem so self-conscious about the fact that they are on the camera that their performances are excessively melodramatic and completely forgetful. This film is poorly written, poorly arranged and poorly directed. She is unconnected, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way. McDovell does a brilliant job with what he's given, but he's the only one in this movie - he's got a bad story and a script he can work with. Not even that camp is funny enough. I have not seen Van Pelleske yet to act in a credible way, and even sub-characters like Eisen (with their nasal, loud voice) confirm that we are a lot in Toronto, not on a bargain in Africa . Did the director see that the 'creature' looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit? The struggle between the blue flashing lightning and the Pelles orange tape of 'magic' (!?! Because of the lack of a better word) is obviously the result of bad actors, without choreographers, coated with fully performed special effects. Is even the director on the shooting or in the mounting room for this film about disasters (not really good)? Learn from the mistakes of others ... do not waste time with this, you will regret like me. I have nothing more to say about this celluloid waste.
