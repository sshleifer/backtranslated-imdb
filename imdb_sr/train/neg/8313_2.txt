I watched it on the sound because it was available and I heard Thumb movies were funny. This is not. Most of the jokes were based on the "Geranium" body and, again, on Kate Winslet. I think it's really pathetic that the "Thumbtanic" creators have so lowly dropped to make strikes with a reputable actress just because she (not God) does not starve in the model of ideal modern beauty. My favorite part was the line that goes something like, "Hey, I have a great idea! Let's go to this improvised raft that no one else sees!" Thirty seconds of 26 minutes movie entertainment does not redeem its value.
