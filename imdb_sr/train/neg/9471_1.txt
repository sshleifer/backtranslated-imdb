Do not misunderstand me, I guess this movie will be stupid, honestly, I gave it an incredibly low standard. The only reason I saw it was because there were a bunch of girls (another story for another time). Since I started to watch something I noticed, this film was horrible. Now there are two types of horrible, here Freddy vs Jason is terrible, where you and your friends sit and laugh and joke about how horrible it is, and then there's a movie like this one. The cat in the hat did not manage to create a current interest in me. While I was watching the first part, it was not only senseless to me, but I felt like I was in some way disturbed by the horror of that movie. Mike Miers is usually brilliant, I love most of his work, but something in this movie did not click. One of the things that changed the director / producers / writers / vatevers is that they refused to use any of the original book colors (red, black, white) of any character other than Cat. Accidentally or not, they also refused to capture any of the originals (and I hate to use this word, but it fits) the zaniness of the original. The book was like ice cream on Sunday, colorful and delicious, and the movie was about stupid and hard to swallow as a sawdust.
