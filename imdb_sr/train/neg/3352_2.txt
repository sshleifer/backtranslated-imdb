I do not even know where to start with this. "Everything is in the family." That must have been the worst line of dialogue ever known in the "horror" movie, although that could not be a horror movie even if I tried !!! Ugh !!! And I know Owen Wilson is a better actor. He must stop playing the game with the guy who dies in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man was co-wrote "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore". He has some talent. Also, Lili Tailor should keep indie movies. There is no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There is no place in legitimate action for her. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
