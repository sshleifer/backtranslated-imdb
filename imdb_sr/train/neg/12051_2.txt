This film is "riveting", but in the same way as a car accident. It's hard to look at it. All in all, this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment - and a futile, biased experiment in it. Film makers are manipulative and seem to have no problems with the smallest possible denominator. The way money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation. The interventions that Ted's authors forced to take part (a meeting with the so-called experts) were empty and devoid of essential attempts to connect with Ted. Instead, it is painfully obvious that they serve to cover the back of the filmmaker and to further exploit Ted's situation. The worst thing is that filmmakers stop following Ted after six months; and seemingly completely cut off from the topic they followed so close to months earlier. If they were worried, they would find better "experts" who would help Ted. If they really wanted to see what Ted would do, then they should have let him spend money without any intervention. This film is at best the strangest stuntman trick, not the documentary. It's sad to think how much $ 100,000 could actually change the life of a homeless person that he was put into the right hands.
