Real movie, of course, apart from the fact that the characters do not seem to be afraid. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels bad ... but he does not look. So I do not like his performance in this movie. Tom Berenger is playing the soldiers again. There is no good excitement, real sequences. It's not always a shot, it's one big thing. Good shot. I hate a helicopter sequence, because only one terrorist kills almost all the sea pile ... I give her ** and half of *****
