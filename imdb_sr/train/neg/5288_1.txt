My God, is this "Run, Lola, Run" adaptation conviction? It was scary. It's bad enough that the "scriptwriter" (and I use the term very loosely) cut and paste a dialogue from one character to another, often completely out of context and to hurry up the story: but Anne Elliott runs from location to location in search of Ventvortho end of the end was a horrible thing! Austen must be in the grave. No respectable young woman would have acted so horribly. And the actress who acted Marie? Horrors. Needless to say, if the rest of Austen's processing is so bad, they will exclude a new generation of observers. If you want to see the flawless version of this (otherwise) wonderful novel, We got the 1995 director's version of Amanda Root (whose terms only they can speak) and Ciaran Hinds. That's great.
