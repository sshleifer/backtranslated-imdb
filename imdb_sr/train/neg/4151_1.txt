This is probably the best horror movie ever since Ed Vood died. I can not break the end because I have no idea what happened. I'll try my best. There are some types of lesbian vampires, but they hold body replacement, so each character may or may not be a character to think it is, or perhaps a lesbian vampire. Sounds confusing? It's not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters has any sense to start. There is no complication, character development, and random people appear, they speak several lines, then disappear, they never hear again. There are also zombies, which may be * enemies of the vampire, but there is also a dream sequence in a dream in a mental hospital, so none of this has happened, and this is the main hallucination of the protagonist. Upside Down? Both the leading girls briefly strip their shirts. Special effects are simply stunning (I especially liked the incredibly slow, unpleasant fight). Everyone has a really silly Canadian accent, which adds a general level of joy. Good value for the rental price. We laughed until we cried.
