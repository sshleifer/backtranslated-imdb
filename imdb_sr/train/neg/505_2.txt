This is bullshit. I'll summarize as soon as possible. The Count calls four naive whores back to their castle. A bunch of nothing is happening for a long time. There were some crazy and unhealthy sexual scenes. Some girls cut off their heads (off-screen) - End. The only things that will happen for this are decent costumes and costumes, some bad dubbing that leads to some kind of funny dialogue, and a few short games. And believe me - those things are not enough to redeem 90 minutes of annoyance that this movie is. In fact - the best part is a seam at the beginning of a distributor that contains some blemish that is covered with blood and shows its tits - and again - it's definitely not worth the price for receiving this garbage. As everyone else has noticed - the title of the movie is completely meaningless - since there is absolutely no blood type or any dance in the movie. It could also be called the 'Koza-Raper' circle-jerk-and then at least it would have a better title that does not refer to anything in the movie. The exact title would be '90 minutes of torture' - another seductive title that would be at least true for the viewer. Frankly, the trailer on the disc shows all the best parts (and I use the term 'best' extremely loosely ...) so I suggest you look at it instead if you're still curious. I can not imagine that everyone likes this movie wreck - please, listen to my advice and leave it on the shelf. 2/10
