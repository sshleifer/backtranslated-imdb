Close to the beginning, after it was established that the outlaw John Dillinger (Varren Oates) an egomaniac rapist, another bandit from the 1930s was driven into a farmhouse and surrounded by the FBI. Second Commander Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson), explores the situation, puts a light cigarette into his mouth, pick up two loaded 45-calibra automatons and goes to a remote house. Bang Bang Bang. Purvis leaves alone, carrying a female hostage, a dead man who is dead. Everything in a long line. If you are delighted with stories like the Red Cap, this should have great appeal. Oh, it's as exciting as it's foolish. Pretty Boi Floid dramatically realizes her death. Multiple violation of civil code. A lot of shooting with Tom's guns and pistols. Blood everywhere. As history, stinks. He remembers Melvin Purvis a little as a hero of the FBI, partly, I suppose, because of his name. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover, who fired Melvin Purvis because he was a rival for the public's attention. The picture was written and directed by John Milius. He is the one who wrote in his contract that, in case of killing animals during one of his productions, he should be a certain shooter. Milius is a guy, a gun rider, who had rough riders Teddy Roosevelt in the Spanish-American War, quoting Henry V's quotations - "St. Crispin's Day" and all that. Exciting, yes, and complete garbage. "I knew that I would never take him alive, and I did not even try too hard." That is, kill them all and allow God to arrange them. You will love it.
