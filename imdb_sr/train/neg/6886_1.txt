John Heder was absolutely horrible in this film. I felt like watching a bad kid playing for the first time in a student film. Anna Farris was a couple on the course, she was not good, but she was not terrible (plus she's cute). Dianne Keaton should have known better. Jeff Daniels was the only rescue grace in this film (though he was also a bad judgment). All in all, I would avoid it at all costs. I'm just glad I did not pay to see him! John Heder will always be stuck in the role of a "little kid" unless he does some serious work on his acting hits.
