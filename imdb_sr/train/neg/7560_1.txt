How this movie can miss so many fascinating, complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or original movie is truly remarkable. Incredibly slim and unpleasant plot, characterization / motivation to the ankle and truly terrible soundtrack (replacing tension with huge parts of noise, replacing the mysterious musical references of the originals for digitized crashes and shrubs.) Then there are specific references to the original In a world in which the restless, dead brains of the Americans processed The Italian Job (tears appear), remove Carter (uncontrollably laced) and Alfie recently desecrated our screens, This is an endless nonsense, as Ellen Burstin ever caught, a wonder ... Nonsense.
