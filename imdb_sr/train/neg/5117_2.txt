First I want to say that I am a Christian (and I work in the film and television industry), so I understand how it works on a feature film, and so to film creators. I am for positive, exciting messages if they are true to the nature of life (this is the world that is falling and things do not always work ... even for Christ's followers). I'm glad that others have such a very positive reaction to an open Christian message; For me it was just that the execution was where the film fell on his face. The film lives and dies in its story and here you have one-dimensional stereotypes, plenty of exposure and spontaneous behavioral changes that are unexplainably the least mentioned. I believe that you do not have to film the movie over the head with his message to get to the point. I'm sure Kendrick bros. it will improve over time and that their narrative methods will be. Maybe they could direct someone's scenario as their next project. Sports movies are not really my first love, but good (Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, etc.) I can inspire in a variety of ways. If you would be interested in a PG movie that inspires, give 'King of the Hill' Steven Soderbergh. All truth is God's truth ...
