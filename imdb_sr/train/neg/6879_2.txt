Rosie lost a lot of TV time talking about the Tainos as if they were very influential in the dynamics of the modern Puerto Rican age. They were not. The truth is that the Africans and the Spanish were and she knows it. What kills me is that she stands on the screen and looks like some sort of black black skin (with an obvious black dad, relatives and aunt) pretending to truly admit the true essence of what makes them modern Puerto Ricans, but barely mention how The Africans influenced how their Spanish language, food and music are spoken. She is so typical and I have lost a lot of respect for her and I will not support anything she does. Also, since she wants to dance around her African nation, she does not have to take on more roles related to blackmail (ie, Lackavanna Blues). Next time we can find proud Black Latina (thanks to Zoe Saldan, Gina Torres, Gina Raver and Melissa DeSous). A Puerto Rican who said they were Africans, not "black". ...Thank you. We "blacks" certainly have nothing in common with "you," so that there is no love lost. But, since you probably in America and benefited from the Civil Rights Movement, we would like you to refuse any decent human treatment that you have received with the kindness of blood, sweat and tears from the back of the "black people" with whom you do not share anything. If I am right, Puerto Rori have a terrible picture in the media, but we do not waste black time trying to disrespect you because we know that the media like to take advantage of the low points and the behavior of all minorities to maintain a foolish generalization . However, you obviously got into a mortgage that you're somehow white or overweight ... you are not. Also, somehow you feel compelled to believe that the black culture is BET ... you are again wrong and you need to go on vacation from the hood. Try to visit Atlanta, Georgia, Houston, Texas, Charlotte, North Korea. Believe me, none of these blacks do not want to report to you the "culture".
