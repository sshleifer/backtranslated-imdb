Chris, the adopted son of a moral family, the loser who works in Kate's school papers (Christine Lakin from the terrible sweet "Step by Step" is now gratefully wrong ABC TGIF line) learns that he has just inherited pornography from his biological parents. He loses sight of what true friendship and love are and the blah blah of some other nonsense. He also has to fight with his uncle who wants control over a family business and a joking lawyer (right?) Something beneath the average teenage comedy that steals from better teen comedies (just opening is a BIG American drink), bops on the head with moral every chance and loses the only star she has (Wayne Newton, Lin Shay, and if I'm really stretching the star of the word, Martin Starr of "Freaks and Geeks", and Justin Berfield "Malcolm in the Middle"). It's not bad, but it's far from good. Eie Candi: a few extras you get toplesu My Rating: C- Where I saw: Starz on Demand (available until September 29th)
