This film was not horrible, but it was not very good. I'm a big fan of Tony Collette I think she's a very beautiful and talented actress. The film begins with Robin Villiams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14-year-old kid. The book is great and can not believe someone wrote it. Tony Coulth plays a children's watchdog that you do not know if this kid really does exist or if everything is making up. I will not destroy the film, but I will say that this film is not scary. The performance is pretty good and Tony Collette's performance was as good as Robin Villiams. The film was a big disappointment, in my opinion, I would have to come to DVD.
