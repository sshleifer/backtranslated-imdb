I just watched the 30th anniversary of the Blazing Saddles, one of my favorites! TV Pilot for Black Bart stunk. The action did not exist and the acting was not good. Obviously it was an attempt to profit from the success of Blazing Saddles and there was a TV show that managed to make big movies, but this one would never work. Taking into account that TV for years would not even give the sound of farting when they were playing a movie, it is inconceivable that they thought they could show a TV show with "N" words. On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing many famous faces !!! There were plenty of actors / actors I recognized from other shows over the years. I had to write down all the names and make a few searches. That was fun. I was discussing with my mother whether Steve Landesberg was from Barney Miller or Mash. I won! :)
