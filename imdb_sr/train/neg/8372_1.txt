I can say catogorally and unequivocally that in all my 51 years on this planet, I'm the worst (I guess, the kid) movie I've ever seen in my life. They even tried to smile during all the curling 90 minutes. I will leave sex indendoes for the second day, but they are as uncomfortable as a movie. You should pay for watching it, not paying them. It's really terrible, there is no other way to describe it. People who made this movie should be tasked with taking money under false preconceptions.
