I saw this in an art show that featured "Last Dais" and some Charlie Chaplin movies. Based on the quality of other characteristics, I decided to give the "Immortel" a chance. I almost left this movie, and I like science fiction! The story is set in futuristic New York, filled with Blade Runner's sky commercials and some similar cloning / synthetic discussions. Unfortunately, the scenario was not condensed enough in an hour and forty-five minutes. There are three groups in this world: people, artificial people and Egyptian gods. Artificial people seem to have the advantage and control of city politics. People are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (modeled on the Great Pyramid of Khufu and complete with a worsening exterior, leaving a smooth "cap" on the pyramid. Should the floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition?). The pyramid lies above the city and nobody on earth understands what it is and why it is there. I will not bother you with the so-called plot, but there are lots of unnecessary bloody and many brutal scenes. The film, as I said, seems to have been under the influence of the Blade Runner, and perhaps the Fifth Element and the Matrix. After completing the film awards, thank you to the UK, France and Italy. The film is FRENCH, but uses the British actors who do not speak French. So, it is obvious that their French dialogue was called. This is a disturbance, and I also thought that the transition between right people and animation was quite disturbing. It does not help that animations are bad - it's no better than video games. Skip this.
