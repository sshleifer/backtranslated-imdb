I've always loved the account for its great scripts and characters, but lately I feel like it's turned into an emotional type of soap. If you look at promotional images / posters of the law, you will see that two policemen throat / love or have to do with friendships, while promotional images of the law have long ago shown something to the crime. This proves that much has changed from an absolutely incredible police drama to an average type of TV soap. When I watch it, I feel like I'm looking at the police version of Coronation Street or something like that. I must say that I still love the account because I am interested in the work of the police and that kind of thing, but I really lack the size Bill had. I want to evaluate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit that the people who took the bill completely destroyed it. As for scenarios and characters, both went downhill, most of the big characters are gone now (although a few still remain I think), and I'm not saying that the newer characters are bad or nothing, because they definitely are not, just because they lack the heavy chances, personality and scripts. that all the old characters used to have, since most of the new ones are currently involved with silly relationships and family troubles. All in all, this is one of the only police programs on television these days. it will always be interesting to watch, but as if I say she has lost a lot of her uniqueness (if it's a real spelling) and will now be classified as a horrible, unreal television soap. It is recommended to look out for good laughter because of the nonsense of the police involved - 2/10
