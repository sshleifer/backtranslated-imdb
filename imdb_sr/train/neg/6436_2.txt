I am a kind person, so I gave this film 2 instead of one. It was undoubtedly the worst movie I've been watching for a long time. There were very few complications and deeper areas of interest that were touched, i.e. What Jesus really wanted to know was pressed and instead we got tough visual doses of the sadistic punishment inflicted on our heroine (Arquette). The total crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would be more humane and its character and the audience. The act was barely existent and the direction was not inspired. And if I saw another drop of water or a dove flying toward the camera, maybe I started screaming louder than Patricia.
