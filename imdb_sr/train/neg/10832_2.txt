Normally I do not have problems with free cursing in movies, but this really made me annoyed. Everything they did was cursing. For the whole movie. (And, as someone else noticed, got cancer) It was bored, wandering and pretentious. I would not be in your place. It is also not that I do not like movies that, like most people who love it, claim to "watch life". I love Woman to drink men, and everything that happens in this is that the Taiwanese people lead their lives. But I could deal with them. I've never met anyone who swore as much as the actors in this movie, and I used to work on the site. So, go. Saying I was Villiam H. Maci smiled. One time. 2/10. Avoid, unless you enjoy boredom.
