1/10 and that's just because I'm not going down with my grades. Skip this "movie" and wait for the last movie "Trilogy", do not buy or rent it. Believe me that you do not miss anything. The architect does not bring new information: _ (spoiler) _ before it was more NEO, it is like nr.6 or something similar. you could already come up with something similar from the first film: Agent Smith told us that the first Matrix created did not work because it was too perfect. The Trinity died, and Noah's "love" returned her back to where I had seen it before? In the first movie of the role in which it is reversed! Just like an action scene, nothing new with just a few opponents. The action scene (20+ ships) in the BIG battle that we have not seen (perhaps in Revolutions?) Has betrayed someone (hmmm, maybe the guy holding the knife who wanted to stab Neo?!) Who pushed the EGM button soon. All in all, a shameless trick to earn money (especially from the guys who went to see him many times), which obviously worked as a charm.
