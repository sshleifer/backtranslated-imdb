Not as bad as you heard. There are actually some funny things, and Affleck and Applegate have pretty good chemistry. Applegate is particularly attractive and sympathetic as Affleck's love interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are top professionals. They're pretty good at everything. In the end, "Survival" is not the worst holiday movie you'll ever see. Unfortunately, it is not focused and most comedies are forced. Attempts of dark humor turn out to be cruel. Affleck strives to be dear spaghetti and to be overly enthusiastic, but encounters anxiety. The caricature nature of his character is greatly relieved when he looks at Gandolfini and O'Hara's duller, convincing performances. Even with the relaxed standards of holiday movies, you can never fully engage in Affleck's "rent" for this Ks-mass family. . The X-mass scene is filled with incestuous humor (a son looking at the naked, provocative image of his mother is discovered), which is not only not ridiculous or convincing, but also disturbing. To make things worse, the colors in this movie are blurry, almost noon. The home set where most of the films take place looks fantastic and cheap. Survival is most often interesting as the fourth in a series of boxing dudes (Paicheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl, and Affleck. It remains to be seen how long it will last.
