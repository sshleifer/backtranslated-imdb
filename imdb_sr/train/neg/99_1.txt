Some of the movies you buy for a pound are pretty good - 23rd-century movies have published dozens of blurred Italian and American films that were great, but although Hardgore released some Fulci movies among others, most of their output is crap like Zombie Chronicles. The only positive thing that I can say about this movie is that it is not nearly as boring as the body smell. In addition, his very clumsy anthological film with the technical competence of the Lego house built by a dog house. It was noticed elsewhere, but you really have to worry about a movie-maker who inspects the action in her credit line so that by the time the zombie attack comes, you've already seen it all. Bad movie lovers will have a ball watching 18,000 mistakes in continuity and devilish acting. from the actors (especially the autostoper, who was so bad that he smiled me a little), and praised Hardgore for entering the spirit of things by publishing the print so bad that he felt like I was watching a video from the camping. Terrible, terrible things. We all did these things when we caught the camera, but common sense prevails and these films disappear in our closets somewhere. Avoid.
