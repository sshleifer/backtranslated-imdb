Blame the executive producer Vesa Craven and the Veinsteins financiers for the debacle in a big budget: the thrash-metal update of "Dracula", with a calm verbal attack on Bram Stoker (who would not want his name anyway anymore) and nothing else for us slasher-stiled jolts and up. Christopher Plummer seems to be Van Helsing on a modern day - not just the offspring of Van Helsing but the real thing; he holds leeches derived from the corpse of Count Dracula, who was exhumed from his suitcase after being stolen from Van Helsing's vault and flew to Nev Orleans. This is exactly what Neu Orleans needs in the 21st century! The film, well-produced, but without an original idea (except for multi-racial victims), is both repulsive and lazy, and after about an hour it starts to repeat itself. * from the ****
