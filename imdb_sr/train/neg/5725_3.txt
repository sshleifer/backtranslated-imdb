2005 gave us a very decent "gore porn" flick Hostel, and in 2006 he gave us Live Feed; not very decent separation of the hostel. Live Feed follows almost the same formula as the previous film Eli Roth, except that this time stupid kids in Asia, not in Central Europe. The action focuses on these stupid kids, and one of them has annoyed one of the locals to find themselves in trouble. The locals decide to lock them all in the theater and kill them. Despite the fact that I heard something less favorable about this film before I saw it, I was hoping that this could be at least half decent because director Ryan Nicholson had earlier made a very decent 45-minute rape and revenge movie "Torched ', but this film only falls because the majority is either ridiculous or boring. The film obviously tries to get back to the old good times of the Grindhouse Cinema (which the Hostel did, successfully), but it really does not come to the fore. Surprisingly, given Nicholson's previous work in special effects - even worse is not impressive ... although it's much better than acting! I can not say much about this movie ... it's bad and it's not good. Avoid this!
