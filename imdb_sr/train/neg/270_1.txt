I'm looking at him now on a pink (Serbia TV station) and I have to say that this is bullshit. I mean, who made this series? This was a stupid studio attempt to make some more money for the success of the movie. OK. The film was excellent in 1994 when it came out. But the series? Several times you can see how idiotic lines are in speech characters. I mean, did they really pay somebody to write it, was anyone in the studio? This is not SciFi. The film was a bomb, the series is bullshit.
