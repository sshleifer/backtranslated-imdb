Hi, I'm from Denmark and one day I had a movie night with friends. One movie brought with it a "Russian terminator" and it was extremely terrible. After watching less than half an hour, we decided to speed up just by stopping on some ridiculous "highlights" or saying "lovlights" in the movie. I was most surprised when I learned that this film originated in my homeland in Denmark ... it was certainly the biggest mistake this country has ever made.
