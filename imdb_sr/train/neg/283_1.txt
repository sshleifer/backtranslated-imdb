in the film, this film felt like one of those after school specialties, only a lower budget and lower everything else. as preachi.it has very pale Flash Dance shades, but then what? There's just no excitement in this movie. Dialogue is fictitious and clich√© to death. The acting was less than a star, though it has much to do with what the actors got (or in this case - not) to work with. At the top is a bad selection of songs, with really bad lyrics. all actors are involved. They are all talented, but you can not say from this movie. This is just my opinion, of course, but I have to give Fliing AKA Dream to Believe 1/10
