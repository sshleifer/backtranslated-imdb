If you really need to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, let him be a boy. But prepare yourself by bringing your HP equipment if you have a radio. After you've watched such a good movie as Arisan (2003), it's terrible to see what they did again in Indonesia. It seems that the only idea is to make money, but nobody seems serious to work on the image of Indonesia in the world of entertainment. It does not seem to be about those who make films in Indonesia. And since the Indonesian public is pushing everything presented to them as 'Made in Indonesia' with the taste of the West, they get out of it. Ok, the story is nice to begin with. And that could have developed into a frick. But did the director never think that music should be primarily live music OR at least good reproduction, and then good choreography? In this movie, the playback is SO BAD to make it want to cry right there in the cinema. Every word you hear is followed by a second LATER by the actor or the one who sings the play, which is extremely boring while watching a movie. but in the end he thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical ... They just forgot to change the choreography. It's hard to dance, you see, they jump in there and throw their legs in the air, which is why. Well, at least there is a happy ending ... But if you can convince your girlfriend that the beautiful candlelight dinner is much more romantic, DO DO IT!
