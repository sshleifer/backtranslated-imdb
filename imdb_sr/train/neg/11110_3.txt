I just want to know that I often do not rate movies under 5. I was initially very excited to see this movie. His numerous hits on TV have been watching me for several months. Well, the other day I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand, I got popcorn and sat down to watch a movie. Subway. The photographer is obsessed with the missing people. Where are they going? What's happening to them? One day, the photographer sees the connection between the photos he has captured and becomes obsessed with the butcher, following him around, even though iada. The film had a way to pull you in, although the plot was very predictable. "Oh no, it's dark, look behind you," I say, pretty boring with cheap excitement. The action, although predictable, was intriguing ... that is, to the end. "This was good to the end .... Then it got stupid," says Jack_skellington_freke on bulletin boards. And I totally agree. And here comes the spoilers ... See, I was hoping it was some crazy killer, let a psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism. Not. It was a secret society that kept living creatures for centuries. Voo. How original. How unreal. How boring. 3/10. Come on Lionsgate. You had incredible movies, but this one sank.
