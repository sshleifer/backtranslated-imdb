What should be a simple, general, mysterious idea that involves a dead philanthropist is, in fact, a head that raises the story of a bunch of characters (the only big actor is Ginger Rogers, at a very early stage) who are all trying to find a killer among the small actors in a large housing estate building. These characters move from extremely stupid to evil. As a cheap, low-budget production, most of the actions revolve around Rogers and her leading man (I do not care who he is since he really sucked) and talks about their various possibilities of solving the crime, while he is constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head in the ass. Frankly, I've never had the worst time watching an old b-rate movie of this kind, and I've seen some real heads. Oh, and the Butler did not do it. , because there was no butter. But pay attention to the guy who is closest to the butler. There it is. <br /> <br /> - PolarDiB
