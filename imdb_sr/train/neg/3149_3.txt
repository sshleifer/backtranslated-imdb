As an independent film creator and great fan of Edward D. Vooda Jr. I bought this documentary, believing it would finally set the record for being talented and brilliant Ed Vood in fact. What I got was a disappointing, focused, conflicting, contradictory compilation of bitter self-products. Where people remember Ed Vood Jr., do people remember a second cousin-type guy who knew someone who was in Plan Nine of the universe? It looks like it was at the moment when the renewed interest for Ed Vood, these people get out of "Wooden" work! It's just that you wickedly invade someone who gave them a chance when no one else would! After 50 years, I suggest that many of these people should give up the fact that they have not received the promised $ 75! Ed Vood was a great creative film director who knew how to have fun. In fact, it was ALL for whom he lived. You can laugh when you see Ed's movies, but you're kind of aware that you're laughing at it, not AT him. But, I digress ... Back to the movie at hand. If you are looking for a movie about Edward D. Voodoo Jr., you will not get it here. If you want a movie about slimy bitter old actors, this is a movie for you!
