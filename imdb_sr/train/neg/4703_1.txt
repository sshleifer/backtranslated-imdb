"Show me your tits!" It's not funny, and certainly not on a channel that shows caricatures if you understand where I come from. I do not want my 6 and 7 year old daughters to think or hear that. It's sad to me that Nick has disinfected this shit, and that's what we got, stupid little kids who act like stupid adults. I know it should have been funny, but let's consider that we have cute little innocent girls in K and Class I who can not wait to see this. I had to comment on how disappointed I was when I saw him. My daughters will not look. I'd like to block Nick, but at this point I do not have the heart, but if Nick continues with this kind of shit, I have to.
