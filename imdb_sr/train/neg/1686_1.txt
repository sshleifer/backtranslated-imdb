Imagine that your date asks you which movie you want to see, and you remember seeing a rather intriguing story about Grudge. So, in good faith, you recommend watching this movie. It's still the Halloween season. And last weekend it was done by the boffo office, so it must be pretty good ... so you go. And in fact you are in a state of shock when the film finishes in the way it works, and you hear yourself aloud: "It can not be the end of a movie ..." But, unfortunately, it is. And imagine leaving the movie theater and be ashamed of what is recommended for such a dog's film. You think your date thinks you are stupid because of suggesting such a crime, and your suggestion will certainly end up with a promising relationship. Actually, it was so bad that both of us started laughing about how bad it was. I do not see the future for Miss Gellar in movies, and I suggest keeping the television in the future. In fact, it will not take a long time before it is ready for the Buffy Souvenir Market Buffets Conventions, and this can not happen soon if you ask me. Terrible, terrible, terrible. The plot did not make sense; Continuity was terrible. It is obvious that the whole end has ended up with "Grudge II - Return of Cat-Boi." "
