Will Farmer (Lanter) play a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack, and Riplei, a super-government computer designed to profile potential terrorists, is tracking him because Vill borrowed (hacking) some money from his neighbor's neighborhood to pay a classic trip to play chess in Philadelphia. Neighbor neighbors, whose computer is repairing Vil, have relatives in the Middle East who send money through their bank to a neighbor's bank, and Riplei sees a terrorist connection. Riplei has the power to call rocket strikes. Oh, oh! This version of War Games has a much faster pace and more aggressive than the film War Games in the early 1980s. Well, the electronic industry has so much to do these days. Makes sense. So, the film fascinates us with fantastic CGIs on computer screens, and when Joshua, the forerunner of Ripley, finds himself in operational condition, we are left to look at a computer against a computer and people are struggling, hoping, praying. oh-ing, OMG-ing, and even more, I hope things will go their own way. In other words, we are now experiencing a movie made for TV, which is Oh Hum Time. Go back to the '80s and watch the original war movie. It's much better. But, we really have to ask ourselves: do we make computers too intelligent where, in time, they will rule us? Hmmm ?????? .. Violence: Yes. Gender: No Golotinja: No. Language: No
