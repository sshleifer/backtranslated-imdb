Not the best of the movies that can be watched today. I read a lot of reviews about Shining and I expected it to be very good. But this film disappointed me. The sound and environment were good, but there was no story here. There was not a moment of fear. I expected this in the horror trilogy movie, but there was no horror without a thriller. The only scene I was frightened was during the scene of the change of the chapter that shows "The Fortune". There are many fragments in the film. Most things remain unexplained and nothing that connects with anything. The story does not tell us about women or other scenes that are shown. Maybe it's a good movie for watching the 80's, but not for the 21st century.
