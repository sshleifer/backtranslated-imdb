Left behind is an incredible loss of over $ 17 million. The acting is weak and inspirational, the story is even weaker. The audience is asked to believe in a totally incredible and many times ridiculous complicated line and does not give anything in return for their good faith. Not only did the film behave badly and write, but it was lacking in all technical areas of film creation. Production design does not contribute to the credibility of the action. The effects are completely non-original and straight. Illumination and overall continuity are inexcusable; even in comparison with films with a tenth of the budget. However, none of this will be important because millions of families will without a doubt accept a film for his health and religiousness; and who can blame them. However, it is sad that they will be forced to accept filming in the third course.
