I have to agree with the first comment: this film is a very, very difficult one. Despite the large number of B-lists, the front page of this film (for those who do not watch it on Comedi Central during a business day, which is probably the only show that this film will ever get) tries to blame Dangerfield, but in reality it's just a salary for every comedian from the '80s. Randi Kuaid? Check it out. Ed Beglei, Jr? Check it out. Voice Lise Simpson? Now she can say that Makimum Overdrive was not her only terrible blow: a double check. And so many, many others. The most sad thing about this movie is that it was so lazily written with already told jokes. Nothing about this film beyond its existence is not funny. You better look at dry paint. This is definitely direct-to-video scraping-the-bottom-of-the-barre things that still believe in an old video adage: throw the old star on the cover and get some money back from the rental. Considering that the rental days of video are changing, consider one of the last examples of garbage dump. The only way this movie has benefited is if you have trouble sleeping. He'll bring you there.
