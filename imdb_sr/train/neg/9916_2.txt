Justin goes home to live with his tough, stubborn police detective, but Dad seems to turn up in three improvised suites each with bizarre tenants living in them. The idealist Justin is drawn into the world of occultism, murder, drunkenness of minors and other cowardly things. Ho-hum Vov, did I see the same movie that almost all other reviewers saw here ??? Smart, convincing, original, intense, smart, genius ???? !!? I did not see any of these things. What I saw was an uninteresting, mild, snappy, extreme clich√© low-budget thriller that was matured with incredulity and no tension at least as the killer telegrated as soon as possible into the film, he gives his monologue / debate / discussion. And where are these ridiculous funny moments? I never laughed so much, maybe because I was too busy fighting the movie did not fall asleep. My Rating: D DVD Extra: Audio comment with Director Dave Campfield; Second comment with different contributors, as well as isolated music tracks; 4 characters (Making, on set, converting 1 room to 4, and Inside the black circle); Interviews with Feliss Rose, Desiree Gould and Raine Brovn; Alternative scene; bloopers; music spot for 'Addiction'; Trailer for this movie; And "Shock-o-rama" trailers, "Chainsav Salli", "Skin Cravl", "Sinful", "Bacterium", "Creature from Hillbilli Lagoon", & "Millennium Crises"
