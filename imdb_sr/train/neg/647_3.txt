The acting was terrible as the script. It was badly composed and made you almost want to laugh at a couple of terribly played scenes of murder. The end was even worse. Everyone was dying, but somehow the ending looked as if everything was perfectly fine! They did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had, etc. The film took more time to develop a better story. The only reason I'm 3/10 is to feel bad for young actors. They needed better training. They could really make this OK movie, but the script and the acting failed.
