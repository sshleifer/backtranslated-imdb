I watched this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well, I found it to be strange and completely pointless ... so I decided to make a bit of a break and catch a copy of the 70's. Vov. what difference. The original was much better. I wish you all knew that it actually made a statement that the existence had a purpose. The Christian public really expressed the fear of paganism. If you study deeper, he also gives comments on life, but I do not want to get into the details, just, simply put it, if you were disappointed and want to know what it looks like, feel free to watch the 70's version, a little obsolete but much better.
