Letting the class look at this in English is a bad idea. Films that are serious and educated can have an effect, but it seems that this did not have any effect on the classes - whenever the teacher left, conversations quickly began - and I did not hear the words "Shakespeare" or "Shakespeare". Tempest is generally used. And when you look at this, it's easy to see why. The acting is nothing special - everyone seems to be boring, just reading from the site without worries in the world. Shakespeare always liked the presentation of a dialogue of action and death, but I could not understand the word that someone said. The costumes are not bad, nor are the special effects - the class may not have liked the film, but they did not exactly take p * ss. But it's hard to joke with a movie that is devoid of any kind of inspiration or joy. Scenes on the ship at the beginning of the film were not badly made - although the rain seemed somewhat unrealistic, everything else was good and good. But where are the heads cut and exploding masts? Where was death? Where is inspiration? Character Ariel would have been much more seriously understood that he was wearing clothes - but as everything showed up, it was just another excuse for a joke. This film is by no means appealing to any gender. Women and girls will have no romantic or comedy to enjoy, and there are many naked men and a lack of action or death that will separate most men and boys. The storm was not badly made, but this looked like something that manufacturers had to do, not something they wanted to make. Both general boredom and lack of inspiration show. 3/10
