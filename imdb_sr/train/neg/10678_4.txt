This movie looked good - a good cast, evergreen theme and explosive opening. He went downhill from there. Why was he shot by hand? She shakes, condemns, shoots a scene, and simply confuses the viewer. A really bad choice. As if that was not enough, the worst change in memory assumed the drugged viewer - obliged if you wanted to even enjoy it at all. And then he committed the worst sin of all. After the viewer has dropped all kinds of incredible and incredible scenarios to the point of exhaustion, they turn around without revealing the payoff - ending - payouts - like, hell, was the motive? How can you expect to succeed by making the thrillers endless? Doh! This film had a great promise and ended with the work of a facial plant in the mud. What a loss of effort. Poor effort by the writer and director.
