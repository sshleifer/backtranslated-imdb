A good actor (with one big exception) moves through Epstein's smart light satire. Mansfield has never been better or funnier than being in the pair with Volstone, a veteran who is determined to become a congressman to get out of the war. He and his comrades - including the lucky artist Grant - go to San Francisco on departure and start a city-wide Sungen party, while conventionally fleeing the service through industrial speeches. The only thing about this film that is not wonderful is Suzi Parker, which refers to one note as Grant's love interest, which takes up too much of the film and slows the pace in the second half. Valston and Mansfield have good chemistry; The trick is that she is ready to make love with every soldier (of course doing her duty for war effort), but he is a married man who still loves his wife. They steal a film with little problems from Grant (which is fun here in the first part of the film, when it is not paired with its actor who is not an actor.
