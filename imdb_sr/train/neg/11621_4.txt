I was interested to see this film because I knew it was Christian. The director had a good idea / intent when filming this movie, but it could have been better. I can understand why someone would still have feelings for who he believes is the greatest love of their lives. However, I did not understand why the director made his friends so insensitive, evil and rude. The main figure apologized to his friends when they were the ones they meant to him. They did not understand at all and used God as a reason to explain their behavior. The main hero, or anyone else, did not know if the ex-girlfriend was divorced, still married, etc., but he was solving the old feelings that had to be solved against him. His friends should have been Christians and should have shown them as support if they agreed with his decision or not. We have been doing so many times in life in which we do not apologize to those who have hurt in the past and when trying to do it, they were all against it. Ironically, the fact that his new friend accused him of behaving in an instant because she simply looked for an old friend, when she did something strange to catch his name, address and phone number ... she seemed to be a stalker !. she did not look like a friend at all, but she only took care of herself. God is love ... and I think God wants people to be with the person with whom they were supposed to be, and I think the film did a terrible injustice by looking like God does not care about true love ... only that you stay with someone with whom you made a bad choice. We all make mistakes ... everything is in the steps you take to redeem yourself. As I said, the film had the potential, but I was tired of the unilateral point of view that kept repeating itself and crowding the viewers through the throats of his so-called ... benevolent friends. This film was not true for a Christian belief of love, but I gave it to my efforts.
