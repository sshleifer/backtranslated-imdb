I understand that several of Ben Stiller's films have come out or will come out this year, but maybe they should insist on quality rather than on quantity. . "Stiller's Reuben is a grid, charming and ranked as one of the worst performances of the year." Stiller's schtick becomes tired. He undoubtedly has a comic talent, but he needs either to find someone else or to make pausing to find some material that is actually funny because his films are moving from painfully merciless to painfully bad. There is absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is a shame because she is a good, smart actress with a promising career. As long as she does more films like "Good Girl" (which is great) and less like "Along Came Polly," she will have a career from which she could be proud. Aniston desperately tries to overcome the flabby material she works with, but this is a discouraging task for Any actress. With the exception of a few moments with Alec Baldwin, like Reuben's boss Stan, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Reuben's best friend Sandi, there is nothing ridiculous in this terrible film. Other supporters, including Deborah Messing as Lisa and Hank Azari as Claude, are embarrassed. Azarya's emphasis is not only stupid, it is terribly immortal. The premise of "Along Came Polly" certainly promised. Unfortunately, he needed a writer who could actually turn him into a good comedy instead of this miserable, boring, boring apology for comedy.
