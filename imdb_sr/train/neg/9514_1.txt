Please, spare me these films that teach us that the crime is fun and justified. Connect this with a meaningless scenario with an intense desire to be Farrelly or Coen's brother, plus the lives of another group allegedly high school students who play their Davson Creek brand teen angst in a set with Genksiz soundtrack that is terribly trying to make the movie "feel" cool and we have intense and painfully incompetent satire. This is not even diluted 'Ferris Bueller' ... I'd rather watch the traffic light change. Only one scene stands out as close to the price for admission: when Betty Masked girls meet a friend of Richard Nikon. It's a surreal moment. Inexorably. But for the rest, I'd rather have a toothache. At least I can apply some benzocaine (tm) to stop the pain.
