I'm sorry to say that this movie is really bad. It reminds me of a c-class porn movie with one big difference: there is no pornography. Story and dialogue require a complete revision. Perhaps then the bad acting would not be so noticeable. At least, the pacing should be picked up. While I accept that this had a small budget and that the director did a good job visually with regard to the few resources he had, he should have spent more time on the story or better, someone else write. Many of the action scenes were meaningless. It was absolutely a waste of my time.
