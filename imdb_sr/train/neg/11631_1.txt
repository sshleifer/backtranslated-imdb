Today I wrote it in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollivood. Hollivood has made films based on one of the darkest days of our nation. 911 has changed everything. This has changed our perception of security. It has changed our understanding of the evil of man and mankind. What is most important and worst, this has changed our world. However, I can not emphasize how completely I have been dismissed, disappointed and angry at the careless, obviously ignorance of Hollivood who seeks to profit from death and destruction. This film and those like him will surely cause controversy in the middle of the mouth among viewers and critics; it will surely be echoed by the mainstream. Hollivood sank to a new level. Even lower than the poor bastards who carried out the most barbaric acts of savagery and merciless cruelty. Behind all is Uwe Boll. I'm very angry at this movie. How dare they not respect the memories of the families of the lost? How dare they mock the lives of brave men and women who risked their lives to save those captured in towers condemned to these fatal days of shame?!?!? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the fog of the sad and tired world after 911!?!?! How ... do they dare ... they? For those who have the desire to even think of seeing this morally terrible travesty, I say this with a hard heart with all my might: Remember. Think about that day and ask yourself whether you are a reasonable or moral person. Think about that day, ask yourself if this film is embarrassing and embarrassing for the lost lives of that day. Think about that day of indignation of loved ones. Go back to that day of lost lives on those two planes. Think about the further massacre that caused it after the attack. Ask yourself if you have a soul. Think about it. To remember. Respect memories of lost lives on 911 by not seeing this movie at all.
