This film is a waste of the film. Do you believe that the map of the military mission plan will be placed on a stall in the courtyard in the middle of the day for anyone with a binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see? That happened in this movie. Do you believe that DEAF persons would really be engaged in an active army in Europe during the Second World War to serve in a "black" unit ... cooking, supplying, funeral details, etc.? That happened in this movie. Do you believe that a black (and supposedly intelligent) officer would choose the same DEAF K.P. to be part of an active combat mission to defend itself from destroying the dam from the Germans before the Allies arrived? That happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that the DEAF soldier did not realize that the German plane was coming from behind and that he would attack and kill him? That happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that a group of US soldiers in a farmhouse at a farm that the Germans had encountered picked up their emotions in looking at German soldiers who were only 50 'far away? They did this in this film, and left all possible entrances to the amber. The Germans could spend it completely unprotected. Would you believe that, through the waves and in clear English, the captain mentioned the general's rank, if not his name, as the person with whom he spoke and that the general, in English through open waves, said that the dam had to be protected next of the day? Maybe they should have just sent an envoy to tell in which direction the US attack would come just to make it a bit easier for the Germans. This so-called movie should be placed on the list of 50 worst films. If it is, I'm sure it would be good. Take care of your own risk.
