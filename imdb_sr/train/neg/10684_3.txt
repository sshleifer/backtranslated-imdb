This film was a craptacular. I was so emotionally decoupled for every character that was the biggest film antagonist, actually, me. I played it beautiful; promising me that I will leave, but just drink another beer in the hope that it will auto-magically turn into something interesting in the way. Even in such a state, I could not fail to notice that Cuba's acting was as thin as paper. His obsessive dedication to the business was incredibly done, as did his one night spree after the failure of his idiotic standards. Burt came to the screen as a general, so is General (who wears too many makeup items). I fell into a scary fast drunk to confront Cuba, except that mine was right, and I bite my finger. Recompense! Make up my dirty finger!
