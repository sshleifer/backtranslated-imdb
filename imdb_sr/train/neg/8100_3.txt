Bonfires of the Vanities is a film soaked by sweat. I can not think of any film that has worked so hard to be so intransigently offensive, provocative and important, but it has not succeeded so consistently at all levels. It's like a comedian who does not laugh, but can not leave the stage. As the film makes more effort, every attempt at laughter leads to a louder stroke. The father who shows the film is so obvious that almost all those who are involved are excited. Film reaches a loud status only twice. Once in the eyes of Gerald Rivera, who plays a stunning, arrogant and amoral TV tabloid journalist - which is ridiculous just because he obviously does not understand how to play alone. The second scene that deserves to laugh is the last "big moment" of the film, where Judge Morgan Freeman brings a dedicated lecture on what morality ("that's what your mother taught!"). The pompos of the moment insults to the extent that it is absurd. However, it must be admitted that this is a noble effort. It's good, if it's a bad actor, a group of actors who try to get the characters out of thin caricatures. The movie looks professionally made and the small movie flowers that Brian DePalma only loves are obvious, if not particularly effective. But the film, which obviously wants to be a commentary of modern morality and ethics, never appears above the level of a cartoon film. Satire requires a style. Farce requires energy. Even the sitcom requires timing. But the best fire can come together. In the end, you do not want to laugh, you just want to turn around.
