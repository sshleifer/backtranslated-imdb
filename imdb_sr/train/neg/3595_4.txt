I was not "happy" like some others who commented on this film: I never saw anything else from ... say ... "fruitful" mind Sarn. I agree with many: some of the actors who spend a lot of time in toples and go-go dancing are not so attractive. I kind of liked Fraulein Crank (?) ... she was so ugly, sweet! The act was also quite stagnant, although the delivery of lines in another language may have represented a large part of the problem. Attempting to follow the plot was the main task: was it real? I sincerely agree with another commentary: there is not much blood left for the vampire movie. Yes, if you want GOOD bleeding, look at such classics as "Horror of Dracula" and (my personal favorite) "Brides of Dracula". Doctor draws clothes from a blade cloud ... you never see! ... bats, I mean. cable here in the Big White North, but, for God's sakes, do not rent it!
