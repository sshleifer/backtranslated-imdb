I went to watch this film with low expectations, but I was hoping to be enchanted by watching my hometown on the film. Unfortunately, that's all I have. The story covers a familiar territory (gathering in high school), but the plot is bent and the supernatural element little contributes to this well-worn topic. Although the quality of the acting was good overall, the content of the film was terrible. Sexism of the film was obvious - women are obviously unfulfilled, unless they marry, give birth or both (although it was a post-feminist choice). There is still a bitter racism - a goddamn Jewish mother, a blacksmith who still lives at home - and a lack of cruelty (torture of the geek class). We should be ashamed if these characters are thought to be residents of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers should be embarrassed by the widespread and cruel stereotypes on the screen.
