Tobe Hooper is probably the greatest happiness that the horror genre offers. Like all other horror fans, I liked Tekas Chainsav, but I think that in order to put your name in front of us, you should have at least one hit movie. I can not imagine any other film that Hooper did (alone, do not count Poltergeist) that really influenced the horror genre or film world. And this movie, The Nightmare, just supports my attitude. Poor Robert Englund, I give him credit for it at least doing a good job with the terrible material he got. He did what he could. What about the film itself? Pure drudge. Unnecessary naked scenes every five minutes, a story that is surely written in our, and indeed just a horrible scene, music and cinema. Nothing in this movie can be bought. Do not waste your time. All in all, 1 out of 10. I'm sorry, Hooper, his career seems to have been completed before he really started. I hope that he is capable of pumping at least another good movie, so he can achieve his cult status of justice. <br /> <br />
