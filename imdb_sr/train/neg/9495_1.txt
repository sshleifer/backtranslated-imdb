This is a horrible movie, and no scene has any true emotions. The characters are immobile, obviously drawn, predictable, and the story is an obvious and typical fulfillment of Hollywood desires. Villiam Holden (so sad to see him in this role) was 55 when this film was filmed, but he plays someone in the early forties and looks like he's in his 60s. Kai Lenz was 20 years old and wrote that he was overwhelmingly attracted to him. I think that the dog that they found alongside the road was more sexy and had more life than its erotic connection. Holden's character - the same year as Clint Eastwood when he directed this film, (not) accidentally - was set up with apparent jeans before the 60s before the hippie cool: boys drop, rocking hi-fi, lunch at Iamashiro. But the movie is ridiculously untidy, screaming old fogs that desperately want the free spirits they saw on Sunset and the Laurel canyon find them and their big caravans sexy. Ugh. Youth culture has never been so desperate. I shake when I think that Bill Holden was so desperate for the youth that he took this shameful part.
