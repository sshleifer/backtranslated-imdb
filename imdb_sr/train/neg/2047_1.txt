I do not want to go here, but ... this is the worst "movie" I've ever seen. Worse than Avengers. Uncompetitive direction, unrelated writing, and terrible acting are the only consistent elements. Filmed on a very inexpensive video, it looks like a high school project, but without emotions. Lighting often looks like a Sun-Gun. The sound is slightly better than one microphone on the camera, but everything else about this thing is simply terrible. The action takes place in strange directions without foundation or later resolution, the elements of the technicians are obviously absurd, and the editing looks worse than a rough cut. It's not even bad enough to be funny. That's just bad. CTV, packaging is deliberately misleading. The lion's door owes me $ 4.
