Spend your time in a different way, even housework is better than this movie. Jokes are not funny, fun rhymes that are Dr. Seus are not there. A very bad way to lose the evening. My children aged 4 to 16 were laughing a bit at first, the younger ones got bored and left to play Barbies, and the older ones stayed to play PS2 and surf the net. My wife left and made a meal. So I ended up alone. It was the worst "kid" movie I saw. If you want to watch Shrek 2's fun children's watch, this movie is fun for children and their parents. SAVE THIS FILM. It's not funny, it's not sweet, makeup of the cat is the only good thing in it and you can see it on the disc label.
