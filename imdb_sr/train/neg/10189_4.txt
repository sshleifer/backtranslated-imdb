I've seen this movie many years ago, and I was impressed ... but I was only 12 years old again. I recently looked at him again and I wanted that time back. This movie is pretty bad. Although I love Lee Mayors, Chris Makepeace (see Mi Bodiguard (1980) if you want to see a good movie in which he was ... Meatballs (also starring Bill Murray) for some laughs), and Burgess Meredith, this role has not done anything for their career. In any case, the character of Lee Majors, Franklin Hart, is a former auto race driver who plans to ride his racing car (which he had in stock) across the country to California. One problem: The government banned every private carriage. I thought the concept was fine (for which I did not hear it up), but the execution was terribly gone.
