Poor plot, predictable violence, only half-interesting characters. As if the writer (also one of the stars?) Fictionalized his own scams and added incredible fantasies about drugs and murders to be "hot." From the predictable rap and house soundtrack, to family conflicts, it's bad, stereotyped, and ultimately terribly boring. Even the title has already been made - IMDb lists FIVE films of the same name issued 2007-2008! Note: You saw it on Shovtime, which shows the synopsis for one of the other films. He was halfway before I realized that nobody was a secret cop. Even the second stereotype would have been interesting for this to happen.
