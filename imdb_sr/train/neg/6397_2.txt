That's the problem I have with movies that come on television, when there's nothing else to watch. I kind of got into really bad movies. But this was pretty much the case. The concept that the only ones left on Earth after the comet, and then finding the zombies are nearby, makes me laugh. And that's why I gave this film 2, instead of 1. The story was stupid ... but it made you laugh (too stupid> ridiculous). I think I was just watching her because the Star Trek guy was in charge. I was surprised to see him as a younger ... and he was the only funny figure anyway.
