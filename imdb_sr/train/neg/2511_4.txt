Director Fred Schepisi (Rokanne) directs this benevolent, yet inferior comedy about Albert Einstein (Matthau) who tries to merge his scientific nephew (Rian) with ordinary guy Tim Robins to force her to relax and enjoy her life in the 1950s. In order for Rian to love Robbins, Einstein tries Robins to look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is sweet, but the film falls in underground situations and stupid dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Rian, and a great assistant team do their best to keep this stupid comedy on the surface, but they are not able to save the movie. Unfortunately, so much talent has entered the production of such a film. I would not recommend to anyone that they are not great fans of Meg Rian.
