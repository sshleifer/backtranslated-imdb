Absolutely poor film loss !! Nothing ever happens. No ghosts, no train, no mystery, no interest. Permanent and brutal comedy attempts are painful. Everything else is pathetic. The assumption is idiotic: a crowd of people stranded in the middle of a non-place, because their train was kept less than 3 minutes. What? And the railway leaves them no place to stay in the storm? I do not think so. Oh, I can walk 4 miles across dead black fields. Um, yes. Of course. Or, I can compel the hospitality of the railways and stay in the 'ruined' train station. A station that proved to be nothing but dead bored, completely without ghosts, interests or complications. on the list LOST FILMS !! aargh !!
