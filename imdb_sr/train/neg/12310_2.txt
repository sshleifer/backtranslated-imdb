Steve Martin should stop trying to make remake of classical comedy. He absolutely does not fit this part. Like the sad remake of Out Of Tovners, this film falls on the face. As anyone ever thought Steve Martin could even come close to the wonderful performance of Jack Lemmon is beyond me, and the same is true for this film. Day Ackroyd could have better played Bilko. Martin is great when he does his original characters, but he does not succeed in trying desperately to create the classical work of other people. It is a sad statement when the funniest part of the film is contained in the first line of credit when the film is over. Line "Manufacturers with gratitude acknowledge the complete lack of cooperation of the United States Army" was the only line that actually made me laugh. If you want to see the real Bilka, grab the original episodes of Phil Silvers Shov. This guarantees you will laugh, unlike this error that should never have happened. I put this film in the same category as the Lemmon classic and remake Psicho. None of them should ever have happened.
