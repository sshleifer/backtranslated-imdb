For those who desperately wanted to find out what happened to Tvitch in the original movie, here's your chance, then go back to the real world. The guy who hid gold in the first movie told Tvitch, so he was transferred to another prison where wrestling champions waved around him. Tvitch plans to leave prison for a month to make gold live with his wife. Then something happens and someone is killed, and the movie turns into Die Hard in another prison. But the wolf's daughter is caught in all this, so he and the jerk are going to find her and Twitch's wife. ) rap music and badly organized fighting scenes. On the plus side, there's a Latin American who plays in every prison / action / thriller ever made, and closes the door in this. It's not very content, but at least it's harmless. If you were a great fan of the original, then everything is fine. If not, you are warned.
