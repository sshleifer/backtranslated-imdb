This may not have been the worst film Peter Sellers ever did (I think the laurel goes to the Zende prisoner), but it's certainly the most depressing. Sellers, especially without a syntagm like Nile Smith, seem to have just passed chemotherapy. Like Fu Manchu, it looks a bit better and spends most of the film (with the exception of those unusually disturbing scenes where electrical currents are struggling) at the edge of the collapse under the weight of this makeup. Supporting players also look tired and run, and the presence of Sid Caeser is insulting and without constant references to "Chinks!" (One bright spot: this would be one of the last time the main movie would portray Asians so offensive ... or, in that case, as a non-Asian star!). The film looks surprisingly inexpensive, with a photo in soups and gray sets - even the number of Elvis in the end seems to be reduced. Just the amazing Helen Mirren and the tall, thin, nervous types that give him trousers moistened, add all the sparks of life to this sad affair. All in all, this film provides a spectacular horror of great comical death, and even more horrible documentation of his dying.
