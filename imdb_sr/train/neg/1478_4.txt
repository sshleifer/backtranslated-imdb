this movie has its own good points: hot chickens die ... the problem ... hot chickens become barren hot and you do not see many of the people dying, mostly just quick movements and screaming although there were two good scenes of killing. Also for those who are watching this for JENU JAMESON, it is just a minor file with a very small role and smaller bare scenes. What this movie needs .. script and story would be nice, but I will not complain about it .. simply put it needed more nudity and better kill scenes cuz lets face this is the reason why we watch these shifts ... I would not spend my money on it ... and if you must, wait until it's on the old shelves in your local video
