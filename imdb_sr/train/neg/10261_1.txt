Vov, I just saw this on T.V. as one of the "scary" films that show around the Halloween. Is this rated by G? There was nothing to make this film scary or worth watching. Also, other people say this is a hoax, but I do not think so. For a spoof, you need something called "humor". This low-budget shit-fest did not have a piece of humor, nor did it make any sense. Basically, you have a stupid monster (a man in rubber clothes) that comes out of the closet, kills people, I suppose, since you never see that the monster is violence to anyone or any bloody consequences. Newspapers that are rumored say that people were killed by the monsters, so I guess it's good enough. The army is trying to kill a monster, which is not much larger than a man. They have a very bad goal. Then the military FLEES! Wow, did this film make American soldiers look pathetic or what? The monster, while it is hard to kill, does not do much more than it revolves around it and urls. Oh, and occasionally from the mouth and screams comes another head. It was a little interesting, but total Alien ripoff. What was the deal with a scientist who played Xylophone to attract a monster? It was difficult to understand a lot of dialogue due to poor sound quality. Likewise, why did the monster so long carry around the chief guy? Why did not the monster go into the closet when it had a chance? Why do I insist that I try to figure out the meaning of pointless?
