This film was recommended by my friend who lives in California. She thought it was wonderful, because it was so real, "Just like people in the Ohio Valley!" I'm from that area and I've seen a movie like "As people in California think we are!" I lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and I worked there minimum wages. We laughed a lot, we tied up and made breaks with people of our time; young people went out at night. Older people had little spare time after work because they were worried about their families. The area is beautiful in the summer and it is no longer more gloomy in the winter rain than anywhere else. Apart from "if you live in a manufactured home you have to be depressed," the subtlety, the story lacks any element of charm, mystery or even a sense of fear. Marthin's figure was the worst drawn. I doubt that someone who was repressed would belong to the church, but if she had, she would probably have friends there. I read reviews that seem to suggest that Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was "younger, prettier and thinner," but if that's the case, it's not shown. All we see is that Marta teaches that she does not like Rose for reasons that would equally apply to three friends of the same age and sex. We see that Marta feels left out during a smoking session, left out of the circle when making social plans, used, but not priced, and ultimately not respected and hurt. Just one more thing: Do we need to doubt Kila's murder because once he had several panic attacks? Please. This brings the stigma against mental illness to a new level.
