I watched only DVD 1. The correct program can have 10 minutes of good information; otherwise, it is a snobbish persecution of religious people. It's as if director Brian Fleming just recently discovered atheism and sarcasm, and he feels with these tools that can easily fight against his opposition. Movie. He never returns to the subject. Religious people are prone to skeptics when their objections to religion obviously come from violent upbringing. The arguments of such victims seem irrational, and therefore unconvincing. Anti-religious people want more data. We do not need to say that religious people are crazy, nothing more than American Jews should apologize for the boring Christmas music coming by mid-December. In the best scene, the chief of Fleming's children's Christian school is quite strikingly confronting the director with his motives. It looks like the most honest part of the movie, and it was too short. If Fleming was a little self-conscious, he could have a good story about his own (past and present) attitude towards Christianity, and offensive institutions that indoctrinated him in his youth. Or perhaps he could borrow his material "Christ never walked the earth" to a serious documentary. I do not study the texts of Saul / Paul to find out how much this is airtight, but the quick search for Wikipedia suggests that most of these arguments are discredited. The bonuses are pretty good, they do not support Fleming's thesis. Sam Harris is a good spokesman for the anti-religious POV, and does not look at those other, non-Christian religions. Harris also has some good (and easy Google) interviews at Salon.com, Amazon.com and Samharris.org.
