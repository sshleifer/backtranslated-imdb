"Welcome to Colinwood" is a type of disaster. Having in mind the people involved, it should have been a lot better. Seeing him, if at least a bit bound to the belief that it will be better, you will probably be crying. This is one of those films that had the potential, but this potential was robbed by a horrible scenario and a bad act, not to mention the unusually unpleasant and unnecessary character of George Cluni and a man who reminds me of Richard Dreifuss, but for whom I care so little that I do not even want to know his name. The only rescue grace of the movie is the weird vocabulary that introduces. I found that I was thinking about it again and again as I watched more criminals. This is the only reason I gave it to movie 3. The action is boring, the characters are neurotic, unnecessarily insulting and very inaccessible. They are in constant condition of painful stress and they are all so irritating that I have celebrated their obstacles. They shout at each other and swear. The dialogue is at best unsuccessful and insultingly stupid at the lowest points. I consider Steven "Traffic" Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Cloonei to blame for it. They should be tried for war crimes, if one remembers that shit enough to take care of it.
