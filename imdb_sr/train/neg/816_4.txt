In the seventies, VPIKS led the "Adventure of Superman" every working day afternoon for several years. From time to time, we would get a treat when we exaggerate adjacent shows to broadcast "Superman and Mole". I always looked forward to those days. Looking at him recently, I was surprised how badly it really was. It was not bad due to special effects or defects. The truth, George Reeves Superman costume was pretty bad, the edges of the foamed pillow that used it to make it even more impressive and clearly visible. And the truth, the costumes of the mole were even worse. What was supposed to be a fur coat would not be tricked by the ten-year-olds, since the zippers, sleeves and badly stuffed fabrics badly packed in baggy costumes were painfully obvious. But these were gaps that could be forgiven. No. Over and over again, Superman did nothing to get the situation worse. Linch mob is looking for creatures? Instead of rounding up a hysterical bunch or searching for creatures, he stands and explains Lois and PR people in the dangers of the situation. The creatures are drawn into the corner? Again, he stands and looks and speaks, but he does not keep them until they shoot him. Luke Benson, city mayor, shoots him? He tried to kill any reasonable person, but Superman repeatedly and again let this man cause more trouble. Superman had the opportunity to stop the problem at the root, but never used them. However, both George Rivers and Philip Cootte played well their characters, seemingly immediately in the role of the role. Just to get a better scenario for work.
