I do not believe in all the praise for this movie. The performance and the film were a bunch of Sleuth. Michael Caine wants to be Olivier, and Reeves wants Caine. Caine even had the courage to make a remake of Sleuth with Jude Lav who played his original piece. Jude Lav? You mean the one who did the "Alfie" remake? This film was shot during Caine's career when it was obvious that he needed to pay gambling debts. He would do everything for money. He would feature in such award-winning films as this, and "Beiond the Poseidon Adventure". What appears to be starting a praise for this film is Reeves' death. He deserves better than remembering this bad movie. And Caine. This film can be found at $ 5.97 in Valmart. Together with jewels like "Island" and "Curse it for Rio".
