As I watched this movie, I felt, but it seems to be the reason for madness in the family in this film. In any case, this is not a lot of sense, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's latest films and only his presence on the screen gives her any credibility. It's sad that all the great legends about horror films in the era of sound have been reduced to a stupid stupidity like this one. Marginalli, Boris got a little better than the poor old White Lugosi, but not much. Boris gives his best and gives him the credit for trying to keep this mess together. Powerful background music does not help and distract from any lucid moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican actor is called a strange, cramped, English monotone that resembles the type used in porn movies of the late seventies. I guess it's "House of Usher" by Edgar Allen Poe that this is taken from, but it would be hard to find a lot of Poe's in the final article. Still, there are far better films with Boris Karloff in their best edition, overtake them and give him a wide fly, unless you're boasting and curse of the 'calming brain'!
