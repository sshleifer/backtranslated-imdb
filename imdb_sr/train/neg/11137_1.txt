All naked women in the world could not prevent me from pressing the stop button to about a third of the way through this terrible garbage. With a mocking act, an equally terrible scenario and a poor CGI FKS that agrees; this film is an insult to the genre of the Werewolf. It should be serious, which in itself would be ridiculous for this film to lead to the level of bad joke. apparently competent, but they are too lazy to do something even a quarter of the decent. Avoid at all costs and instead look at one of the classic Verevolf films. <br /> <br /> 0 of 10!
