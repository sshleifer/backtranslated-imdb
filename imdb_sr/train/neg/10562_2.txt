This film with very low-budget comedies only succeeds in a low budget. The dialogue is stupidly stupid, the scene is boringly boring, and it seems that most of the money on the screen is preserved for a series of crashes and explosions in the parking lot during the last five minutes of the movie (a brief look at the port early in this scene is sure to destroy and slam shit about the main criminal of the film - no basis is here for no purpose). The whole film depressively resembles those who occasionally left the studio of Roger Korman when he first directed a couple of dollars and a camera - but without the discipline that Korman imposed.
