If Bob Ludlum saw this mini-series, he would cry. It was a total waste of time and money. I read the book and even though the movies are not exactly what the book can be, CBS lost time and money on it, and it's a shame to claim that this is Ludlum's work. Perhaps the creator should look at Bourne's identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good the TV series is. Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign up to get down to it low? > Horrible !!
