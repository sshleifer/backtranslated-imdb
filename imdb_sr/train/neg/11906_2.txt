Watching "Der Himmel uber Berlin" as a teenager in the late '80s was a deep experience for me - "so could it be films". With "Paris, Texas" and "To the End of the World" I still take a special place in my heart and mind - the testimony of the genius of Vim Venders. Unfortunately, later on, there was a steady decline in the quality of his work with the "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Land of Plenty" that hit a terrible low point. Wonderful pictures or music went away. There is no search or large view view. All that remains is the characters and the thinly hidden political statements, which only reduces to clich√©s and sincerely mock the intelligence of a mature audience. Is the well dry? Whatever the reason, it's time for Mr. Venders to either withdraw or stop.
