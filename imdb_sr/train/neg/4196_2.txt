This is one of the worst movies I've seen for a long time. Not only the story, but the acting is shockingly bad. The dialogue sounds like someone reading the news. This is rated as a comedy / drama / romance, not of these things! It's a small action, that's it. There's really no comedy or drama. If you go to the movies to see this, I'm sorry for you. I would not recommend it at all. A lot of what you choose to look at will be better. This is mostly a film about action / crime. Action scenes were sucked in, and part of the crime story was very predictable. If you are not really interested in a good story or a good acting. And you just want to look at the 'side' movie for the attraction of being a party. Then this could be for you.
