Really, they wrote BRAIN in credits, not BRIAN. All production money went to big old cars. There are at least two Packards here. One is Darin Convertible. Nice yellow Packard convertible. Scenes of the film studio show that there was a lot of money for costumes and decorations. Old cameras, exterior of the Ciro, street signs and all that was needed to make a visually pleasing picture was there. It's bad written and directed. My DVD says it lasts about 104 minutes. It was more than 85 minutes. It ended without a conclusion. There was a collision, but without a conclusion. The film just broke up against the loan. 99 cents for this. I paid 99 cents for this. I could buy 3 cans of feline food and watch the face of the cat while he felt more excitement. A few seconds on the Ciro scene after Darren McGavin got a phone call, it looked like it might be. ... this movie would have a surprise surprise that would be for an interesting movie. Then she just sat there. Young Latin actor Steven Bauer (Tony Montoia) could have a much bigger role in everything that was going on here. This actor could make a good movie. I think that if they cut down Brian's part and used Steven Bauer in his place and changed the script and kept Packard and lost the band and added Johnny Otis sound. band, then they got something. Here Kitty, Kitty ... Tom Villett
