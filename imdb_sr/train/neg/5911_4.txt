POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <b> Spi Vho Shagged Me is much overestimated and excessively resumed. The International Man of Mystery came straight from the blue. It was a lonely star that few people heard. But he was stunningly genuine, he had sophisticated humor and humor, always kept in good taste, and he had a great role. Spi Vho Shagged Me was much more commercially advertised and praised. Ok, I admit, the first time I saw this movie I thought it was very funny, but only after I watch it or three times to see all the flaws. The acting was fine, but Heather Graham could not work. Her performance did not look very convincing and was not as good as Liz Hurley. Those characters who flourished in the first, (Scott Evil, No. 2, etc.) are thrown into the background and heard and do not get many independent scenes. The film is simply overflowing with the cameosima. I especially hated the way in which they completely ignored some of the scenes in IMOM. When they initially killed Vanessa and when Basil sat down, he knew that he was a fembot all the time. What was the purpose of that? They killed number 2 in the first one and now they are being returned without any explanation. This should be a spy blast, I do not think that one character holds a gun in the movie. It simply goes further and further away from the point. New characters are very undesirable. The whole Mini-Me 'mocking the size of my size' is getting very old. Fat Bastard is just a poor excuse for rude humor. In total there are about two or three good jokes. The rest is either flavored or rehashed from IMOM. If this was the first movie of the series, then I would probably be easier on it. But the series began on a note of dry wit, and then went down to the level of gross humor. So to say, watch this movie only if you did not see his predecessor, because Spijun was shocked by an extreme disappointment.
