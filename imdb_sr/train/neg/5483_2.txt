I just ruined four dollars by renting this movie! Why would Alliance Atlantis promote such a bad excuse for the film is beyond me? But even more surprising were pretty good reviews that some Canadian critics gave to this film. I'm tired of our media justifying the film simply because it's a Canadian and a low budget. It's like they expect Canadian movies to be bad, so they look at it well. Now about the movie: The acting is below the average (with the exception of the main male character, which is actually pretty good). The quality of the movie was poor, which, I guess, could have been expected from an extremely low budget. The script was absolutely horrible. An example is a story that revolves around one of the main characters, a drug dealer who flirts with one of her clients so she can recruit him to repair and steal bicycles for his gang, whose sole purpose is to randomly destroy SUVs. Apparently, many of the bikes of her gang members were destroyed in these activities (I do not know how she can not afford to buy only new ones, because she should be a great deal to sell drugs from Vancouver to Toronto). In any case, the point of the story (which is not revealed until half the film) is that the drug dealer plans to build facilities in Toronto to make the home more affordable - I should say more. Shame at the Toronto Film Festival that he accepted such a film, Telefilm for his support, and Globe and Mail and the Georgia Straight newspaper for giving such biased comments. Film should not receive a special treatment just because it is Canadian !!!!
