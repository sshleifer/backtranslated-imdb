A bloody maniac with cannibalistic tendencies rages a woman. He was killed by two policemen, and then he rose from the grave because of some sort of Satanic ceremonial rite that carried out the evil heresy. Hunting for women continues this zombie-demon. The sacrificial baby returns from the grave and again wants a dead maniac, but only with the help of the police this will be accomplished ... Bloody mess of 65 minutes ... Horny zombies, doll -Babies, S & M, corrupt and distorted policemen, repentant heretics who seek refuge in Jesus Christ and three text screens at the end of the film explaining to us what finally happened to the policeman who survived (yes, we must know!) ... Two decent discharges can not save the situation. I saw the worst horror flicks, but this one was pretty bad. It is recommended only for those who are very fierce.
