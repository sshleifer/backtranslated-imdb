This is a strange hacked movie, you have the feeling that the bond has to come to this, I'm not surprised that there are no points on it, who would like to be associated with this movie. The act of all involved is terribly stiff, and the action of jumping all over, everything makes little sense. As I already said, it seems that the bond had to come because there seemed to be plenty of recordings that were not recorded and that all music was a very bad music library (I guess I'm cheap). Very, very strange. Maybe I would actually buy a DVD from him, if he could let me in what the hell is happening, and what happened to this film.
