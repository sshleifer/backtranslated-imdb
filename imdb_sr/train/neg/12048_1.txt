I came out of 6 movies all my life. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not know how I spent an hour. I must have been in a coma that night. I saw him in the theater when he came out eight years ago. I could not remember the name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller was acting in her. It must have really influenced me to waste time commenting on it today. Iech! Vomit! Barf!
