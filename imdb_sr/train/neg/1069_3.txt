I saw this film at the AFI Dallas Festival. Most audiences, including my wife, enjoyed this drama comedy, but I did not. It includes Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (kiss, five senses, Hollivoodland) and Adam Scott (first snow, confidential school). The director is Matt Bissonnette, who is married to Molly Parker. All three actors do a good job in this movie about 3 friends, the marriage of two of them and the unbelief involving the third. Everything is happening in the house on the lake and it looks great. The film wants to treat its subject as a comedy, then as a drama, and I thought it should be the other way around.
