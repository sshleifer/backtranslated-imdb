Super sexy movie actress B has another important role as the future girlfriend of "Goodfellas" star Raio Liotte in this bomb. She plays Marion, has only one line of dialogue, well, actually, a VORD dialog. She yells "Joe!" because Rai's character breaks poor Poor Pond with a plastic bowel spray. This movie is so bad, although it sometimes becomes ridiculous, funny. The guys from the Mystery Science Theater 3000 would love this! Check out the hysterical scene at the end where Pia has a nervous breakdown and all optional editing and effects that try to show how Pia is crazy. In this, Pia plays the Hollywood scriptwriter. Pia Zadora as a screenwriter? Yeah, right. Pia barely speaks, let alone write! Pia is completely and absolutely wrong in this stupid role. But who cares? The real star is hot and fresh Gloria Annen in her participation in the opinion of this cat! Rock on Glori!
