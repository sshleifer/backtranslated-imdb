I rented this film, sounding for the noise of not being set for the Oscar, but after watching, it's easy to see why it is not. In spite of beautiful photography, the film is moving very slowly, despite the fact that there is almost no complication. The action refers to a boy who tries to reconcile with the death of his parents in what he or she may or may not have had to be an accident (the film was never clear), and how his grandfather spoke stories from a fairy tale. Fairy tales contain only parts of interest for the plot, but they are very short, and seem to make no sense. The first fairy tale is especially for a boy who tries to find the magic flower of his girlfriend in the dying to save her life, but the boy postpones by first tasting a flower to make sure that he is not poisonous which results in him for a few seconds too late to save his grandfather says that it is morally that the boy was too impatient, but that does not make sense because he was cautious and slow, which resulted in his failure. Perfect metaphor for this movie. Skie's photo is beautiful, but Stardust, released this year, is still one movie about fairy tales shot in Skie and beautifully photographed - and it's infinitely better than this.
