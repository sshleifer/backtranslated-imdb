but there are not many of them. Probably the worst movie about the "big edition" I've seen in my life. Definitely the worst for this year. It does not make sense to comment on the act, acting or acting. The problem is above all that. It lies in the absolute stupidity of the boring type (not the ridiculous kind) of everything that happens on the screen. I do not know why I gave 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably because of Steven Martin. He really did try. The bottom line - 95 minutes is washed in the toilet together with several brain cells. Avoid at all costs.
