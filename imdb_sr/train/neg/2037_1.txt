If I could give her a zero, I would change my mind and give it -10 instead. Absolutely terrible film without a movie action, there is no point in what's happening. Just PLAIN BORING. Please do not spend money on this. Pleaseee !!! This movie could have done so well that it really showed the real zodiac killer, but nippes, I did not feel anything but drowsy while I was watching it. Do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies, it's better to watch a movie you've already seen as 3-4 times than watch this shit! I do not understand why people even try to make such films when they know they will not succeed. Zodiac killer should be called "killer Boriac" !!!
