Unwittingly, ignorant, poorly imagined, killing career (where is now talented Angela Jones?), Deep-optional freight. No wonder Reb Braddock has not done anything yet - anyone who has the opportunity to make his first film about his rules, based on his own script, with Quentin Tarantin himself, creates something like OVOG, anyone feels that OVO was a story worthy of telling the world, does not deserve a second break. In the given circumstances, performances are good - actors do what they are told to do, and they do it well. Only they did not have to do it at all. <br /> <br /> 0 of 4.
