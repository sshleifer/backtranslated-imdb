This movie turns more like a combination of music videos on MTV than as a real movie. There is no real story and how the film continues, ask yourself: "What will happen?"; but nothing is happening. The story of Eric Cloecke, a frustrated writer, is the only good thing. It seems that other people do not have anything in common: why connect them to a movie. With music you can watch the worst movie. When I open the tap and exit the water with the music of Bach, most people will love to look at it, but this is not a movie. The director should learn how to write a script for a movie of 100 minutes or more before starting to direct the film.
