This is a nice, deep sound, but for the thriller you better deliver more than the names of the actors and talk. The first third of this film was just a talk and more conversation. Most of that was a bunch of women who were muttering each other. The top five actors on the list are women, so it confirms that this is really a "chicken" and a little bit of the other. This is probably played on the Lifetime Network. It was a quick scene of murder, and then another conversation. Halfway through, they lost me. Otherwise, Salli Field looked here for about 15 years.
