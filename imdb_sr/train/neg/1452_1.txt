These 1919 to 1933. Germany looks tough as the Czech capital after World War II. Oh, excuse me, this is the Czech city, and this is 2003, how funny it is. This is one of the most horrifying historical films in the recent past. Rohm's head is higher than Adolf and looks so damn good, Goring looks like 40 when he's only 23 and "Fuhrer" always looks like 56. And buildings, people, even buildings were young, sometimes. In particular, in 1919, there were many homes in Germany almost new (World War I does not reach the German cities!). No decomposed mortar! Then Reichstagsbuilding. There were never any urban canyons around this building. And this can sound like a miracle: in 1933, the Berlin-based fire brigade owns many vehicles with engines, some even with swivel ladders, but none with a manual pump. The last thing: What was the PLAIMOBIL castle in the last sequence? For me it was some sort of "Adolf's Adventures in Wonderland".
