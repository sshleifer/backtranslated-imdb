Here is an indie movie that I really wanted to love, but in the end I could not. The lack of scenarios (boldly proclaimed in the main titles) really shows through and kills the picture. The story is a meaningless mess that does not pay off. Soon I got bored in 10 minutes, and then I suffered the rest of the first 40 minutes - hoping for the best - before I hit the chapter it stops to (gracefully) come to an end ... even it was not worth the effort. OZARK SAVAGE obviously tries to be too smart, raising his best sequences from EVIL DEAD 2 and MATRIX. As a result, there is very little in OZARK SAVAGE, which has not been done before, and even better. This film would be much more entertaining in the short term of 10-20 minutes, but as a characteristic, it only feels susceptible and forcible. Of course, there are no money in short trousers, so I completely understand the financial reasons I guess motivated them to stretch for 75+ minutes. Director Matt Steinauer shows a great promise and I wish him luck.
