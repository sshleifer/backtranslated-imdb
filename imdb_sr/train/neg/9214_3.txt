Many things become clear when you watch this movie: 1) The acting is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so-so, but the parent-child conflict is the soap-ish boundary. The other two boys are: excessively pouting a miracle of a child and your stereotyped self-infant-but-really-sensitive-inside blonde dreaming; 2) the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing; 3) Robbie's dreams and episodes are disturbing (played by Tom Hanks); 4) the inclusion of an initial love ballad is an unusual choice ("we are all special friends"); 5) strange lines and partial plots do not become better than terrible acting; and 5) this is a really bad movie. Expect to be disappointed - and probably disturbed.
