The main question I ask about this movie is how to record a musical for a cole porter and you only use 3 out of 15 songs! Merman and Lahr played leading roles on the Broadway, here they were replaced by weaker red skelton and lucille ball. changes in plans are abundant and entertainment is lost. SKIP IT.
