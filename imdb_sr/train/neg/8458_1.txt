I bought this movie last weekend at my local Film Gallery. It was a bui 2 get 2 free and I needed another one so I chose this one. A terrible mistake. The box says it would be a really good movie. Well, it starts like this great movie. About five minutes. The film is about a young woman, Laila, who was killed trying to save her beau, Jack, from the bull. Lailin Dad, Cordobes, is a rancher whose citizens are scared. He assumes that Jack killed Lail because he allegedly feared this bull, and goes to this hunt to find him. That was the first 5 minutes. What follows is only 100 times worse. Whoever wrote the script, in my opinion, had to be on some sour journey or something, because nothing else made any sense whatsoever it ever was. Jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio DJ named Mari who drives him. I think Mari was supposed to be the kind of Virgin Mary. You know, Jesus' mother. But, who knows, I could not make heads or tails. While running ... we see bad guys, magical visions, spooky encounters, flashbacks, etc. ... And all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts from trying to understand what's going on. Needless to say I returned the movie and replaced it for something else. It's terrible to tell you, horrible. And in this film there is absolutely no fight. Unless you count the first minute of the movie. I hope I helped some other people not to waste time on this movie.
