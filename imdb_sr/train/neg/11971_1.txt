Although film with Bruce Villis is always worth watching, you better skip this one. I watched this on television, so I did not have to spit on it. I'm happy. The operation is developing slowly, very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes are quite convincing, it's getting more and more unbelievably nearing completion. It is very questionable if an experienced soldier such as Lieutenant Waters fails to comply with direct orders. Even if he would, if he had the rest of his water. They know that it puts them in direct danger, and they know that they will surely die if they follow it, but what is it, he is our lieutenant, so let's do what he says (despite direct orders, remember). Still, there are some nice scenes in this movie. They somewhat rescued the village, where rebels massacred the entire population. Well, they saved a dozen villagers, the rest was already killed. Strange part, they took the trucks that the rebels left. They prefer walking on foot. Maybe because the roads are uncertain, but there was no explanation for that. Anyway. I think that's what made the movie one point I gave her. What made this film an insult to the brain, and it's totally unbelievable that a group of 7 soldiers can kill as many rebels as possible to be hurt or killed. Only in the end he loses a few comrades. And just because they have to fight with an army of almost 500 or more. Can you believe it? They fight against the army so many, kill hundreds of them, and lose only a few of them. And they have rounds and ammunition. Do not ever go away. Grenades and bunting mines, machine gun M60, and even RPG. Where do they get these things? Should I wear it or what? They even got a laptop that showed them the activity of hostile rebels. This laptop has a battery that lasts for days. Really? Who thinks this shit. I assume that if you completely turn off the brain and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots, you give this film a high score. If not, skip this. It saves you time.
