This movie seemed to be good at the beginning, but it was never in line with his expectations. The director is talented and has some good angles of camera and artistic ideas (typical for Asian directors), but does not know how to create or tell a good story to join her. The story was fragmented and it seemed to be taking place in all sorts of different directions through the film, it never found a solid, explanatory, interesting angle. Basically, the film never corresponds to the explanation of the press release. However, the acting was very good. All the actors had good performances, and Jude Lav was remarkable as always. Too bad he decided to make such a bad movie.
