My boyfriend and I rented this because we thought it could be a good 'Halloween' flight. A killer who is terrorizing young people, a white mask ... you get my enthusiasm. We were dead! It's not intentional. Not only have we discovered one of the worst movies, but it's also a cult classic! It is stuffed with holes and makes no sense. The actress who plays Maddy is beautiful, but that's all. I give credit for being recorded on VERY low budget - I always support movies like that. Just not this one. This movie can be good to see if you are drunk or tall; otherwise they do not bother. Unless you want to lose your privileges for a movie like me!
