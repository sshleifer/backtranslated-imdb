My comments on this film have been erased twice, which I find quite offensive, because I try to evaluate this film for other people. Please be tolerant to the opinions of other people. Obviously, writing in the spirit of Nietzsche's works was not understood, so my comment was completely changed. I think this is a really bad movie for several reasons. Topic: One should be very careful in making a movie about a philosopher who still does not understand the mass and brings passionate arguments among peers. One thing that philosophers agree on is that Nietzsche was a great thinker. Therefore, filming a film about his life, which obviously includes his 'ideas' is something with which he needs to be extremely careful, or preferably not at all. Wisdom begins with knowledge of what you do not know. One might think that this is not an overview of the film itself, but the film is not about an imaginary character, but about the life of someone who really lived and had a great influence on the world yesterday, today and tomorrow. If someone talks the story of tomatoes, I can express my thoughts about the story itself, but also about the chosen theme, tomato. There is a responsibility for producers when filming a movie about real facts. Especially in this case and this responsibility has not been taken. Scenario: One of the first things I've noticed are funny accents. Why? He discourages from what should be; Nietzsche and the truth he found. It does not help to put things in the right geographic perspective or time! Come on, make it English or better; German! Even Mel Gibson was given that part of the right ... by letting his characters pronounce nonsense in Aramaic in Pasay. Second, it behaves well. 3d, Assante is not an actor who would show Nietzsche. Bad Throwing. Fourth, the facts are far away. And so on. It's celluloid waste.
