This movie has been sold for one dollar in Val-Mart on DVD, so I do not feel like I've lost anything because of watching this movie, except my TIME. He enjoyed the role of Tom Hanks, (Robbie Vheeling), who was a very young look and gave an extraordinary performance as it was a horrible scenario. The story is about students who decided to play Mazes & Monsters, only in a very realistic environment. Robbie Vheeling had problems in the past playing this game in other colleges and recommended his parents to leave the game themselves and get a good score. Robbie meets a very good girlfriend and has a romantic game with her and when she starts playing, she stops making love to her and acts like a monk. There are some scenes in the film that run around the former World Trade Center, as well as on the viewing floor and in the roof area. It's very sad to watch this part of the movie where so many people have died from evil in the world. This is not a very good movie, except that Tom Hanks tried to keep the film above the level of entertainment.
