Beverly Garland was born at the wrong time. She was an actress ahead of her time, bringing power and grace even to such poor films as Corman's films in which she acted. In Gunslinger, she is the husband of a city sheriff. He retreats, so he takes up his job to persecute his killers. It is better than the material with which it works, away. The film is gray, stiff and mostly boring. There is (unintentional) humor with traces of rubber everywhere, people running behind a building to suddenly appear in front of the other (I heard about false fronts, but this is ridiculous!), And a truly stupid drawing of a new widow Sheriff fell in love with the guy whom he Hired to kill her. Even if she did not like her husband, it was only a week or two since he died! And finally, in the end, he kills the guy to death. No luck with men, this one. Zlikovac this piece is the other woman, the owner of the salon. She plans to buy a bunch of land only if the railway passes and makes it rich. Her plan of action, if not, is pretty lame - she will just steal from the city the way she can and escape. Damn it, it's just she and her hired gun in the end against the whole city. You tell me these people are not armed? See what happened in the right cities in the West when bank robbers came to rob a bank and then they were demolished by armed and dangerous city people. There are many pointless conversations and riding around, interwoven with several chromium outputs. The ending is as dark as usual with Corman's film, although thanksgiving to God lacks moral transformation at the end of the world. The sheriff turns the badge Sam Bass and goes into the sunset, although the film was so gray that you never saw the sun.
