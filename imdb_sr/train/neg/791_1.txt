Imagine a scene in which a bunch of scriptwriters sit at a table, and one says, "Let the black woman come to an unexpected public member (also black) on the street and ask him if she is black and go." Other writers fall hysterically until they are proposed to repeat it in each episode. More laughter. Now, if you think the premise is ridiculous and the show contains many such situations, you will enjoy this show. For the rest, use your zapper and find something more fun such as looking at dry colors. Those who have written great reports on this show should be extracted or forced to watch television comedies that are really funny. Another example of humor in the show, the girl tries to escape from paying to the supermarket cashier trying to hypnotize the cashier. Marginalli is funny for the first time, but why repeat it again and again in various shows with different cashiers? I could cite other examples, but this could be treated as spoilers, revealing why this comedy is not ridiculous at all.
