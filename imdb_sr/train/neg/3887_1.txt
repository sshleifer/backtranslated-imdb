I managed to get an insight into this with the help of MST3K, and the boy, even with rifing, this movie was terribly bad. Imagine someone whose competence with a camera can be done by a monkey. The most significant (a bit of what was) came from the special effects that were "OK". The biggest part was "OK"; although nothing special, was better than other B-films I saw in the past. The rest of this movie is bad, cameras work often seems to have just set up a man with a camera on the rollers and pushed it. The story (if you can call it) is so full of holes that it's almost funny, it never explains why it's been alive, or it takes human flesh to survive. The script is poorly written and the dialogue is dumb on the plane itself. The peak of the film (if one has it) is absolutely ridiculous. If you can not find the MST3K version, avoid it at all costs.
