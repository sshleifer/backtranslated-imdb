After I looked around half the film, I noticed something strange ... I found myself changing TV channels constantly to see what's still going on - it's not a good movie feature. This film is listed as in some genres, and I have to say that it has mostly collapsed in each of them. 80% through the movie I switched to watch the old replay. All in all - the whole film felt as if those who made it did not know what to do and ended up in a fiction without obvious taste.
