This is a movie that everyone should be confused about. Poor director, above acting and plot that deals with no purpose other than showing violence. I thought that when I first saw that it might be a satire of the media and how it shows violence, it is not. I'm not sure what makes the movie worse. Oliver Stone is the worst director ever. From the scenes in which the face of Voody Harrelson is transformed without a play or a horrible performance by Robert Dovey Jr. such as Vaine Gale, who is a reporter who looks totally sweet, this movie is simply a mess.
