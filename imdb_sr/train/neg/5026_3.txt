Flame, flame. It seems that Gammer is in the shortest form, a prehistoric creature that can take it and empty it with the same abandonment. I'm not a fan of Japanese monster movies, but I'm finished dedicating myself to watching all the films on fifty movie DVDs from the Sci-Fi collection by Mill Creek / Treeline Films. It's a huge value of about twenty-five dollars, so that for fifty cents per film it really comes down to an investment in time to look at some of the stupid bids. Gammer has been shaken from a long-sleeved nuclear explosion, and he is not happy. Like Godzilla, he takes him out of Tokyo, prompting the United Nations to try to devise a plan to save the planet. They arrive at 'Plan Z', the hopes of the world, and would you not know that, there is a scene in which a huge shed is called Z Z Plan? it was a nice touch. By the mid-1960s, this country was still not quite politically correct. One of the US military scenes in the Alaska Air Defense Department, General Arnold, asked a female sergeant to make a coffee. I suppose there were no circumstances. Good old Gamer was pretty obvious, walking around on two legs and going to the flame throwing routine when challenged. So I was surprised that Plan Z managed to capture a man with a turtle in the cone of a hidden space ship, taking him to Mars to save the world. High flying for the American and Russian team who have made savings, now we return to the Cold War. Like Godzilla, Gammer has produced at least a good dozen movies, but after seeing this much satisfies my interest in flying, flaming turtles. Especially after the DVD package I mentioned earlier had an "Attack of the Monsters" with a guest performance by Big G. It took everything I had to get to the end of both films; there was such a relief to reach the final framework in the one that said 'Gamer, Saionar!'
