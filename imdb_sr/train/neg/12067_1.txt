You know that the movie will not go well when John Carradine's story (aka reads the script and the synopsis of the action) about the funeral procession of his character, only 5 minutes in the movie. Narration is the last will and testament of his character. It is envisaged that his property be divided between his four children and officers. Children will share $ 136 million equally, but if somebody needs to die then that part is divided among the remains. If all the children died, then it would be divided among the servants. To be similar, they must live in a family estate for a week. Sounds like a typical plot of a real show. There is little subtext about the nature of the dean. They are a powerful and seriously dysfunctional family, but the real problem starts with the drowning of that dog. From the opening of John Carradine's voice, it is expected that this film will lead to Machiavellian cat and mouse with a tweet ending. This journey is painfully slow and meaningless. We go through a few minutes of watching people sitting around, playing a pool, shooting arrows, misusing a picture through a fish-glass, dramatic conversations between a silk tie that carries men, constant arguing, congested circus music, bizarre flashbacks that resemble fauk-German expressionism, horror aesthetics of the fourth grade and a bunch of dramatic exaggeration. All this inevitably leads to the expected and honest ending. You will be glad to still be alive, but pain can be too big to be worn on your own. Share the children, share with them.
