I can not understand everything about this movie. All right, if you like cheap spraying, you love this movie, but if you love good stories and good actors - do not look at this. Personally, I really liked the actors in this movie, it seems they were rented straight from the street. Dialogues are completely flat and you always know what follows. The overall quality of this film lacks an assumed very small budget. When we saw this film (I and three others), we all had in mind that this film was made by some people who needed it, just to get a degree in a film school - with the least effort. Another question that really diminishes the whole experience is a bad camera (very shaky) and a bad sound, the entire movie seems to be recorded with one microphone.
