I doubt the motive of the creators of this fictitious display of the BTK motive motive. Are they trying to portray animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who's responsible for this? Do not they think that the people involved in this monster are sufficiently vulnerable? What an open disregard and exploitation of the victims! It was like an experiment of personality: What is more disturbing to you, slaughterhouse or human murder? They used the names of some of the victims ... this film was horrible, disrespect and insult! The creators of this film have used this tragedy for their agenda! People have to wake up and re-draw the line!
