The director, equipped with chains and leather, warned the audience at the SF Frameline Film Festival on Friday night that we will see an "experiential" movie. Experimental? Leave the video camera in the rear seat of the car, let the tape roll and arrange in all meaningless paths in mind. A meandering shepherd travelogue manic, which does not start anywhere and does not attract audiences. The unscrupulous violence that opens the film has led more than one patron of the Castro Theater. I would also go, but my cinema buddy needed a ride home and had the thing to see even the worst to the end. By the time the lights came in, the audience decreased considerably. Nice applause. Pro form of the questions of directors who were satisfied with the product. Avoid this film!
