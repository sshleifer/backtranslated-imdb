The falsely accused, John Vaine's friends (like John Scott) and Eddie Chandler (like Kansas Charlie) change their identities to become "Alias ​​Smith and Jones". G. Vaine becomes "John Jones". G. Chandler should be "Rev Smith", but Vaine calls him "Dr. Smith." At no point, none of them is fun such as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris, or Ben Murphy; Although Vaine can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them, the career is wise. The beautiful blonde Maria Kornman (like Anne), who grew up from her days in Our Gang, has a great interest in Vejna. She and Chandler have a couple of sweet scenes with Vaine. If you are not a fan of low-budget films by John Wayne of the 1930s, this film will not make you one.
