This 30-minute documentary that Bunuel made in the early thirties of one of the poorest Spanish regions is, in my opinion, one of his worst films. First, let's admit that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say it, I fully acknowledge that wealth can bring its own problems, such as excessive individualism and consumerism, although everything is far better state rather than showing extreme poverty here). And if poverty in Spain dropped, this was not exactly the kind of socialism Bunuel favored, but with the capitalism of the West European style. But one of the most shocking things in the film is this: in one scene, the narrator hides that the pupils learn about the value of Pi. Teaching Mathematics for Poor People, Horror! Bunuel's short-sightedness is here most prominent, not realizing that access to the latest knowledge and technology is what will help the poor to overcome their situation. What do you suggest? That children learn exactly what in school? Does not Bunuel realize that the lack of modern technology has made them poor compared to other people?
