The obvious b-grade effort to cash in on the Hostel / All Buzz, my expectations for this movie are low (really low!), But he managed to disappoint at every level. The acting is so bad that it is not even ridiculous, the line of complications is nonexistent, and the only fear was the realization that I lost 1 hour and 21 minutes watching it! I'm surprised when I noticed that 34 people received a grade of 10 stars. I can only doubt that 33 of them are Cast and Crev. 34. maybe it's the mother of the director? - although I'm sure it's even hard for her to leave more than 2! DVD accessories include an hour of "making". Which leads to the question: "Why?" (although it may serve to show what does not work!). Avoid at all costs.
