So, what can you say about the adaptation of Barbara Cartland? There are some incredible actors in it (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer), but they obviously make money. Lisette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert appeared in two other Cartland episodes - Anthony with Hugh Grant (which looks rather embarrassing) and Gilbert with Helen Bonham Carter. If you really want to see Cartland's adaptation, Bonham Carter is one to be addressed ("Hazard of Hearts" - what a title!) Gilbert has a weak link in it, but Bonham Carter it is adequately beautiful and of course it can work, and the rest of the actors play it on a handle with tongues firmly in the face (Edward Fox and Diana Rigg)
