This is the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen several movies. It is transmitted as an artistic film, but it's actually a piece of garbage. It's a quality dance, but it can not make up for the disgustingly obvious recognition of Salli Potter. The action of this movie does not exist, and I assure you that you will begin to laugh at the end. Especially where it starts to sing. It's absolutely unrealistic.
