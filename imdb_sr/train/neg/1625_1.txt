When I was at school I made a film about a couple walking around the trees and talking, and I realized halfway that I had edited it as not only a bad aesthetic strategy but a clich√© of Canadian film: the soaked lyricality of a married woman for empty, metaphors-loaded stitches on social comments. But regardless of the flaws of my film, I feel much better after I see this ... this ... thing. First, mine worked for 20 minutes, not 85, and he had more satisfaction in it: every absurd part of the work here comes back in four, five, six merciless minutes. The male trail is incredible, the pounding of the voice, the loud reptile that is being given out of the improvements of the drama class between philosophical insights from U Pub, and he has a lot of room to hate us. If, however, he was not such a hole, then the third rank would have made even less sense, as a couple of sarcas of types appeared to provide distant and utterly useless reverberations of 'exploitative' values; but this does not make it easy to look in the cage, "please," in close-ups until the newspaper is empty. I withdraw what I said about AUTUMN GODS, which at least had the courage of my own mischief: this film crater is and will remain the worst Canadian film of all time. At least I really hope.
