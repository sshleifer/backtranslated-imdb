TiVo did it for Angelina Jolie. He had 2.5 stars. It looked promising. Quickly started downhill. It is much too much, even from Angelina. He is about 20 years old and plays at age 16. There are three signs that should be Italian. All the others are Italian-American. Italian accents were good, I thought. A young man is sweet, my wife says. Everybody else in this movie is a fat Italian. Even men. I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was dumped as an early doctor, it was a bad sign. The two couples who chase their children are like the four Italian Stooges. My wife would not let her go remotely. I hope she did not take makeup, clothes or decorative tips. It was a sick and distorted combination of disgusting and evil. It was hidden. The cutting of my left ventricle was not enough to distract the pain of watching this movie. If this movie appears on your TV, do yourself a favor and instead head your head through the TV screen. You'll be glad you did it. The only movie I ever saw was worse than this "Hamburger: The Movie". Or maybe "Deadli Friend".
