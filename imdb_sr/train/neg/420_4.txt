For those who want to see this movie? I would say: Go! Without narration can be a very good movie / documentary. But music, narration and some of the implemented stories make it very difficult to watch a skeptical person like me. After several animals, their life in several seasons gets the feeling that it is an animal soap that we watch. But the melodramatic view simply does not shave it, unless the predator finally seizes the booty (one exception remains there), the camera zoomed in or switched to another scene. I wonder why this is happening, if they show reality, why cut off scenes that remain a melodrama fairy tale? I think it was important for the mass of the crowd, because in the end, it would be a waste of destruction of this beautiful planet.
