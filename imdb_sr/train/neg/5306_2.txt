OK, I'm blessed. I've seen two very strong stage productions, one in New York with an original acting show, and the other in San Diego Rep (Rosina Reinolds and Monikue Gaffnei, you rock!). Compared to any of these films, the film is almost invisible. I passed two DVDs in the past two nights and I have not finished yet. Too much unnecessary dialogue, and too many added scenes and people. Yes, the four main performances are pretty good, especially. Ms. Streep's. But the comparison of the film phase is definitely an example of "less is more". The dulling of the performance in order to satisfy the audience's need for scenic diversity and specificity was a bad choice. Please, please, go find the theater production somewhere near you.
