It starts on a beautiful note only to quickly stop and lower the expectations. Mac (Akshai Kumar) and Sam (John Abraham) characters were not properly built before Mac's boss decided to capture him with three aviokomande. The rest of the drama is about Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Raval) dealing with situations that sometimes seem to be forced. About actors, Paresh Raval is a very talented actor, I thought he was lost in the role of a weird chef. Akshai Kumar is tolerable, John Abraham is very bad, he constantly stumbles on furniture, and Rajpal Yadav is the only rescue grace in the movie. The other half of the movie is sometimes ridiculous, but in all DUDs (the songs are boring) and a great downhill if you are hoping for a healthy party and comedy.
