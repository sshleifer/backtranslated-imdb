I know that slashers should always be bad, but come on, what the hell is that, it's like a bunch of 10-year-olds have prepared lunch money and started recording until the end of their week. In any case, six young people all go to the same house to be killed from the screen. We have a smart, slut, another whore, a blacksmith, a killer, stereotypes like that. while the others are shaking from some guy wearing a mask, people in a poor box are denied. There is a pretty decent murder somewhere in the middle, but then he returns to even more boredom, and especially more fake fears. we actually know that it can not be a killer when a person is attacked, because the guy who loves to take his sweet time for everyone. After each character you expect to die dying, the standard ugly blond and her boyfriend who will soon become a boy will eventually be caught by the killer (they become like, pushed, then fainted) and the killer is revealing. I think the writers of this film just took a tie and pencil and put it somewhere in the list of characters. The motive is only chrome and it did not even trigger me on the damn mystery. it's too much time to explain everything (and then another ten minutes more in which he cuts his arm for some reason) and eventually a guy with a pistol gets caught. Hey, no fair! Really one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. I could enjoy even more watching Lindsay Lohan-movie, I swear. I'm sure, most of the 80's slashers were sucked, but at least they were thrown into a movie T & A. There's nothing for it.
