This is a film that tries to convince the Thai history, set in the ancient city of Aiutthaia. I decided to watch this movie because I thought it was in line with many Thai films I watched and enjoyed, one with Thai actors who speak Thai and madness of martial arts. Well, that's none of this. This film was shot entirely in English, full of Anglo actors and has productive values ​​so terrible that it's funny bad .... but it's not funny! Who can we blame for this trash? The acting, dialogue and most of the sets were pretty bad. Some of the fighting scenes looked like they were choreographed by the local high school drama club. Special effects were also generally poor, but few were just a cheap animation pierced on the screen, which gave a special effect. It has one big, epic scene in the open, where several thousands of accessories run across the field in costume, but when we see that two armies are fighting in the battle - HA! What a joke! The movie has some beauty. Too bad they did not show a little more skin. At least that would be something the lads would appreciate. Do not bother.
