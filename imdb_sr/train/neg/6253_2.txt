It's not a very good movie, but according to information, it's pretty accurate in showing torture techniques. The purpose of the film was to show the brutality of camps for prisoners of war, and this is effective enough, with surprising sincerity at that time. Whatever technical defects exist (and there are plenty of them) by looking at this, you will see the forgotten corner of the forgotten war and some pretty nasty things - again, nasty because it is north of the DMZ, and not in the Guantanamo Bay. > I do not think any Korean veteran has reported torture when running for office, and if you watch movies like this one and Pork Chop Hill in comparison with Vietnam films. I do not know if people in '54 were trapped in the concepts of the Second World War (guys have a lot of things) or war or what, but it's interesting to see that from the same system that will be 16 years later making movies like "Go Tell The Spartans ".
