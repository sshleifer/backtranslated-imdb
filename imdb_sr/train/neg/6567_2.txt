I went to this film hoping for the best. I usually love musicals from the war. Dick Povell and Lucille Ball have done good jobs with their roles; however, the writers gave them a boring dialogue. The love interest between them did not get any real growth; Suddenly it was there. I did not think much about music; The best number was a clip that we heard about Spike Jones with the "Fuhrer's face". One complete number that Spike Jones had little of his great musical comedy; pretty pitiful things, even with a monkey. Berta Lahr's comedy was infinite. There was a chance to enjoy: Lucille Ball was pretty handy, and there was a good selection of players who earned more time on the screen.
