From the terrible scenes of death to the gun that falls without making the sounds of a character called Fiend. It's all tiring, slow moving, not very imaginative. It was okay to see a guy with a cloak and a hunchback lurking around. It was visually creepy and probably occupied the viewer of that time, but even in 1936 it might have been thought that there would be little more imagination and credibility even for such a film. I just waited for something to happen of any importance, because people stood and held speeches and acted as if posing at an office picnic. And there are those targets, as the previous commentator mentioned. Perhaps the best trail was to look for water on someone's pocket.
