Joel Schumaker manages the scenario he wrote and wrote a group of citizens of Georgetown who are confronted with adult life situations. The story is a mess, but some scenes are really good. There's a lot of lost talent and time here. Actors are more impressive than film. Demi Moore, Rob Love, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Alli Sheedi and Mare Vinningham are presented. The most prominent are McCarthy and Moore. Love is pretty disgusting. Lifetime is not so damn easy.
