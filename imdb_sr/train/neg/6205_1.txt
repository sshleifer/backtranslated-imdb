That's how violence has flashed and it's labeled sick. Well, violence is the best I'm afraid of, but unfortunately the characters are not sufficiently developed to allow us to understand why they continue (completely predictable) rage. This film has a really horrible scenario. We never have a chance to meet Robert, and his actions are ultimately pathetic. The acting is not much better, the worst of them being a TV chef and a schoolteacher. The direction is awkward, enough pace to send you to sleep. And what, for God's sake, is a school film project? Perhaps a comment on the film itself? The use of movie magazines during a climatic murder is ridiculous. These guys obviously think they are intellectuals, but they hopelessly get out of their depths. How, for God's sake, I got great Iorgos Arvanitis to infuse him, I will never know. And how they got the money to make it, it's even more mystery. Absolutely terrible.
