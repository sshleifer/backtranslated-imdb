Stereotyping sending slasher flicks falls as far as the supposed fun. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby, and in fact, the entire acting is completely lost. Lame jokes are abundant, and each line is well telegraphed. Stupid liners come at a fast pace, and almost each of them falls as a crushed grapes. Music numbers only contribute to the boredom that appears and lags behind the whole movie. Another negative claustrophobic position is completely within the walls of abandoned high school. Avoid this and look for one of the "Lampoon's" truly funny films like "National Lampoon's Golddiggers" - MERK
