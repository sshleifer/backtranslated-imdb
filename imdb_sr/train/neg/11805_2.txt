Look at the Original with the same title from 1944! This is made for a TV movie, it's just terrible! Although it uses (as far as I know) almost the same dialogue, it simply does not work! Is it acting, a poor director? Okay, so it's made for TV, but why watch a bad copy when you can get your original original? Especially because you will be hacked into a plot and you will not enjoy the original as much as you watched it first! There are several things that differ from the original (once shorter), but they are all up! Actors who play parts here just do not match the bill! You just do not believe them and who can do Edward G. Robinson in the original way? If you like, just watch after you've seen the original, and even then you will be very brave if you watch it! It's almost sacrilege!
