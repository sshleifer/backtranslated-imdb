If you want to get a good Jason Scott Lee movie, I recommend the following: Dragon: The story of Bruce Leeu Rapa Nui Timecop 2: Decision about Berlin "is a horrible movie. Horrible production values. Terrible acting. Avful script. I would not recommend that this film be watched by one who seriously believes that this joke is a quality party or advances in American American consciousness in Hollywood. (This movie does nothing.) let's say this movie is a passing rainy party in the rainy day if you ever come across it while surfing the channels. If you are curious, maybe rent from Netflik, but this movie is definitely not for storage. If you are one of the few people who watched this movie as a means of raising your Asian American film consciousness, and disappointed, then I recommend the following films for your personal viewing. These are well written films with high production values ​​with talented actors from American American actors: Better tomorrow tomorrow Mulan
