I bought this DVD because it has a curse in it and mpaa rating; "Rated R for violent violence and sexuality, nudity and language". Which correctly, IMO, should indicate; "Rated R for violent violence, sexuality, nudity and language". The word "sexuality" should come after a "notch" and not "and" because of the huge difference in meaning. I think that many people who watched this movie would agree with me that parts of sexuality and nudity are ALMOST non-existent. My first impression when I look at the mpaa rating is that I will watch something like a "live" movie. That's why I felt cheated. the story was so-after all that was really interested in the story, if there was a wonderful curse in it. I know I do not know. Of course, this is just my opinion
