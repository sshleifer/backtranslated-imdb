Do not misunderstand me, I adore actions and revenge, I have seen many of them since childhood, including the latest Dolph Lundgren "The Mechanik", which is pretty good. And Tony Scott certainly knows how to use the camera, and can even be ingenious filming and editing movies. But with the "Man on Fire" (and even more with "Domino"), Scott shows that instead of intelligently using his "ingenious" filming skills, he uses it senselessly to show and compensate for the lack substance that the material does not offer. "The man from the fire" is about 2 hours and a half when it was supposed to be at least an hour less. The way Scott has shot and edited this movie, it seems that you are wondering if he really wants you (watching his movie because his constant camera is running and the flash is really annoying for the eye and makes you want to leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes. Sometimes the MPAA and the studio have dubious views on ratings, violence and the creation of PG-13 movies, but I also suspect that the $ 70 million movie is made from scenario B -film with a guy who cuts his fingers, puts a bomb in a man's ass and blows his hand with a rifle, all to revenge the death of dev jƒçice which is not even dead! Go then why studio will pass a better scenario for language or violence ... That said ...
