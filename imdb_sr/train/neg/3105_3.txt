I can not believe that someone can make a comedy about a matter like homelessness. Of course, Brooks did not make a comedy about _real_ homeless people. There is no mention of drugs, prostitution or violence in these streets. The people we encounter in this movie are homeless in the land of fantasy, so the only difference between them and us is that they do not eat so often. Brooks films have become worse and worse over the years. This is just another nail in the suitcase.
