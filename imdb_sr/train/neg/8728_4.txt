This is bad. A really bad and boring movie about crime that does not have anything unusual in it. A series of crimes, a killer you do not see throughout the film, a classic investigation. And also a classic story about a policeman who reveals what is happening and does not trust anyone, so he has to fight himself to discover the truth. Not too much in this. Vote: 4 out of 10
