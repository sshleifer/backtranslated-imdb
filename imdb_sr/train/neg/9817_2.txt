Wow ... sheer brilliance. Convert the thriller / uncertainty / horror in comedy. After I watched this, I never laughed so much in a horror movie ... a funny 3-character plot that was just crazy-or not written deep or too deep. If you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialogue, messy plot, useless scenes, futile characters, bad sound and bad development as a whole, then this is one for watching. Be sure to focus on the classic "food processor" scene and the completely incompetent police scene. /> This is an extraordinary new low performance screen and writing, and sitting through it for the entire duration makes you stupid, bold or brave.
