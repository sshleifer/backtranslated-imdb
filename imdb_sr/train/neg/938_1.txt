Perhaps I will not be the one who will review this film because after 45 minutes of pure boredom and stupidity I turned the channel. The original series lasted only 2 years, which can be said for the career of Adama Vesta and Burt Varda. Put these two "actors" into a stupid movie and the result is twice as bad.
