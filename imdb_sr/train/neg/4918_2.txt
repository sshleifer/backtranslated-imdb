The rich Harvard falls on the poor Radcliffe chick to the astonishment of his strict father (Rai Milland). Syrups, sweet, and most of all, a beautiful story of the 'class' fight when richer Ryan O'Neal brings home librarians for his snobby parents to mock. But MacGrav is socially devastated with dirty mouths while John Marley plays his pious Catholic father, but no one in the film is more boring than O'Neal himself with his squealing portrait as Harvard champion iuppie. > Next 8 (!) Year after 'Oliver's Story'.
