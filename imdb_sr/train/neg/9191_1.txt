Well, I had to sit down for a computer and write down the review right after watching this puddle of sludge. Why? Because I need to inform you how bad this movie is. It's incredibly bad. Just to get to know you how bad it is, I will offer you this little detail about the movie. During the scene of criminals, which usually consist of people who shoot or hit zombies, they cut scenes from the video game. Yes, you've heard me well. This movie is really shit. Actually, it seems to me to think about the fact that these days it costs ten dollars just to get into theaters these days. And see this kind of corn crap? There is no story to talk about, and the movie basically has nothing to offer except occasional sucks and really cheap killings. I'm really disappointed with this, knowing that I watched it. OK, I'm stunned. It's so bad that I can not even find words. RATING: ZERO out of *****.
