.... it might seem incredible ... but there really was a real life story ... about a man who had an affair with a woman who found out where he and his new wife were staying, and killed a woman, seems to look as rape murder ... In her delusion, she told everyone that a man had asked her to marry him ... so she left the job in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota .......... Last I heard that she was in a mental institution, in the Security Prison ... She was still wearing "engagement ring". which she bought for herself ... and told everyone she had bought for her. Events happened in a small town in Visconsin ,,,,, and there was a murder in Minnesota ...... In the magazine "People" even it was and the story ... Spring 1988, I want to say on page 39. I remember that as I was at college at that time, and my colleague met a person at the hospital of safety.
