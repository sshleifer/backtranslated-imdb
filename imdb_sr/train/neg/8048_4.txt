Suppose you were on an abandoned island for the last ten years. I did not hear about Scream and went when Halloween part 1 went into the movies. Then this film would be an explosion and a completely new vision on the horror scene. Currently it is rated 2.7 on the IMDb and it does not deserve such a low estimate. Breaking up all the way, like "I know what you did," and whoever it was that eventually convinced me of who and why. It's not a big surprise, just a nice shot to watch with a wheel, popping and without a blade to get heavy complications, deep characters. If he saw a rental outside of the top, you can take it without risk, but do not expect a mastervor. I saw much worse.
