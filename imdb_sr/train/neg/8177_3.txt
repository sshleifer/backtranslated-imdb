90 minutes from Mindy ... Mindy teases boyfriend Bill ... Mindi prances in high school dance ... Mindi goes to Big Sura, buys bread of "Shepherd's bread", Mindi almost rape ... Ah, the satisfaction of Crovn International . You have to remember that these films have never been designed to be watched starting to end on DVD players. They were made as a 90-minute ambient, so teens from the 70s will have a soundtrack as they get it in their Pints ​​and quotes. The lack of pacing and structure were not important to the original audience - they probably only set up when the T & A on the screen responded to what they did on the parking lot. The film is really irritating when viewed as a story. It's much more fun to talk about it than to watch. My favorite things: 1) Bill and his friend follow the teacher to find Mindi. Without luggage or changing lingerie, spend 2 nights in a motel room with a teacher, like in real life. 2) After being kidnapped and nearly raped by spoiled cyclists, and after their innocent friend Pan is wildly beaten, Mindi and her girlfriend find a motorcycle without supervision on the road. Mindi immediately shone and shouted: "I'm going to Big Sur !!" But again, it is much more fun to talk / read about it than to sit.
