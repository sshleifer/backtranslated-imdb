Mr. VanHook took a good idea and kicked off like a football. Unfortunately, this did not achieve the goal. The historical object of the giant is good, but pour the milk and end up with a huge car cheese. I say, take this wheel and take it off the cliff. I could not even watch the whole movie. That's a lot of talk because I rarely leave any movie. I always like to give them a chance for the last time. It's impossible to use something so badly. Well, at least the acting was good ... NO! The only thing that "falls" in this movie is rating. 1/10 and sink into negative numbers!
