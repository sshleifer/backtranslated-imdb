Yes, stupid! I'm just ending watching and I still have a bad taste in my mouth. Too many colors, too many unnecessary "supplements" of stories, too stupid characters (I suppose they wanted to achieve comical relief, but I just wanted to cry) ... too much. It's a shame to spoil one of the divine stories from the "Arab Nights" like this. Childish, naive (and in a bad way) and with lots of magical mistakes, I think this can not keep a five-year-old child for more than ten minutes. The princess is beautiful, but she should be rude, because the actress does not know how to play the role. The rest of the actors are worse ... our "bad guy" is really bad. It's a shame that "good guy" is not better. The only light in this darkness is, of course, David Carradine, who unfortunately goes deep under his level with this, but at least keeps his acting / "combat" skills at the top. I'm still sorry to see him in this kind of thing, but I'm glad I have something to watch in the whole school, so thank David. Only, ONLY, for him, I give two stars to this fiasco ... I would give him more, but that would bring the final result to the whole movie. The rest is so bad that I might like to rate it, but there is no class lover then here and I think it would be too much.
