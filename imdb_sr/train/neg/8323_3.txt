From the very beginning this film had several drawbacks. The main character of Haiden Christensen is the rich young mogul who inherited the great wealth and power of his father, and he is struggling to fulfill his father's shoes and slit male mothers (and su-executive) too firm. He also has a heart disease problem and is waiting for a limb that is a donor organ registry. There are also lesser stories that your first instinct largely ignored that become important later, such as his friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his romance with a middle-class girl (Jessica Alba). Untold stories, but it's not bad enough to destroy the movie. The only real "oi vei!" a moment was the name of Lena Olin. Women named Lilith ... subtle! Surgical scans are not censored at all. I appreciate it, people who think the scene operations are scary. The horror of awakening during anesthesia was initially well done. You look in an emotional agony while Christensen screams from inside through a breast cut and a scatterer of ribs. The moment of irony from the trailer comes when he is one of the unhappy who will wake up during anesthesia, but he is also fortunate to help him find out that his surgical team plans to kill him. The big bandage, however, is very predictable and sends the film into a conspiracy and his memory of the small signs that were there, but he, as we did, initially missed. There are two more turns in the end that include his relationship with his mother. One of them is Olin's impressive gesture, which due to bad writing is very impressive. The other is the secret of a family history that seemed very ruthless and meaningless. The original drama of anesthesia is lost in a badly written drama of conspiracy. There is one last attempt to get it back, which falls flat, taking the whole movie with it.
