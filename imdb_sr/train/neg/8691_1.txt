If there was a ZERO rating, I would give it to this movie. Today, I tried to watch it the second time, and I could not get it from start to finish. I can not believe that more stars are given by others and that I can only assume that either they know actors or they are a disguised publicist! The act is cruel everywhere, the scenario is bland, the kid playing Nichole shows zero emotion even when it is endangered. The "South" accent of the actress who plays Amber's mom is ridiculous - I am from Georgia and I have friends from Texas - believe me NOTHING does not say so! None of her emotions seemed real in any scene. The subject is very serious and deserves much better treatment.
