What?!?? Why do people say it's "a mind blowing"? Face the end of the worst ending in the history of cinema! 4 The left and the whole world is over! Not to mention figure 9 was an idiot all the time he killed everything. I was right all the time, if he sacrificed 9 then that would have happened. People who live there live for a stupid thing and for what? I admit that the film had its parts, and the whole concept was fascinating. But there were plenty of clich√©s one by one. And has anyone else got the feeling that this is much like "The Lord of the Rings?" The characters died for stupid reasons, there was almost no character development, and frankly wonder if it's good to have only four guys in the world; its meaningless and stupid. It was one of the shortest films I've ever seen, and thank God! How robots in any way turn against people creatively! It's done as many times as it is! This movie is really dumb, watch a movie worth watching, such as Star Trek, Hangover or Inglorious Basterds, these were good movies!
