Want to watch a horrifying horror movie? Then hold on from this. There is not enough beer in the world to make this film enjoyable. However, there is enough whiskey. One malt, if you can manage it. If previous comments were not enough to keep you from watching the movie sober, let me help you. NASA sends one man and two unpaid spacecraft into orbit Saturn. A really big solar torch provokes Colonel Steve West to bleed from his nose. From there things go downhill and there is a vackiness. I actually read the book adaptation, which was published and published only in the UK. MILES was better than film, and the book was terrible. At least something turns into uncertainty, and some sort of explanation of the event is drawn from the author (rhymes with 'gas'). Not to say that the film is completely without merit. Rick Baker has learned that he really needs to read the contract before it gets in the movie, and Jonathan Demme has discovered that he is much better adapted to directing him. Of course, it's pretty well arranged. Without the obligatory blinking of the breasts, even the healing power of whiskey can not save you. See Space Covbois if you feel the need to see the astronauts. I can not, with my conscience, recommend this film to a sober film audience.
