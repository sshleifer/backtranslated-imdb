Just kidding! This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! However, it was so bad that it was hilarious. My friend and I intentionally rent it because it looked so bad. Rough old horor flicks are always good for some laughter. Pitch, some of the voices were calling, the quality was terrible. But I must have watched him!
