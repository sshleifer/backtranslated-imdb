In Asia, they have sex with watermelons. Okay. First, I suspected it, but after I saw the cloud, I changed my mind and in the end I was convinced that they had sex with watermelons, with people dead or alive. There is no safe sex of course. (terribly ugly), the leading man shoots him into the lady's mouth after he has made a dead lady. Have you never heard of HIV? I guess not. The rest of this film is mostly boring, but incredibly disgusting. in fact, in parts it became so disgusting that I could not take off my virgin eyes. sex with dead people! how rough is that? and what is the message behind all this? we need water, we need melon, we have to be dead to have sex? Sorry, but this stinks!
