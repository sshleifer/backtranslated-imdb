I just saw this movie tonight and I must say it's a mess. I love Vince Vaughn, but he's ending even more boring and funny here and the movie is more than a remake of the stealing classic of the 80's "Santa in the movie," but without a camp or a bad song Sheena Easton in the end. The story is about your running black sheep in a family that returns to face their family for holidays, but with the North Pole as its environment. Of course, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is a fucking family that comes back home after a series of sets that include his girlfriend (Rachel Veisz in the Kamberian role) throwing him away, so he comes home to confront his parents and his more successful brother Santa. Claus (Paul Giamatti) and the wacky tall leader are following a little rival brotherhood and a little anarchy that threatens all Christmas. If you think you know the end of the movie, I think you're right, because it's possible for the hill. As for the acting, Vince Vaughn plays the same dear loser he always plays, but this time ends more boring than cute, Miranda Richardson plays Ms. Claus, but the role is more than one note, Elizabeth Banks plays Santa Assistant, but she's not many characters except neurotic jokes and poor Kevin Spacey basically plays the same person he plays in Glengarri Glen Ross, but a bit more anal. The only two actors who came out of this film with their dignity are untouched by Paul Giamatti, who brings genuine honesty and warmth to his role as Santa Claus, but it looks rather embarrassing to be in the movie and you can not blame him and Rachel Veisz, who manages to do a lot more with a very small role than most of the main actors do with her, which is a disadvantage because both Rachel Veisz and Paul Giamatti earned much better than what this scenario gave them. In short, a big disappointment.
