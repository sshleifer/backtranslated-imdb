Drew Barrimore plays the young Holi Gooding, who moves with an ambitious hacker scriptwriter Patrick Highsmith (George Nevbern) and totally impedes his life by claiming that her "duplicate", or an evil twin, is ready to kill her and her family. This stupid horror movie is hard to grasp seriously, even if it seems that filmmakers and actors themselves are dead serious. "Doppelganger" is confused, with an unpleasant stupid dialogue. Some viewers will notice that the name of the Devil's character was extracted from the role of Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffani's", and that the name of Nevbern's character is played in the name of the famous author Patricia Highsmith (he actually trying to re-write "Breakfast" as a horror movie, believe it or not!). I assume he deserves credit for not being entirely your typical horror film - I mean, writer / director Avi Nessher seems to really care about his characters, and gives the movie much more complicated than the standard slasher tariff. After stupid criminals - explains-all-it-confrontation of viewers, the film continues to bear the filthy climax that must be seen to be believed. This film certainly does not stutter up. But hey! An old man kills his mother in this. No, I'm not kidding. Jaid Barrimore appears close to the beginning only to violently slaughter. The Drev is always very visible and very sexy in this. Nevbern appears as a nice, "good" type. But the highlight of the film must be a scene with Salli Kellerman, an attractive veteran who is very professional in her own scene as a former nun who launched a business with telephone sex (!!!!!!). <br /> <br The movie is basically garbage, but pretty fun on the sleeves, a slim level. 4/10
