Although in some aspects the Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some narrative style, the Gabriela Muccino project is quite central. The film becomes more and more supple and manipulative as it moves towards the end: the heart is human and emotional, the eyes of the physical and metaphorical. Seven pounds is more amateur imitation Amore Perros Alehandro Gonzalez Inarrito and 21 grams, with lots and lots of flashback. The problem is that the story is pretty predictable from VRLO easily through the film. That's bad, because the Seven Pounds could be authentically "good" that Ben and Emily were placed in the right hand.
