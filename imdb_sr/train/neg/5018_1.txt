I rented this film only to see Amber Benson, although after reading the box I thought it sounded like a good story ... the first problem was that there was really no story ... or there was actually a story. but it did not make any sense. The other problem is that there was no setup for these characters ... that I got that they all went to school, but in the first 3 minutes of the film you realized that they have nothing in common and that they do not like it. ... so why were they constantly hanging out? Error number 3 ... the director, with long breaks and sharp camera shots, unbalanced (especially with typical music in uncertainty) ... he unfortunately was wrong. It was painful to see that a great actor like Amber Benson is wasting time trying to bring this back to life ... my only hope is that the money she made here was put on the production of her own film.
