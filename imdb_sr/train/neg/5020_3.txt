This is the most busy IMDb entry I have not yet encountered. All previous reviewers are acting like a movie. This is not a movie. Instead, it's just an option that is extra on DVD's "The One". Also, it's not nearly 90 minutes that are listed here. In reality, it's barely over 13 minutes how cool Jet Li is capable of martial arts. and his thoughts on the film. So, this IMDb entry is quite a fubar. Do not listen to any other review because ALL is wrong. You can trust me because I never feed you, dear reader, BS. And it's true. I think that u can say that I am "one" reviewer who is important.
