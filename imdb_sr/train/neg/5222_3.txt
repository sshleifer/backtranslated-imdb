This is a really bad movie. Why? First, the story is bad. It is an artificial story that combines all kinds of things that make no sense. It looks like a wrong experiment. Second, actors can not play in a realistic way. I can not even talk like an actor. Why did I buy this movie? And what do I do now with her?
