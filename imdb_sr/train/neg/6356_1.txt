If I accidentally came across this script in a text form, I would read it and maybe I would laugh. I would not, however, laugh at the points in the film where the director would like to laugh. Although I'm still not completely sure where they are. I do not care if it is Voodi Allen, this writer can not write a dialogue, or at least can not consciously write a dialogue and draw plays from actors capable of taking laughter even from the most secret clowns. For example: (paraphrasing) "I'm an art historian, I'm looking for a job in an art gallery." Okay, this states the fact, but honestly, do you know of some art historians who would say that? How would you answer? "Really? Art Gallery? Who would have thought that?" The entire script is full of such stupid quasi-intellectualism that I would not expect from such a reputable character writer. I admit that I have no knowledge of Allen's other work and, judging by this, I do not want to start learning. The characters are disgusting without exception, trying to illustrate that we all suffer from a human condition? Or really a really bad character writing? You're a judge.
