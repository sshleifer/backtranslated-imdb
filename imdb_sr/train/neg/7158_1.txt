This is the worst thing I've ever seen. I love Almereidin Nadya, but this is just absolute shit. Apart from a few moments of interesting cinema and music, this movie is just a non-stop bad actor and stupid material. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but no one in this is good. The action is a joke, but not haha. I do not even know if you can forgive films that are so bad. Please delete the last hour and a half of my life. How did this director make Nadia and another girl to another planet?
