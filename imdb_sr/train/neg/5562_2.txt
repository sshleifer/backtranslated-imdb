This nasty movie has little to recommend. Dolph Lundgren gives a performance that is better than this scenario or other action movies. There are occasional clips of dialogue that suggest that the film could provide some insight into the bizarre subculture. But no. Motivations are either blurry or banal. Most procedures are sub-pairs. The scenario creates unnecessary confusion. A redirectional unnecessary fascination by focusing on the hindrance. It's hard to imagine who the audience is for this movie.
