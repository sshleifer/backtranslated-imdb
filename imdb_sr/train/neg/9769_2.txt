I read this play Thornton Wilder last year in the eighth grade. I was also forced to go through this bad translation on the screen. To tell you, this is not a great game, it's easily overtaken, but one deserves a much better shot. The cast was really lacking, the landscape-sincere to God looked like it was designed from cartons by a three-year-old. As if it can not get worse, sound quality is bad ... there is a "buzzing" that dies from the head whenever an actor says ... and also I could not fail to notice that the chemistry between George and Emily, well, well, does not exist. It seems that all actors are very uncomfortable to be there. No music. It's in black and white, which would be fine, but it's even more revealing of sirens. Anyway, I think if you want to see this movie, which I really do not recommend, then do not target your hope to a high level. The performance, like her, is probably better.
