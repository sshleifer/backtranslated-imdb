I'm not alone in admiration of Superman's first film, a film that Richard Donner performed masterfully. I'm also not lonely in mocking Superman 2 Richard Lester ... which brings us to Richard Donner's clip from the same movie, unfortunately, it's still absolute horror. unbelieving is needed at high doses, but Superman 2 is raising things too far. It does not matter who directed Superman 2 because the script offends the first-class intelligence. In a sense, there is no complication because the characters have a zero motivation to act in the way they do it, unlike the original superman. With or without his powers, Superman's power (or its disadvantage) is handled in the most incredible way. Too much to be criticized, so I will not be bothered. I condemn this film ... maybe the slapstick in the Lester version is more suitable for the moronic script on which this film is based. Super-Duper bad.
