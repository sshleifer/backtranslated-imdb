This film does not contain humor for anyone who lived with a member of a family with a mental illness. Many scenes reminded me too graphically about my own life experiences. This film was a male version of "My Favorite Mom". It also shows the graphic and exact life through which many children of mentally ill parents pass through. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupted and to act as if he were God. Somebody told me it's funny. No way, I say! At best, it's sick humor. The movie is so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room. It is best to use this film for people who do not understand mental illness or do not believe in what our families actually experience.
