John Pressman (Micheal 'I should have called Ditech' Lerner) worked in the office as an editor. His mother (Zelda 'Poltergeist' Rubenstein) hypnotized him from people who thought he was wrong. But it turned out to be a movie in the film, but soon lines appeared as John went to the movies to kill. It encourages a guy who watches a movie to do the same. Lerner is convenient above this, but Zelda repeats the dialogue rows over and over again. It quickly becomes irritating. But not as boring as the two girls watching the movie in the movie. As a horror movie, this fails, he is too busy trying to be smart, trying to convey a message and seems to forget a movie that must cause a sense of tension, either at a jump or two. No, what we have here is the worst kind of slasher: Art-house one. My Rating: D +
