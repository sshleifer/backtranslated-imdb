This is a very sad movie. Really. Nothing's happening in this movie. Script is bad !!! I suppose they just copied the first 15 pages to 90 pages. Producers surely thought we were making a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They did not succeed. Now, in the third week, she's just working in Antwerp and Brussels at 22h45 or something like that. In the past, we had very good films in Belgium, like Daens. Shades are a waste of your time. Maybe you could sneak into the theater after seeing a real movie. If you saw 10 minutes of Shades, you saw everything. He was put to death on a local radio and TV. I hope it will soon disappear in the shade.
