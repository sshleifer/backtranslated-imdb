This is just a bad movie. With what looked like a pretty good budget, he had the potential to be much better. It was almost there. With heroin pretty close to Salma Haiek, the hero fights almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duelings almost like in the Crouching Tiger ..., music almost as in, say, Conan ... etc. Done. But in the end it's just boring and it's hard to find something interesting in it. Perhaps besides John Rhis-Davies flying in a fight like those warriors in Hero or earlier mentioned Tiger ... I'm really embarrassed by the poor old John. He is still a good actor and deserves much better. Just like you - so if you still have a chance, just look at something else.
