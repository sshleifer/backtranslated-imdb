Imagine the Great Cold with a plaster of twenty and a few whose characters are unusable, and a human-lizard like iguana is haunting them and you have a picture of insanity. On the positive side, the film does not save on displaying the monster. There are no shots from shooting, or night scenes where you have to imagine what it looks like; There are people there. Unfortunately, the design and construction are not so inspiring. A little mystery may have helped. Look, I've seen a lot worse, but if you bring it to a full show for a lot of movement, your monster looks better goddamn good. Spoiler Ahead! Oh, and there's also a screw that includes an allegedly dead brother that does not make any sense at all. This is not a surprise given the poor script writing. As for acting; so let's just say that it was not bad, but I do not expect to see many of these children in future cinematic excursions.
