Since the low budgets go, you will usually find that you get what you are paying for, and let me say, I have not paid much for "Frightvorld" ... Writer / director: David R. Williams brings us a story about an abandoned amusement park, surrounded by the vindictive spirit of the murdered serial killer. It's not a bad premise, but it's done with a series of budget failures. Work on the camera is trying to be too pliers for your audience by constantly using tremendous quick cuts to cover the fact that they really do not have anything terrible or scary to show us. This becomes apparent immediately after we are introduced to a potential killer, and soon we realize that (acting) is the most terrible thing that happens ... After a painfully long title, we return to modern times, the acting remains the same. "Frightvorld" generates a fairly unique cinema when displaying a scene from a fun home, but with an extremely long working time, it can not save a movie from below the average indie hell. There is some central nudity, but not much for the upside, which is usually the savings for these types of movies. Fans of really bad B-movies could find something interesting here, otherwise, do not spend a lot of money.
