... except Jon Hedera. This guy burned the whole movie. The action sounded fun. The 29-year-old son (Heather) still lives with his widowed mother (Keaton) who is in love with a new love (Daniels). Lazi son is jealous and eager to lose a comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. He also met a girlfriend (Faris). I really liked the performance of Daniels, and especially Farisa, but whoever put Hadera on it would be better to sell hot dogs on the beach. The Hedera performance is unpleasant, which would be a good thing because he plays a boring guy, the problem is that he is a bad actor to lose this act making this guy nice in the final. In the end, you still want to be able to personally hit a guy in the face and be upset about the end. In the future, every movie with this guy will be without me!
