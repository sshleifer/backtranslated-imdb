Everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Miers, for example. He came to the point where you realized that his count had not changed from his SNL days, more than ten years ago. He does the same funny jokes and the same voices. His Cat is painfully immature. He is trying. He is a strange comedian of type A, not a cool cat that should be. The rest of the movie is equally bad. The gatherings are incredibly ugly - and apparently the loss of millions of dollars. (Cutouts for back-up buildings would make more sense than building a whole village and the main street.) It's even an unsuitable moment of cheese with a fake celebrity Paris Hilton - which is held in the head just because it should be the story of Dr. Seuss. Avoid this film at all costs, folks. It's not even interesting wreckage of the train. (I hope Horton will hear who is with Robin Villiams. Then we will have a bad-Seuss movie actor-a rescue comedy trilogy.)
