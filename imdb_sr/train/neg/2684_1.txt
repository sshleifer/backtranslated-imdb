I found a film offensive for Americans who lost someone in the towers, for American people in general. Pretending to be worshiped by the terrible facts that have happened over the past years, each director uses the opportunity to polemicize the old facts (which have nothing to do with the terrorist attack), or criticize American political behavior, or compare different political situations like having a country that does not Nothing to do or share with the September 11th crime.
