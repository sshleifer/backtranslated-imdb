This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was actually expecting a bad movie, but surprised me or not. The story is traditional, all clich√©s are included. Dialogue is so badly written that you actually laugh when half-descending actors are trying to sound it really. The photo is not very good, the music is so small that it really angered me, the actors do not even try, although it is almost impossible to expect more than the people who have behaved for 30 years due to the scenarios, and the so-called action of the scene does not actually succeed in getting the action itself. I do not understand why these kind of bad movies continue to come, who finances this shit? Where's the screening? And why do actors act this impossible mission script? There are millions of Hollywood films in this genre, even without the desire to get to the theater, but even those who are doing the video things actually manage to look professionally in comparison. I can not say anything positive about this, except for the title that explains everything, I feel being robbed of 2 hours of life.
