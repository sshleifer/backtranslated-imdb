Another film about a tortured, lonely, arrogant, impersonal, hatred, self-destructive main character that we should worry about. Do not misunderstand me. films on the wall that have a distinctly self-destructive character as the main character. What I'm complaining about is that there's so little background for this guy. Why this guy hated himself and the world? If the script dealt with this problem, they might have managed to get away from it. As he himself appears to be an unpleasant hateful character, not tragic, only hatred. After making great efforts to make this guy crazy and antisocial as much as possible and makes his fate dark as possible, the writer has the courage to make a happy ending ... <br /> < br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's a good fight! Man! Do not waste your time.
