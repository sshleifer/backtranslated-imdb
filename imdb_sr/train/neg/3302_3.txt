In recent years, Swedish action films have developed into something that imitates American films like "Heat", but with a low budget. This film follows the same recipe as "Noll Tolerans" and "Livvakken". However, it is obvious that they are too busy making a cool and difficult movie. The story is already seen, the dialogue is artificial and the acting is very bad, especially from the main actress. . The film attempts to paint a picture of hard-boiled military robbers without any remorse and a female investigator who completely lost it to the problems of the past, but at the same time it seems completely rational. It does not work very well. The style of glossy photography no longer seems fresh and in this picture does not look good. Only a very few scenes really look good. Also, the sound is pretty strange and it sounds like a lot of real dialogue is recorded after that. The main quality of this film is Stefan Sauk, although he does not make a convincing SVAT-portrait. The leader, he has some really funny lines. Also, music is pretty good.
