What else is left to say? I read all reviews here and most are correct. . However, one person even went so far as to call this film and Satan chased him (or something similar). Evil?! Wow, what a shock. . I mean, TBN made this movie. Open your eyes, please. In any case, this was the lowest level of propoghand of nonsense that has appeared for years. they used to make it. If this film can be made, there are no limits, and therefore we have no choice but to save for "Ientl 2" and "Ernest loses Omega codes". who are in the Bible stories, the new Dogma movie will pick up where Omega Code has never started.
