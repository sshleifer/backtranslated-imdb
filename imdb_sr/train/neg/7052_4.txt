God, this movie was so boring as the music I really loved, I mean what was the point in making this movie, please anyone reading this review does not watch this movie, it's a waste of time. Emraan can act, but it's really pathetic. In this movie, I'm actually ashamed of being one of his fans especially in this movie, it was really bad. Celina is just another nice face without any lack of talent, what has ever been, it can not work at all, and there was no point in being in this movie, such as for another girl Radhu she was fine, I guess, but she could have done better. What a waste of time. please buy great music and do not watch this movie.
