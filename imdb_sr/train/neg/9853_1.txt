I think that the majority wants to believe that there are extraordinary things and that this film does not show any restraint in an effort to fully utilize it. The presentation is very interesting, well presented and graphics is a state of the art, but from a scientific standpoint it simply does not work. Hydrogen filled flying bubbles? They should be the size of Mack's truck to be useful. And there is always the possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problems with fantasy, just do not try to throw it away as a fact. Some people will always misunderstand. All in all, the movie is fun, but I kept saying, "Oh brother, what's the load ...". If you want a FAKE documentary, check out This is Spinal Tap. Or at least turn off the sound.
