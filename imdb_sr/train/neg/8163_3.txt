I agree with everything that people have said about this, but I must add that the soundtrack is probably the LEVEL that I've ever heard of my whole life! There are real vocals at a time when you need to listen to the talk of actors! And vocals are like the broad version of Danzig's singing, "The Darkness of the Forest! The Darkness of the Dark, Dark Forest!" or something else that does not endanger. The singer has a terrible vibrato and was recorded with a tweeter microphone through a synthesized section and fake drums. It's horrible!! Yes, men's tracks are terrible. Like women. This is a bad case of gender stereotypes - it's so bad! Everything they say turns around about being male or female, only stereotypes are played to the maximum. I'm sick of. Soooo boring !!! The children were so proud of their ranks that you could not understand them. And why do ghost girls always wear sweet little bows in their hair, beautiful blue dresses and long hair? And the ghost guys always wear clean pants with sweet blue hair? Not scary - STUPID. Dad was too dirty, clean and clean to be a man living in a cave. Nice beard and bangs, so. Did you bend them with a knife yourself or did you walk into the city and go to the salon? Stupid movie.
