Vov. Simply awful. I was an admirer of the original film, and I reluctantly passed through part 2, 3 was an improvement. 4.5 and Freddi's Dead were pretty bad. But Nothing is as bad as Freddie's nightmare. Freddy plays Rod Serlingesk the host of this anthology series. I can accept how Freddie became one after the other, but at least in movies, Freddie's attraction was movies, but here they were so badly made, they looked like high school horror series. Poor actors, if you really want to call yourself so that after this performance they were obviously what they paid for. I am almost sure that this was a stopping point for two types of actors. Those who are just starting out on the Hollywood scale, completely new, ready to take any part that would delay their need to take on this porn job offered to them last week, or experienced actors on the way down the Hollywood charts ready to take any part that would put from their need to take on the pornographic job offered to them last week. For a long time I expected Dan Plato for the guest star, but she was already dead by the time she was in production. <br /> <br> To paraphrase Nens's line in the original Elm St, "Whatever you try not to fall asleep watching this."
