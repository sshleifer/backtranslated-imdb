Well, I guess I'll have to say "The Emperor does not have clothes." When I saw this show for PBS last night, I was promised and worried. I loved "Morse" (even so far I bought a complete DVD set) and I felt it, while I always loved Kevin Vhatelija Sgt. Levis character, the show was John Thav, a period! After looking at the new "inspector Levis" (as charged here), I'm more convinced that I was right ... He was okay (though he looks terrible (and bad old and too fat), but he just does not have the charisma to maintain a performance like Thav did. As for his "assistant" Foxs, well ... maybe reviewers from England can understand what he says, but I can not do it for one. <br> /> As for Mrs. Innocent, all I can say is that I'm missing James Grout. </ br> I'm sorry I have to say the left "Morse" rests in peace.
