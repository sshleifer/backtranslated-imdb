First, this film, according to slick, said he won the "best movie" at the Worffest film festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm must have been a quiet year. I would not call it the worst movie ever, but it sure is bullshit, it's pretty scary as other Aussie B grader "Be Melt", but at least the movie did not look like it was shot on the HI 8 video. I assume that filmmakers have watched a lot of Trom movies, and really bad B-class movies, thinking they can shoot at the job that's publishing this movie. Do not misunderstand me, I love low-quality movies, just the fact that some of the characters dress up fake American accents, almost as if they did it they have more chances to sell it in states or something like that. A really disappointing ending, too, the Chauvin could have been much more exciting, and some good fighting scenes. You can fully see that filmmakers are trying to copy "Bad Taste" with the whole, car explosion, rocket launcher and the endless amount of people killed, but the finale lacks any humor or style as a "bad taste". If you like to watch bad movies, or are you interested in filming without a budget, watch it, otherwise hold on.
