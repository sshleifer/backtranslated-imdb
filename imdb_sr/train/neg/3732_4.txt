Perhaps because I was so young, innocent and when I saw her, this movie was the cause of many sleepy nights for me. I did not see him from the seventh grade at the presbyterian school, so I'm not sure what the effect would have on me. However, I will say that he made an impression on me ... and most of my friends. This served its purpose, at least until we were old enough and educated enough to analyze and create our own thinking. I was particularly frightened of what the newly converted Christians had to endure after their enthusiasm when they did not receive the mark of the beast. I do not want to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it, so I will not mention the details of the scene, but I can still imagine them in my head ... and it's been 19 years.
