This was terrible. Andie Macdovell is a terrible actress. So wooden makes the rocking hinge seem to be better able to do the job. But then remember that turning into Four Weddings, just as sick. Another movie that shows England as a full cabin for a chocolate box and village greenery. I mean, school, how many schools except Hogwarts looks like that? The police station looked like a set from the Heartbeat series (a British series that was troubled in the 1960s). This film could not understand what it wanted to be - a comedy or a serious examination under the stream of female friendships. If she stuck to the former, then the sex scene at the graveyard and the very stupid breeze at the wedding might have succeeded (I'm just saying). But these scenes just did not work with the tragedy in the second half. It's also amazing that Kate will talk to Moli again after her terrible behavior. The Final Note - what is a decent actress like Staunton in this crowd? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdovell should be kept for wrestling advertising.
