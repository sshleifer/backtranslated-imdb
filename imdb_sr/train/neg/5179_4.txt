Without effective relevance to supernatural or poetic motivational nuances of humanity, all this creative team must hope for the effective use of its middle, non-genuine elements. The 'Fifth Party' is gone maniacal, and then genetically inevitable, there is little interest, because the singular non-killer element is a subtle, silly-acting 'Ves Bentley' moped. Actually, all acting is deep. Although the dark-skinned women speak, the comfort is reduced to a minimum. There is no nudity here. There are also enough buckets of blood missing. All the sensations are kept on an incredible, safe distance ... an unfortunate fact given the name of the director is 'butcher'. Only sound, droning angst alt-countri and tense fluctuating result give you any tangible tension. Sometimes some static compositions with static records add attractive low angles that add weaknesses ... but for a movie called horror, I have never come close to twitching. Perhaps there is a greater emphasis on social rejuvenation through blood intake, a scene geared to different geometric shapes outside the square, and a sustainable focus on playfulness through the malicious family or traps that sympathetic characters need to escape to avoid their dilemma would improve my thinking, but this was not it was a good start of my excursion through horrorfest.
