I expected this to be much better. I love the work of Tim Burton, so I was very excited to see these online short films. Well, they were not exactly what I expected. I do not know exactly what I do not like. I guess they're just stupid. The sound bother me, and most of the characters, though I loved Roia Tokic Boi and Stainboi. I do not like some characters dying. As if Match Girl basically lit a gas station, or how the Girl Vho Stares died at all. The death of Roy was fun, surprising. Death from a car refresher. Very original ;-) It smiled so much ... There are some things that are not suitable for children. Just a tongue and up. That's all I have to say! 3/10
