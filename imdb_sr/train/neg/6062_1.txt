Vov. The only people who watch this positively are Carpenter's apologists. I know a lot of them. The guys who watch John Carpenter squat on the celluloid and shake the film and declare it a mystery of horror. This "movie" is the ultimate crap. It looks and sounds like a porn (good master, a soundtrack is horrible ...), and has a sub-pair of porn movies, which is shocking, as Ron Perlman is usually a good actor. Frankly, I have no idea what Carpenter was thinking when he did this. Most likely, "Beans, beans, beans" until someone feeds it and plunged it into a blanket for a day ... Nothing speaks of an abortion debate, when they could have a very interesting central theme (how a religious fanatic against abortionist feels when it is that's the baby's baby?), but instead they chose Ron Perlman and his terrible children to kill a crowd of people and that terrible doctors are trying to calm a hysterically poor pregnant girl. No one from this episode or what you need to get undamaged. It's horrible. Like, Plan 9 From Outerspace is terrible. Like, good God, please, would somebody extinguish him before I would have regretted it. Try to watch this and the thing on the same day and your mind will collapse.
