The Idiot dentist finds out that his wife was unfaithful. So there are no new stories here. However, the authors managed to create a stupid, disgusting film. If you like to watch your children return, or watch a dentist imagining pulling all her teeth in a bloody type of horror, go to see (or rent) a movie. If not, go to something else (MY FAIR FAIR, anyone?)
