The story line was repeated several times; "the breath of life in the nursing home". Several plays, movies, novels, short stories, poems and newspaper articles have won the topic to the end, but it is still an excellent platform for character studies. If 'Gideon' is made more enthusiastic, it can be brilliant, but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely overwhelmed by clich√©s (even the subtitle and abstract of Gideon's "simple wisdom" almost laughed in its inefficiency ). Mostly an indifferent performance is the final straw for this bad movie, but the rest is quiet enough to make the actor's lack of focus almost irrelevant.
