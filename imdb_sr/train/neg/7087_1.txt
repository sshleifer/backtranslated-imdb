I would not usually write a comment on-line, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only was it recorded as a series of soaps ("Young and Restless" are really recorded by professionals compared to this), but it also has horrible cuts. No action. It's full of useless garbage. Here is the example: the guy wants to kill the main character when he was fired because of him. So (after a bunch of shit) here are them: the guy puts a knife on his throat and says something like "Now you're dead." Then the main figure says: "If you kill me, you are dead. I told the police to threaten me." So, the guy (killer) goes like this (he'll just cry): "Oh, no ... the cops are following me !? !! Oh ... my God." Remember: this is just an example. I really can not believe this movie really exists. So: If you ever want to see the LARGEST movie ... just forward, I recommend it :)
