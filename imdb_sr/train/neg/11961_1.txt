Anyone who could find a redeemable value in this piece of shit should look at the head. We have a subordinate, heroin-dependent, shortened wife of a whore with tenseness all over the body, tears received from the repeated beatings by the abusive son. Now, she sprays breast milk on the kitchen floor, the release has somehow become similar to Helen Keller putting her hands in running water. We have a husband who begins with the patronage of a prostitute who is by chance his daughter (she is upset about him because she came too soon) and ends with the killing of her colleague, sex with her corpse, and then her cropping. We have a child who tirelessly harass his colleagues and who comes home and fights his mum. You see, everything is circular. Deep, huh? The only decent moment in this terrible bunch of jokes is when Dad kills the martyrs of his son. The good thing is that this Turkish video was shot on the video because otherwise it would be a waste of expensive movie. If the guy who thinks artists should be interested in this raft is really serious, it's no wonder that most people think artists are crazy. We saw this bad movie, and then put "The Zulu Woman, the Accused". Oh, my God, it was a conversation about what's worse. What's happening in Japan these days? Sick, sick, sick.
