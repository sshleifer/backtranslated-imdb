Ok, I absolutely love Ben Stiller, although I'm lukewarm for Jennifer Aniston. I think this girl can not do the least. Every movie or comedy I saw in it is very difficult to go through her fake acting. It sounds like it just stands there and reads immediately from the script. This film had only one good thing about it, and that's it was Ben Stiller. This plot is so used and abused that it is ridiculous. How many movies have the same type of action? Can we say "forces of nature?" Not only is the action so old, but the outcome is so predictable, boring. I knew everything that would happen before him. It was boring, but watching Stillera is always a thrill !!!
