I think I was laughing twice. The line in which the main character says something about being off the street. And then I forgot the second time I laughed. Probably it was at the beginning. This must be one of the thinnest movies ever. Does Hollywood do not realize that such humor is really humiliating and sad. You can only insult yourself so much. 2/10
