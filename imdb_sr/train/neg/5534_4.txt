I'm doing my way through the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack collection and REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is one of the films in the set. I'm watching them with their 7-year-old daughter, who makes most of these films a mess of laughter. I had great hopes for the REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES, after I watched the Zombie Zombie, which is really precursing so much that it is the mainstay of zombies in cinema (I think Serve and Rainbow Clive Barker and James Bond Live and Let Die Die, NO Night of the Dead Dead). However, although the title includes the word "zombies", it is slightly more than a love triangle, involving anthropologist Armand Loukue, who was hit by Claire Duval; who occupies with his companion Clifford Grayson. What a festive fest, my daughter fell asleep halfway. I had really difficult deciphering for whom these people worked - allies or axes; but I guess it does not really matter. I was shocked to see White Lugosia in the clips for this movie; but, of course, it was his eyes (from the Vhite Zombie) that served as a mind control device for zombies.
