The film had some good acting and good moments (although apparently a rather low budget), but a poor rating because of a poorly developed basic premise. The main point of the conflict between the two leaders is not in a realistic way. There are several scenes in which they disagree about it, but there is no talk of great depth that would explain how they can be together as they look at the world so differently, especially since Glenn's employment has so much been completed in this part of his life (and Adam is sufficiently active with his to support him with time and money.) Also, Glenn has been shown several times negatively because he is as he is (apologizing to Adam for his past) while Adam has shown that he is upright and "traditional", which film proclaims " good "at the end. I do not like being preached to me. I attended a discussion with the director after I looked at the LTR, and he said that he presented this conflict between them, because if he was in Glen's shoes (and he said that in real life he was referring to Glenn's view) that he never he could come out with someone with Adam's views. Well, then, I think he should do a much better job explaining how Glenn could do it in the movie. Also, the director said that he directed this, his first film, only after he read it (director for dolls). The direction was not so bad, but far from top-notch. I've seen worse, but I rarely leave movies that feel frustrated.
