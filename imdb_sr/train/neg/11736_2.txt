One week before I saw Iowa, I saw a confident art school where a pretentious student makes a movie and can not decide whether he wants art or violent exploitation. Iowa could be the film he made. I can see the elements of much better movies in Iowa - Spun and Natural Born Killers. However, in addition to art, both films had a good character development and a coherent story. Iova. This film comes to a pointless end. I have to admit that she had consistency. This film is bad from start to finish and is not particularly worse or better in any part. All actors did what they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves better. She shows that she is very talented, very funny and very sexy. But why it has to demonstrate in this ball.
