The first "Home Alone" was one of the most entertaining films of the 90's. The other was equally funny with the same actors and jokes! Now comes "Home Alone 3". I was curious to be able to continue the same story since Kevin would have been 17 years old until 1997. So what does the director decide to do? He takes the child equally bored and makes him sick. The kid is 6 years old, and his mother leaves him alone in the house? What kind of burger team are you idiots? I really do not want to get too involved in the details if you want to watch this movie. But please, I would recommend that you stay away from it. It's not worth your precious time. Go bend a piece of paper, do your homework, balance the pen on your nose, or take a nap! It's better to watch "Home Alone 3"! 1/10
