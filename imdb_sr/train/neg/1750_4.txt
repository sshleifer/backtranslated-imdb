Priiadarshan's HERA PHERI was a good situational comedy. This film, however, actually does not have a story, but it's pretty funny, but not logical. The first half has 2 funny scenes like the one in which Akshai and John invite Neha to lunch, and the other half when Paresh enters the game. it's funny though not scripts Jokes are funny though we wonder how they never hear the voices of every person from the rooms? Climak confusion is treated as Ali, the film is abruptly ending The direction is fine Music is good Akshai Kumar stands out in his work which has now become his second skin, but this is his film entirely and overshadowed everyone else. John settles and fails in comedy Paresh Raval is ridiculous Rajpal is in the girl's line, and loud and sometimes clumsy Nargis, Daisy and Neetu (only Neetu is now seen) are good in parts, but the scream is too frequent Manoj Joshi is OK
