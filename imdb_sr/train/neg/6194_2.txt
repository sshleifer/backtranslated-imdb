With the title "borrowed" by Verner Herzog and the liberal aid of Kubrick, Haneke and Noe, it is painfully obvious that Thomas Clai is considered a cut above the usual sort of garbage our British cinema produces. Robert Carmichael (in short) is set up as a realistic study of youthful alienation and, at the same time, a seemingly critique of the war in Iraq. The problem with realism is that the characters are so obviously unrealistic and atypical - contrary to the stinking fantasies of "extreme" filmmakers, most of the teenagers are not rape-force drug users. As a criticism of the war in Iraq, a film about youth violence (by a talented classical musician - a subtlety society has damaged this sensitive person) is so infantile that he can barely think. There are signs of technical capability, but some reviewers have overestimated this. Like Kubrick and Noe, he shows that the desire for shock is linked to the alleged serious intent, perhaps the worst film scam of the recent film. People liked "Clockvork Orange" and "Irreversible" because they loved rape and violence, but most of all they liked to feel more culturally superior to the things they hated most. So too much Kubrika and insufficiently Hanekea (a serious and moral filmmaker) here marks this as one of the deepest films in years. (I am not against violence on the film. To do this is a serious trick - people in the cinemas welcomed Alec to "Clockvork Orange" showing that Kubrick's intention was missed by millions of pretensions by many directors of art films.)
