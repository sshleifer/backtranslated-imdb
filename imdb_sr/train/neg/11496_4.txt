a documentary about one of the darkest places in Guatemala. shown as fun, surely ... but a sad place, whether a bunch of sex workers got a chance to play in a football team, gathered in something that looks more than a week! documentary film is the main focus to prove that society rejects this kind of "workers", although no solution for these poor women has ever been achieved, except that people who documented it made some "stars" (just as the title says) in return for exploitation to create this realistic documentary. has, however, its documented reality ... but, unfortunately, it has nothing to do with the main story. I would not accept to see him again; but I would recommend it only for general cultural purposes.
