The inexplicably stupid, non-budget "war picture" is made mainly to show the attributes of the spectacular Eve Meier - which is not a bad idea in itself - but that should be a disgrace to everyone connected with it. The funny "script", performances that would not have passed in the elementary school Christmas, incompetent "action" scenes, the confused directors of the normally competent director of the documentary Louis Clide Stoumen - who is obviously not sure that the real comedy, the philosophical tract of the futility of war or leering T & A (up to the early standards of the sixties of the last century) the travelogue of the magnificent body Eve Meier - and the general air of bruising and incompetence. It's worth seeing how to watch Eve Meier slamming, but that's pretty much.
