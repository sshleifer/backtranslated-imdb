Jerry spy on Tom listening to the creepy story on the radio and takes advantage of the opportunity to scare off his enemy. I did not realize that this episode was so funny: humor was pretty limited and the entire setting was pretty limited. somehow lame (Jerry is essentially a "bad guy" in this, torture the poor Tom for no special reason). There is an occasional flash of inspiration (such as Tom's literary experience of 'hearts in the mouth'). and the moment when children of his life are sucked out of his body), but in general, this effort lacks the frenetic tempo, excellent animation and pure humor of most other T & J caricatures.
