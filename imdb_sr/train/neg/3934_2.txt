He looked forward to watching this movie and watching these great actors. However, I was sadly disappointed with the script and the entire story of the story. David Duchovni, Dr. Eugene Sands, Connie & Carla, '04, was a Doctor in a story that uses drugs and loses a medical practice license. Dr. Sands visited the nightclub and could use his medical experience to help a wounded client and helped Angelina Jolie (Claire), "Taking Lives", '04, which immediately attracted dr. Timothy Hutton, (Raimond Blossom), Kinsei, '04, starring Gangster of the Great Shot and a man with all sorts of money and connections. It seems that Timothy Hutton works in most of the scenes and completely leaves the mind trying to prevent his gang members from being killed. Gari Dourdan, (Iates), "TV series CSI-Vegas", plays a big role and shows the real COOL DUDE, the so-called guardian for Raimond Bloss. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby ​​red lips that attract the attention of all men. This film is not the biggest but entertaining.
