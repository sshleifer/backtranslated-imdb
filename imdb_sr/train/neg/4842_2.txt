Who did the research for this movie? It was installed in Baghdad in 2004, but all soldiers carry ACUs and have universal masking equipment. Nobody carried those things at 04. I just watched this movie while I was deployed abroad and I can say it's a huge feeling from the VTF audience? This film did not make any sense, they had characters coming and going without explanation, and people are doing meaningless things that NEVER happen in real life. I realize it's a movie, but it's obviously trying to show something realistic. Unsuccessfully falls, but tries. It's as if somebody came up with a bunch of random ideas, chewed them and swallowed it, then recovered the movie. I would not recommend this film to anyone. I'm still not sure why I went through the whole thing. GI Joe was the one who really made you think about this. STAY AWAY!
