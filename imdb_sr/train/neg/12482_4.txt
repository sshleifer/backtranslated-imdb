Deathstalker is directed by John Vatson and played by Rick Hill, who is some kind of bodibuilder and known for it, if I understand it well? The shop follows while Deathstalker (Hill) tries to get something from the evil master, and he must travel to the cave. He meets many dwarfs and monsters during his journey, and the settings are very close to Tolkien, and of course, Conan Barbarian. This is a split from the huge success of Conan, and although this is a very dumb movie, he has many nice trash credits and is recommended for fans of junk and tolerated movie narcissism! There are not many movie credits in this movie. The pair scene is almost atmospheric and fascinating, but what Deathstalker concentrates to show is naked females and Hilla's huge muscles. Females are usually helpless victims and very stupid, so this is a very feline movie and therefore can not be satisfied by many feminists! The battle scenes are nothing special and quite boring, and the monsters are nothing special. And all other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly made, but what did you expect from such low-budget efforts? This is trying to be as big as Conan, but it does not get pretty bad. As I said, it can satisfy fans of Turkish cinema, but no one else. This is a category that is so bad it's great! The perpetrator of death is still not as bad as it could be, and as a movie for Turkey, I appreciate this almost as much as other parties, those who enjoy naturally! If bad movies are your tea, try this and have fun, but if you do not understand "cozy bad movies," stay away. And if someone can not bear a large amount of nudity, then hold on. There are more nudity than violence, and because of these scenes, the film has a R rating. Otherwise, this could be a sure PG family movie! 4/10
