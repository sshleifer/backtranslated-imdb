Recap: Ron is about to marry Mel. They are deeply and lovingly and are sure to be perfect for each other, even though they met just a few months ago. Tod, Ron's brother is not so happy. He fears that marriage is a threat to his easy business in a family business and decides to organize Rona's boyfriend party. But his real plan is to put Rona in a compromising situation, get evidence, and break Ron and Mela. Comments: It should be a continuation of the comedy, but it's not at all funny. It's mostly puberty and a juvenile excuse to show expensive women. In fact, in a way, it's almost impressive that many can put them there, because they are everywhere. Unfortunately, this is also one of the characters of a movie that can not be supported. It just is not good enough. It has three redemption points, or actually three actors who are worth a better scenario than this. Just actor Josh Cooke manages to give the impression of some common sense. Sara Foster I know has more talent than doing such films, and Emanuelle Vaugier seems to have a lot more talent than this movie. What is suspiciously absent are good jokes. In fact, bad jokes are quite rare. It's just not funny. 3/10
