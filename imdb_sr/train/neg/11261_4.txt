To begin with, I must point out the fact that you will feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Yes, some things are happening, but you do not know why or why. When you finally grasp things, realize that this is nothing more than a twisted opera soad dealing with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate sons ... Characters are rather poor, and actors (especially young ones) do not help much to look credible. Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but she is a great actress, regardless of whether the film is pure garbage. The only positive thing to say about "Frio Sol De Invierno" is that the Debian Pablo Malo had good intentions, and recorded several scenes that are quite intense ... Well, maybe the next time ... My rate: 4/10
