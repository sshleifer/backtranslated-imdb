One two three four five six seven eight and aft, haha. This must be seen, first of all, to see how it works. Much is shown at work, look at those close up, man, where you will enjoy. A few years ago, the video was based on this film. It's a slasher, but without tension. And the ending is ridiculous, and the clothes he wears in a copper-faced tree, Jesus, looks like a clown. The murders are mostly unfolding outside, the blood flowing, but never too much. There are many combat scenes, and hey, nobody is hurt. And what about the weapon to be killed, it has never been seen so much, it will not spoil it, you have to see it. And as a slasher, there's plenty of T & A. To guess who the killer is, you will be captured several times and that's the best part, but what about the story of the copper in the forest? But, however, because of his hype, this one is still one that many would like to have. I'm glad to have my own copy, one of those bumps. But, man, these clothes and not to mention haircuts! If you are in your forties, then this is one on your back to remember.
