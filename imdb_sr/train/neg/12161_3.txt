The "deadly look of love" is essentially "Fatal Attraction" with a few turns added to the last half. The end will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three films of the Week. This is another warning story about temptation, and does not add anything fresh to that genre. Although he has everything, he risks losing everything by starting a steamy affair with Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, the blonde blonde from Cedar Falls, hardly falls for Brett, and she does not take it particularly well when she comes clean about her engagement. Shortly after the wedding, Mrs. Brett appeared dead in the bedroom of a large, luxurious house she shared with her new husband. When the police are examining Brett, he immediately points his finger at Janet. After her arrest, Janet seems to be relaxing at any moment - not that she had a picture of stability before. Her defense attorney (Holland Tailor) is convinced Janet is innocent and that hell is prone to prove it. Is it done or not? How will this end? You can find out the answers to these questions the next time the "Deadly Look of Love" is broadcast at your local station. And do not miss the morale of this wonderful story: men are pigs, and women are crazy.
