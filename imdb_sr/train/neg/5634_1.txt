The poster that he called "Immediately and senselessly" literally took the words I would use in my subject. The only thing I would add is "no passion". For a movie made by a real married couple and containing many graphic sex scenes, this movie is able to do what should be a sultry situation in one behind the ice. Dafoe and Colagrande look bored during sexual scenes, and the viewer could take Valium and do it. Also, please, the audience in the audience saw VAI too used tampons in their time, and every guy involved, seeing Villema Dafoe pulling out a bloody tampon from his wife's vagina, should really get the therapy. I think the key to the movie (if one has it) is a restaurant scene in which the waiter explains the ever-sleeping eyes of Dafoe what "deconstructed jambalay" is. (All the antenna components are still separate but collected together.) This film is a "deconstructed thriller." All the elements are there: a spooky, isolated house, a dead wife, freaky violins on the scorecard, a freak guard who comes and goes as long as he wants, fatalities with an automobile accident and near death, characters with a secret past. Basically, any thriller cliché can be imagined, but NIŠTA does not merge. Everything just sits there and never fits into a coherent plot or even for an artistic mood. In the restaurant, Dafoe goes to the "deconstructed jambal". Potential owners of this mess would well leave this deconstructed thrill on the video store shelves.
