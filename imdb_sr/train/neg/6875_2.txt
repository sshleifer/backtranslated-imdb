Somehow attracted to erotic scenes, only to realize that this is one of the most attractive and incredible parts of the movie I've ever seen. As a high school film project. What is Rosanna Arquette thinking? And what about all these stock figures in this bizarre city in the Middle West? It's pretty hard to get involved in this. No lessons can be learned from it, no brilliant insights, only stiff and rather funny (but a lot of skin, if you are intrigued by it) recorded nonsense ... What about bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all heterosexual encounters. And what about this absurd dance, with everyone who plays their stereotyped roles? Give this passage, it's like a million other miles of bad, lost film, money that could be spent on hungry children or Aids in Africa .....
