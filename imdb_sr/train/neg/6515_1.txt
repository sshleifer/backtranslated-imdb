This is not a boring film, the audience might remain fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkovitz, and a filmmaker and actor. The story is simple: after divorce and ten years of Hollywood career, the author plays a quest for love in front of the camera. The first question is how is it all true: what is written, what is it by chance? Both "yes" or "no" answers portray M. Berkovic as a low average person. If you are looking for a self-fiction about love like this, I recommend reading some of the independent comics: Chester Brovn, Joe Matt ... Besides, I felt pretty disappointed to hear so much against my country, France . I know American people usually say that the French are arrogant (which could then be the truth), etc., and surely the French (and the whole world) have a lot of sorrow against America, but why so much hate it? Do not think that this movie can not be loved for that alone.
