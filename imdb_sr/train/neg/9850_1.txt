I felt my brain dead, I'll tell you. This is the worst movie I ever bought. (in my ignorance I thought it was the same name and film Peter Jackson). The performances are so scary that they are funny. Special effects did not endure the test of time and looked terrible. The scenario promotes that kind of TV movie, looking at the middle distance. The actors seem to have taken lessons from Joei Tribbiani, have one look at each other and stick to it. Besides, I was never confused with the movie until I sat down to watch this. Whether it's a dream or not, the plot is so horrible that frustration arises in a matter of minutes. Avoid plague.
