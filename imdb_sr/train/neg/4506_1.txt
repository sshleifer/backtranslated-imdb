American filmmakers have decided to make a movie they think is Japanese. Characters that are poorly represented, actors are neither Japanese nor set is cheap, unreal, and definitely does not represent Kioto in the early twenties and thirties. Who ever read the book understands that script writers have not added any added value to make the film different from the script. Even worse, they even changed the original line of the plot with a few nonsense. For his two main characters, Rob Marshall uses two famous Chinese actors who had previously joined in a hidden tiger hidden dragon. Marshall has probably seen one Chinese film and they represent Japanese culture. Re-watching these two actors makes movies even funnier. Kuentine Tarantine's last scene in Kill Bill # 1 is ten times stronger than this movie.
