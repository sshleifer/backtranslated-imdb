It is painful to watch, not fully empathy with the struggles of characters. Two of the main characters, Cinthia's mother and Monica recognize their daughter, they spend a large part of the film pathetic, mevling and bitter ticking. Their characters are so firmly convinced that their redemption into a tolerable person after a fast family catharsis is incredible. It was not worth the wait. I want a decent porch for honesty among families to have less headaches for watching.
