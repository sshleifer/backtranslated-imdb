There were many really great horror films produced in the 1970s - but this film is certainly not one of them! It's a shame that the child is not better, because it works from a decent idea that takes a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. We have an idea of ​​a vengeful child, which worked so well in classic films like The Bad Seed, and then we have a central zombie theme, which was, of course, the backbone of many successful horror films. The plot is basically this: a young girl blames the burden of the people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the cemetery and raises the dead to revenge (as well as you). Everything is good and good, except that it's boring! Nothing happens to most of the movie, and even though it eventually climbs up with someone nice up there; it is not enough finale to justify sitting through the rest. Obviously, the film is budgeted, because the sites look cheap and all actors are trash. I can not say much about the movie, because there is not much to do. The child is a horrible movie from the seventies and I certainly do not recommend it.
