About 15 minutes, my wife already wanted to leave. Not so much about the material, but because of its lack. They decided to fill in gaps in which funny things should be from as many languages ​​as absolutely vulgar speech. If it were emptied (very rare), we would sit and watch (not laughing, watch out for you) and wait for the next coarse or offensive remark. After about 35 minutes, we both got up and left. All we read was that this was great. The trailer looked good and Roger Ebert actually called it "intelligent" and said it was not a rough sexual comedy. Did he go into a real movie? Together with Be Cool, it's the only movie I ever came out ... and I'm not complaining. I'm sick of trying to see comedies in America.
