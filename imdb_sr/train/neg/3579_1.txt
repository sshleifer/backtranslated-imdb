Immediately after renting and watching this movie a few years ago, my friend and I decided to define an absolute zero on the movie scale. There was nothing in the movie that could have been worse than it was. To this day, we still rate movies, even very badly, how much better than "lonely ladies", as they are. I've long seen an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote scenarios for, among others, "Last Summer" and "Diary of the Mad Housevife", and she said that she asked to write a scenario for the book by Harold Robbins "The Lonely Ladi". She said she had been treated and denied her because she did not think she understood the difficulties of a female screenwriter in Hollywood. Then she said: "I think they have someone else to write it." The interview was made before the film was released. She died in 1981 and I bet that the first thing she did when she came to heaven was to thank God personally for saving her from participating in the result.
