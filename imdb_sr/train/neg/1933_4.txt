Final Score (average of a variety of classic movie quality - acting, image, creativity, profitability, humor, entertainment, etc.): 4.3 (out of 10) Had "Atlantis: Lost Empire "came out a few years ago and would look like a brave, serious new direction in Disney animation. However, it comes only a year after the innovative and almost genius "The Emperor's Nev Groove" and marks a step back in releasing Disney from its repetitive "Disney Formula". I am a great fan of feature films of Disney. I have to see them all like or hated. "Atlantis" is an animated return of "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" and similar live sci-fi live from the 50's and 60's. The problem is that this version barely contains one original idea. I feel like a remake of something, even more than the actual Disnei's treatments (Tarzan, Notre Dame Grbav). The characters are just more than the walking clich√©s of the usual suspects who typically inhabit this type of film (strange mechanic, gung ho general, daring tough women). In addition to Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner), the supporting actor is uncomfortable. The film also suffers from a brief pace. Instead of telling it in an epic story, Disnei stuck many times in the most short run time because of the ability to develop ... suspensions, characters, anything real. They entangle us into this new and miraculous world and barely let us go back. An unpleasant tempo sometimes confuses what is a relatively simple story. The animation is dark and dull and cheap. This thing looks like a robbery on Saturday. Let's hope they did not forget that 2D traditional animation can still be wonderful. The Iron Giant proved it. Negative: visual effects, tempo and ordinary lack of originality. Positive: It's a very nice scene of death for Disney for a long time. It's the creative peak of the film.
