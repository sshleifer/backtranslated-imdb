Really, when everything comes down to it, this movie is simply not funny. Josh Kornbluth is an antisense funny, yet he thinks he's hilarious. The sending of 17 letters was initially good, as long as Josh's "look at me, I'm an unwanted" approach did not begin to attack every scene. Judas Priest's joke might have been the least fun thing I've ever been told, and that's pretty little, because he has strong competition from all the other jokes in the movie. As for the incredible excessive use of Picasso's Debaser, I have only one thing to say: What did Pickie ever do to deserve this fate? What did someone do with Josh Kornblutt to get him to write / direct / produce / star in such an awful film?
