Linne Ramese makes arrests of images, and Samantha Morton can invoke a feeling of gesture. So, it's hard to discover their talents that are spent on this imaginary, pretentious joke. Ramsay can not revive Callar. Her attempts are too artistic and hairy. Her camera is repeatedly held back in the long silent shootings of an agonist actress, as if only Morton's wiped look could give a character. We are in an empty Varholian hell of self-reliance: for a movie that has enough minutes for the bumps on the floor, you can think that it could be rounded up to his pronunciation of the protagonists. But how will it do so if it rarely speaks? Without the internal monologue of the novel, Celluloid Morvern Callar is no one. No wonder Ramsey often dragged on Morton. However, the first ten minutes was so impressive, recorded and arranged that my hopes rose. Give the movie so much: it knows how to promise, if not how to keep it.
