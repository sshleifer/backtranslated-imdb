This film has become one of the top 10 films. Terrible. There was not an uninterrupted minute in which there was no fight with one or the other monster. There was no chance for any character development, they were too busy running from one sword battle to another. I did not have any emotional attachment (except for the big bad machine that they wanted to destroy). The scenes were apparently stolen from other films, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. Examples <br /> <br /> The spiritual scene was eventually stolen from the last scene of the old Star Wars with Iodine, Obee One, and Vader. The spider initially was the same as Frodo was attacked by a spider in the Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is a victim in both films) and waits ...... he hypnotizes (stabs) his victim and wraps them ... hello? The whole machine against people's theme was Matrix .. or Terminator ..... There are still more examples, but why waste time? And will somebody tell me what's with the Nazi?!?! Nazi's ???? There was one story about minors who rushed to a juvenile conclusion. The film could not decide whether it was a children's movie or an adult movie, and there was not much. Just terrible. Real disappointment at the very least. Save money.
