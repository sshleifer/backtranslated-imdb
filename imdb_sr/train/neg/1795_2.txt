I had the opportunity to watch this movie as a member of the test audience, and the only thing that kept me in the seat was the opportunity to fill in the post-screening survey. I felt that the biggest problem of film was the lack of a major complication. Instead, it is composed of (too many) plenty of sub-boards competing during the screen. As a result, there are not any characters that are sufficiently developed to allow the audience to form any kind of attachment. What the director and producer did not do is show us why we care about what will happen to the characters. In fact, any sub-plot and characters associated with it could have been completely removed without serious damage to the film. (The time available would allow for the much needed development of the remaining sub-parcels and characters.) Simply put, the Hungry Bachelors Club board is overloaded with attachments and areas where it is desirable.
