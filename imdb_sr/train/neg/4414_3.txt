Christopher Durang must have been taught by an unforgettable horrible nun, since he simply can not give up the concept. The play, "Sister Marie Ignatius explains everything for you", was introduced - at least in Hollivood - exactly in the same tone as Diana Keaton's lectures here. Sister Mary was an overworker, a puppet, a bitter satira of a bright, self-confident, doctrinal, and very convincing nurse-and how she played Linn Redgrave, she was ridiculous. But the film insists that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously - while, as we mentioned, keeping the same tone in "explains all" scenes. Two approaches clashing upside down and for the last twenty minutes the film leaves the trail, plunges into the gorge and explodes. No survivors. It could work if the tone of a scene with four former students and their meeting with her sister Mary is the same as the scene of sister Mary. Or if the scenes of Sister Mary are presented more realistically. This method simply does not work.
