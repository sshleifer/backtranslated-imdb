I did not like this movie at all! First of all, I do not know why, but everyone here says Clemence Poes is great, which in my opinion is absolutely wrong! She is not like Natasha: another look, another character ... Worse yet, she is a very inexperienced actress and she could not play that role! Destroy heroin completely! It was really disgusting to watch her play! In my opinion, it would be much better to give this role to the Russian actress, because it would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for the Russian person. Unfortunately, Kutuzov looked like a drunken man who did not shave for 2 weeks and defeated the battle in which he lost his eye ... (Thank God, in this movie are some actors, whose game was great! That Alessio Boni was very well overcome I was pleasantly surprised! He is one of the few people who read the book, which is very important for the show. The only thing I liked in this business were very nice looks and incredible dresses! My advice is to read the book and you understand the true meaning, the goal by which Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and perhaps realize the whole idea of ​​the book ... 1 of 10
