Frankly, I consider this film another bad effort by the Dominican film industry. The first 30 minutes of the film are a bit funny, but when they change their role in society (men do what women usually do, and women do what men usually do), the film falls. You become boring and not funny at all. They left many things without explanation and the end of the film is predictable. I did not like the way Roberto Angel played his character and his little one. I went to the cinema theater in the hope of seeing a good job, but I came out really disappointed. I do not recommend this film.
