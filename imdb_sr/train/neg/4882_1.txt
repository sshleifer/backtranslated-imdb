There are some bad films. Most of them are fun. "Criminal crazy 1" was one of those moves. It was so bad that it was pleasant and that he looked at him again. "Criminal Crazy 2" must be one of the worst films ever made and come from me, that's a lot of talk because I'm not the type of person who says anything is the worst. But believe me, this was completely terrible and running only 1 hour is too long for 1 hour. The film has a rather incoherent story, but who cares for the story when everything is what you want to see a big fat woman running around and kills people because she does not feed. Well, you can not see this in this movie, except for all the flashback sequences that are from the first. The new story could have been really funny because Ethel was sent to the house halfway and killed everything in it, but nothing has happened to the last 20 minutes of the movie and you're already asleep. Working with the camera in this movie is terrible. This literally reminds me of something that I shot with my friends when I was 15 years old. The sound quality is something else that you can not understand the word most characters say. To give an example of how badly it is, go to the underground railway in New York and try to understand what is being said through the speakers, so that sounds like this. It does not matter what they are talking about because the actors are too dry like dead wood. Now I know that saying this is the worst movie there is pretty sharply, but words I can not describe how bad this movie is. If you do not believe me, see for yourself. 1/10
