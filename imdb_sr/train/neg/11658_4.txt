Scari Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films, as there are not a lot of complications, bad acting, pretty boring and some really joking jokes. But. And this is great, but there is one good actor, one good repetitive joke, and a good start. A good actor, Tim Curri, a good joke that is constantly repeated, is a creepy, weird butler with a disgusting hand that always dares, but laughs. A good start is the grief of the Exerciser. The plot for Scari Movie 2 is the main character from the original and a multitude of new characters on the road are invited to spend the night in the creepy night old castle, but will they survive the night? This movie is not very good, but if you can barely watch it!
