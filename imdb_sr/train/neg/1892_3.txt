I read the comment from Chris_mgranta from the United States. He wrote, "A fantastic 1924 documentary, I like to thank Chris and the people who are interested in Bakhtiari Nomada from Iran, Zagros Mountains and landscapes and watched the film Grass, A Nation's Battle for life These traditions you have seen in the film last for centuries and will last as long as they live. "I am from this region of Iran." I am Bakhtiari. "Chris, I am sorry to disturb you, but the Bakhtiari region of Zardkhu is in Iran, not in Iraq, as you mentioned in your comment. Iran and Iraq are two different and different countries. The ranch for the Iranian is almost like taking the American for a Mexican. Thank you, <br /> <br /> Ziba
