Hopalong Cassidy with a horse that is not white and does not call Topper? Go figure! This travesty makes a great injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes, Hopalong Cassidi. The actor who plays it is young in relation to the old, blonde to white hair and kills people in relation to shooting from the hand. Will the Hopalong rise? One of the worst movies ever made and, believe it or not, the person who brought us the saga of a grandfather!
