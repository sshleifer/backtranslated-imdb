This is a very inexpensive movie about the wolf. The video is dark and poorly lit. The sound is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed. The scenario is clich√© trash with common characters like a hard detective who shoots a wolf with his silver pistol! [filled with silver]. The acting is as wooden as the characters. FKS does not exist, many extreme major insect plans and biting. The only thing that is shown is a lot of soft core T & A. Instead of dropping $ 30 for this trophy, check out the really recent recent inferno: "Dog Soldiers" with Sean Pertvee.
