The film begins with a promise, but it takes too long in the Sepia world of distance and alienation. We are left, but without anything else we can save the poor images of the grave and imaginary male faces to enjoy. Certainly there is no rope to the wall to help us climb. It's a shame, because the concept is not without merit. We wonder why a loved couple - father and son - no less - should be so distraught from the real world that their own world is more desirable when it is claustrophobic above all imagination. This loss of presence in the real world is, quite obviously and unnecessarily, contrary to the son who has applied to the armed forces. Why not in the circus, so we can at least appreciate some color? There is a stupid sense of loss, but unfortunately there is no enlightenment, which is confusing since the film is obvious about some form of achievement that is not available to all of us.
