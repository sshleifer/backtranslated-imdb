This movie was the worst movie I ever watched. It was like a "homework" for movie lessons. Fully misses the sign when it comes to the "message", TRIING tells it. The characters are exaggerated, bad acting and a plot ... and this is extremely funny. The cover story is what led me to think it's a decent movie, the co-actor is handsome and that's all. The Moral of This Movie: NEVER MOVE THE FILM ON THE MOVE! Save time, money and energy and make your home movie and you'll be far better than me. It was painful to watch and honestly, I'm surprised that someone would spend money to make and distribute it!
