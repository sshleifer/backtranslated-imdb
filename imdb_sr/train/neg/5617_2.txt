This documentary is based on incomplete consideration of evidence, in which Brian Fleming, perhaps deliberately, does not mention important evidence of the opposite. Perhaps his most important mistake is one of the earliest: His claims of inadmissibility of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ ignore key facts, such as: ** The existence of some formulated beliefs in Paul's letters. These religions suggest that most of the central claims of Jesus have already been formulated in the statements of faith, probably in a few years of Christ's death and resurrection. ** The testimonies of early Christians can not simply be dismissed as a mere fantasy. There were really many people who claimed to be Messiah during that period, but only one of them remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would be absurd for anyone to truly believe that Christ the Messiah, and to continue to die for those beliefs, if they know that he has not risen. ** Even if the Gospels are dated more liberal, we are still talking about Jesus' records in the lives of other eyewitnesses who would point to inaccuracies in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospels have been written much earlier. What I'm saying is that Flemming's documentary is incredibly biased and a self-serving part of the work that encourages the various arguments and evidence to serve his anti-Christian view. Do not be fooled by a bad investigation.
