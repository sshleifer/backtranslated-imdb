In his short 40 years on Earth, author Jack London has managed to embrace as many adventures and incidents as possible. This 90-minute film, supposedly a biography of man's life, but apparently fictionalized, does not even scratch the surface, and remains a story that is very ripe for modern Danish persuasion. Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his first roles, shows London, and his performance is cruel and cute. He is not a problem here. Neither is young and very beautiful Susan Haivard, who plays his future wife, Charmian, whose biography of London is "the basis" for this film. Life in London is here divided into a series of episodes, which the film easily skips. So, we have short incidents with London like oyster pirates, seal in the Bering Sea, golden scout in Iukon and a correspondent during the Russian-Japanese War ... colorful events, surely, but barely gave something like a deep treatment. And the direction of Alfred Santel (also directed one of Suzanne's first films, "Our Leading Citizen", 1939) is at best rude. The fact is that here is the hottest DVD with a bad source and crazed sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie, for me, was one of the DVD add-ons: a catalog of all the Alpha Video films, with hundreds and hundreds of color films. Let's hope these films are in better shape than "Jack London"!
