Roman Polanski has made many, many films that are unusual. His glory confuses me. Nothing stands out as a peak except the Chinese Quarter (I have not seen 'Knife in the Water' or 'Tess'). Every contribution he made for the film was completed more than twenty years ago; his work is just shameful, safe and / or boring (Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, Ninth Gate, Pirates). out. It's a bow-produced and fairly high concept for the 1968 horror film (it never shows the baby). But this is only a misunderstood horror. Everything is artistic to the extent that the line of complication becomes hopelessly clear very early (hm, thanks for that title that destroys the finals), and on a clear day you can see how the turn ends for days. That did not keep my interest. I think that whatever this film was, it was completely exhausted by the 1960s version of what femininity is. Farrow is such a chronically disturbed, helpless homeless housewife. Her fragility is oversold ... she is irritating in extreme terms. There are no real ideas in it ... nothing to be considered except that the mother of the devil. Dakota is scarcely used for its ghostly potential.
