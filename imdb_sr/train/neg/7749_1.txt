This film should never be recorded. From badly performed animation, through bad acting. I'm not sure at what time the people behind this film said, "Okay, it looks good! Come on!" I was in awe of how horrible this film really was. At one point, which may have been the worst, computer-generated tooth of golden gold falling from the roof that bites the idiot creator of the cats in the mouth ... uh, oookkkk. Zlikovac in the film was a paralyzed sabreton who was killed a few minutes after the first appearance. The other two managed to kill a handful of people before they were burned and killed. Then, there is a random person waiting for the jungle victims ... which scares me for one single reason. Will there be a second part? God, I do not hope for the welfare of people everywhere. This film was a clean garbage. From the credit from the point point to the end of the slide shov.
