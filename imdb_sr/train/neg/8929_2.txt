This hawk-podge, adapted from the novel by Gore Vidal (actually one of the great American writers), makes MAGIC CHRISTIAN and VALLEY OF THE DOLLS look like Fellini art works. Rakuel Velch, with an incredible body (and not really too high) in the lead (except for KANSAS CITI BOMBER when she was pretty good) playing Rek Reed (a bad reviewer of the movie, not a critic) of the alter ego, only to be surrounded would be expensive kueen (big chick) Mae West, angry John Huston, young and naive Farrah Favcett (pre-Lee Majors, what a shame), and other miscellaneous azoids - to pretend to lie to VAI too many things may have nothing to do but inter - old video films (ie Vidmark in KISS OF DEATH, Lena Horne) ... only to be able to continue bleed the life of all. 2 out of 10. Best Performance = ?. It's so bad, it's worth a look!
