It seems that this film starts in the middle, introduces peripheral players as important and represents the main characters without any substance and paper and / or impenetrable background stories. Almost no one has credible or notable motivation for his actions in this film. The action is rising and ultimately not going anywhere, the dialogue is sloppy and banal, and the director has a small concept of getting the best of his actors. It looks like there is the first half of this movie, but it's never made. We were told that the mysterious pyramid appeared above New York and that the Central Park inexplicably became an Arctic desert. However, none of this seemed to cause great anxiety in the general population and that it was only of minimal concern for the government. We are introduced to the "evil corporation" in Eugenia, but it is a really suitable idea of ​​settling the universe with several energy-powered officials. The entire "Eugenics-is-bad" double tendency is a heavy hand and never really moves. We should take care of the central characters, but we never learn enough about them to know why. So much for this world is underdeveloped or completely underdeveloped to come as a 1-hour, 40-minute fatalistic rationalization for rape. In the "revolutionary" digitally animated world that has been created here, I can say that it was about the same time that this movie was filmed, a few other directors were doing the same thing with more seamless and convincing results. After you spent time watching this movie, the worst question left in my mind was "so what?"
