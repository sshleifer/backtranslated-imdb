Once again, the same known story about a man (a writer here) who sells his soul to the devil to have the most wanted ambition in life: success. A meaningless script (we should "go home and write better"), ridiculous lines to understand a "strong" "Christmas" message (our only aspiration in life is to find love, respect and good friendship) and a long process of the scene at the end where Agent Hopkins has defeated the devil (Jennifer Love Hevitt is not sexy or not at all evil) for all the bad things that made her incomprehensible. It was not a bad effort by actors (Baldwin is also a director, Cattrall in the role of "Sex and the City", Aikroids with some funny lines in his limited role). P.S. Try not to make such a popular movie from Greece called "Alloimono Stous Neous", a brilliant adaptation of this myth (the old man gives the soul a devil to return his youth)
