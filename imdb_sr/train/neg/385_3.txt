Poorly written drama of the plot / mystery about the possibility for the public to introduce the public to the public. Vlaschiha plays gay researchers in search of answers - which in this foggy plot would be hard to find. Despite the fact that the cinema itself is praiseworthy, the camera is a hungry character of true depth rather than a shallow, amateur act, unfortunately it must pass. Grade: D +
