I think I've already seen such things: college graduates do not realize that it's pretty good to them all the time, complaining that their lives are bad. and the reality of the bite of what I can do: they practically have the same plot. If anything good came from this snoring-fest, it was music. That was it. As far as I'm concerned, I'm not impressed ... but again, I never expected anything less. The film was directed by the same person who directed Batman and Robin; another movie to be watched only with a blindfold. Now for judgment: it's 1 out of 10.
