OK, I and my friend rented this a few days ago because we like to watch b-movies because we do it ourselves. In any case, the cover page contained bloody and strange naked girls with little eyes and things ... and Tom Savini! There is simply no way this movie will fail! Right? vrong !! Looks like such a loss! There was really no story, the dialogue was terrible (does anyone have? KS 1000 !!!), the characters were ... well, they really lacked any personality ... The effects were terrible ... and what with this rainbow art shots of frightened people running around and doing nothing ... with extreme close-ups of the eyes and things? We sat the entire movie and waited for something ... what happened ... but no ... "oh, here they are nymphs! Beautiful! Oh ... they are kissing ... again ... and now for OK .. nothing really is happening ... again ... oh, now running around ... and closing his eyes ... again ... oh, here's Tom Savini! ... right ... OK, maybe now to happen something cool or even interesting .. no .. oh! cool! cut off head! end ... oh shit .. "And finally, since I'm so full I'll tell you this! Give me a van, six actors, a strange looking house, Tom Savini, a couple of naked girls with ankles and buns of blood, and I can make the best movie you've ever seen ... I shot movies with a zero budget. in two days that has better effects, better acting and a better scenario than this ... what does this Johannes do? Making cool movies is easy! It could have been so great ... I'm really upset!
