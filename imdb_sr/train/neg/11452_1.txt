If I could evaluate this film of 0 I would have! I see some ppl on the IMDb says this is the funniest movie of the year, etc. etc. Excuse me? do you LPN snorting LSD or ........? There is nothing funny about this movie. Actually I want 27 minutes back from my life I spent watching this shit. I read someone who sits on a plane watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes, I completely realized, actually I would be watching snakes on the plane 2 times instead of watching this movie once! DO NOT watch this movie, do something else useful with your life make cookware, walk the dog, hell ... it's all better than spending time in front of the TV watching a hot rod.
