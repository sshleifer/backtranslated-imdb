I watched the whole film to a shameful ending, even though I felt so angry at what I saw. I felt that the director screamed for the attention, and the only way to achieve this was to be as repulsive as possible. Since I lived in the UK, I loved this country, but this film shows the British young people in the worst possible way. There is nothing that can be said, but avoid it, it will make you angry and sick. People involved should be ashamed.
