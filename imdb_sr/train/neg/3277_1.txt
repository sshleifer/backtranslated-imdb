If you've ever watched Dukes of Hazard, you know that you never had to worry about drugs or curses or rough behavior seen by children. If you've seen a movie you know, it's no longer the case! This movie is HORRIBLE! The main characters who make drugs and think it is funny and cool is certainly not what I call fun. They took a great show and turned it into trash. Daisy, who was a bit of a cocktail in the original show, now looks and behaves as though she is at the corner of the street and pays for her services. I was so excited to see this film before it came out, 15 minutes into a movie that I was ready to leave. I stayed to think it had to be better, but it became worse instead. I wish I never saw this movie. He broke up a good show and left me just a terrible taste in my mouth when I left. Do yourself a favor, go to see something worth your money, because it's not just a loss of money, but a loss of 2 hours of your life you will never return!
