I rarely give less criticisms of a show or a movie I do not like on the IMDb, but Mighty Morphin Pover Rangers is so painstakingly horrible that it's terrible. animated series - it would have been better in this way, I suppose, but as a live-action shov, it typifies the terms 'cheesi' and 'camps'. Of which is Pover Rangers. Five colorful, spandex carrying teenagers struggling with evil using their martial arts skills. Costumes are terrible - they look like something that resembles what athletes and women's gymnasts will wear. The act is sad, and the choreography of the fight is so shockingly bad and so bad to see it, it makes Jean-Claude Van Damme, as good as Bruce Lee, which is in itself unspoken. In fact, they look like jumping and dancing; as if it was a version of 'Nutcracker', or they did a ballet, not a fight. In addition, there are some caricatures that characterize martial arts, and yet it's a fun but not so syrusy way to look stupid. Kids play or not, this is just so miserable and at the limit of absurdity. Although this version is set in America, you might be forgiven when you think that while watching some of the sequences of the fight, they have not been filmed in the United States, but in Japan; so it's a bit 'fake' fight and a shot borrowed from the Japanese version - just to compare it with the American version.
