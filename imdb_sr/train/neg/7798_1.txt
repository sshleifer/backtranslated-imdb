This overview is based on a Shock-o-Rama video posted on the non-serving world of 2002. How bad is it? It's terrible, what's '1' on the IMDb scale - but it's much worse than that. It's good to imagine that original German-language printing could improve things - English comedy is not funny at all - but true, this is one of the worst amateur movies of any genre you'll likely see. Zombies in the movie are slow and clumsy as always, and they seem to have no ability to speak or think about anything beyond their next meal. However, they are also intelligent enough to do chainsaws and malicious enough to know that the western taboos about genitals will undoubtedly revive their conversation at the table. The land of the novel by George Romero has set up a zombie nation that has maintained social coherence; here, zombies are nothing but an empty canvas for the perverse imagination of director Andreas Schnais. Absolutely without redemption of social value, and worse, completely missing as a party, Zombie '90 is a bad joke for anyone who spends money on it.
