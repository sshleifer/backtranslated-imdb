"Sleeping with the enemy" is predictable, "it was there before" a thriller who never finds any inspiration no matter how desperate she is and what the team is trying to do. I can not believe that a bunch of my friends persuaded me to see this in movies some sixteen years ago. The complete lack of originality from the scenario of Ronald Baas (based on the Nancy Price book) does not help or staged the direction of Joseph Ruben or the very average performance of Julia Roberts. Supporting actors, including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson, help little. There is really not much to say. Just miss it. Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoits Cinema Center Melbourne
