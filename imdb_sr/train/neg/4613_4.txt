So what is it then?! I found Nicholson's character shallow and unfortunately uninteresting. Character Angelica Huston has exhausted my power. And Kathleen Turner is a dirty, not a good slut. It's not that I do not understand it. It's not that I do not think that some of the ideas could lead to something more. This is a movie that has nothing to do with the idea that we need to accept these ideas, and that's what the movie is about. The fact that Nicholson falls behind Turner is absurd, but again, the intention is to be so. This, me it does not, however, act as a.) Funny, or b.) ... still interesting! This was a waste of my time, so do not let Hyper get you the best ... it's a waste of your time! With all that, he said, the order of opening the church is pretty nice ...
