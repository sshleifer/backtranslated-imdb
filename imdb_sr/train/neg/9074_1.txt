Another project in the domain of teenage comedy, set on college campus, featuring task dumb to cool, and how he decides to blackmail the three top athletes to get him to get a girlfriend. Everything was done earlier, and everything was done in a satisfactory way. Creepy humor who did not have a teenage shifts like "American Pie" and "Dude! I Vhere's Car" so popular, it is left out of context in this sequel, appearing so completely by chance that the viewer can only frown and not approves. The film is poorly written, and actors never fail to make any of them more bearable. I will not even take away this terrible picture by discovery, because it is the loss of my time and yours. At best, Slackers never fail to entertain or cause laughter, and in the worst case, it is incredibly bad and sometimes completely elusive. <Br /> <br /> Jason Schvarzman, who impressed his debut Rushmore, degrades the appearance of this figure and asks how a career can end up in the toilet so fast. Please avoid, avoid. Save money.
