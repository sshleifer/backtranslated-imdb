And how many actors can they get to fit on their own neurotic, compulsive uber-non-yorker person? In this film Voodoo plays Vill Ferrell in what is mercifully less direct imitation than what Kenneth Branagh did in Celebrity. Now this is a boring story: a nebulous, neurotic man with a woman or girlfriend falls in love with the siksa queen on which he projects all manner of perfection. Everyone lives in the perfect gigantic apartments in the great Manhattan settlements, everyone continuously supports expensive, exclusive restaurants in which all the characters connect fascinating anecdotes and discuss mysterious philosophy, there is always a journey to Hampton where the nonessential main character is releasing sand and physical effort and possible exposure to diseases , and, of course, said the main character feels guilty of his lust for the Queen of the siksa, but he is persecuted, sometimes thrives, sometimes fails, etc. This tired formula, and proof that Alen is not at all a big film artist at all. He just looks like a dirty old man with libido and emotions of a twenty-year-old who intends to repeat the same dreary old stories over and over again.
