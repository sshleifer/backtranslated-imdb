I really disliked this film when I saw it at the age of 6 or 7, because I was a big fan of Robin Villiams and nothing he could do was bad. To this. This whole garbage ruined Robin for a long time. I recently recovered with his ridiculous but serious role in Father's day, but then he continued to make another mistake. So far, Robin should get much better jobs, and now he is back in the performance of the mucus that came with this 'classic'.
