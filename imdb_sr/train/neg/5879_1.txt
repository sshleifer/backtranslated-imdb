I wonder how the actors acted in this film. Annette Bening was really alone, half and a half, whether she acted or was natural? It did not matter, given that even if she walked across the ceiling, she would not change the pattern of the film. Brian Cock acted very well. I almost thought that he always behaved like this, cunningly, dishonestly, in a dirty environment where nobody worried about hygiene. As far as Gwyneth Paltrow is concerned, the question is what she did in this film. This film is pretty tedious and disgusting. Who would pay to see such a shit?
