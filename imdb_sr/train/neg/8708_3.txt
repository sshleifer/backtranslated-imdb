Like all Carnosaur movies, this is a joke. The way dinosaurs move, reminds me when my sister plays with dolls, because they can not be harder or lighter than they were. The action did not make any sense. I mean, they are first on the bus, then in the warehouse, they are suddenly on board. And let's be serious, does it make sense for a pair of dinosaurs to stay together on a van or on a ship? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can stand on a moving van. Sounds stupid even when you think about it. The only reason I gave this is 3, because it is still fun. I found it better than the first one (I have not seen it yet). Just do not rent it. I saw him on TV and it's good that I did it because I would not want to spend money by renting it.
