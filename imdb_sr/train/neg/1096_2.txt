While some training scenes were realistic, they were too described by military instructors as former Nazi types. Obviously, the people who wrote the film were either against military types or they wrote a movie for that audience. the way some of them were probably still serving in the military prison. I really liked the scene in which the "hero" and his friend (both soldiers) sat in the captain's office, smoked cigarettes and talked and cursed with the captain as if they were their friend. Such things never happened in training or in a formal situation, as was the purpose of the scene. In the end I was wondering: "What was this film about?" how it seemed to wander around without any focus except "I hate all the authorities." Thank God I got it from the library and I did not pay to rent it.
