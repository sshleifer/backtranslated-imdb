... and I actually gave him a ZERO on a personal scale of 1-10. I attend films since 1952 and I see over 1000 in the theater (I do not evaluate films I see only on TV). This is THE ONLY movie I rated ZERO. My wife and I took four children (then 15, 11, 8 and 6 years old), and even the children thought it was terrible. In fact, my daughter (now 26) warned me of this site (stunned that the film got a total score of 4+). The dinosaur animation looked amateur at that time (and worse in retrospect), acting (especially Shaun Yang) is terrible and the story is simply stupid. <br /> <br />
