This is a film that is firmly in the 50s. It is surprising that the American Film Institute chose this one for the top 100 American films of all time. I've seen practically all the movies on that list, and this one was most disappointing one of them. Music numbers (and many, many of them) are VERY long lasting and boring, and absolutely have nothing to do with the story. The end of the movie has an awfully long ballet sequence, which, of course, has no real connection to the film story. It must admit that it is very well made, the music is fine, and the dance with the highest professional standard - but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the movie. The main character of the movie is extremely childish and unsuitable and acts rude. His mental age is around 14. If you want to see a good musical made on the "golden age" of a musical, go and see "Singing in the Rain."
