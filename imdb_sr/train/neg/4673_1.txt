I love books Henry James and Washington Skua was not an exception. I was very excited to see a new film that appears on the basis of a book of that title. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin is good enough to play the lead roles. Albert Finney is wrong and does not play a good role. I wanted to kill Maggie Smith ... or rather her stupid, insulting role. The real problem and lack of this latest version is a good script, music and direction. I fell asleep in the theater watching this long, drawn and extremely boring movie. The dialogue has more breaks than Pinter Plai. In the book I felt a deep concern for Catherine Sloper and her life. The film had the opposite effect. I also did not like when aunt had sexual attraction to Morris. Eeeeeeeek. IUK. Take care if you can not sleep, it's definitely snoozer. Do not look if you are depressed. You will need Zoloft after this. Of course, "The Heiress" was remarkable with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the lead roles. The actor who played her father was considered a carefree, cold dad ... who still complained about his dead wife and hated Catherine for this. The film was not loyal to the book, but not even this one. This film was a flop at the box office. I do not doubt why.
