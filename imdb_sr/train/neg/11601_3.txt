The Nightmare in the Elysian Street: The Dream Child, the fifth sequel in the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the worst continuation ever in the series, even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was fortunate to get Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box set for my birthday and I watched all the sequels. The child of dreams was the worst without a doubt, and I was surprised because they were so well-balanced with the last two sequels. But I guess they just lost charm, the story was just funny and I was not happy with where it went. Alice became even more boring, she was not Nancy or Kirsten, so her wearing this movie did not work for me. Freddie also loses his fear, it just got a little stupid. Alisa returned and carried a child, she could not be happier with her life. But Freddie is also back and will not be too bright because she won so easily in the fourth film. But nevertheless, he wants his child and is born again in the world. Have you ever wondered if Freddie has parents? Well that's what A Nightmare on Elm Street: A child of dreams explores and Alice soon finds out what Freddie's childhood was and that it may be one thing that can defeat him. Nightmare on the Easter Street: Dream Child is all about bad movie and insult for the series. I do not think anyone can be content with this sequel. Only the story was really silly, I think she might have been able to work, but once again, she was just executed. I know that if you want to see sequels for Nightmare on Elm Street, you should watch it, but I really would not recommend it, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion. br /> 3/10
