I really wanted to like this movie - the location records were mostly filmed in Pittsburgh, and the trailer had an incredible photo. But even for a shot cartoon, it was a really bad movie. Continuity and pacing were simply terrible. The best pieces in the movie are below the final points, so it's (almost) worth it to get to the end (though, unusually, it raises a little in the last half an hour). When the best performance in the Andi Dick movie, you know that there is a problem ...
