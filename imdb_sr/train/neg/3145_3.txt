I'm not sure how connected they are, but I'm almost sure that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie (or the story on which it is based). Very similar, even some scenes and sets look very, very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so check out this. It's moving very slowly, but as a French film late in the 60's, it's also expected from style. Said in retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls who returned to school. Editing flashbacks with current scenes is at first a bit confusing, especially because the sound from each overlap (ie Listen to flashback while you see the current and vice versa). Also, "girls" are a bit old to think they are in the boarding school. Finally, there is not much development in character to even link you to the movie.
