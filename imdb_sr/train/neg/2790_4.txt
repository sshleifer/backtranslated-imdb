Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Man and their son Alec to spend several days with their family on the island of Savage, their own island. The couple expects to resolve their issues over the weekend on a remote island. While waiting for a boat, Julia and Steven meet two strange men in the port, and when her brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that the family of mountain peasants lives on the island. Ruthless Peter smokes a pot while driving a truck in the night and turns the forehead to show up; however, he accidentally overcame the young son of Savage's family, but in the dark he believes he hit an animal. Later, the Savage family claims that Alek is compensating for their lost son. The young family does not accept trade and launches a deadly war among families. "Savage Island" is a very low-budget movie, with a dumb script, amateur cinema, but surprisingly good acting. The wrong story is completely absurd, and there are many incredible situations. For example, how can two men leave two women with a baby on the road during the night with the threat of a disrupted family? The logical procedure would be to leave immediately on the continent and bring the police forces to save Peter. Then a young family disappears; Julia and Steven are leaving cars on the continent and their houses and friends, and no one is hunting them? Peter calls sister Julia from Alex when he arrives at the boat at the beginning. There are so many drawbacks in this movie that I can spend a lot of lines writing about this topic. I believe that this movie was recorded with a home video camera, so the images are so horrible. Good cast earned better material for work. My voice is four.
