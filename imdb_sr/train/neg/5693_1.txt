I can not believe in the positive reviews of this film - I thought it was one of the worst, worst performing and bad acting films I've ever seen. And the plot was completely funny (sp?). It starts to spread with him while he's tied to a chair? Leaf-lease. The worst was that it was not bad even in a good, funny way. Simply awful - I could not figure out why they even tried to show it to HBO. I thought Belushi was ridiculously ridiculous - very incredible as an "eccentric" killer. idk, I could go on - again, I'm shocked with positive reviews. The only thing that prevented me from watching is that it is fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and that makes it bad. And the end did not disappoint his stupidity! "live by the sword, die from the sword ..." funny.
