His Slovakian S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character flashed her tits. It was pretty tight. Before and after the movie, the film hit a lot. The acting is like an E-list and is well presented in the movie. Not to mention that it's such a small budget for Preacherman and Chainsav Charlie to play by the same person. The whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of halfway through a decent movie. The only other reason I liked the movie was that Chainsav Charlie and Doctor Ripper were fun. They said many nonsense they were laughing at me. In addition, if you see this movie on Blockbusters, make everyone hide behind Lavnmoverman.
