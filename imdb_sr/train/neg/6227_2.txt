Good performances can not preserve this terrible scenario, with every clich√© in the book. The two main characters are deeply incoherent, and the scene in which Lora Lynne's character is reminiscent of having sex with a dead husband before a teenager's son - which, in my opinion, should be touching - is just scary.
