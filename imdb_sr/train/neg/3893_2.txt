I thought it was the main character, an astronaut with a bad run case (in his case, his skin, hair, muscles, etc.) I could always get more film work after he was reduced to the puddle. All he has to do is get a job like Blob. The premise of this film is pretty scary. The astronaut is exposed to the radiation of the sun spots (I think), and so begins to behave like ice cream on a hot day. Not only is this confusing, it must obviously kill people and consume their flesh, so it can maintain some kind of integrity of cells. Huh? Have you ever noticed that whenever any radiation accident or experiment occurs, a person immediately turns into a killing machine? Why's that? The astronout has drifted into the night from a "secret object" (which has no security), letting parts of themselves go. Obviously he kept enough memory to head to the launch ramp, perhaps because he wanted to return to space. So begins the part of the movie that is quite full, while the doctor walks around with Geiger's counter, trying to find the man who melts on the buzz that he gives. He kills the stupid fisherman Bill Gates, he scares the girl in Frankenstein's monster movie, and ends up with an elated elderly couple (punishing them karmic for theft of lemon). Then there is a short scene in which he strikes his former general, and a very long scene in which a young dumbman kills and shoots his girlfriend. He would think that after he cut off his hand and escaped, the scene would change. But no ... it took about ten minutes for a woman to sneak into the corner and scream in fear, although the monster disappeared. All I could imagine ... is the girl's director, anybody? The end of the film is even more lamer than the rest. A wet man ends up turning himself into a bunch of gooos, and then ... nothing. That's it. It's the end of the movie. Well, at least that meant there was no place to continue.
