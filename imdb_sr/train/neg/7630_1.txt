A boring film about the boring city of the '50s. How can anyone think this is a classic? The producer has quite completed his career by pushing his girlfriend, Cibil Shepard, in several films that were far beyond her acting ability. I think this film gives an insight into how Peter Bogdonovich's future films will be. Career Cibil Shepard dived after being in several films produced by Peter Bogdonovich. Only "Moonlight" her career began to return. I thought the performance was a bad performance, "Graduate." I noticed that this film was not shown in the US. The only place I was looking at was abroad in Europe late in the night.
