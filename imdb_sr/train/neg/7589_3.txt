What do you expect when there is no script, and therefore nothing a director can do. Hajek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they simply have nothing to say or react. Even the earthquake was pretty bad. And I do not know how carefully the film follows the novel, but the two have emerged from nothing, so they show that Arturo has a nice, warm heart, but some stereotypes are nothing. Even buried Camilla in the desert, instead of returning it to LA. to a nice Catholic burial where at least he could occasionally bring flowers. Pathetic. A set L.A. It's funny graphic created. Anything good? The window into his apartment felt real, curtains, sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. It was from the Snatchers or the Night of the Living Dead, whatever it was.
