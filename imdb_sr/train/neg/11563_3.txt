This Italian semi-horror movie begins very similar to a soft core pornographic film and turns into a mystery that has few to many loose ends to be good, and the fact that it's pretty boring makes this movie quite invisible to my tastes. The only thing that's really worth watching is the many boobs spread through the movie. The story has a guy who, at the beginning of the film, seduces girls in his castle where he continues to lead them to prison, crazy and seemingly killing them. They show nakedness, but they never show murder at this time in the film. Then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and continues to hang out with her and marry her. There is something for the redheads you see as well as his beloved ex-wife Evelin, also died under circumstances that were certainly not the job of spectators. After many scenes with stories, murders, including snakes, foxes and the like, begin to happen. At this point it is easy to understand who is responsible for the killings and what is the motive then you have a meaningless ending in which everything ends not so nicely. This film did not work for me, he left me many questions, and the last third of the film did not have the tits of the first two thirds of the film. Explaining Evelyn's death would help the film, as it would somehow end up where Evelin rose from her grave. The titled title is not entirely wrong because it somehow left the grave, but not under its own power. The blood is very light, mostly because there is a scene with handcuffs and scenes in the end with plenty of blood. I just thought this movie was a bit dull.
