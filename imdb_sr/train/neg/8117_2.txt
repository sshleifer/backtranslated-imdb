"Terrible people" should be the subtitle of this terrible film. If you want to see ordinary people do ordinary things, then watch out of your real-life window. But if you want to see unpleasant people doing bored things, you will have to watch this horrible movie Mike Leigh. The characters speak for a long time, but they never succeed in communicating with one another. Why not? Probably because Leigh things that all of us are ineffective and pathetic as his actors, and he wants to record real life. But we did not, and he fell.
