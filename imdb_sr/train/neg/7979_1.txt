This film was slow, but dull and acting often floated into the ham land. Redgrave's character was implausible as a 60-year-old woman who was trying to compete with Thurman's 20 for Fox's love character (why he is beyond me). The title of the movie should be "Shallow people on the lake". The actors played as if they were on a rehearsal. A terribly predictable ending. I can not believe this on this website as a comedy!
