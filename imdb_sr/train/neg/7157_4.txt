First viewed 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereida): A strange story about a Druid witch trying to capture eternity by inheriting the body of his granddaughter. At least I think it was a relationship. Some kind of spooky quality is held through this film, not like Stephen King. The difference is that in Nicholson's performance there was folly that is not in this film at all. All this is taken very seriously until the end, when some lame single lines and attempts to lighten the mood do not work at all. Performances are not a problem, but the story is. It seems that everything does not agree very smoothly, and the viewer remains a lot of information and there is no real understanding of what happened in the film. There is a very small performance by Christopher Valken as an uncle of the granddaughter, who, of course, gives him a superb fee in an attempt to sell the film. Do not go into this trick and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
