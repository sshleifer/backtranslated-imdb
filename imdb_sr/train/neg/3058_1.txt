When I was a little in the 1970s, the local theater had children's matinees every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (whoever remembers this?). They showed this a year around Christmas. We and some friends went to see him. I was expecting a cool Santa Claus movie. What I got was horribly synchronized (you can say) and a really creepy movie. Something about Santa Claus and Merlin Magician (do not ask me what these two do in the same movie) Satan (some jokes in a ridiculous costume of a devil with horns!). The pictures clattered to my chair. I've always found Santa Claus to start so it did not help. The guy in the suit of Satan did not help. But what actually terrified me was the wooden necklaces that pulled Santa's dreams. When he got into them and the creepy sound they made and the movements - I remember that I had nightmares about these things! All these years later, I remember that I left the theater more than a little upset with what I saw. And my friends were scared. I just saw an ad on TV and all those nightmares came back. This is a creepy, disturbing little Christmas movie that will probably scare the pants from every little kid who sees it. Avoid this - unless you really want to punish your children. This gets 1.
