This is a bad movie by any standard. The story in Match Point had a certain intrigue, direction and writing of a certain fascination (Voody Allen mingled his culture with the culture of classical English murder and explored what could be done with it). Scoop, however, has none of this. Badly written, two tracks are hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest. A genre that underlies requires at least some sort of subplot with witty explanations and links (why are tarot cards and keys held under French horns in locked rooms?). Various Hollywood genres (Curse of the Jade Scorpion / Purple Rose of Cairo, etc.) have given us so much satisfaction over the years. Even Hollivood Ending had a big central idea. Unfortunately, this time inspiration has left him.
