I really wanted to love this movie, but it never gave me a chance. This essentially meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, but it did not work. He constantly feels like they have written and behaved high school students for a school project, and that is the level at which humor is directed. There is no subtlety and, more harmful to mockumentaries, it never feels like a documentary. And while the lines are not at all funny, the attempt to deliver the dead cover would help - certainly, everything would be better than the pervasive reaction to which we are exposed. I recommend this to people who love "comedy" in the veil "Big Momma's House" or "Norbit"; People who think that words like "ass" are inherently hysterical funny. Other people should stay away and not spend their time.
