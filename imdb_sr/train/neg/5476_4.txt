I do not know if this is one of the original movies in the SiFi channel, but that's exactly what it feels like. A cheap action movie with a low budget, which is probably made very quickly, contains funny effects, a lively dialogue and an unclearly faded star that gives it a distinctive mark (funny how 90210 kids are now doing cheap TV movies Ian Ziering plays Cortes, which we know from history a researcher who destroyed the whole population of domicile people as he conquered parts of North America. Here he is not a hero or even compassionate, but as a slim opportunist, his character likely to have been killed if it were not based on historical In this story, Cortes is on a short exploration mission, trying to find something worthy to prove he deserves funding for further exploration of America. He and his men have found a little Aztec tribe troubled by dinosaurs. The real hero of the story turns out that Lieutenant Rios, proven to be honorable, resourceful and wise. He knows the right thing to do in every situation, putting him in opposition with Cortes, and with the young, ambitious bar of the Aztec. Of course, a born girl who is to marry a stubborn Shaman shaman falls on Rios, deepening her anger at the Spanish outsiders. So it's all cliches. Dinosaurs are sent relatively easily. Despite the fact that it takes place in an area that seems wide open, the story is in 95% of the cases taking place in the forest or the village of Aztec, so it is not visually exciting either. I did not even recognize Ian Ziering. They gave him a funny wig and an unconvincing accent, and somehow it disappeared into it. However, he does not appear to be Spanish, but he seems to think that the choice for casting is wrong in every respect. If this film was published theatrical, he would have been separated for Razzie, no doubt. All in all, forgetful.
