Certainly NOMAD has some of the best scenes for riding, fencing and beautiful landscape cinema that you will probably see, but that's not what makes the movie good. It helps, but the story has to shine through all these things. And there Nomad wanders. The story is stiff, giving her the feeling that she was thrown together to make a "cool" movie that "looks" great. Not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region in which this story takes place (and this is obviously with names like Lee and Hernandez). If filmmakers want to hit us in a culture such as Jugars and Kazakos, then they are damn well used by actors / actors who seem to be part. the love interest that separates our "heroes," they are all touched, but with so little influence and screen time that many viewers will drag them aside for the benefit of the next set of battles, the next action scenes of horses or the stunning beauty of the landscape. It is important to note that there were significant changes during the recording of Nomad, especially with the director and cameraman. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov, and Ueli Steiger (cameraman) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In one sense, it seems that Laustsen has a better eye because his vision of the earth made the final cut that we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, moving to Bodrova as a director may not be the wisest choice. By what I see here, the focus is on battles, not on people, what I feel from Bodro's eyes, not from Passer. True travesty. The most embarrassing aspect is that this could have been a really fantastic movie, with a characteristic and action-oriented focus. Unfortunately, the higher people obviously decided that the action was what was needed and took a cheap (intellectually speaking) exit. Although I can not give this film a positive rating, it's worth watching simply for incredible film work. But that's all.
