Scari .. Yes Scari !! Packed with nudity (from fat people to skinny people), Maslin Beach is held on a nudist beach in SA. The first time I saw this movie two years ago - we can say with certainty that it has made a bizarre topic of discussion at school the next day. This movie was horrible! It's hardly a romantic comedy - just a showcase of nudity! This film has reached the lowest point of view while one of the newest characters stared between the legs of the girls. Girl: You will not find God there! Gui: No, but I think I found paradise. Stay away from this, unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics such as farting, adultery, and the genitalization process. AVOID!
