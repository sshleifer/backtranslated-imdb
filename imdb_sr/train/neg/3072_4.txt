Margaret Lawrence probably did not intend to have some of her novels adopted for the film, let alone a stone angel. Hagar, as a character, was the one who constantly challenged a social norm (Gainsai who dares, anybody?), And in the end he almost sacrificed his humanity in that process. Symbols in the book (Stone Angel, Silver Thread etc.) They have permanent reminders of this struggle of old and new, and the slaughter (so to speak) on the road. While the film is reasonably faithful to completing a book (but it's not really a story about telling a story, right?), I think she missed the point of catching the spirit of the movie. Hagar's defiance (because of defiance) was not there. Bram could have been much rougher than he was shown, and Hagarin's father could play more "traditional", so to speak. If the director insisted on stronger displays, the film would take the point straight to the house. In the same way, why should we look at mobile phones, organic products and other modernization? Are we trying to make some points in order to create some points (eg Muslim girls and natives). Hagar and co. in the book everything is, but politically correct, so why should we watch it in the movie version. Modernization can be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but the use of it as an excuse to send subconscious politically correct messages that are completely irrelevant to the novel (and film) seems like throwing the blows below the intellect. There is also an audience. It seems we were conditioned to see the bitter old people as sweet and cute. Why should she laugh whenever the Hagar is on her tantrum? I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted her readers to laugh, or with, Hagar. These people are frustrated and full of sorrow, and we just laugh at them. I think that Hagar and other people in her situation did not have any justice.
