This is one of those films in which the trailer is 50 times better than the film itself. For the first time I saw a trailer in 1991, it looked great. Since then, I've always wanted to see her, but I never found ... ... to date, yes, 14 years later. Let me just say that I was so disappointed with her unreal, I knew very well that she would not be an Oscar winner, but there is still hope that there will be a fun non-brain movie in the blood of blood. Unfortunately, it's not Pooh. What about American rock and roll music and acting was so bad that it was pretty scary. The fight scene was nonsense and the look of this DVD cost me only 5 pounds and I believe I overloaded it with 7 pounds. Now I'm sad because I know I will never get that hour and a half back.
