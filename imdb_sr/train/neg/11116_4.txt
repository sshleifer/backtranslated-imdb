This woman who works as a trainee for a photographer goes home and climbs where she reveals the hole in the ceiling. That's why she discovers that her neighbor is a photographer above her. This film could have a great trick, but then it's complicated of any hope. The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds somebody sneaks heroin. If you were to take out scenes where someone sneaked heroin, then that would be a pretty good movie. Every time I thought that some scene was going on somewhere, somebody breathed white powder. It was really poor to have so much drug use in one movie. Attention attracted the main story and a great story about the photographer. Lesbian things did not bother me. I was looking for an art film. I found a film about the use of drugs.
