This movie was just sick to watch ... not in a good dramatic way that makes you get into emotions for well-developed characters in dramatic situations (yes, I pretty much made that last sentence while I was walking together), but in just one Absolutely annoying way for more than two hours. Now, you all think that I'm just an ignorant who does not respect Shakespeare or "artistic creation of a movie" ... well, in both cases you mistaken. I love the works of Shakespeare, especially the tragedies of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet, and I've watched a lot of "arthouse" movies, such as the superficial and well-made Eraserhead and Fellini 8 1/2. .. but this was just over two hours of Shakespeare's lost translation, too much nudity (I can understand an artistic nudity in some scenes ... but not in every other photo of the movie! NIT for a PRIEST !!!), and in fact only exaggerated film shooting. I had great expectations from this film in that it was said to be "very artistic" and that it was an adaptation of Shakespeare's The Tempest ... but this was only an extreme disappointment. I gave this film only ONLY for the actor Sir John Gielgood's acting performance (which has far outnumbered all the non-names in this movie) and the combination of cinema / scenography, because many scenes looked like motion pictures ... however, much would be better if the picture was just a picture with the text beneath it. The real disappointment ... maybe that Zeffirelli got a director's chair, that would be much better. But this is the opinion of an audience member, many others can enjoy this far more than me. If you do not say this, if you can not find it in nearby video stores (not currently on DVD), do not try to go too far from finding it ... it's not really worth it.
