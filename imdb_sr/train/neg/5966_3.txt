vov! I watched the trailer for this and although 'nah, this is not for me'. I watched the husband and faces of our friend in the trailer, and I knew it was a "children's movie". I mean, hello! a bunch of fish chickens dancing - another striptease? Then I started to watch it, it did not look so bad. so I continued to watch. I watched him all the way. What a great movie. if anything, this is a flicker. these girls have a stance. It's a really good movie and some love stories. really leaves you with a nice feeling. In essence, the story of a little girl from a small city that makes him big in the city, after having passed through the usual big city c ** p. there were a few, it's almost a new urban legend. but it also makes you think of your life and what you have achieved. Well, anyway. I think that this is because the entire work in the bar script is very well known, not only for me, but for many people I know. Do not believe in the trailer for this - the goal is to bring people in.
