Terminus Paradis was remarkable, but "Niki ardelean" is coming too late. We already have enough of this and want something new. Large directors should not have trouble viewing from outside their time, and not behind themselves. Why do people look at Romania only as a post-revolutionary country? Most people do not remember or do not want to remember, and the new generation of movie consumers does not understand a little. This should be the first day of the Romanian film, and not the last song - priveghi! Perhaps the younger directors should make that move.
