Just today, I've picked this up to 99 cents just today, and I still think I'm gone. "Dream to Believe" is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastic drama, and $ 1 is too expensive for this. This film is probably noticed only for two things: 1. It has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. Directed by Paul Linch, a man who also worked on Promo Night. Now on the movie. It is a girl named Robin (played by Olivia D'Abo), who was badly injured in a car accident that also cost her father's life. So the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments, often resorting to her hours and eventually meeting a wildcard named Tommy (played by Keanu). Robin, when she is not in training, works part-time with her mother and a half-sister, in a laundry room owned by her offended fathers. In the end she was selected to compete. All in all, Keanu and some striking 80s melodies are what keep me from giving this 1 star, and it's not one of the worst movies ever, but still far from good. The DVD itself does not receive any medals because it looks like it was purchased from the old VHS and in the end, the sound comes out of sync and when the end credits are almost finished, it fades in black, although the sound can still be heard. So this can probably be transferred as a bootleg. DVD works do not make sense because they have recent photos of Keanu and Olivia, and the background has nothing to do with the film, because it is also not in the film itself, so the front page is obviously photocopied. In any case, avoid at all costs, unless you are a fanatic fan. Probably no longer hanging. I'll probably give it to The Cinema Snob, who is a great IT critic. Hey, if any of you have some shitty movies that they no longer want in their own eyes, feel free to donate to him to keep him safe.
