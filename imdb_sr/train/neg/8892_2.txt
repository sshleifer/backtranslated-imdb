I must admit, this version refreshes Shakespeare in advance! No one can act except for the sister who was my fav! Julia had good skills as a teenager, but she could not give her emotional depth with her lines and we really can never connect with her. She's worse to perform the scene when she thinks she's drinking a beverage ... God stops crying! I would have poured it into my mouth to close it! Anthony Andrevs ... iikes! Given his other great films (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), he's pretty shocking in this. And do not start with Romeo ... puhleasssssee! It's still good to see if you're hunting to see every Romeo and Juliet ever made in the history of the movie. The version of Olivia and Leonard is still the best, followed by the version of Leslie Howard, then the current Leo and Clare!
