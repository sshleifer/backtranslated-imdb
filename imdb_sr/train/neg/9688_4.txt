Greenavai's films are smart, learning and innovative. Nevertheless, his style and grammar encourage and remind the viewers of films made during the Second World War of filmmaking: the frame composition, the use of medium-frame, the static camera. Perhaps it is good to suffer from the mainstream movies with this style, but this is not new. Perhaps, like that other "innovator," TS Eliot, he draws more from the past than looking forward as an authentic innovator or could. Nonetheless, Greenavaia's biggest failure is that she can not write. His dialogue, and even the land structure, is mechanical and logical, but without the vitality of another dramatic logician, Brecht. Where this weakness is most obvious is in its humor, which is ready and logical, so the joke is dead before it is delivered. The result is boring: if it's not funny, it did not work: ask the comedian to justify his act if the audience does not respond. Perhaps a well-read director could learn something from Freud about humor. Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenavai manipulated his actors over the years to work as clones. They speak lines with boring, self-satisfied air like narcissistic adolescents. This film, despite design and lighting, is mysterious.
