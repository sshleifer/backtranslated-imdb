I hired this back in the 1980s and honestly I can not think of anything concrete about the film - just that it's the worst movie I've ever seen. This is not one of those "it was so bad, it was funny". This is not one of those "it was so bloody, it leaves you with a bad feeling" of movies. It was not one of those "what was that?" movies. I can not remember the acting of actors, but it was badly recorded, the story was unconnected and did not have a definite style. When it was over, I was angry that I lost time. I saw many movies I did not understand because of unknown cultures, styles and / or storytelling, but it was clear that these films have some of these features. Incubus does not have it. I was actually thinking that I do NOT comment on this "piece" because of the fear that someone can look at it from curiosity, but I am forced to warn anyone who appreciates the film to skip this film.
