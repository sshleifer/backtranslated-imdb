THE CRIME BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino; Italian crime drama was partly recorded in Hamburg, Germany. A lightly forgotten movie. Even in spite of a good row of car cartoons, this film is almost without aim. New Don takes over a powerful mafia family and fights for their lives. The unwritten laws and ethics of the Mafia Code make everyone's trust more difficult, especially when it comes to millions of dollars. Brutality and violence are back. This can not be put on a shelf with real gangster epics. Only the appearance of the film returns memories to the American ticket. Even the popular American actor Telli Savalas can not raise the caliber of this criminal drama. Antonio Sabato also stars: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
