Do not waste time and money on this. Half-decent actors could deceive you to think that this teenage thriller, although barely ready to break any record, will slowly entertain for 80 minutes. It will not. It will not scare you, laugh, cry or even challenge your intellect. It will ask you how on earth this movie has ever finished production. Yes, it's really so poor.
