In this film, there was not one single factor to buy it. The girl and I both love action movies. Especially combat scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboker were great), but this movie was not fun. Five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of conversations and "angry" facial expressions. The protagonist is a troubled character who has seen the battle and is therefore forced to constantly look seriously. The army disrupted his bow at the top, perfecting his combat technique. Music is not good either. They fight for rap and hip-hop style on the streets, because these types are more violent. The rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise in low-budget drama. All about this movie is a classic B-style. Actors deliver their lines as if reading them on cards, and the lines themselves should be lit and left to burn in a corrupt Hollywood passage. The film is called "Honor", but there was no honor in the making of this film. It was simply a waste of money, and spending is wise, something I consider honest. We will go see Felona. Scenes and situations of struggle are more real.
