OK, so it was written in 1996, before September 11th, so you can give little credit for taking care of terrorists and the idea that the CIA director is plotting to blow this convicted plane out of the sky before it crashes. the world is prophetic. That's it. That's a good thing. Act ... fair. Action ... silly. "Twist" ... unnecessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It's not like nobody ever thought about what to do when the plane was contaminated. Do not you think that the bureaucrats have a manual for "monsters" and how to keep them? The proper execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after Katrine. But they have a plan. They should not be sent to Iceland, and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is transmitted in the air, why did the aircraft door open and the "shooters" stand there without any protection? In fact, has it ever occurred to anyone to shoot her in the legs? It would have stopped it. I always watch a movie to see the end when I started it, but this was a waste of time, and mostly foreseeable. To watch all commercials, it was a plus, that's a good example of why I watch so little TV network.
