These two points are dedicated to the reasonable effect of Aksha Kumar. I know that Bollywood films do not try to be realistic, but PLEASE WALT DISNEY production is more realistic than this. The father dies and does what every good parent ... throws out a son from his son with his PREGNANT wife. A few things that were too heavy for swallowing - 1. Priianka 'cool indoor pool in the bedroom' and going from living hungry in her family in the woods ???????? 2. Akshai suddenly got the job of a stuntman, he was eaten by raffy dogs, then he went away. This film is INSulT to our intelligence I can not really believe that I financially contributed to the 'people' who made this film by taking my family to see her, we left the cinema with frenzy, do not be subjected to this mess watching this is my advice and not you lose your 'vakt'.
