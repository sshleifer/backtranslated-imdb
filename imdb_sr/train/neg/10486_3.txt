My main comment on this film is how did Zvick manage to get credible actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast ?? even for helpful characters, none of which help this movie. Do I have to admit that Tom Hankova's comedy has almost made it worth it? What was it about Tom? Did you lose the bet? The best comedy of the movie was Joe Isuzu - a long classic! The premise is good. Basinger's character, struggling with the existence of Pink Lada, is moving towards a motel in Vegas, a motel that elevates the famous pyramid of cosmetic sales. This is because Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver Elvis's suit so that his ex-wife would soon be motivated? Since they both succeed, they have numerous victories with Elvis's imitators who are on their way to the Elvis Convention in Vegas. Soon, the FBI turns on and begins to track what they think Elvis's imitator is a serial killer. Unfortunately, the premise does not mean that the movie is good. When watching this movie, imagine that you have returned to the first grade? when stories and continuity are not important. It's much more pleasant to watch Basinger looking beautiful in his pink outfit, and he is not wondering why what he does does not make sense. The film works hard, but eventually it becomes shorter. In the end, it was filled with ideas that could theoretically be ridiculous, but in practice they were not so funny. It's not the worst, but you might feel like you're leaving the building when watching this one ???? Do not tell me I did not warn you!
