I think this one is sucked on ice because he left the cube, and he gave us a lot of information about who and why. The original CUBE never left the cube and left everything to your imagination. This shit fest, however, gives you everything. and I did not like it ... Although the act is solid, I think the reason this was bad was that it was done by other people, not by ORIGINAL filmmakers, that Vincenzo Natali did it, or even I continue to think that It would be better and it would be more true to the source. so I recommend you stay away, far from this, and HIPERCUBE, another movie that I do not even want to discuss ... (I gave it only 2 for the acting)
