In spite of the fact that unfortunately it is thought to be (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately this film quickly ends mercifully. The scenario makes little sense, the whole idea of ​​the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is unusually banal, and John Lidon shows us everything in the space of a movie, why it should never have been left to music. Its performance is unambiguous and irritating. The only positive thing to say is that Harvei Keitel manages to make a good turn. His later Bad Lieutenant would show how badly actors can act, but mercifully his performance here is restrained.
