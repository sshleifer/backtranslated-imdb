If there's one thing you can count on Disney, it's their unusual ability to take a story and tell it again and again and again. Even watching a commercial for Lada and Tram II was a terrible experience. Disney will ruin one of its strangest classics ever. He even had that spaghetti. This has already been done! And that's what I say to this apologize directly to the video (the entire concept should be banned). It's all just a repetition of the original movie, and even a few Bluth's bad films. The duo of the penguin and the sea (I even forgot their names) are just a very bad copy of Timon and Pumba. Morgan is another Ursula. She even repeats almost all of her old lines. The songs are pathetic, really hopeless. Never before have I heard such bad songs from them. And the dialogue is terrible. It's pathetic and simple. On the plus side, at least they took time to make the animation a little more decent. All the usual characters are not as boring as they used to be (or maybe minus for fans of a small siren). Back to the negative, Melody is so sweet that she could vomit. I'm almost there. Do yourself and your little Siren a favor. Do not spend money on this. True, it's not as terrible as the Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but it's a little consolation.
