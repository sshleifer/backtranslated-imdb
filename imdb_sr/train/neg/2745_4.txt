Skueamish 11-year-old Luke Benvard (as Billy "Vorm Boi" Forrester) moves to a new city. In their new school, young Benvard were chosen by other guys. They put worms in his thermos. Getting his control reflex under control, Benvard throws a worm on the spotted assailant Adam Hicks (like Joe Guire). Benvard bets can eat 10 worms in one day - without regurgitation! High, teased Hallie Kate Eisenberg (like Erika Erk Tansi) uses her archery skills to help Benwood. Director and former SCTV writer Bob Dolman promises: "No worms have been hurt in making this movie." In a similar note, SCTV star Andrea Martin has one funny scene. "How To Eat Fried Worms" is freely based on Thomas Rockwell's popular novel. Pre-teens should enjoy the movie.
