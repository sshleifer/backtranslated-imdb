(aka DEMONS III) Made for Italian TV although it was filmed in English and was never intended to be a continuation of earlier DEMONS films. It should have been simply called OGRE, as it was issued by director Lamberto Bava. The American family is renting an Italian villa for the summer. Woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams of herself as a girl who goes to the old wine cellar of this villa and encounters a resemblance to a shell-like shell that hangs from the ceiling. It is shining and covered with spider and has what looks like spiders or legs of insects that hang from it. Drops what looks like a green color. Of course, the husband does not believe in this. The villa is just old and creaky and creates strange sounds in the middle of the night and she should ignore it. But then OGRE appears in some kind of 16th-century bone with a look like a dragon head attached to it and drawn by the scent of orchids. Movies are not so bad and at least the dialogue is half intelligent without any ridiculous unfavorable phrases that would lead to dubbing. There are no other blemishes except some skeletons that rot in a pond in a basement that looks like a bottom of a modern pool. OGRE itself just disappears after being overtaken by family Jeep Cherokee. A copy of the Shriek DVD that I watched was incorrect, with a picture that was black in a few seconds, about half an hour in the movie, and I hope that Shriek is removed. The extras include a brief interview with Lambert Bav, explaining that it was not a sequel, etc. Etc. Together with some trailers for other Shriek DVD releases. This is pretty standard equipment. 3 of 10 <br /> <br />
