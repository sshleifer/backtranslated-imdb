To my knowledge, Largo's winch was a famous Belgian comic (he never read) who talked about adventures of a playboy, a kind of James Bond without spy life! So when I had to pick a movie for a five-year-old kid, I picked it up because the kid was already a big fan of James Bond! there are grave doubts: when American films offer an incredible start, there is no action and terrible sex scene? Then, the story becomes very complicated with financial moves? I thought I lost my child. But, strangely, he was caught by Largo, and more than James Bond! Was it a great interpretation of Tom Sisley? The difficult relationship Largo has with his father? A story about a multiple box in which friends are bad guys, bad guys are friends? Exotic locations of Honk-Kong, Yugoslavia? I do not know, but he really care about Larga ("Will he get up?") and we enjoyed our time.
