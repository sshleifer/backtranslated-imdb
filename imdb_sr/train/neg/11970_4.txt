... that Lt chose this. First, the film was not terrible, it was only Hollywood. In the worst case scenario, if necessary - this-yes-be-desi-or-nemam-film-scenario: if Villis's mission was to save the doctor, but she was determined to leave her "men" out of the missionary, that first helicopter and took those refugees to the border without it. He would not compromise his refugee package. It's not like that. But, as I pointed out, this is Hollywood, we must have a drama. That's why we make movies, because reality is not so complicated. However, I thought Villis and a good doctor had functional chemistry. However, there are some well-executed battle scenes in the film. It's not a waste of time, "Tears of the Sun" is a worthy dvd rent. Check it out on a rainy day and you will be satisfied.
