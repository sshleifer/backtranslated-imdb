Oh, Sam Mraovich, we know you've worked so hard. This is your magnum opus, a great example to others that you are definitely worth the nominations for the Academy of Film Arts and Science (as you say on the 1998 website). But, it is better to remain silent and be considered a fool than to speak and to remove any doubt. With Ben & Arthur, you're doing exactly that. It seems to have been made with a lack of instruction or education, the film script leads us to truly bizarre with every new scene. It's that crazy excuse for a story that could be the best ally of the movie. Beginning with warm, homosexual titular characters, Ben and Arthur are trying to marry, go so far as to fly around the country to do it, in the shade of the best palm trees of Vermont. But all this posture is just an introduction to the KRV. Then more blood, and more and more blood. I mean, in the last third of this film, there must be at least $ 20 in a false blood substitute. The film as a whole is a technical gaf. From sound to music editing, which consists of a fuzzy note that is held on the keyboard, it's a wonder that the movie is even held together on any media you are watching. It's a shame that some decent amateur performances are made here. <br /> <br /> Regardless, Sam. I'm sure that you made five figures about this rented movie or anything that drives a poor soul (like me) to watch this movie. Unfortunately, we should not be with you.
