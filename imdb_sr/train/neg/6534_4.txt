This fantastic adventure is not the best and not the worst. I agree with the claim that the bad science fiction is comical. Bizarre pink tinting and unusual special effects make it a favorite for late, late, late spectators. Mars explorers on planet Mars are fighting against strange monsters and other strange creatures. Pretti cool. Actors include Les Tremaine, Nauru Haiden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Be comfortable and enjoy. Do not feel bad if you smile for a moment. I agree with adding this to the list of cult classics so that I can not miss it.
