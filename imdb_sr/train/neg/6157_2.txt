It was definitely one of those sleepless nights in which I surfed the canals and encountered this stench of the film. For some of the names in the actors, I would expect a much better film. I'm almost ashamed to see Oscar Winner F. Murrai Abraham was reduced to such an awful part. I hope the money is worth it. And students talked about fencing as they talked about surviving in a war or a terrible catastrophe. I mean, I enclosed it, it's a fun sport, but I've never been so intense. The only reason I even watched the entire movie was because the remote control fell under the sofa and I was too lazy to get it back.
