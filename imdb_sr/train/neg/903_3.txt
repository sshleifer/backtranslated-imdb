"Stella Dallas" from 1937 with Barbar Stanvick did not grow old - as someone thought the semi-updated version of the story would now work out real confusion. Perhaps they thought that poor, cheerful fool Bette Midler could do something about it, but this script was defeated. The stories of a female bartender who has a baby out of wedlock, and years later giving a young girlfriend a rich father, so she will have a chance for a better life, can not escape from skinny, old-fashioned ornaments and feelings. Midler works best with a film director who can control his excesses, but this does not happen here; Stephen Collins is steadfast as a man who changes her life, but Trina Alvarado is as good as Midler's daughter. This is what was once called a "feminine painting," but it does not go because it is too loyal to the origin of the 1930s. * 1/2 of ****
