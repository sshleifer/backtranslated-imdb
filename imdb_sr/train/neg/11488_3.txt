It's hard to imagine anyone could find this short favorite if they saw most of their short films, but I know that VERY humor is subjective. I've seen all their sound shorts (far better than their IMOs) and I found this as one of their poor efforts. In the year when it was made (1930) Stan and Babies were made 15 years old. short trousers and one feature. They were extremely popular and their boss, Hal Roach, took full advantage by continuously working. In addition, this was the time of experimenting for writers and Stan. I would say that this was an experiment that really did not work. As someone else has said, it does not play on their strength. Too many dialogues and complications. The best part of this for me is mostly an improvised sequence with Stan As Ages and the great Thelma Todd who talks about "girls". <br /> <If you really want to see boys on their most creative and funny review of Blot, or Brats from the same year. They made so many short films in such a short time that I think it can be forgiven for performing fewer than a few perfumes. In total, they made 108 films. Very few (except those made on FOKS) were completely unsuccessful, but there are some. The District Hospital, me and my Pal, The Live Ghost, The Fiker Uppers are considered as fundamentally weak. But, the other, then I found something wonderful in all of my brief trousers. A very good record in my book. If you've seen and enjoyed all the other short trousers then be sure to check this, but I would be willing to bet that this was less than a memorable Stan and Babe.
