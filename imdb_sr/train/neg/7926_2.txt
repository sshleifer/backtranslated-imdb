The original exploitation of the classics - though far from enjoying at almost every level in relation to some guys who convert cats into human flesh, eating monsters, because cats' foods made by humans are made with added scifi elements. Cats can not get enough, and when exhausted food disappears, cats turn their owners. Poorly composed at almost every level, this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that it actually used for movie cinema in the early 1970s, which was updated by alien races of cats and dogs fighting for supremacy. The director Ted Mikel is a hack, but he is such a cute man (I generally like this guy thanks to his smile that provokes interviews and comments) that you can utterly utter the garbage that he mostly produced. Mikel wanted to make movies and did not care how they got out as long as he produced something. More power for him, but I do not want to subject him to my home movies
