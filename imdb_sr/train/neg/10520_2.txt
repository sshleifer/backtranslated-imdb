Angels who have a little kiss are banned from heaven and now live in the British forest where they seduce and quench the young. Talk about a high concept. On the plus side, this little mother gives us Tom Savini, but since his reach is limited to two minutes of the screen, his five-minute presence looks a little long. Angels run across the forest bare for most of the film, but although they may have the body of angels, their faces look like Joan Rivers is on a bad day. Mediocre acting and amateur-top effects do not help, and night scenes fatally remember the most famous Paris Hilton movie. It's so bad that it's really bad.
