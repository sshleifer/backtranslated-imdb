The film is quite confusing and funny. The action is terrible ... but on the plus side, the acting is pretty good, with a few good jokes and trembling. Sharon Stone is OK this time ... even half as good as the original mind. The killings are not even bloody as the first, which is a shame. It's not an unpredictable mess that everyone says is. Sex is pretty graphic, while others are clear to be fake (they are fully dressed). The scenario is most of the time weak, but the scene with jokes and arguments between Dr.Glass and Vashburn are the most interesting. The plot revolves several times, but the end is horrible. The tension is always constant with a huge downward 'oh my God!'. The hooking sequences are brilliantly directed, and the camera shots and angles are impressive and bring a bit of class into a movie that has felt bustling. Sharon Stone is a little old for this. The parts we see in her breasts are, at first, delighted. This time they are too scary to describe them. Movies about themselves are pretty average, but worth it to go. Mostly because the movie deserves a good voice ... with an initial sequence. Do not be critical, but if you like it first, leave this. Do not ruin the race. You'll be glad you left this stone unturned.
