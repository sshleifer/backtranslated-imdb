This film begins with the execution of a sorcerer's practitioner and his mistress. His head was cut off and buried separately from his body ... sounds like "A thing that would not die," is it? Well, it plays a bit like that, but when the body rejoins with the head, all interesting and terrible deaths are over and the film moves very slowly. I mean, the movie is only 88 minutes long and I was constantly thinking "When will it end"? The characters in the movie are mostly idiots and mostly deserve to die because they are really stupid. Zlikovac is also very bad because he is moving slowly and you are really wondering how he managed to do anything because he was afraid of jewelry. The only thing that keeps an eye on you after the head is reattached is the fact that there are so many tosses that are thrown to really start to lose track. However, I want to see a horror movie, not a soft lingual porn movie and as a horror movie, this is a way to slowly move with the way that many slowly stretch to make them even more pleasant. And do not read the back of the box because it seemed as if eating zombies were attacking the city, there is not ... just a small scene in which three or four zombies attack the house and so easily refuse are not at all a factor in the film and their scene is pretty meaningless. I mostly say that you should avoid this movie, unless you find it very cheap.
