I do not know if the problem I had with this film was that I was not able to grasp the way movies worked in the past, but I do not think it has failed to use any of the modern conventions available to the 40s to make a movie. If you do not have anything better to do my advice is not to watch this movie, but to read a book or go for a walk.
