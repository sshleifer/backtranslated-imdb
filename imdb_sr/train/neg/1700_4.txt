In the film I feel it should be more than art. I think it should be more than that, a way to talk on the screen. This short text by David Linch tells the story, but not much. I felt it was funny, but too bizarre for comedy. It's good movie work, but there's really nothing else to do. As I have already said, I'm David Linch's great fan, but some of his work frustrates me because I do not see the need for this. This is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far, but I know he still has a lot of talent and I am excited to see what is ready for us in the future. If you like Linch, check this out, but do not be surprised when you do not like it.
