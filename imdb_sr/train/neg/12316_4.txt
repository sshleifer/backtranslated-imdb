In the past, director Jonathan Linn made some underrated comedies such as 'Greedy' and 'Clue'. This is not one of them. Even more akin to the film of the 'Police Academy' than inspiration, it's Steve Martin in the old role of Phil Silvers as a military sergeant who forever pulls scams under the hands of his superiors. But the idyllic life of Bilk and his lazy water looks faint when the old enemy visits a base that decided to capture Bilka in the act. Nothing really happens. It's all pretty boring. It's not so funny. Martin, Aikroyd Day, and Phil Hartman are pushing a couple of laughter through effort, but they're better than this and it's pretty painful to watch them work with such thin material.
