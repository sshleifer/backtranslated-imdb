I can say without a doubt that Going Overboard is the only worst movie I've ever seen, and yes, I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is disgusting as Schecki Moskovitz, a comedian working on a cruise. It's a complication. That's it! Nothing else in the movie makes sense, it's everywhere like a crazy breakfast, and not in a frustrated naked pistol in some way, but more frustrating, 'throw both shoes in such a way. even General Noriega appears, without reason I can understand (it certainly is not for humor). Add to Mic Miss Australia, which has the worst Australian Accent I've ever heard, and you have something that I will not call the worst movie ever made, because Going Overboard does not even fit even the basic definition of the movie. I recommend watching this movie because it will raise the position of every bad movie you ever see. I guarantee that the first thing you will say after watching a bad movie is to be "at least not as bad as Going Overboard".
