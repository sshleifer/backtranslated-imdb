The lack of content in this movie has impressed me the most. First I thought people would compare this with Rock On! but I'm really surprised to say that this is the worst of Rock On! So the Horrible Play of Ajai Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asina is telling me you're kidding me. The music was OK Khanabadosh was the track of the film, the rest was bad! Vipul Shah still does not learn from Singh that the king is a critical comedy. Now Asin .. from where she comes from sorry for Asin fan out there, but she sucks * d a great time in this movie seriously bad acting did not look good in all overdose make-up! My last judgment is to watch Aladina with her family, instead of wasting time here.
