The acting is good, the women are beautiful, and the men are handsome, so if you are looking for good acting soft pornography, this movie is for you. Otherwise, waste time. Motivation of the main characters, especially the leaded lead, is often a mystery. She could only tell the truth - the truth of the film, not necessarily the historical truth - and her lover would have been spared the time in prison for rape that he had not committed. Did she protect her father, who went half as half as he was, when he forced the lawsuit into force? Was she protected, with her reputation that was suddenly worried when so far only her art seemed important? During the trial, this strong woman turns in front of our eyes. On the contrary, her lover, who begins as a narcissistic jerk, becomes an unselfish hero during the trial. At least his motivation is clearer: he is sacrificed for love. Of course, since no good work has to go unpunished, it has been told to never see it again.
