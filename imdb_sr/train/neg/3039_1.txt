I can always say when something will be hit. I see or hear, and I have a good feeling. I did not feel well watching the review. I was not really thrilled with this film, and I'm not surprised at all that it's rated here as one of the worst 100 movies ever. In fact, I proved to be right. The first thing that rejected me is the title. It's not that I have problems with ebonics (by the way, I'm black), but they could use a better title for the movie, and for this time they use a title that does not have bad grammar. I heard the dialogue, I saw the acting, and all I could do was make faces. I also think that the topic of the dance film is overworked. At least "Iou Got Served" is better than this in my opinion. Even the soundtrack did not delight me.
