Do you remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood because he shot great movies? These days feel like more distant memories. While "Hollywood homicides" are by no means terrible, it's a routine and surprisingly dull friendly cop. It's a comedy that is not particularly funny and an action movie that is not particularly exciting. Excessive background can not conceal the weakest central story. Ford at least seems to enjoy more than it did with his latest projects, and he is able to take the movie most of the time. Hartnett is adequate, but he and Ford are not exactly Nevman and Redford as far as chemistry is concerned. All in all, "Hollywood killings" is a reasonably fun diversion, but scarcely. Take out Ford, and that's not even that.
