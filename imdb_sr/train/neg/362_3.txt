To not be confused with Madonna's movie "The Nekt Best Thing", "The Last Big Thing" is a silly, stone, off-the-vall comedy about a man who wants to run the magazine "Nekt Big Thing" is considering different artists coming and coming . This low budget indie makes Chuck and Buck look like a masterpiece. Slaughtered by stupid acting, poor sets and costumes, "... the thing" has earned some terrible criticism and has so far been nominated for only one prize. Add this.
