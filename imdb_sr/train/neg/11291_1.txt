Sheesh! What a horrible movie. An indecent camera works, a multi-corn script from Kelloggs, and behaving so cold that you can open the pig farm with her. To break everything, you do not know which audience you need to target - do we have Cornel Vilde - or is it Cornie Vilde? - putting on a soapbox on the dangers of smoking whenever someone burns a cigarette, my dear God, and on another unpleasant scene we have a bad, Lobo, forcing him, ah, if you will, a 'male friend' to do a striptease dressed in a bikini. Try to explain to these children ... Throw an overly fictitious Treasure Island-cum-Javs type story, and the result is a movie that is so inadvertently funny, enjoyable - you should not expect it soon, however, a special DVD.
