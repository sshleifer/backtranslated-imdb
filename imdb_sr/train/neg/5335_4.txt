It's been a while since I saw this comedy, and I forgot how idiotic it was. I could easily put it in the bottom two or three Elvis Presley's worst movies. Presley plays Joe Vhitecloud, an Indian bull rider who returns home in Arizona and a broken cabin where his family lives, and where his friends like to have fun all night long. His parents play Burgess Meredith and Kati Jurado, and his old Indian grandfather is Thomas Gomez. Neither of them offers anything important, comic or otherwise. The government invested in a family cattle, but they lack a bull. Elvis sings only a few completely worthless songs, followed by a young girl and her mother. This is just a real mess in the mess, and the eroded environment practically stinks at the manure and it does not make it much easier. The only thing that confuses me is, however, that Elvis really enjoys a good time in the movie. It's hard to believe, since he got so upset that he got stuck in making so many major films.
