This is actually a pretty bad movie. Ideology is not as perverse as in the movies that Collins later made. However, my main concerns about the film are that it's incredible and pretty boring for a long time. The whole concept of a former SAS member who joined the terrorists for no particular reason is not very convincing and you can not wonder why a group of highly organized terrorists (who later became rather inexplicable) dropped to it. The film begins with a pretty strong scene, but then for a long time it walks in the direction of the big finale. All in all, I think that Whoever dared to win could be an interesting 45-minute episode of professionals, but the story does not carry the feature film. Although quite successful at the time when this film triggered the collapse of Collins' career, which in the 1980s generally rules cheap and suspicious military films. It's a pity, because he is a truly versatile actor, but at the end of the day, Martin Shav has carefully selected his roles and has a career that is still successful.
