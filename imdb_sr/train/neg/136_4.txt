*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Do all teens run from drought of originality? It's terrible. First, this is a noble premise that could be used well. A discarded young nerd who grows up, walks and kills all the girls who tortured him when he was in high school? I can not say that you have nothing to do with it. But this film goes through the same movements as any other recent slasher. All of the results to the angle of the camera allows us to predict exactly when a false alarm comes and exactly when the killer strikes. So far, we know the pattern. These stupid slasher films are increasingly pushing the credibility envelope. Let me ask you: Who, in their healthy mind, will surprise their friend in a dark, gloomy morgue in the middle of the night and surprise her suddenly while she is alone and surrounded by corpses? Does that make any sense at all? Valentina is only occasionally innovative. One good blow involves the shooting of the character Denise Richards. She is trapped in the pool, and the killer stabs her with a chainsaw. There are some good songs in the soundtrack, including one cool Orgy song. Music video is located in the DVD section with special features. Even the acting is at best central. All actors sleep their roles. Of course, David Boreanaz is often stoic, even in his portrait as the title character on Angel. Nevertheless, Denise Richards is a fine actress and holds a stone in the whole film. "Valentine" is just as you would expect: pretentious, incredible, forgetful, cheesy and without a good frightening vision. Do not even try. My score: 4 (out of 10)
