I could not believe when I put this movie in my DVD payer. I thought I'd make a good laugh, because I was playing D & D for half my life. I had to exclude him because I had a company and they wondered what the shit I was seeing. I finished it later, and I had to leave it to a soft-gay porn clown at the beginning. No, they lead a scale of jokes, jokes with sperm, incest, racism, dressing like KKK ... This film is flat for anyone who has ever played D & D. No wonder it looks like Real D & D did not let them use their game. Who would have wanted this to be added to them?
