What a horrible, horrible movie. The worst collection of clich√©s I've seen for a long time. It's not that I saw much. I left the theater screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a hard drink to calm my nerves. Mary Streep was as terrible as usual. How many injured and tortured expressions can one person have? Aidan Quinn's talents were - as often - as futile. And who told Gloria Estefan he could play? Trying to be a police officer, this film continues to impose racial stereotypes. (A brave inexperienced lone music teacher teaches a poor child violin in a poor school). The children were not even cute! Just written to fit the awful scripts. Aaargh! All of Craven really made me screw up once. real horror this!
