I do not know where to start from. Actors are full of people who have never done anything before. Debralee Scott is listed on the boxes, but does not appear in the movie at all. Writing is pretty bad, even for college movies. Obviously, this is a very small budget, with one scene in a nursing home that has an extremely turbulent editing. , an attractive girl, a girl from a small city, etc. The taught teacher is about what you would expect ... a middle-aged hard guy who is easily removed. If you do not want to see College Flick, keep away from this one. It's so bad, it's not even funny.
