It was interesting to see how much writing was true to the geek buzz word, but very naive in the corporate world. The Ministry of Justice would seize more large corpus giants if they made such naive things to win. The real corporate world is much more subtle and more interesting, and yet somewhat malicious. I seriously doubt that any corpus would really kill someone directly; Even the mode is more indirect these days. In the real world, they kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, poisons, etc. This film was certainly developed by some garage nerds, and the studies did not know the difference. They just wanted to use something in Microsoft's antitrust case case.
