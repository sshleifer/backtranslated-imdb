This is an amateur movie shot on a video, not an "electric drama" while the DVD liner falsely brags. I've seen much better things than students of a Belgrade film. Most of the story takes place with taxi ride on the whole taxis in Jakarta. This film could have been made using one video camera, but there are several parts where two cameras were used and the content was later rejected. Editing is extremely rough. The final change was probably done with two cameras, bouncing content back and forth, instead of with the corresponding editor. Maybe they arranged a taxi too? English subtitles are written by someone who does not speak English, e.g. "Where are you going now?" They say that the quality of production is equal to Blair Vitch is generous. If you're not scared yet, this film was an ambitious and creative endeavor, with lots of cool and funky pictures from all over Jakarta.
