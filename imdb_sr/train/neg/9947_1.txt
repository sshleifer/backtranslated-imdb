This film was terrible. I swear that they did not even write a script, but they were somehow covered in the whole movie. Ice-T is as boring as hell. * SPOILERS More similar reasons not to be watched * They sit and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. he could leave a long time ago. The soil was difficult for him to be almost impossible to track with dogs. And when the ICE-T on the hill and used Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN as your sniper rifle (and then cut a tree with eight shells? Should 1000 armor that shines tree of such size.) And hand guns are considered inaccurate at 100 yards . And they even saw the reflection. What reflected the light? I did not see space on that thing. Also, when he was shot in the intestine and continued to go, it was retarded to bleed to death. I end where he puts a stone or a cigarette in the wind. He would not explode and kill him. The bullet would still fire on the ice, but it ruined the boar.
