I wonder who, and, more importantly, why is the decision to invite Richard Attenborough to direct the most unusual sensation on Broadway for many years? He's a director who awards Oscars. Yes, he won for Gandhi, the moron! Jeremi Irons is an actor who is the winner of the Academy. He has experience with musicals. Really? "Oh, what a wonderful war" you forgot? To answer your question, yes! The film is a disappointment, clear and simple. No ounces of living energy have survived a tough procedure. Each character danced beautifully, they were charming, but their screening was theater. I did not feel anything. But when I saw it on the scene, I felt it all. The film was supposed to be thrown with stars, unknown, novelists, but also stars with incredible unforgettable faces even the most impatient of the group. Big actors who can dance fine. Michael Douglas was in it. True, I forgot that I am absolutely wrong and that you are absolutely right. Nothing like Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas musical.
