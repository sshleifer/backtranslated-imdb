Bernard Rapp passed away last year and was a very cultural journalist. The cinema was one of his greatest passions (he wrote a huge world dictionary of films) and that's why he had to use his camera at least once in his life. But the films that he left won the mild reviews: "Tire a Part" (1996) despite Terence Stamp's sensational performance that was very caricatured in the presentation of characters, "une Affaire De Gout" (2000) was a hungry job even if Bernard Giraudeau showed perverted performance, "Pas Si Grave" (2003) was another downfall and "Un Petit Jeu Sans Consequence" is as clunky as his predecessors. Comic potential is exploited in an unclear manner. However, the initial idea was to predict a dizzying, spiritual comedy. The couple who were kept by Ivan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain, who called for their friends, are in full force in a luxurious villa. In order to play with their guests, they pretend to be separated from one another. And things do not go as planned, because the announcement of their separation is not surprising. The two enthusiasts are beginning to think about the validity of their money. In spite of the lush landscape and the promising material available, Rapp's unexplored direction can not revive this game with unexpected consequences. The action follows a well-worn form with characters that have specific well-known features and masks that are revealed about who they are in fact. Verbal or situational comedy effects often fall. Poor processing disappears a bit more film with this bad habit from Rapp to crop many sequences. Even the sincere contribution of the actors in the venture is controversial. It seems to them that they are bored and reciting their lyrics rather than living them, especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The audience was soon caught in deep laceration. It's sad to say this: Bernard Rappa's films have never fulfilled his intentions as "Un Petit Jeu sans Consequence" testifies.
