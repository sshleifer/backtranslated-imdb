The idea of ​​this film was good. It's a shame that's not well written. Casting Sidney Poitier as an FBI agent is a good idea, and he has done a remarkable job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, knows only one emotion in most of his films, anger. Kirstie Ally's character could have been great, he even showed some possibilities, but the writer really failed us to do his part as a largely helpless woman. It was completely incompatible with the strongly independent character that should have been. I do not care if Allei plays anyway. The film should end about fifteen minutes earlier than it was. The director cut the dry cow before the incredible final action. I will keep this in my collection just as an example of Poitier's performances.
