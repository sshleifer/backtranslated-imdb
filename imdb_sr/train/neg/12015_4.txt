Alfred Hitchcock is not my favorite director, but imagine what he could do with it! The plot has many potential for uncertainty. John Garfield is almost always excellent and Raymond Massy is fighting against the guy. Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive lead lady, but support is great and very capable. There are too many coincidences. And the important topic is trivialized by being made in a little bit more, after all, from a love story. But it's not terribly good.
