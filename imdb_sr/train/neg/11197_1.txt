What was the Worst Movie of 2003? "Cat in a hat?" "Gigli?" Mais non! I suggest it was that terrible little movie from the previous year. Poorly written, poorly decorated, and (if so brave) a bad act, "Red" is the black hole of the film - a film so thick that even the smallest part of the party can not escape from its horizon of crap. It's not by accident either funny, like (for example) "Shovgirls". You know that manufacturers assume that their audience will not be very smart. They renamed the movie, originally called "Eat Sins," because they thought the Americans were too stupid to understand what the sin is eating, although they are going to the great duty to explain what is in the movie the one eating the sin. Instead, they have expressed the full generic name and image of Heath Ledger that looks crazy is more than enough to bring you there. My ex-girlfriend saw Heath's picture and pulled me inside. Congratulations, manufacturers, you've met your target market. She also liked "Grease II", so you are in good company. Going back to the subject, Heath plays a Catholic monk from a specific (you have guessed) a command that tries to investigate the murder of his mentor. He has questions of celibacy, probably because no one in the common sense would believe that he knew the least thing about religion, and even less that it was a monk from celibacy. The only other member of this order is a ridiculous alcoholic. As much as I wanted to see the spirited alcoholic return to the big screen, his humor attempts reminded me of all the stupidity in my high school imitated by Monti Pithon, thinking that if they just say that lines similar to Pithoni were automatically ridiculous. You know what kind of people I'm talking about. If I say more, I would be in danger of creating a spoiler. Frankly, the thing that ruined this film was the fact that it was created.
