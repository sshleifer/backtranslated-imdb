Growing up with the Beast Vars transformers, I was not well acquainted with the original Transformers, and now that I've seen a great movie, and now that I've seen the older cartoon on which it's based, I have to say that I like the original cartoon and live action movie more than Beast Varsa. It's not that I do not like BV characters, I just think that characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. <br /> <I mean, "AUTOBOTS TRANSFORMATION AND ROLL OUT!" sounds much better than "MAKSIMALS MAXIMIZE!" The voice of the original Optimus Prime continues to make me a strong believer that he is a real commander, more than Optimus Primal. In addition, the Optimus Prime PowerMaster is much more powerful than Optimal Optimus. Just look at the internet! Megatron in the face of BV looked more like a funny version of its evil version in the original series. Besides, the cooler it is, robots are changing into animals or changing robots. in vehicles and spaceships? Give me the original Transformers every day over Beast Vars!
