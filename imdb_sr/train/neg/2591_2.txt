To begin with, I would like to say that I'm a fan of the American Pie series. Although it is "naked mile" and these two worst, this seems to be a fall in the entire series. First of all, the best part of the film was that it was an American Pie movie, which is always appreciated. However, there are many bad things to say about this movie. First, the story has a very staggered 'arch' structure. First, the introduction of characters, then advocating for the beta house and finally the Greek Olympics. Each of them has exactly 25 minutes of length. Apart from the general stiff complication, there is little or no development of character, which makes a double stroke of bad complication. Besides, deeply I did not like stereotyping in this movie. That is, showing athletes as extremely cool, just thinking about sex, and explicitly displaying geeks as inferior. Also, it shows females only as sexual objects, and men just want to treat females as sexual objects. Besides, the acting was also bad. Maybe with the exception of Steve Talleia. Finally, generally horrible movie, if we look at it from a critical point of view. If viewed from the viewpoint of a teenager, I suppose it is better, but this film is rated 18+ in most countries, so you really should not see it minors.
