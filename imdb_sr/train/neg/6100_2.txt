Effort to the side (this is not a good intent, but about the final product), this film is poorly written, excessive and poorly directed. The story obviously had the potential, but this story is not present in this film. Clara Barton was a human being. She had passions, desires, love, pain, shame, weakness, and suspicion of herself and ourselves. You would never know that from this movie actress actress. In fact, this applies to every character in the film, but in Barton's case: Every sentence is speech. The epic above speech as a non-human robot. In fact, the only scene that played well at one committee meeting, and I realized that this is because she is speaking! Every idea she has is incredible in her context and she comes up with ideas that sound like they take a lifelong search for the soul right on the spot. For example, when seeing a wounded man, she will begin to pontify needs on the battlefield and protect soldiers and set white flags, etc. A well-conceived idea in a second. In conclusion, this film takes Clara Barton to her fights. She is the deprivation of her humanity, and this is essentially more and more cheaper than she did because the script is written in clich√©s. The writer does not know Clara Barton, and his script appears to have been based on the Encyclopedia Britannica. (that they had then) But hey, fine Technicolor! (who cares)
