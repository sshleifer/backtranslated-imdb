Oh, God, I think this is perhaps the brightest movie I've ever seen. I'm serious, this is one of the ultimate b-films. The first proof is that it is not a 5 USD DVD. Oh no, it's too mainstream for this. I got this on VHS, from a full video container to a local video. If I quote the advertisement: "In the 17th century Japan, a samurai was living who would post His name was Maieda, who was sent on an epic journey all over the world to buy 5,000 mushrooms from the king of Spain, while At the sea a violent storm swallowed their precious gold with the intention to buy weapons and almost take away their lives Maieda has to fight with all odds to survive and secure the fate of her beloved Japan. Then it says: "An epic action adventurous event of several million dollars in three continent "Must have seen another movie. This was not an epic, and There was nothing more than a million dollars in the game, not 'Shogun Maieda' is actually just a crazy adventure by Maieda (Sho Kosugi), he is not even Shogun, but that does not matter, what matters is that the real impression of the repeated charge of John Clays in a single castle in Monta Pithon and the Holy Grail and his ability to move from serious scenes to showing his Samurai minds. Avesome. The biggest thing in this movie is Sho Kosugi's Engrish accent. The movie may be missing almost everything that makes a good movie, but it is compensated by some of the funniest lines ever brought by the coldest accent of Engrish ever. And honestly, do you really want something else? You can accelerate 'Shogun Maieda' to the end, and repeat the last line of Kosugi. The tape will probably wear out before you get tired of that line. Avesome. 2/10 - Very poor.
