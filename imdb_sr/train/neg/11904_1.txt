The end of the violence and, of course, the Million Dollar Hotel hinted at the idea that Venders lost his vision, his ability to tell convincing stories through a moving picture card. I am afraid that the Earth abounds in a sealed casket, since it is a non-immobile, obviously sentimental and clich√© movie. The characters are completely flat and stereotyped, writing, complication and direction are amateur, at best. For the first time in a while, I was impatient to finish the film so that I could continue with my life. A wretchedly devastated uncle's delirium, a patriotic abstract that looks at the sky at the end ... it seemed to me so simple and pathetic, it was hardly a movie director who made some compelling magic on the screen. What happened? I'm afraid the days of experimentation, perceptive writing, and interesting shooting options are long behind him. Hopefully he will find his inspiration again ... At the film festival in Toronto, where I saw the film, Venders was there to present it. Totally without humility, he offered us the following: "I hope ... no, wait ... I KNOW you will enjoy the next two hours." I'm afraid he could not have been more wrong ...
