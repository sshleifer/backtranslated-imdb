The terrible acting of Potter and the flat plot without tension, as it ever was. As far as feminist controversy is concerned, it's ridiculous. I saw this trash when it was released for the first time and although I considered it boring, it is incredibly glad that I went to see it. This is because I now have an immediate answer to the question 'What is the worst movie you've ever seen?' Plus, I have the comfort to know that every movie I see for the rest of my life will be better than the Tango lesson. But I have to admit that I was impressed by the way Potter wrote a script that will collect the maximum number of art councils from around the world (as revealed in the final points). I'm Just Recently I've seen Orland and myself to see how Potter learned the wrong lessons from the movie. It took only a bunch of costumes, some passionate eyes led by a lady, and a loose plot to seduce the audience into the cinema. So why not think that she can get away with the self-indulgent nonsense that the Tango lesson?
