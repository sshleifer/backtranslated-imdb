This was a disappointing movie. Taking into account the material - the life of the army is always good for laughter - and the stars, this film should be a parachute. There was a couple of smiles, at best. Steve Martin was much more fun than this and Dan Ackroid seems to have to play a dramatic role, where he could follow the lead of Robin Williams and one day to win the Oscars.
