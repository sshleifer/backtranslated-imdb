I just saw this movie yesterday. My girlfriend wanted to see him just because of Richard Giraffe. I feel that I have lost my time and money and told my girlfriend that it is the last time to watch a movie just because there is some actor / actress in it. I hope she learned the lesson because I had trouble keeping her in place. To me, since I already paid for it, I wanted to at least see the end, only in the hope that something good would appear, but I did not hold my breath, and fortunately, because I would be a victim of the film. This is not a black and white film, but black and black. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his registrars, and all sexual offenders are portrayed as unfounded criminals, and the bad ones are really very bad. Talk about clich√© and exploitation of typical American phobia. Richard Gere acted as good as usual, but the blonde girl who should replace him was the best. Totally inconclusive for the job. The film is trying to make use of the popular theme and give it a cheap, dramatic and sensational reversal that is simply unrealistic. They only use sex offenders as an excuse to quit cheap, violent killings, beating, rape and torture - something that almost seems to be free. They even have a wolf who attacks people in a movie - how low you can get. I consider that the film will not appear in the US and will go straight to DVD. It was supposed to remain in other countries, but because they were Hollivood and Richard Gere, they had to show him. Believe me, without Gerea, the film is not worth the B-series.
