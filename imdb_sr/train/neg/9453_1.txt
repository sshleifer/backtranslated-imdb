The Holy Cow, which is a piece of this movie. I did not know how these filmmakers could take a 250-word book and turn it into a movie. I suppose they did not even know! I do not even remember one fart or bursting in a book, is it? This should give you a good idea of ​​what these Hollywood producers think. I must say, it was visually interesting, but a brilliant visual story was destroyed by toilet humor. > Do not take children to see, do not rent DVD. I hope that the spirit of Dr. Suess's spirit comes and chases people who made this film.
