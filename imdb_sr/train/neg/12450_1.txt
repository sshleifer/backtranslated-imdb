Ten minutes of the story stretched out for a better part of two hours. When nothing of importance happened halfway, I should have gone. But I always hoped, I stayed. And I went with the guilty feeling that he lost his time. The acting was fine, but the story is so transparent and weak. The scenario is roughly as lucid as it can be obtained, but again, stretching the ten-minute action does not leave much room for good dialogue.
