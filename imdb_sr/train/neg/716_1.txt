This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is absolutely no story, the gags are only for retardation and absolutely nothing else that would make this film worth watching. In the whole film, Freddie (about my God what funny name Ha ha) does not wonder how he came from the plane to the middle ground. There are many stupid and completely immortal characters whose names should sound ridiculous. e.g. Gandalf is called Almghandi, Sam is called Puppy ... and so on. I did not even laugh during the whole movie. Gags look like they were made by people whose IK is negative. If you smile when someone's coat is trapped in the door (this happens about 5 times), then this movie may be for you. Another funny scene: They try to encode the code word for the closed door (do not ask why - never ask "why" in this movie), and the code word is (ha ha): manure. So, if you're laughing at these examples, you may like this movie. For everyone else: Go to Youtube and watch "Lord of the Veed": it's much, much more fun.
