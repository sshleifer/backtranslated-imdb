I went to see this with my wife and my 3 year old son. He seemed to like much more than my wife and me. Writing is surprisingly bad for picnics / disneys excursion. Actually, it was hard for me to pay attention to everything. The film looks incredible, but the story is so strange and long that I hoped my son would fall asleep so I could pick it up and get out. An interesting concept is just so strange (bad scenario?) Especially when we first meet the family. I know that we should get the impression that the family is jittery, but a good lord, they could shorten that line in about 15 minutes (apparently, I did not really look at him). Up to that point, I scratched my head looking for a way out.
