I'm a great fan of Fred MacMurrai and Carole Lombard. In addition to them, Charles Buttervorth (a very pleasant actor) was in this film, ... why did not I enjoy him especially then ?! Well, despite a good vote, this is one of the poorest written and unusual "images" I've ever seen. Given the talent and money spent on this movie, it is shocking as it was written. I knew that the film would be boring when, from time to time, in the film, I was thinking about exactly what was going to happen - and I was always right! And that's not because I'm some kind of "movie savant," but because there was almost no imagination or effort. Actually, it seemed like the movie was just a long string of clich√©s that were all merged! Also, it was a bit irritating that Fred had so badly treated Carole throughout the film, yet, as she conventionally agreed, she eventually ran to him. Uggh! There is more uncertainty in the Lassie movie ("Will it get people to rescue Timmy or hang his rope from a break?"). a few positive pages about the movie. It was pretty cool when Fred looked like a broken-down end of the movie - it was pretty convincing and it looked like he did not eat, shave or sleep for days. Also, Charles Buttervorth provided "a chatterer" a few mildly humorous moments. But all this was not enough for this film to look different from "B film". Too bad ... it could have been much better.
