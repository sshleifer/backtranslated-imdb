I got this on trial testing. All I can say is: What ... Hell? This film takes place as smoothly as Mickey Mouse reading the script for "Scarface". It's bizarre, but it does not make any sense; Even if you leave your brain in the car, the movie is still so bizarre that it's not even funny. The action includes a crocodile hunter Steve Irwin who tries to "save" the crocodile containing the CIA probe. The CIA is coming after Irvine to give them an investigation, Irvin misconstrues them, and moves them to "stop" them. It is all that exists; there is the outpouring of Australian culture ("Didja see dat" and "Crikei!") and unusually choreographed action sequences. At one point, Irvin struggles with the RV and fights with the CIA agent. Yes, that's right: Steve Irvin's battles fight with the guy at the top of the RV. Let this be your guide to this funny bad movie.
