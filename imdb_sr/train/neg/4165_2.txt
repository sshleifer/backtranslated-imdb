I am a big fan of the camp, but when every plot of the 'screw' is predictable and bad, and obviously does not try to be, even I lose interest. I wanted to evaluate this 3, but the end ended with ease. The only saving grace is that I hated other films more. There's not enough beer in the world for this.
