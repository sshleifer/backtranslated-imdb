From the director of Barbara Schroder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I saw little of it in the Media Studies class, and I recognized the lead actress, so I tried, despite the criticism of the critics. Mostly cool kid Richard Haivood (Ryan Gosling from Half Nelson) and Justin Pendleton (Bulli's Michael Pitt) are teaming up to kill an accidental girlfriend in order to provoke herself and see if they can get away without being found by the police. Investigating the murder, Cassie 'The Hiena' Maeveather (Sandra Bullock) murder detective and new partner Sam Chaplin, who are pretty confused with the evidence found on the scene, for example, hair that is not connected. It seems that the plan does not go completely well, because Cassie and Sam pretty quickly have Richard or Justin as suspects, it's just a matter of being able to deny them. Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Rai Feathers, R.D Call as captain Rod Codi and Tom Verica as Asst. YES. Al Swanson. Now I can see the same concept as the Rope Serpentine Alfred Hitchcock with the murder of the challenge, but this film does it in a very funny way, and neither reasonably good Bullock can save him from being boring and predictable. Adequately!
