I loved the original Scari Movie. I'm a big fan of parody - it's my favorite form of humor. Sometimes it is considered the most intelligent form of humor. It seemed that Vaians guys perfectly understood this concept in the original movie, and then they temporarily forgotten it when they continued. I think Vaiani is a family of comic geniuses. Unfortunately, even the genius is wrong. Film begins with a promise. I liked the parody "The Ekorcist", especially "Come on out, ma" gag. This is a quality material of Vaians. But, moreover, I can remember only twice when I laughed: 1) when Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by the spirit, then he becomes frowning and begins to talk about marriage with him. In the meantime, he says: "It was just a call for loot!" That was fun. 2) Parody "Save the Last Dance" where Cindy's character accidentally defeats a girl while practicing her new moves. But even short-term ridicule does not coincide with the side-smile of the first Scari movie. The rest of the film is pure garbage, filled with cheap brutal gags. Jokes from the first film that were subtle or implicit are magnified and exaggerated. For example, in Scari Movie I, several insinuations were made to imply that the character is Rai Gay. This was hilarious. But, in Scari Movie II, the whole scene of suffocating the penis with Rai under the bed was dead and incredibly unbridled. This is the whole film pattern. Only humorous humor * does not take away a movie. It was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately. As much as it hurts to evaluate Vaiji's film so low, I have to give 2 out of 10.
