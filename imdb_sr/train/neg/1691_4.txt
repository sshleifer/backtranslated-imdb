This film is really nothing but a well-recognized well-formed string of tense sequences that are inevitable "incredible!" at the end of each. Indeed, there is no development of character and there is no real conspiracy to talk about it. Only the skeletal motivations for the characters are to do anything as they move forward toward their inevitable destinies. All this is just an excuse to show a creepy ghost child (which seems to have attracted a family cat to his ectopace), and his ghost mummy (with a long black hair hanging in his face as the "Ring") takes a series of gypsum boards, two-dimensional pronunciation for human characters. This version of "The Grudge" in English is equivalent to film junk food; satisfying at the moment, but not exactly what you should be living on. It is not recommended.
