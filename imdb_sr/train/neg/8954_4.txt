I had great hopes for this film, because I enjoyed the book so much. However, I do not think I would understand the premise of the film that I have not already read the book. The film is a noble attempt to show the desperation of people trying to break the ties of the rule of a powerful government, but the book describes suffering much more thoroughly. Corrupt government officials have comfortable, almost luxurious lives, while ordinary people struggling to get the basic needs of survival. Perhaps most people feel that way to their leaders and rulers, regardless of whether they are actually oppressed or suppressed. Orwell's dystopia looks like it could exist in many places in our modern world. It has been several years since I read the book, but often in the media and informal conversation I hear references to the Big Brother, the Police think Novgorod. Probably many people who use these terms do not understand where the conditions came from. I recommend that you read the book.
