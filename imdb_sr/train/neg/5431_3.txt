This is your typical Priiadarshan movie - a bunch of crazy characters on a stupid mission. His peak signed the film's entire film and fought in some crazy moshpit because of hidden money. Whether it's a winning lottery card in Malamaal Veekli, black money in Hera Pheri, a codecoo at Phir Hera Pheri, etc. Do not get me wrong; as clich√© and absurd his films can be, I usually end up enjoying comedy. However, in most of his previous films there was really good humor (Hungama and Hera Pheri were worthy of attention). Now, the joy of his films is fading because he uses the same formula over and over again. The songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks great. Rajpal Yadav is irritating, and Tusshar is not much better. Kunal Chehemu is fine, and Sharman Joshi is the best.
