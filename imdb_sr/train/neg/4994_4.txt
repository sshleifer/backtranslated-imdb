Good movies are genuine, some leave a message or touch you in a certain way, but sometimes you do not like it. I wanted something simple, without thinking about a simple action when I was watching this. It started well and it was pretty fun, so why is it a bad review? In the end, the film lost credibility. The story was not so sweet at all, the action was not too special, but generally good, the acting was fine, and it's more than enough to meet my needs. But everything broke down, because things happened over the top, and that left me feeling bad. It was supposed to invest a little more effort to make it all credible and get 7 in the category "not thinking just about ordinary action". In the end, if you know that you will be upset because things that look completely illogical are happening: do not look! otherwise I would say that we will continue ...
