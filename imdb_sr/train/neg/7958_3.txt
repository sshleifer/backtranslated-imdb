Protege works linearly; Do not expect quick action, nor will you find yourself with a terrible breath because there simply is no time for sitting on the edge. There are not many problems, so do not too. I would not blame the acting - the show would be the worst if not the Vova acting, which was the only saving grace of the film. And, oh, that sweet girl. Humor is at best weak, and the show has to pass as a campaign against drugs that uses the usual shock tactics (esp and Zhang's scenes) to tell us things we already know-that is, drugs break up family, heroin is driving you crazy, it's not easy to get separated, you'll get into a vicious circle. I know you seem to be a little bit raw, but I feel that the show is far from seamless and somewhat uneven (* SPOILER ALERT *: Take, for example, when Andy Lau was brought to the police station : what? there are all tapes and evidence against you since 1997, and that's how they caught him. No, there is no action in the car hunt, just a jump of the scene, which at first glance diminished Vu's role as a secret.) I doubt that the lack of creativity is attributed to the fact that it is nevertheless the production of Mediacorp Raintree - a Singapore film company.
