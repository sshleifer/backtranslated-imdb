I've never commented on movies, but I've seen 5 great comments about this "movie" and decided that I have to consider it with my review. My instructor received this film by mail, mixed with his academics (AMPAS, who voted for Oscar), and was so burdened with the terrible construction of this movie to bring him into our class. Show us that you do not need to make a movie. This film has no plot, the scenes are terrible, horribly arranged (often using fake "24" image styles in the picture), and performances (especially lead, which even fails to act like a bad actress) are mostly unpleasant. Someone really did not manage to understand the point of introduction, namely placing the plot. No settings! At half the film, neither did the rest of the class know what this film should be. A photograph of the opening of the crane, which puts some sort of murder, has never been addressed, and now that I think about it, it probably meant that it would be a flash forward, while the rest of the movie would be a flashback, but from there, paint it directly to the next, without any indication as such . BAH, I really could continue on. At the very least, this film gives me new confidence in my ability to create a movie.
