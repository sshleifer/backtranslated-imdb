I do not buy kung fu movies for the plot. I buy them for fighting scenes. A bad plot can be forgone for excellent fighting scenes, but not vice versa. The story was decent, but it was too slow for my tastes. There were about 3 or 4 focal points of battle, lasting only minutes. The last fight was a bit longer, but by then I was so boring that I did not pay any attention to it.
