I'm 47 years old and spent so much of my life as I remember, a horror and sci-fi movie fan. Regardless of whether they are silent, black-and-white, without a budget or big budget, there are few who can not find something for themselves. That said, I will give this movie a credit for good up and creating effects, but that's all. This is the case of the effects of the story. The truth is that we live in a time where there is little left that has not been seen in the horror movie. Therefore, for a movie of any kind to truly entertain it must have a good, original story. A good story can overcome bad effects and bad behavior, but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie. This movie does not even have a good acting, just good effects. So, unless you can just say it up, upload this.
