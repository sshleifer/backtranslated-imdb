When I was younger, I thought that the first film was really good in childhood, so I decided to see a sequel. This is an example of why some movies should not have sequels, because the first movie is usually the best, and that's it. In fact, now that Ariel and Eric have a daughter who is not allowed out of the house because they are worried about Ursula's sister (octopus with her legs of movies), Morgana is approaching her. When the child comes out, he asks Ursul's sister to turn her into a siren, just like her mom. That's why Ariel returns to the sea to find her. The same good voice artists, it's just a story that could have a little more thought. Adequately!
