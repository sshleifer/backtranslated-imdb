this film is similar to Darkness Falls, and The Boogeiman (2005), but it's much more graphical than both, and it's not as good as it's just as slow and pretty predictable. There are also Deliverance and Amitiville Horror.plus, we get some new taste in the mix, and some of these scenes turn out to be motivational / inspirational preaching. In fact, this film is a prank of almost everything, although it's bloody, the effects of make-up are not quite real. in fact they look kind of cheap, besides all that, there is some really terrible clich√© dialogue. And I will not say when, but there is a point in which a few actions of the characters were not authentic or credible, given the circumstances. no one in his good mind, what would be done in this way. When you watch a movie, you'll know what I mean. There are also some free nudes for sake.it nudity, just what was not needed. The acting was actually pretty good s.so, after carefully weighing the evidence, id says this film was transient, but not good. My judgment for The Tooth fairies: 4/10
