This film is now my meter to which all the other films will be compared ... like in, "was he as stupid as the Revolver?" I was also in the audience at the Toronto International Film Festival last night, where one room filled with more than 2,000 people came out in a ghostly silence after being absolutely stunned for 2 hours of pure nonsense. Jason Stratham would have been incredible that he had only a purpose. In the first 10 minutes he made a proposal from Andre 3000 and Big Pussi (from Soprano's glory), why NO SENSE ALL! Then there are shootings, and there is Rai Liotta who wears shameful bikini panties, then there is some animation, bare butt Rai Liotte, a lot of shooting, teeth crunching, the art house wants to be pretensions and more than Liott's unpleasant body that caused laughter on each displaying. which I'm not quite sure that the reaction he asked ... not 5 times in any case. Everyone in this movie thinks they are smarter than average bears, and Gui Ritchie thinks that Iogi Bear is embodied. The stories may have gone nowhere, but it's posturing out! The only way this film could be worse is that Madonna herself is in her.
