I'm glad I saw this movie after Mr.Sandler became famous. It's bad ... bad, bad, bad. There is no complication. It's like watching a painfully boring home movie. I really enjoy his other films ... but if you're a fan like me .... do not approach this one. This can change your thinking about Adam. Perhaps you will never recover from the horror of this movie ... I had a better time watching the elders playing in the house .......
