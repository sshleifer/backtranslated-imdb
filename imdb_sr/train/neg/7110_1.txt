Well, you have to give the director a credit for how brave he is. Gutsi would be the right term. Not only did he use a total of five people (no add-ons to everything), but he decided to use sub-par special effects with a confusing and boring complication, also, and I DO NOT joke, put a warning at the beginning of a movie that might DIE OF FRIGHT !!! However, they promise FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFFFIIIIINNNNN. Having a creepy, cautious gardener is always a good move. Iaaa-unikue-aaavvvvnnn .... <br /> <br /> If you are watching the Mystery Science Theater 3000, you may have seen this. They like to show terrible movies, just to let you know. Good gift for someone you hate.
