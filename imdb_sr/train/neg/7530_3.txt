I thought this film was boring, monotonous, and rather uninteresting with a busy, shallow, "optimistic" ending that was not true for the whole story. Following these characters through the weekend of horrific events, hostile attitudes and bad news, my idea of ​​watching, an interesting movie is not mine, and I was very tired of the topic of "one note" and I could not wait for it to end-- in fact, I almost stopped halfway. The whole film seemed meaningless and wandering, and the characters were mostly depressed and unpleasant, although the acting was good. Small movie with small ambitions and a little appeal - I'm sorry, but it just did not work with me, and I love good, small films! This one was not only, although I continued to look at him in hope and believe that he would. I was disappointed, especially after two domestic reviewers put it on their "Annual 10 Best" list. I recommend that you watch "House of Sand" - now there is a good, small movie!
