Previously I was not aware that in the early nineties the University of Devry (or ITT Tech?) Added a film to his wonderful repertoire of technical programs. Well, this movie must have been a product of class valedictorian. My friend and I rented the original Boogeiman 1980 on my Netflik, and this movie was on the other side of the DVD. Do not waste time with this movie. Terribly terrible. The author of the film adds 2 main characters, a woman and her therapist. The woman dreamed of Boogeiman and his victim from the first film. Over 50% of this movie is a stock of original film. The rest of the film is the main character who has bad dreams, and her therapist drones to the storyteller. These scenes are shot through a filter so thick that the characters are bright. It looks like Angela Lansburi will look 25 years old. So, let's repeat, it's terrible. Do not watch this movie.
