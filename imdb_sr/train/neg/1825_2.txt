I'm not sure what. I could not laugh. I had an open mind. I did not want to be firmly attached to it. But I could not seriously laugh at this film. I was not funny. Some parts seemed like Ben Stiller and Jack Black tried too. Just because you put two very entertaining men does not mean that this will be a great comedy. Some movies just should not be made. This is one of them. Because she's doing many old jokes and acting, she was just stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. At least. But I was not impressed. I'm sorry, but I can not give anything less than two. And that's all I give. 2/10
