As a former citizen of Kalamazoo who loved the city, I was looking forward to watching this film. But what a disappointment! Although the acting and production are not bad, the scenario is terrible, the plot is unrealistic, and the theme is disturbing. The main message of this film is that women are without husbands and no children. I can not believe how regressive it is in regard to women. Was the writer living under the stone? Although I enjoyed seeing my favorite city on the big screen, I would not suggest anyone to this movie. It's horrible. It's a disgrace to a city named after him.
