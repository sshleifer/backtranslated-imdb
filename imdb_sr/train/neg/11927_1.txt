No doubt, the worst movie I've seen for a long time. I've kept it all the way, because there's definitely something here, but no. The plot, when not dealing with cliches, walks to the point of non-existence; the dialogue that should be the street is simply torn off; characters never develop outside sketches; sets are clich√©s. Worse still, with regard to its co-director, the photo is just so-so. Comments on other places that raise it with Get Carter, Long Good Fridai or Kaspar Hauser are far from the mark; The lives of saints lack their innovation, let alone their depth and shadow. In short, their craft. An unscrupulous editor would probably shorten it to a decent 30-minute short film, but as it is, the six-form film project was executed on a million pound scale; wandering and bubbling with their own pretensions. If she got the money (certainly only because of Rankin's name), while other small films are fighting for cash, she depresses the British film industry.
