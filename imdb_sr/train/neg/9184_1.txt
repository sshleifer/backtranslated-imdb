F * ck Me! I've seen some incredibly terrible movies in my time, but this requires p * ss! Apart from complications that are not really there, comically stupid acting, hilariously horrible pronouncements for zombies; You know what, I could go all day. Every little thing in this movie is either stupid, senseless, shit or shame. I express to anyone who wants to watch this movie ... do not! I'm ashamed to tell you, I have this on my stand. Hidden right on the damn bottom of a huge crowd. I could not even give this excuse for the film. It's so bad.
