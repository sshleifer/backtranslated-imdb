I usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review, but in this movie there really is not much to talk about. Just a mix of other FAR better epics of sword and magic. The lack of cohesion runs like banality. Even the main population who refuses to wear other cloth clothes around the bed is quite boring because, to a large extent, it has the chests of a young boy. Lucio Fulci has left the bottom of the barrel here and it shows. My Class: D- DVD Ektras: Posters & Stills Gallery; Lucio Fulci Bio; and American and international theater trailers. Eie Candi: Sabrina Siani is in Toples (some consider it attractive, I'm not); Various additives are also toples
