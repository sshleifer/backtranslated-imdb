What is this ? Low-budget sexual comedy? In any case, it perfectly describes people in Spain. We could think of a better idea, I think they have been doing such films since the 60's ... and people love them! This is neither comedy for teenagers, nor family (you can not allow your twelve-year-old boys to look in bed, he will never want to go to Spain). This should be rated as "R" because only 35+ people are allowed to watch: S I'm really disappointed, maybe I do not like homosexuals (which is a pretty important part of the movie). <br /> <br Foreign humor is horrible in movies (except Kusturica), stick to the drama! If you want a new comedy, try Talladega Nights
