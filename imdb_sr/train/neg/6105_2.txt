If you are a person who can get out of a very bad movie, then I recommend this. If not, go away. This is a staggeringly cheap movie, and sometimes you can wonder if it's just a joke that someone pulls. The most positive comment I can say is that responsible people have realized that it is stupidity with low-budget budget, so here at least there is a sense of entertainment. But this is as amateur as it gets. Their idea of ​​gigantic mushroom killers are simply guys covered with beige-brown leaves with what looks like garbage covers on their heads. Obviously, it should not be taken seriously (at the very least), but even with this waiver you will find yourself shaking your head in the terrible roughness of all that. Or they often laughed, just like me.
