Let me start by saying that I am a great fan of fantasy. However, this film is not for me. Many unrealistic arguments try to support the claim of this film that the dragons have ever existed. The film mentions links in various stories from different countries, but it does not explore them in more detail, which could give the film some credibility. The film uses (nice!) CGI to tell us the story of a fantasy about the life of a young dragon. This is combined with a flash-forward in the style of a popular TV show-CSI to look like something scientific, which definitely is not. In many cases, the arguments / traces are unrealistic. In some cases, traces used to display dragons may have existed, or fly, or spit fire, they are simply ineffective. To see this, it just makes me cracks in my fingers. Even the fantasy movie needs a certain degree of reality, but this one is simply not there. Conclusion: It's a pretentious fantasy-CSI documentary, which is not worth watching.
