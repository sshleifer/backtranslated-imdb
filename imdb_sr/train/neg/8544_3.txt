I've never been sure where this thing is going. It seems that these people are interested in what is happening on a mountain. They investigate, have close escapes, go, go back, go, put each other in danger, walk in a dream, attack witches with permanent clothes etc. . She's gone, she's giving it back, she's leaving her again. You understood the point. It seems to me that the whole thing comes closer to some kind of victim, but I'm not sure, or I'm turning people into witches, but I'm not sure. It's simply boring and infinite and not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the print is so bad that when twenty seconds of darkness is not unusual. Whether this is caused by age or overuse of night filters.
