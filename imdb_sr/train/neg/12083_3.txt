Iai! ... I think. It's hard to say. It's hard to have emotion about a movie that does not have emotion. This film is sterile as a surgical scalpel. For the landscape, there are several stone pillars, several stone seats, a couple of stone crosses and several stone actors. They do not have emotions! The only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is Hamlet, and Hamlet is greatly written literature. Dubbing was not really that bad. The voices kept the boring, gloomy, gloomy, animal atmosphere that the film gave. I saw this version of Hamlet on the fantastic Mystery Science Theater 3000 three times, and every three times, I was on the brink of turning off the TVs, even though it was MST 3K. an exciting production of a drama that deserves much better.
