This movie is simply bad. It's not worth watching even to laugh. A crazy professor is simply boring. Even the discontinuation of disbelief to enable invisibility (what I do for good bad films) and enabling extremely stupid victims in a horror movie, this film requires even more. If you are looking for a shower room in a women's locker room, and random sexual encounters, take a pornography, if you are looking for a good-bad movie, get something else. If you just want to waste time on a dull bad movie, rent this.
