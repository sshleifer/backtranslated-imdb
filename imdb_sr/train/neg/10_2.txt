This film had many promises, and the action was relatively interesting, but the actors, the director and the editors seriously released this film. I feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. The acting is wooden, few characters are authentic. Who edited this clearly learned some new editing techniques and wanted to spray them all over the movie. There are many quick 'fictitious' changes in almost every scene, which are obviously symbolic, but only end up as boring. to break the balance, but unfortunately, I left the feeling that I lost time and that the filmmakers spent their money.
