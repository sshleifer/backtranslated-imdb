I just watched this movie last night at the Tribeca Film Festival and it seriously asks me if people at the festival actually show films before they choose. The film was simply horrible - I say that without hyperbole or hidden motives - it was horrible. Days of Metju Modin as the leading man are far away. Gina Gershon had an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she should be shy of her participation in this movie. Gloria Ruben had a strange little snot in her - she should be ashamed. The scenario was terrible and we have absolutely no reason to worry about the characters. I very much doubt that it will be picked up, but again it is known that people in Hollywood sometimes make mistakes. I really think that "Kettle of Fish" is a serious candidate for the worst movie I've ever seen.
