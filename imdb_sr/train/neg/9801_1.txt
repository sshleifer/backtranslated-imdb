I remember that this show was on television when I was a kid in the early nineties, and there was that rage about the children with dumb leotards who worked kung fu on each other and ride around plastic dinosaurs. His name was Pover Rangers. I remember that little children walked and hit each other, and then the shirts and stuff from the show were banned in many school districts across the country, because this show taught children how to fight each other in solving their differences. I never thought of this as a show, especially when there were better shows like The Tick played on Fok Kids. Most of the older teenagers always looked at the rangers in a funny and desperate manner, and it's not difficult to ask why. The video is at best funny. Costumes of colored renderers look like things in which you will work, and dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. Then you enter the acting, and of course they are really funny hairstyles. All boys run around with earrings, half of them wear shoes of the nineties, and they always wear the same clothes every day, and then they turn into force carriers. And the toys are particularly funny, and it was the joke of many hosts who talked about late night shows. And of course, two of the worst films ever made, and I think that the two of the worst films ever made are based on this show with almost any critics who destroyed both films and the shows on which it was based. Pover Rangers is nothing but a bad commercial TV for particularly bad toy trade. As an adult, I do not look at her gently, but as another shame of childish performances from the 1990s, fashion and boyfriends.
