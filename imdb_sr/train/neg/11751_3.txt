When HEI ARNOLD! it was first broadcast in 1996, I watched it. It was one of my favorite shows. Then the same episodes began to show up again and again, so I was tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching them. I was kind of surprised when I heard about HEI ARNOLD! THE MOVIE because it seems not as popular as some of the other Nickelodeon cartoons like SPONGEBOB SKUAREPANTS. Still, without any better work, I went to watch the movie. I entered the theater, I did not expect much. I just expected it to be a stupid movie version of a children's cartoon like RECESS film. I guess I got what I expected. It was a stupid movie and nothing more. There were some good parts here and there, but in most cases the film was a stink. Easy for kids.
