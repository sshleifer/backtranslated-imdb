Valking Talla's 1973 tracking continues the drama of real life around Sheriff Buford Pusser of Tennessee, but this sequel plays as a lame TV movie. Bo Svenson takes over the lead from Joe Don Baker, but he's too gentle to play; He appears as a singer from the land, not a guitar. Good actors like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askev and Robert DoKui end up with very little work. I would give the movie one star strictly for its good intentions, but the script is transparent and lazy mass of routine difficulties and production is cheap. Following 1977 "Final Chapter-Valking Tall", and in 1978, the television "Real American Hero".
