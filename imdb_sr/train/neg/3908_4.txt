It has enough stars in HOUSE OF SPIRITS to create another galaxy, but the final product is quite disputable. The film and its messages are very noble and I think most would agree with them. (Liberal democracy is good, violent fascist regime is bad, openness is good, racism is bad, etc.). Unfortunately, with this we are executed from head to toe and used as much subtlety as I have described them. After all, it remains to watch very noble people without any shortcomings that appear with nasty jerks that do not have redeeming qualities. It radiates with all the tension of a poorly orchestrated "pro" wrestling match. Jeremy Ajrols plays a sponsor, a man of many contradictions. Meril Streep as his talented young man and Glenn Close, as her daughter-in-law. When the camera stays with these people, the film has a tendency to move and is quite comfortable. Unfortunately, the HOUSE OF SPIRIT is simply dealing with too many sub-sets, and the characters appear and emerge from the picture as a target for shooting. We do not know them, so we do not care about them. The result is boredom. If Bille August, the director and scriptwriter (from the book Isabel Allende), either prolonged the film or cut off a few characters, this film may have been fully operational. At the present moment, it was a nice try, with nice messages, and cowardly zeal. It is not recommended.
