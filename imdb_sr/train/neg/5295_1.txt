A teenager who seems to have all done suicide. Leaves his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) to ask many questions ... and blame themselves. Good idea, poorly guided. For starters, this was done before 1988 - mostly in TV films and after the After School Specials. Apart from some curses and dialogue (hence PG-13), this did not add anything new. The outcome is predictable and Reeve's attempts at acting are really painful to watch. He is good now, but not in 1988. In addition, his character was dressed as clumsy and always looked so dirty that it was difficult to build a sympathy. I saw every scene coming and every "surprise" was telegraph. Actually, I could not wait to finish this. I have a vague memory that I saw him at the theater in 1988 and hated him (bombarded by BADLI). It still looks almost 20 years later. The theme is worth handling, but it's done better (with better acting) in countless other films. "Common people" comes to my mind. You can skip this one.
