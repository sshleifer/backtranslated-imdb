This horrible movie gathers every Asian stereotype that you can imagine in a disgusting package. A devious Japanese businessman sends a stupid but lovely policeman Patto Morita to restore industrial secrets in Detroit. Here he encounters the fifth Jai Leno, who immediately calls the victim of the murder as a Japanese and calls Morita Tojo. From there it's all downhill.
