One would think (like myself) that Steve Martin, Goldie Havn and John Cleese should be at least decent. These stars (especially Martin and Clays) have produced some of the funniest comedies of all time. Well, I obviously misunderstood - this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It strikes me how one joke after the other can be so deeply uncomfortable. I wanted to watch these talented actors perform one of the most lonely scenarios I had an accident to find. Relying solely on big names, I have long stayed full of hope during the duration of the film, but consistently failed to provide any entertainment. Normally, both with movies in my life, I try to keep away from the biased comments and broad generalizations. But with this film, it's hard not to let go. I can count on one side, maybe even two or three fingers, the main Hollywood productions that left me behind this. This is easily one of the worst comedies ever made. I tried to enjoy this - I really am. But Out-of-Tovners eventually collapses. If you really want to have fun over time, just take your money and watch it rotate as you flush it to the west. Just do not watch this movie.
