I saw this for Gary Boussey and Fred Villiamson thinking they were cops. They are, but Busei is in the lead scene, and does not reappear for up to 40 minutes in the movie. Although every scene in which he is awesome. Especially when it is disguised in a blind rogue. What's incredible in this movie is the plot. In film Fred Villiamson tries to find out who goes in and kills telephone sex operators. At some point I think it's her Busei. But it turns out I'm only partially right. Busei is not a killer, but he calls and harasses women over the phone. Why? I do not know. He is not in any way connected with the killer, he just does it because of the blows.
