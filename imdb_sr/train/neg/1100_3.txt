Since most films about a movie about ten years ago, I would like to add a newer movie, a film opened with a B-17 bombing of Germany, the film is reduced to Oscar Werner Hauptmann (captain) Vust figure and his Aide run for cover as he broke through to Hitler's Fuehrer Bunkers, once inside, they were examined by bunker staff, the film was then cut into one of many conference scenes with Albin Skoda giving a decent impression that Adolf Hitler gathered his officers to "Ultimate Victory" while Verner's character shows that by if he realizes that the inhabitants of the bunker are caught in the fantasy world, some non-bunker events are presented, most notably the flooding of the metro system in order to prevent Russian progress through them and the juvenile subplot involving a young member of Flak's unit and his family's survival difficulties - this film suffers from several detailed inaccuracies that a German film made only 10 years after the Second World War are not included; the actor who shows Goebbels (Villi Krause) wears the same uniform as Hitler, including the Eagle-Goebbel wearing a brown uniform of the Nazi Party with a sweepstick - "SS" military clothing, the German army camouflage, a well-documented Hitler's assignment of an iron cross for the boys of Hitler's youth has been shown to have happened inside the bunker (this is done outside in the yard) ending, Hitler's suicide weapon is clearly shown as a Belgian model for painting in 1922, most agree that it was Valther PPK-an act of acting also seems completely inaccurate because the drunken dance scene at the end of the film is noticeable, this piece is shown as a cabaret sketch with a drunken wounded soldier (his hand in his hand) who manically walked toward music while the sisters make a combination of striptease / belly dance, all with candlelight ... this is actually unpleasant to watch - the most unlikely part is when Verner Captain Vust gets only the audience with Skoda's Hitler, Hitler is portrayed as broken on a wall bench, drugged in a delirium, when Verner's character begins to question him, Hitler starts screaming, leading to the SS guard who mortally wounds Verner's character in the background of shooting - this fictitious scene is not based on a true historical story. - Verner's character then pulls to die in the hallway, while Hitler prepares for his end, Hitler's forgiveness with his staff is shown, but suicide is out of the screen, and the last second of the film shows Hitler the dim smoke of a funeral that slowly turns into a ghostly picture of the face of a dead Oscar Verner / Hauptmann Vust - this film is more allergic than the historical one, and anyone interested in this period would have been better looking at newer films such as the 1973 remake. "Hitler: 10 days "or the German film" Dovnfall "(Der Untergang), if they want a more accurate presentation of this dramatic story, these two last films are based on the testimony of the eyewitnesses of the first person, with" Hitler: the Last Ten Days ". composed from the autobiography of Gerhard Boldt, as an officer in Fuehrer's Bunker and the "Pad" from the memory of Hitler's secretary, the play for the Der Lette Akte film was taken from the book by Nuremberg's trial for war crimes trial of Michael Musmann "Ten Days to Die", which there is more compilation of events (many obviously fictitious) than eyewitness history - it is surprising that Hugh Trepot Roper's account, "The Last Day of Hitler", has never been filmed.
