This must be one of the worst Swedish movies ever recorded. It's a shame that such a bad scenario is allowed to become a movie and be shown in cinemas only in 2006. in the same movie. It should not be so obvious. I can not understand why many famous actors thought the idea was even visible in a movie like this one. If I had respected some of the famous actors in this movie before I saw the movie, it is now safe. I heard this film follows this film and I can not understand how it is possible at all.
