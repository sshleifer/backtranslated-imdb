I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler, and one day I watched Cast & Crev on one of my DVDs and video 'Going Overboard' and decided to go and rent it. So I went out with a few of my friends and rented it. We put him in and we were shocked to see Adam Sandler who has not yet hit puberty, it looks like he was 12 years old when this film came out. I could not even watch 30 minutes of this shit, I did not laugh, laughed, or even laughed in this movie, I was actually laughing only when I saw how horrible the film was. I could not believe how much he tried to make the audience smiling in this movie ... and it did not work once. Although from the horror viewing angles of the camera and listening to the disgusting scenario, I realized why I had never heard of this movie ... because the shit is more than anything ever happened before. This film, in my opinion, was the BEST movie ever made ... EVER!
