Before the release of the genre Night of Living Dead George Romero, zombies were relatively good creatures. In the old days, they certainly had much better manners. But the social label besides what the excitement of these early zombies offered to the film audience? Judging by this film, none. The story is about an expedition to Cambodia, the purpose of which is to find and destroy the secret of zombification. One of the parties reveals the secrets himself and is about building up his own zombie army. This film is basically a love triangle with zombies. But seeing this as a movie from the 1930s, the aforementioned zombies look more like somnambulists than the meat-and-nutritional diversity we are talking about today. They seem to react to the control of the mind, not the insatiable appetites. And, quite frankly, the 'revolt' is somewhat puzzled. The whole thing is very boring. Apart from the lack of horror, there are no entertaining melodramatic theatrical performances. It seems unlikely that this could have given much fun even 70 years ago. You see him if you have to see everything with 'zombie' in the title, but otherwise I would advise you to skip this.
