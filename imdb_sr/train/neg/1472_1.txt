I'm totally amazed to see that the average rating for this film is 5.2 / 10. For what strikes me, it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I'm still wondering why I watched it all the way. First of all, the plot is completely hopeless, and the acting is really terrible. I think any completely unknown actress would be better for the role of Susan Lucci; As for Mr. Kamara Del Reyes, I think it would be a better choice to stay in his Doll Doll. To sum up, it's a total waste of time (and I'm trying to stay decent ...) to avoid at all costs. My grade is 1 and I still think it's well paid, but since we can not give O ....
