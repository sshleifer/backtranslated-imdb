It's true that some of Peter Sellers's fans can be disappointed with this, his last venture. But surely every fan of sellers will find enthusiasm in all his films, simply because of the enormous talent of a man. and Strange Planets Dr. Fu Manchu is certainly not an exception. Unfortunately, this would prove to be the last movie of the seller, (even released after his death), but it is still nice to see how a man managed to retain his irreplaceable talent until his premature death. And not only do we get one seller, we are coming, too, because the vendors play not only the title role, but also their enemy, equally bizarre Nailand Smith, a detective looking for a crazy 168-year-old Fu. The story is equally unusual as we follow Fow's unforgettable ludors to make his elixir that defies his age and Naye and his group of associates to prevent him. Like any major movie seller, the film comes with guaranteed flawless performance from him, as well as with many famous actors - David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren. a few. It's also nice to see Pink Panther Burt Kvouk (Cato) enjoying the beating with Sellers - although he plays the same role, but it's still nice. The story is really pretty funny, like many of the characters involved, who classify this as a film strongly influenced by Goon. And, although never reaching the height of Goon's comedy, there are many fun jokes that seem to be in the right direction. The film has collapsed commercially on its original release because the whole world is sad in the aftermath of the death of the seller (the film is released less than 3 weeks after) and there is always this sad thought that lurks in the background of your mind when you see that it is the Seller's last film. It's far from a big movie - it's often slow, too funny, and sometimes jokes are simply not there - but it's still nice - at least for another top performance by Peter Sellers.
