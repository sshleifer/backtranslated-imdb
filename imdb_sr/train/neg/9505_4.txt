I will not criticize the movie. There is not much to talk about. There are good scenes of animal actions that at that time were probably amazing. Clide Beatty is not exactly a Matinean idol. He's a bit small and does not look particularly good. But that's fine. He's a man in a cage with lions. We know that when he can not take the time from his lions to turn to his girlfriend, he will end up on the island with her and he will have to save the day. Someone previously said it was a history lesson. Scenes in the circus are one more day, especially the kids who hang out. I did not know that in the 1930s, they sailed to three shells. It looked like something in 1860. I guess they were the snapshots they had. No wonder the thing broke. They always talk about how to fix it. There is even a dirigible. This tells us a little about male female relationships at the time, some sort of giggling nonsense. But if you do not take it too seriously, you can have fun watching it.
