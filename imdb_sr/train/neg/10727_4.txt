The movie is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour. It begins with funny conversations at the bar and seems to be a good, funny story. Well, I can tell you they will not come. It will get worse in a few minutes in a movie that provokes your patience, as well as a sense of shame for the actors who will probably be dissatisfied. In an interview I heard that the director wanted in this film to express the sense of loss of identity that, in his words, most people in this globalizing world experienced. I was amazed when I heard it. Do I live in the same world that I live in? All right, many people walk in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all that, but it does not make me feel like I'm losing my identity. What does Khrzhanoski think, that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch? Am I short-sighted or is he? So my voice: a good start to the film saves it from getting 1, and decent 4 is my conclusion.
