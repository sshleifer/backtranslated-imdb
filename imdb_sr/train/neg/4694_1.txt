I am interested in the title and description of Big Riga while I attended the SKSSV Film Festival in Austin, TKS. However, I was eager to get to the seat as soon as Big Rig finished. The Big Rig is made up of several drivers who went to deliver goods across the United States. The characters are all great people, but filmmakers have never entered deep into the complexity of them as humans. Instead, the story meanders how much the tickets in the film should lead, but never. We're losing the most. We - the audience - we are not going anywhere and, as a direction of narration, we end up somewhere, but without direction, location or complication. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? The narrative is untidy, and the director's intention to "humanize" a group of people they consider "overlooked" and "invisible" encounters unconsciously and irritatingly inexplicable. The problem here lies in the perspective of the director instead of the truck driver. Directors bring their naive assumptions about truck drivers, and then simply edit the movie to confirm these assumptions. All in all, the story lacks any tension in the story, the film is too long (it should have been a 15-minute sketch), the big question "so what" is never answered, and the whole movie is a piece of transparent propaganda nothing that would "illuminate" as the directors assert), the outer world of major bargainers.
