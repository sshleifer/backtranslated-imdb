If you made a movie in the late 1980s, you basically had a 50/50 chance of being set up underwater or in prison (unfortunately, we never got an underwater movie). Framed by the assassination of mafia boss Anthony Franciosa, Dennis Cole ends with the death sentence, next to Fr. Frankie (Frank Sarcinello Jr.). But this is the smallest Derek problem, because the government agent (and mafia colonel) Colonel Burgess (John Sakon, who also manages) uses the prison as a polygon for a new supervisor. This is the only film that Sakon directed during his career. For the guy who worked with the director's tune, it seems that he was the only one who made any advice from cheap Italian. Certainly, it's a small budget, but it can not justify a stiff performance, recording a hunch, or clumsy exposure in the first 15 minutes. With his credit, the Saxon made it a little wrong and worked on a hilarious bare scene (our lead fell asleep during a riot in prison just to imagine a scientist). Cole, who looks more robust than Jan-Michael Vincent, is as decent as the leadership of Francios - a sporting really bad carpet - gives him everything as a clich√© of a mobster. The end takes place at the favorite location of Marti McKee, Bronson Canion. Retromedia has posted this on DVD as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE.
