I saw this film 5 years ago, and the memory of it continues to haunt me to this day. I was fully aware of how horribly it should have entered her, so I was only guilty. But like most, I did not believe in all the negativity. As a Sandler fan, it seemed inconceivable that one of his films could indeed be so bad. I thought they were just Sandler's haters. I could no longer make a mistake. What we have here is a comedy that does not contain any one second anything funny. It's actually quite a success. You'd think of a 90-minute comedy, maybe they happened to come across something that's even fun. But no, it's terrible. It's not "so bad it's good," it's just bad. You can not laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. You patiently wait for a joke that will at least make you laugh, but never come. Have you seen the movie Ring? Where do people watch a video cassette and die 7 days later? If this movie was on the video, people would immediately die with their own hand, and they would have a smile on their face to realize that their agony was over, and that would be the first smile since they pressed the game. > Maybe you're inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is, you can not reduce your curiosity. Do not. Please do not. Trust me, I'm doing you a favor. There are two types of people in the world who think that Going Overboard is the worst movie ever made, and those who have not seen it yet.
