The show had great episodes, this is not one of them. It's not a terrible episode; it's hard to follow "The Man Who Was Death", "Everything Through the House," and "Dig That Cat, He Really Went." This episode is about a couple who just married Peggi (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you discover that Charles just married Peggy for her money. The two go on a honeymoon, and their car breaks down on a cliff and have to seek shelter in an old abandoned building. Charles soon learns the secret of Peggin's family ... In my opinion you should watch this episode, but just do not expect the same feeling as the other episodes in the first season.
