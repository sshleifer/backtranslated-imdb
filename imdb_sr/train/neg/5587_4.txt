In addition to the "Tarzan" series, fertile Edgar Rice Burroughs also wrote many other books, although several of them were captured, in addition to the popular "Earth Core". The exception is a novel under the title "Lad and Lion", which is shown on the screen as "The Lion Man" (1936), an overly talkative, static, old movie, a slow and pretty boring film, despite being recorded in real desert locations. In fact, "movie" is the wrong word. The story does not move, but it moves at the speed of the snail in the abrupt sequence of the asshole. For example, at least five characters get complex open scenes and then simply disappear. Even more frustrating for movie lovers are characters that leave the impression of varieties (such as a girl who deals with Hall with a drugged wine), but play them by non-credit players! Recognized voices are generally worse than unknown. The only exception is Australian actress Finis Barton, who gives a good story about a kidnapped harem girl who rescues a young master's villa. However, most actors are burdened with the terrible dialogue of King James, who must be heard to believe! But the way this stupidity is played is language-to-face, a stratagem that does not appear to have happened to any single list of players without talent. Perhaps director J.P. McCarthy drew attention to this idea. In any case, it's sad to see the beautiful Kathleen Burke forced to trade the lines with Richard Carlile (her father) and Jon Hall (her parish). However, Mr. Hol gives his views with a little more conviction than Mr. Carlile, but this is not a recommendation.
