When I first saw a small scene in some announcements, I thought the show would be fun to watch. The little robot looks sweet. The style of animation seems somehow familiar to some classic performances. Before broadcasting, I studied it through some sources. I was a little disappointed there. Three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) are spoken appropriately, but Robotboi is an exception. It would be much nicer to be portrayed by a young guy. A good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from "What happened to Robot Jones?" The show is not really bad. But the way Robotboi is incompatible is my only criticism. So I do not look at it much.
