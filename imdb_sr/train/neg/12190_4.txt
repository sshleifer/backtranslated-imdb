One of Scorsese's worst. Average thriller; The only thing to recommend is that De Niro plays a psychopath. The finale is typical of this genre, i.e. Over-the-top, with another almost unbeatable, malicious criminal. I did not like the original from the '60s, and this version did not improve much. I have no idea why Scorsese wasted time on the remake. Then again, considering how his recent films were bad (I mean his boring Buddhist film and all those with his new favorite actress, blonde Di Caprio) this is not even so bad in comparison. And since Spielberg wanted to make a remake ... he could have been much worse.
