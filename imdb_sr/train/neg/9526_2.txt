Ever since I hired a video, I chose this one. OOPS The things that I wanted to mention beyond the already given summary are these. 1: Someone who had much to do with making this movie had a strange and sick fascination for food, was rude and unnecessary. 2: In the background of the movie there is some kind of sound background that seems to be there all the time and the way I felt for days after I looked at this garbage, I realized that something was going on the track. Or it is either just traumatic or bad. Many times during the film you can say that the writer and director have not had much experience or talent. And do not ask for acting either.
