Although this is "better" than the first Mulva (which does not say much anyway, I'd rather watch a dry color), it's still bullshit. Do yourself a favor and avoid any of these people with Lov Budget Pictures. I was impressed with the purchase of several DVDs that were supported by some indie filmmakers, and my boyfriend regretted me. Some are not even officially released (they are not bought by the filmmakers themselves) and I can not even indicate how badly they are all. Avoid anything with Teen Ape or Bonejack in them as they appear in other small indie films with which they are friends. If you are friends of these guys, it's a great chance that you were in their movies and having fun doing them. But for those who had to watch them? No way. Bad video, bad sound, bad acting, bad shop ... etc. I gave this only 2 because Debbie Rochon is in it and that's why. Maybe she does not even deserve 2. O 1 / 16th star that showed she was better than the first (I would like to be able to evaluate it in negatives). If you want a decent movie without a budget, pick something from LBP's "friend" to Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins or even Raising the Stakes. It's actually decent.
