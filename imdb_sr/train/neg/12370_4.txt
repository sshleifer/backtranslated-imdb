Probably should have called this film Map, because most of the whole stupid movie is turning around the graveyard. Not to mention how many the same boring images on the map exist. The only ones that show more than just the maps are small sweat droplets that are constantly being built at the head of our main character. This, of course, was a way to show us that there are incredibly tense things at the Immortal Hills cemetery. Now, come on, could not they just show us one of the scenes of death? We hear a lot about how everyone listed on the map drops like a fly, but we see nothing. Something I bury alive to keep my attention so I was pretty generous with the rating I gave, but I will not recommend this film to anyone. Unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweat, I recommend you rent a better movie, such as I'm spit on a grave or I drink your blood.
