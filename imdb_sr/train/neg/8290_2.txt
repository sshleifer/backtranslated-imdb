Alan Rudolph is such a director, without that special touch. As an example, in one of the dentists in the Dental Clinic, a clip was shot that could express the entire relationship between husband and wife. Rudolf missed him. The camera is in the hallway and looks through the door two dental offices, and Dana and Dave are alone in their rooms. You got an idea of ​​their desolation and isolation, but not much more. Brightness, color, body language, facial expressions could have been significantly improved. To say, I would spend all day, if necessary, to get that shot. It's the beauty and power of the movie: it can express so many lives in a matter of seconds. A video with a little boy walking in the vomit bar could improve. The child should have shown more fascination with the locks, she had to trample and bend her legs, her head should have bent down to look at the pool with all her care. Campbell has not delivered. He plays an uncommunicative man, true, but instead of transferring his inner anxiety in the voice, movement, body movement, the film rely on voice narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter ego, played by Denis Leary.
