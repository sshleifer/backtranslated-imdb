Now this film will not scare anyone, but it is interesting for two reasons - two big reasons and one smaller - well, these are three reasons, are not they? Special effects are interesting. I found them pretty interesting and a bit spectacular. See how hair grows on Marsi A. Hunt and Sibil Danning were scary, especially when they took part in trophies and trophies. Interestingly, the fact is that this Marsha Hunt is known for "Brovn Sugar" from the Rolling Stones song, and that she was in the infamous bare scene in the London movie Rock Music Hair. </ br> In addition to the special effects, there were two more things in this film, and they were repeated during closing. I lost counting, but I swear that Sibil Danning has divided these points for us in the final points at least a dozen times and maybe a lot more They were the most prominent characteristic of the film.
