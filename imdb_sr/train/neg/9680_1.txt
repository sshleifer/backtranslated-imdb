It seems that Greenavai has the habit of deliberately trying to harass his viewers. This film opens with an incest - and for no purpose, insignificant, occasional incest. That's Greenava's big problem. He loves tricks from the salon to shock if he does something meaningful. Technical skill is not enough. He's just a little perverse about perversion.
