This is a weird film, since Santa Claus lives on the cloud in the universe and fights against Satan and his servants ... but it's still fun. It has some real laughter. whether they were all intentional, it's certainly debatable. This movie is not good, but I can say that I really enjoy watching it. I would recommend this film through the "Santa Claus wins Martians," "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Litage "Santa Claus" with Tim Alen.
