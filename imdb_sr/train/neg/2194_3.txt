Neat premise. Very unrealistic. What I learned from this movie is that speeding out of control for going to the weekend cabin may not be the best idea. I loved Bill bouncing comfortably from the car and descending down the hill without any injuries! Unfortunately, the same can not be said about his wife. Oh, and the police seemed to have never found a car or followed the owner of the wreck. Many drawn scenes, including a regular stripper (still has nightmares from that scene). A poor assistant and his ugly useless hand. I admit I was intrigued to see what a mysterious "thing" behind the door, but when it appeared, I just laughed. HAHAHA !! The girl really looked sadistic angry that she was alive. Personally, I would really like a new body after such an unpleasant experience!
