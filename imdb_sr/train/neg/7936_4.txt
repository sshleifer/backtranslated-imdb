Nevertheless, another film about a group of less intelligent individuals on the journey, who leave their original road route for short trips or, in this case, for a tour of an attractive show. The results, as expected, are not at all good, as this special home is home to many crazy, healed survivors who had escaped prisoners from years earlier. The father, who is obviously a professional photographer, just has to stop and photograph the place, only to find out that he is still settled. Different family members go to see various attractions, just to get scared. Thinking that they are safe on the road, the van tires explode (surprise!), Leaving them looking for shelter and accommodation in a small town, for which we learned that it was inhabited exclusively by strangers (surprise!). This film is taking place as expected, and the family was persecuted and killed by a freak. There are some fighting against families, but they are probably among the worst scenes in the movie, since they are badly executed. There is nothing original originally here, unless you take into account totally inappropriate soundtracks that play in certain scenes and completely destroy the atmosphere and mood of the film. The act is as bad as I've seen some time since all of those involved (it's pretty bad when your actor does not play the role in Blood Blood.) Special effects are bad, and the end made me want to hit me television. < However, despite all the negatives, I enjoyed this movie somewhat, I definitely have "as bad as it is good" to him, and even enjoyed it when I went through a funny clichÃ©, complicated acting, and sirens special effects, although the end has left me feeling cheated and angry, especially since the film is not It's so good to get started, and the ending makes the entire movie meaningless. In the end, I can count the countless films that, if you've seen them, see this. The difference is that most of these movies are better, not remotely scary. My Rating: D
