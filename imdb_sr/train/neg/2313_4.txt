Shintaro Katsu won fame by playing a great character, Zatoichi. Zatoichi films had a strange and incredible concept - the blind guy is the biggest swordsman in Japan and each film is rectifying injustices and demanding retribution to the evil perpetrators. He's a good guy and movies are exciting and addictive (I actually watched every movie). That's why I saw this final version of the Hanzo series Razor, as I assumed it would be very similar .... and the boy was wrong! It turned out that Hanz's films were extremely sexual and promoted the rape of "women who deserve it." You see, Hanzo is a policeman from the Meiji period and he regularly takes wives to custody and examines them with violent rape with his "penis from steel." How he made his member so strong, that's something you have to see to believe, but it's certainly not disgusting. However, looking at other reviews, I see that they are still very popular ... and that's pretty scary. Despite some decent acting and incredible scenes of fighting, movies are just like brain contamination - and I would not like to imagine how films may have contributed to violence against women.
