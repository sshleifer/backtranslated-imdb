Now, I did not read the original short story to know all the literary points that were wrong here, so I will not go that way here. But I've learned a long time ago. Stephen King's films are not simply horror films, with perhaps a few exceptions. This was not one of them. It started well enough, and I will not regret the acting once, even though Fred Gwynne is as good as usual. And I will forgive the total lack of parental skills, because they needed to move the story forward ... But there was one consistent view that I could not be disturbed. And it was pretty close to the end of the film, and at least 2 characters participated in the activity of nonsense. The traps I am referring to are: There is a small zombie running around the house. You suspect it's under the bed. Do you (a) approach the bed as you can before you lift the blanket blindly blindly, exposing almost all of your body to any damage that can be caused by a tiny unhealthy cannibal. <Br /> <br /> < > (b) Move a little further away from the bed so that you can whirl under a completely open end from a position of slightly increased security, or at least see the miniature terror that comes to you, giving you a little reaction time. I know, we go with (a). I feel like I'm offering myself today for slaughter. Bleh Funny movie though ... Just not really scary.
