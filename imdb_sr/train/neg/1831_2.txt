I usually love comedies. I really enjoy them. But I really do not understand the point of "envy". I mean, it's boring content / theme, and it's not so funny. Although the acting is generally good, it's not enough that the movie is at least a little interesting. Stiller and Black do not show all their talent in this movie. So if you want to rent a comedy, I suggest you definitely do not go to this. Unless you want to be bored, and I see that I'm not the only one who has this opinion, because Jack Black even apologized for that (see Trivia).
