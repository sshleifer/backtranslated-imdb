STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning Alice, who defeated Freddie at the end of the last movie, is now trying to adjust my life. But her unborn child carries a demonic presence - Freddie, tries to re-enter their world. It's interesting to notice directors who received big breaks directed by Freddie's films - Charles Russell (Eraser, The Mask) Rennie Harlin (Longnight Kiss, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) and here Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space, Predator 2.) But as Russell and Harlin did a good job, the Hopkins IMO made a few subpages with this entry, which you should quickly forget. The story is obviously stretched as far as it can go here, with Freddie's funny father and a ridiculous demonic child. Even about an hour and a half, everything becomes pretty tiring, and of course, it's not scary either. "Bon appetit, bitch" is the only attraction of this other. smart entry into oblivion. *
