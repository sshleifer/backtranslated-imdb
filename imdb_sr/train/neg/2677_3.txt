It's a really raw parody of Tomb Raider and some Indian Jones, humor of siren, and acting. But still, it's a film with a soft core, which is expected and does not matter, because what you really want is sex. Which brings me to the biggest problem of everything, hardly any of this. What makes you feel like watching TV at 3 am, while independent movies are playing, and the one that is on it is made of a kid who goes nowhere in that industry. It's a long time for you to wait for the real scene of sex, you often think about something happening, and then just let it hang. One (maybe two, or one with two parts) that really goes somewhere is very pleasant. I personally can not recommend it if you do not find it in a clear bucket for a dollar or two. If you're lucky for a good movie with complication and good acting, you do not want it. If you are looking for a good soft lesbian movie, you do not even want this.
