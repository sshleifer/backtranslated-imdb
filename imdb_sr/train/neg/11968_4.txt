This is just a typical Bruce Villis, an action movie. Watch him with some popcorn and your friends. Rent it to save money. None of this is realistic. Battles are not real. Soldiers are not real. The victims are not real. And why was the character of Tom Skerritt talking to Villis from the deck of the carriage? What about that? Can not do it inside the ship? <br /> <BR> Sure, Bruce V. he gets a wound from a machete. There are a bunch of average explosions. If this film accurately represents navy seals, then do not get stuck in Africa expecting to save you! Precious attack on the village has made me the most disturbing. "Seats first to ethnic cleansing" ... while Bruce watches slaughter in the city. So what does he do? Uvuƒçe u grad na svom stomaku. Yes. How many died while they were moving? Well, well ... I guess it's necessary to count the body. And if this African was so important, why did not he find himself on a helicopter with the elderly and children? Can I say "Ghost?" Finally, the film was very dark. Not only in plot, but so much is happening at night, it was difficult to understand what is happening.
