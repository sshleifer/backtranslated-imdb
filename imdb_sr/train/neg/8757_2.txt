Allegedly a film that predicts upcoming trends in British popular music, it's wrong on so many fronts that it's ridiculous. Tommy Kuickly? The Honeicombs? The DOES film includes a song by Spencer Davis, two groups of Animals, and one on the live Beatles movie that run their live version of Twist and Shout (all 1:20). But all in all, an inconvenient view of British music around 1964. Oh, and Herman's hermit.
