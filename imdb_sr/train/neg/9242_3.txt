What a fantastic premise: a film about the Berlin Air Bridge. He should have everything. Tragedy. Uncertainty. Drugovanje. Rivals. Berlin Frauleini and strong American pilots. love and tears. What we have is a movie that does not have any of the above. Heino Ferch is trying to imitate John Vaine or so, but he is unsuccessfully bothered. He behaves so woody that he needs to break at all times. He tries to play a hard guy, instead of being a hard guy! Why would Betine Zimermann fall in love with him? Because they threw stones at the lake? Because she brings her coal bricks? SFKS are very, very well made. Too much. Hundreds of planes above Berlin look like an attack-fighting formation-squadron rather than organized air transport? as it was. It is interesting that they are in the White House, in the Kremlin and in the office of General Lucy D. Glaze all this one and the same dark and dusty set. Pay attention to the same curtains, which are deep in the windows, as a protective shield against nuclear precipitation. Why is almost every scene INSIDE dark and dusty? By the way, GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAI, it is encountered as a little time, uncertain, relaxed general, who believes in his own noble idea that he is an air bridge. He was very opposite. By combining all these individual mistakes, the result is the film with which it is built according to any passion, without uncertainty and without historical accuracy. Sadly, it started so promising ??
