A man for a man is trying to be a good movie: he has his heart in the right place, strives to be epic and has a message that everyone will surely appreciate. But there are some problems with this picture. It's hard to be good and get your message over that sometimes the viewer has to feel indifferent. So, it is only appropriate that the images that use this picture are simplified - Man for Man does not allow the viewer to decide what he thinks is right, but to stab his message in the head. Joseph Fiennes illustrates this in his role: he does his best to look worried, sincerely touched, and all the other emotions that you can express with one expression of the face that his repertoire can offer. Add that the film is long lasting and loses the speed to the end, it would easily come to the conclusion that Man for man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to defend him: it's fun, there are some humorous scenes and shov-theft Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course, it should not be compared with humanistic masterpieces such as The Elephant Man (David Linch), but you will leave the theater pleased. Trying to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks it's too obvious) and succeeds most of the time.
