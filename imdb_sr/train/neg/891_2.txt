I loved 'Paris, Je T'aime', I really expected this film and I admit that I came up with high expectations, but I was disappointed for several reasons. Although, I did not expect Re-make 'Paris' in New York to expect the same structure. What I liked in Paris was the disintegration of the neighborhood. You have a sense of every style and style they wanted to say. In New York, there is no clear separation of stories, in various places in the film, characters from different stories run between one another that confused me about who I am watching and what is happening exactly. Also, the change of direction was obvious, but confusing, because there was no flow. Another thing I liked in the 'Paris' movie was a different picture of love. Not everything was romantic. There was love between parents and their children, unrequited love, lonely, middle-aged women who love for love, etc., She explored so many layers of love among people. It seemed that 'New York' was only going to harsh sexuality. There were some casual short films (the older couple who spent the whole life together, short film Julie Christie), but in general, the 'NI' movie did not cause any emotion for me. I did not even link with a single figure like 'Paris'. I remember I watched 'Paris' and felt deep sorrow, loneliness, longing, hope, wonder ... he just had so much soul. For me, there was no soul in the movie 'NI'. Perhaps I entered this, and the 'Paris' does not appear in my brain as a comparison, this film may have provoked a more favorable answer, but as a self-titled re-take' Paris, Je T 'aime' I was very disappointed.
