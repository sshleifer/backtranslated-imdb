This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Robin Villiams fit into a part like a rhinoceros that would fit into the tent, even though his performance was poor. Kurt Russell was more convincing, but still terrible. The plot left a lot to be desired, and the rest of the acting was also terrible. The only thing this film had for her was a trailer, which dared me to spend 90 minutes of my life that could have been better spent in trying to lick my head. Make yourself favors and film this movie if you have it. If not, just be happy you do not know.
