Student seduction finds The Bi Association The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berklei Association on the other side of the table and attracts the attention of young and boring Corei Seviera. Speaking for themselves, I can truthfully say that no teacher, except one, has done anything for me hormonally while I was a student. It was Mrs. Diaz, who was a music teacher in high school. Even as a young gay child, I could see what she was doing for the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I could in any way play Elizabeth Berkley. Corei is the one who is he, and he is also used to having his way with women regardless of whether they agree or not. The fact that it comes from rich parents confirms this belief. He rejects chemistry, which Berkley teaches and keeps his GPA up, agrees to a tutor, but do not believe it anymore. So, when he tries to rape and does not get an answer, it is detrimental to his ego. When Berkeley comes out of the canal and reports crime to the police, police officers who have in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Marie Kai LeTourneau simply do not trust here. Sevier's parents have the means to get good publicity in this case for their boyfriend. Student seduction is the wrong title for the title if there ever was one of the garbage to the end. After the beating that Berkeley took for Shovgirls, this television movie was not an upward movement.
