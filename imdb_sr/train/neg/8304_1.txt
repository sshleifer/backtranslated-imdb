"Christmas Story" is one of the favorite films of all time. ACS was able to take the viewer in time and place in such a way that there are very few films. He had sweetness and good will, which is rare. So I expected (and expected) his sequel "It's In The Family". The movie was almost released a few times, only to pull it back at the last minute. When it finally came out, IRITF was (and I presume) a complete failure. Sets and cinemas were completely fine, but the director completely missed the sign. The film was nothing more than a money-making formula of lazy casting, lazy writing, and unrelated acting. Narrator, Jean Shepard, who was one of the great American humorists and narrator of the story, was forced upon us by a false reprise of the hot spirit that he used in the ACS. He was overburdened and why he did it, I will never know. Somehow he managed to become a disturbing, tense parody of himself. Writing and acting in IRITF is inauthentic and forcible. Actors may have seen ACS, but what a shade and a shade in ACS did not even exist at any one of them. The act was shamefully stunned and deprived of any cheetah's dry humor. ACS will always be a real treasure, but to call the IRITF sequel is to offend all fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
