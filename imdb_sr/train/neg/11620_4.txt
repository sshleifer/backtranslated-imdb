I gave this more than 1 because I thought there were some moral lessons in this story and it caused some thoughts and comments from my wife and me. She was beaten over the head with God, God, and Christ is our savior. The film and the story were not needed. If, like me, you are a Catholic who is recovering or a Christian avoiding this, it will make you sad. The film did a good job by demonstrating a thin line between a good citizen and that someone could become a potential hunter who focused on what might have been.
