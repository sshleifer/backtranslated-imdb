We dropped off at the place where the figure of George Clunie took out his nails. We were not mischievous - we sat in for an hour of this joke, we just knew what it looked like. To say that this film was incomprehensible, boring, pretentious, it would be exaggeration! How did people manage to pass through this confusing, slow, depressing pseudo corner of the film, let alone nominate him for an Oscar? Kluni looked so sickly as we were watching him. What did he think? Oh, and what about the titles? - did we only have an unsuccessful DVD or the original movie was done so - the sentences were left in the air? The film was heavy enough without it. I am sorry for the actors, who obviously did their best with the available material.
