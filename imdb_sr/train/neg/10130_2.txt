I have almost every Seagal movie (even this one is a low budget), and I must say, this can be the worst, not only his film, but all the films ever taken. The only highlight of this film, and the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, is that A. Seagal, and B. Seagal has some sweet action sequences, especially in the store, and also whenever it takes. he pulled out the whole army with a knife. Next time, give me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people, and do not even tire of the story, because the story not only stinks, but also the acting, the fact that the F-18 and F-14 have somehow switched to the F 16s, as well as the fact Stealth was fast as F-16. And Stealth never had to fill fuel ??? And since Afghanistan is considered hostile territory from the aviation standpoint. The last time I checked, Afghanistan does not have aviation, we (USA) control the sky. Also, this secret mission is released through the speakers throughout the crew in the room, but the admiral continues to whisper to another guy that it is a secret. Also, how did Seagal go from the bottom of the truck to the top? Please tell us why they closed it, since when pilots of aviation have large commands (unless they are Owen Wilson?) And since when are their drunkards in Arab countries, since Muslims do not drink alcohol? In addition, since when are the Arabs listening to orders from women like # 2 in charge? The highlight of the movie was definitely Seagal killing people in the store and the other 50 people who killed him with a knife, as well as a very short and completely random lesbian scene that came from nowhere.
