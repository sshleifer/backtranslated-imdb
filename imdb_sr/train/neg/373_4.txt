Blank check is a movie that I saw on TV one day and as most of the films I broadcast on TV Blank Check was not so good. First of all, no one I ever met has seen Blank Check and it includes people who grew up in the nineties. Also, Blank Check will not be remembered in 00s or simply because of the fact that it will overshadow the picar movies. I would not call Blank Check a bad movie, but it's no fun. (Or at least not to anyone over six years old) Blank Check is not a fun movie because nothing about it is original. Everything just makes you go "what did I not see before?" An empty check of the discovery and trying to cash in everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (What's unusual enough is that Macaulai Culkin is in it).
