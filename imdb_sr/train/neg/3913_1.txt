This film is a good example of how to destroy the book in 109 minutes. In addition to the names of the characters, the film has very little similarity to the book. A book full of strong Latin characters and they are mostly representatives of non-Latinos. There is no character development in the film and we have no reason to love or hate characters. And to erase the entire generation is unforgivable. Isabel Allende has written a powerful book and the book is what you need to read!
