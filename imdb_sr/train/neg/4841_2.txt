REALLI ??? I'm really amazed to see great reviews here! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's one great pathetic, grainy, cliche. I laughed loudly, and a lot, but I was at a meeting with an ex-military guy. I could not hide my second answer, BORED. Yes, I think I liked my meeting, "good old guy". It's not a compliment. I know the actor wants to work ... Good for the rest. But Ralph, come on. Ralph was a painstaking assignment. I'm voting for 2 just because Ralph looked SO STUNNING. Do I have to make a statement, Ralph, how could you? And why? I'm Going To Watch The End Of The Affair To Heal And Recover Now ... C1
