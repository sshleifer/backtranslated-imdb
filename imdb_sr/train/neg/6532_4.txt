The film begins with the fact that people on Earth discover that their missile on Mars was not lost, but only flew into space near the planet. When withdrawn, one of the crew members is ill, one is alive, and the other two are missing. What happened to them is said through a flashback from a surviving member. While on Mars, the team was apparently attacked by a whole series of very stupid monsters. Strange, although the sets were pretty good, the monsters were among the most remarkable I've ever seen on the movie. In addition, in an unusual attempt at realism, production used a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation just made the film look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of Mars and the intensity of redness practically made my eyes bleeding - it was TO bad! Despite his cheese, the film had an interesting story, as well as a good message about space travel. For lovers of this genre, it's worth a look at it. For others, you may find the whole thing pretty stupid - see for yourself and decide. While according to today's standards this is not a particularly good sci-fi movie, compared to the films that are being made at that time, it is quite good. PS - When watching a movie, pay attention to Dr Tremaine. Looks like a saliva picture, Dr. Jacket from cartoon "Jonny Cash"! Plus, he sounds like him.
