I tried to love this program; I really am. I even bought a pilot, first on VHS and later on a DVD. However, I could not get into this story because it's two main characters: "Bruce Villis" and "Maddie" (Cibill Shepherd) just fell in love with themselves, for one thing. I admit that there was some smart dialogue in the shows, which was a key part of the success of the TV program, and I appreciated a lot of the dialogue. Basically, it was almost like old humorous comedy films from the 1930s and 1940s with men and women. You have a lot of quarrels, accusations, screams and screaming. Many people obviously like this kind of bickering, but I hate it, so I never came to banding. Only Allice Beaslei as an unfortunate assistant "Agnes," was fun. Too bad she had so little time. Shepherd was nice in the eyes and I suppose that women would say the same to Villis, but too many quarrels between them finally turned me off.
