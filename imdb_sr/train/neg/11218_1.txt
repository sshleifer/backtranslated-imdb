This film is not worth the film on which it was filmed. The dialogue is flat, filled with cliche lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound for the first time as if reading a script. Tummy, clammy, film style is a cheap imitation of the visual effects of the "Ring" style. The characters do not even behave like a normal person. For example, a character who searches for his twin sister in her home passes through the front door, scares the house, and scares and cries, and she never even called her sister's name to see if she is at home. What? She would have thought she just buried her sister instead of asking her. Too much memory of her childhood. Too unnecessary flashbacks are a typical sign of an amateur director. It's actually ridiculous to watch a lot of footage of a woman driving his car down the street, on the driveway, behind this corner, over there, on the side, now from the front. Enough. You think you are watching TV advertising for Solaris! A horrible movie. 0 out of 100. I really regret anyone who spent money on this movie or watched him.
