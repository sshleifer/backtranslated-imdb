Nell Shipman tried to plot a hunting finale in 'Back to God Countri' the previous year, and she was miserable. This time she goes better, although it seems meaningless. "Something new" barely has a parcel lying outside the chase. There is a short premise that sets the hero (co-author and Shipman's boyfriend) to save the girl (played by Shipman), then this is nothing more than an exciting, incredible pursuit from there. Of course, it plays as an hour of commercials for the Makvell Sedan, but the whole movie is quite funny. She does not seem to have learned much from the last moment of D.V.'s films. Griffith or his parodies by Mac Senette and other comedians, whom she imitates. One interesting point is that Schipman writes and directs himself to film as a film story writer, who has a protagonist writer (again Shipman), although she does not work much smarter or witty, even though she is trying. Again, others were pioneers in writing jokes in titles, such as Anita Loos with 'Vild and Voolley' or Frances Marion with 'Girl's Folly' (both 1917). At least, Shipman leaves the impression that she does not understand herself or the film seriously - and me too. "Something new", despite his claim, is exhausted.
