The boy who was found as a baby in the garbage and grew up at the Academy of Martial Arts has the meaning of sinking baskets. With the help of the man who found him, he enters college and progresses to the championship as he searches for his real parents. An endlessly better comedy in action is a real mess in the whole. It seems to be a hyper basketball version of Shaolin football, but the comedy is scattered, its focus waves more than Chihuahua with ADD on a quadruple espresso. I constantly asked "What am I looking at." I watched him from the beginning to the end and still do not know what happened. It's a shame because there are some great action scenes, some fun jokes and a casual moment, but nothing, none of it ever converges, I would take a pass.
