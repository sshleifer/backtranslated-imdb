There is no way to avoid a comparison between the Cat in the hat and the Grinch who stole Christmas, so let's get that part off the road. First of all, let me tell you that I think Grinch was a low-end and undeclared movie. The cat was ... well, just terrible. Jim Carrey is thrown out because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly committed himself to outwitting, unseen characters. Mike Mayers fell on his old tricot bag. Why, why, why Mike Miers ?? Children could care less, and demographers from Austin Povers will not spy on this film. Well, what did the study think? The cat was also associated with Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why Not Iork Accent? It is not entirely in line with what Dr. Seuss ever wrote. Miers was even allowed to sneak into his Scottish hat. I wonder how many different voices the director and studio tried to change before they surrendered and said "as long as you do not say faklempt", you can keep accents. "Meyers seemed to have never found any comfort, either in costume, in make-up, or in dialogue." The jokes, what a bit of them were, were rough and unsuitable. When Miers picked up a hoe and deliver the camera: "dirty hair," it all did not, but that would not help. The same people who created "Vhoville", obviously had the hand in creating a city and houses in the 'cat' Sets and props were very attractive, giving the viewer so much distraction from bad writing, direction and Miers. Dakota Fanning was the only actor who was aware and that he is in a movie based on the Dr. Seuss class, and has remained a faithful genre. Call SPCA This cat should be sterilized and never be reproduced anymore. , without continuation.
