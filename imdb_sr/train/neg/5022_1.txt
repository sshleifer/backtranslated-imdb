Oh, God, this movie was bad for a variety of reasons. I expected to see a very low rating for this film and I was a little surprised by the over-all score. Sorry, but to rate it as high as many, it's a joke! Once you pass a film / black-and-white film, which was a good idea, the movie is pulled, even in just 66 minutes. The loan sequence at the beginning was so boring! In the van, the guys are hitting the tire and changing the wheel, vow, that was necessary in the story! How did the guys get pushed, and actually managed to hurt Campbell? It looks like they do not try to keep him running ... sigh .. I'm just happy to get this for free with the special edition Evil Dead !!
