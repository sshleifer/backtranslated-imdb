"A Gui Thing" is trying to catch the feeling "There Is Something about Mary" or "Meet Parents", but it appears more like being changed from a reservoir that refuses these two films. Fortunately, I rented it for 5 days because I could not sit and watch for more than 20 minutes. The space is decent and I liked scenes where other guys automatically cover Pavlov's wrong steps (the controller in Save-March was excellent), but scripting is absolutely terrible. Dialogue falls most of the time and just when you think things will finally come to an end, some unnecessary views are stuck without a good reason. In addition, how many VCs need a movie? Do not misunderstand me, humorous humor is great when it's smartly done like in other films that I mentioned, but this movie simply misses. Too bad I love Julia Stiles (Ten things I hate about you was great), but even that could not help me through this horrible movie. Save your dollars and rent once again "Something About Mari".
