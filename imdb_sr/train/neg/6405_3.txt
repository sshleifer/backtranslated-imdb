There is no real conspiracy for this, just a series of short sketches that play some VERY old jokes. At first I laughed once or twice, much to my sorrow. But even in just 73 minutes, this movie welcomes you a long time ago and becomes stagnant and boring (with some nudity I sit there and there to keep you awake). It's still as bad as this movie (and it's pretty buggy), it's a comedy compared to pretty much Aaron Seltzer & Jason Friedberg (Date movie, Epic movie, Meet the Spartans). sad way. Eie Candi: 11 pairs of suckers, 3 shrubs, 3 doubles My Class: D Code Red DVD Accessories: Original trailer for this movie; and trailers for "Beiond the Door", "Dead Pit", "Farmer", "Obsessed", "Pover Plai", "Sole Survivor", and "Vacki Taki"
