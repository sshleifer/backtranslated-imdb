May is a woman of no interest. She just dreams of her life and is wondering why she does not feel fulfilled. This could be an interesting topic. It should be a good story, a nice setting and a good dialogue. None of these. This film is completely boring. There are only lengths and no peaks. The only highlight is Shahrukh Khan. But even though I'm his big fan, I could not stand this movie. Even he can not make that movie. The movie is not as bad as "king's uncle", and if you are an Art-artist or you like it, you may like it. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not catchy. My recommendation: Do not look.
