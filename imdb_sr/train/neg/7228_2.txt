Good: Efficient color scheme. Good costumes. Top production. Detailed CGI buildings and vehicles. Bad: The terrible mix of actors with all CGI actors mixes the fifth element with Final Fantasy. CGI actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago. Flaved logic. There was a huge pyramid and nobody explored it, nobody even asked her? And there is no explanation as to why the god of Horus was even thrown out, nor was there any reason why he would have to do something as trivial as Jill's fertilization? Ugli: Avful script. There are so many unnecessary backgrounds with too many ideas that are not fully realized. The dialogue was in some places almost ridiculous. Accidental signs and events that are not needed. Stupid signs. Jill should be this mystery, but apparently it was just a mystery to the writer. There is nothing for her. She is uninteresting and boring to watch. It has no substance, no texture. Her character has no redeeming quality. In fact, there is not one character in the entire movie for any purpose, any goal (except for the obvious Horus), any motivation. They are weak and ill-conceived. No role - the key to writing the screen. Horus will not become immortal, but, a big problem, he is a bad guy. It can not be deciphered whether Horus or Jill is the main character. This is a problem: the dedication of half the film to each character means that the writer never fully explores one character, never leads to realization. They are cut out of cartons that walk around and talk and mostly do nothing but explore fine pieces. For the first time, the director paced. Slow, slow, slow. I'm still watching a movie while I write this. I can not pay attention because it's boring. Everything is straight. Even action is not interesting because it is short-lived and sometimes unnecessary. Overall: <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not worth watching. Threadbare story, sub-character development, CGI corn does not save beautifully set production.
