This weekend I just passed by watching "28 Veeks Later" which was very good. After that, I watched this movie. I told you this is one of the boring so-called horrors you've ever been able to watch. The scenes were unrealistic, there were no scenarios or complications. The alien creature was unreal. Fighting scenes are mild compared to the battle in the school yard. And to make it worse, a guy named Cody had an uncontrolled loose dirty tongue that draws attention from the main movie. You'd rather go and watch 28 weeks later. Cheers, Mesaka C.
