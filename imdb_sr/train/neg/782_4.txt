Apart from the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious jerk, his performance is terrible. Nothing about Lopez was funny. I watched his standing position and never mentioned a laugh. His thing appears to be vindictive, and the hostility towards the whites comes from every single vapor of his body. > <br /> I laughed at whites to the jokes of many comedians and they loved many of them. This guy has a dissatisfaction that will not end. I feel bad for Latinoamericans who only have this show for themselves. The displayed plots are always cutter cookies with Hispanic accent. Conserved laughter on the dumbest comments and scenes. Perhaps the reason why this show is always included in 2 in the offer.
