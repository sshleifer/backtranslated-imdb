When I first saw the cover of this movie (the giant beetle that drives several nurses) and the name "Blue Monkey," I knew that I was not for some great Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw Steve Railsbacka in this movie with a horn ball, which always does a good job in any role ... FKS are pretty rough, not too complicated, and I'm still not sure why this film is Blue Monkeys, because there is nothing in this film with a monkey. But people, what did you expect? It's not as bad as it seems .... If you enjoy old black and white 50s-old movies, this is basically an updated version, without updating special FKSs.
