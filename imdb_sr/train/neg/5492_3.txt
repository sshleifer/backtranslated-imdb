The people in Disney have a lot to explain. First and foremost, why did anyone think this material with a smaller sitcom will ever make even half decent movies. In the television game of the '60s, the unique idea of ​​the Martians among us has not yet received a sophisticated treatment of Ks-Files. Strange visions of small green men have long been scattered from people of similar ET, CLIMATE MEETINGS and PAGES 1-3. Bikbike as Tim and Rai Valston as an alien visitor. The silence that the Martians had had an antenna then seemed dumb. Now it seems positively idiotic. However, Uncle Martin Christopher Loyd sports metal accessories. At an early stage, the antenna on the sign of the TV station on which Tim works should make us think of the "Martian"! When was the last time you saw a TV with a bunny ears, eh? Disney does not believe in strange relationships and brings in this movie with special effects for the youth that include a space suit named Zoot! Yes, you have read it well - says Uncle Martin's silver space suit. It should be a real harsh cut! Again. I have stretching socks that are smarter than Zoot. Whenever the action is lagging behind (and it's constantly lagging behind), computer graphics are put into play to revive things. The team is playing here kindly Jeff Daniels, who can not (or will) do anything to save this mess. Consciousness Christine Ebersole brings comical zeal to her role as a neighbor. Even Rai Valston is sorely involved in the proceedings - all without success. This alien visitor is dead on arrival. Permanent testimony about comedies that go over the screen, it seems to me that I just hope that there will be no talk of harem equipment in the film and the DREAM OF JEANNIE. I pray that Samantha's cat in BEVITCHED does not have a line. I live in fear that I love Lucie - the film will proudly present CG Conga Drum called Bongo. Paging Michael Eisner! Mickey Mouse - Take me to your leader.
