If at least the cruelty and deadly purpose was the purpose of the story to justify their inclusion, but the scenario was just incomprehensible and just stupid. It was not anywhere, the story had no readable continuity. It was just a bunch of drawn silly scenes for snooping and a really stupid ending that was put on as if to say .. "end * bip * you are my haters and my few defenders who watched my garbage." > I do not understand, a masked killer who never took off a mask in prison, a prison scene of rape that should have been guards who rape a ugly deformed serial killer and killed him and nothing else? without explanation, without the punishment, a really weak chief officer who was losing an actor like Pare, who did not try to dismiss the guy who killed his cops, tortured the baby, wife and dog and sent them to watch you on the video. The policemen who for some unknown reason leave themselves alone in the dark (individually) in his house at the farm at night as a bunch of poorly written teenage characters who will be killed as a bunch of idiots, and no other policeman can hear him dying in the dark one by one and only wander around for no reason until each one kills each other. A bunch of terrible animal sniffing scenes at first without any reason or explanation, did he remember, whether he watched the masturbate, whether it was a comedy for him ... what was that? No, Boll just thought I was putting him in the harassment of animal lovers .. anyway. Then Pare believes in the word of psycho-paths to let the family go if he kills ... a more handsome, stupid cop you never saw in the movie. I do not know why I try not to hate his work. I'm trying to find some reason to explain horror artists, but this ... pure shit. What more do you do? I hope you understand this because I know many more deserving people who can not dream to get a budget that you get over and over to film your movies. If you want to see Boll at best, check out "Postal" that it's okay.
