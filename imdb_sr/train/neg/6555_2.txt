That's how I decided on a night to watch Tales from Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson. Or Power, Passion, Murder what is called in the Netherlands. When I bought a movie, I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was acting in her, and I thought he had to say something about quality. Unfortunately, it's not. 1) The action of the movie is confusing. During the film, two stories are simultaneously performed. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the whole film, I waited for the moment when these two stories would merged to make the plot a clear one. But it's still not. 2) The title of the movie says that the movie will be about Natica Jackson. Well, sometimes. As if the film covers two different stories, and the part about Natica Jackson is the shortest. So the second title for this movie would not be the wrong choice. To conclude my story, I really recommend that you leave the movie where it belongs, on the shelf in a store at a place that nobody can do it. By doing this, you will not lose 90 minutes of your life, like myself.
