This film is funny and painful at the same time. "Cinemagic" almost gave me an attack. Despite what they say, "Cinemagic" is not an innovative technical process. It was "developed" as a result of the accident and they used it because it concealed the fact that their "monsters" were so stupid. I also do not think it's a coincidence that the writer is Sid "Pink". This film is good for laughter, if you are really looking for a movie made for 9 days at $ 200,000. It's fun; at least I can say it. The bat / rat / spider is the highlight.
