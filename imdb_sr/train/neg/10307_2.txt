The aspect of "mathematics" is just a trick to try to set up this TV show next to one million other police shows. The only aspect of this discovery is Rob Morrow, though his career had to (unintentionally) fall after Northern Exposure if he applied for this coupling. The break from the aspect of mathematics in the show is contained in one episode played by Lou Diamond Phillips (which only confirms that this show is the last hideaway of the damned). To catch a fugitive, "mathematician" uses some theory of "bubbles". So, he gives this a long explanation that if we saw the suspect at A, B and C, then we can use the "balloon theory" to calculate where he might be. He does it all on the board, or maybe with a stick in the ground (I can not remember). In any case, when you look at the finished product, he took three places and chose the point. in the middle and said: "Okay, mathematically, here's where we'll most likely find a fugitive." At that moment, another figure points to "Oh, that point is also the cabin in which the man lived." Is it a math? It does not even connect-f ** k ** g-points !!! This show reminds me of the mathematics I worked with in banking and who had a mathematical analysis that he could do to "support" the points that everyone else had already agreed through a less complex analysis or basic common sense. > It just shows - When you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can not wait until they hit the NUMB3RS team on OSAM ... They use the calculus, they call the air attack in the middle of the mountain, hit Osama, and even scratch the five children who use them as a human shield ... because hey ... all about the numbers. Totally funny TV show.
