The film itself is so pathetic. She portrayed deaf people as cynical in listening to people. True, some deaf people are cautious when it comes to getting to know people, but they are not necessarily angry as Marlee Matlin's character throughout the story. The deaf people do not go to the bar and dance the way Matlin did. All in all, the film itself is more boring than pathetic. It's so boring that I would like to believe that it is a film that cured insomnia. If I have a problem with sleep, I can simply go to the Children of God and watch. That'll make me sleep. Keep in mind, this is the deaf man who talks.
