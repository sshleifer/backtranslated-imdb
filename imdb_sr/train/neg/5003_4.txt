I'm ashamed to write this review. I say this because those who read it know that I have been through the whole thing and that it's embarrassing to admit even strangers. But I had to warn those who read comments on the IMDb before watching a movie not to watch this. That's the least I can. This is a bad movie! Trust me. The plot is stupid. The acting is amateur. Directing, working on cameras, sets, costumes, etc. Let go, let's go.
