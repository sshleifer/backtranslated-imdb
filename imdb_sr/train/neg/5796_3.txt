I saw this feature as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York City and I was horrified by the graphic, sado-masochistic, child pornography I testified. The story is hidden under many too many graphic scenes - and not one is not the least erotic - the disease is more of a feeling. The director seemed to go into shock, not to explore the different levels of why these characters are. See if you can stack it - I still have flashbacks.
