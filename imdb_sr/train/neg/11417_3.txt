A young group in "St. Elmo's Fire" who just graduated from college barely managed to pass through high school for at least four years at any prestigious university. Basically, these children are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, but co-writer and director Joel Schumacher seems to be holding them as a stone for generations. With an outdated passage "up and down", a background score that sounds very similar to the "Resuscitation Conditions", and the writing that gives the self-confidence of this circle above us, "Fire" is an insignificant flame, one that becomes even shameful as the years pass. * 1/2 of ****
