Somebody here compared this film in some way with High Noon. It's really stretching! I am a great fan of the Sinatra, including some of his acting roles, but maybe the only person who could play this role was Don Knotts. First, as someone pointed out, Sinatra simply does not have a building for a Western bad guy. He is too "insignificant" at this point in his life. Maybe he was at the same height as Audi Murphy, but Murphy had a pretty solid build. Sinatra encounters a big little child who should not be taken seriously. The story is non-inspiring and really unbelievable. I do not want to spoil it, but I think that the end and the way citizens react in this story makes no sense. Another thing, these people constantly allow themselves to be completely guided by a "bad guy". This is just a small city, so I do not understand the attraction or understand why people would be allowed to dominate in this way. In the story there is a "love interest" and if I tracked him properly, she was upset when the main character refused to recognize who he was, so that another bad guy did not kill him. Now there is true love for you. 'Fight for yourself! Tell him your name so he will kill you! LOL. Stop, you're killing me. Unfortunately, the basic premise of the movie is not good enough and no matter how they tried this story, it did not have a logical track to track except for the garbage basket. . Want to know why it's not on the video and it's never shown on TV? Critics obviously launched it in 1956 and were right - this film is pretty bad. I would almost bet that Sinatra paid someone to extend six things as much as possible. Want to see the good west in which city opposes the bad guy? Try Tension at Table Rock, or At Gunpoint - two really, really good western ones with that theme. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko. Frank, you were the greatest singer ever - but you did not belong to this movie.
