Although I completely disagree with one reviewer who described Charlee Chase as infertile, in this film he certainly is. It's a pity, because I doubt that the other reviewer only saw a couple of Charlei Chase dudes and assumed the guy was not ridiculous. Movies like MIGHTI LIKE A MOOSE and VHITE PRICE GOOFI? are very good Chase movies, so it could be really funny with good stuff. Unfortunately, he did not give absolutely nothing in this film. Even the inclusion of a good Oliver Hardy as a film is no help, because the basic assumption (the boy wants to marry a girl, but the girl's father thinks the boy is a wolf) and the gags are so bad. It's a pity, because I really wanted to love this movie, but I could not. By the way, for those who have been accustomed to Charleys since the mid-twenties, you will be quite surprised that Chase does not play glasses or mustaches - and looks very little as you would expect.
