Although I was hoping for this film, especially because I enjoy the acting of Jason Segel (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared), I have to say that it was one of the worst movies I've seen lately (Loser and Dr T and women are also on that list). Yes, there were a few laughs at loud moments, although the movie could have been much better. The premise was not a scapegoat who cheated on his way through college and met his sword when someone discovered them with a suggestion for them. The problem is that all the characters were so unimaginable that I did not care about them. The blackmailer (played by talented Jason Schwarzman) was such a psychopath that it was not so funny to watch him - he was not disturbed in a particularly funny or charming way, he was just a crazy loser, which was actually pretty dangerous and not fun to watch. It was difficult to track the film's editing - it kept the cutting between fantasy and reality, and it was often unclear who it was. Only two or three gang gangs were really shown, only you had to rely on the belief that they were really cheats - showing that their schemes would be made for a better movie. The so-called love story was absurd and incredible, in fact it was stupid and poorly written and directed. I could talk about the shortcomings of the film, but understand the idea. It's not worth the $ 4 rent or the gas you need to ride to and from the movie store!
