This is a story about a Jewish dysfunctional family. Parents divorced and Mom stayed east in the house. Father, Murrai Abromovitz, starts with his children in California, and moves around Beverly Hills, so that his children can get the best possible education. He lives with a group. The film deals with various adventures of the family with complicated drugs in close neighborhood. Jessica Valter costars as a woman who wants Murray to go to her because she wants a companion. Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno come to an end. They play Murray's brother and snake; they are also the parents of Tomei. In front of the children, Reiner let him remind Murrai that he paid all the bills all the time. ride around Beverly Hills in his car. I suppose the film promotes independence and some good old self esteem.
