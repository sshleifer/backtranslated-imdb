I can not believe they managed to spend $ 17 million on this movie. Spectacularly bad acting, unusual scripts and effects that you could do on your average PC, incredible perfume contours ... a reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess a big deal in the UN? What? And not only that, but the message of this movie is so unbearable that you feel as if they tried to shove you over the head of a crucifix in full size. Everything that this film does will preach the chorus and make everyone laugh at such funny wasting money. If the creators of this film really wanted to influence Christianity and show what it means to truly believe, they would use that money to help people who are really in need. Now, perhaps, some people have convinced them to really listen to them.
