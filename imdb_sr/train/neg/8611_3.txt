When Rodney Dangerfield is in the game, he's ridiculous. In Mi 5 Vives, he is not in the game. The timing of one line is off, but they are the best thing for a movie. Five women who play women do not make one whole actress among them. The plot is very weak. Even the premise is pretty weak; There are a few jokes about having more women, but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie. Most of the film could be played the same way, even if Rodney's character had only one woman, so the premise is more like an old man's fantasy than as a key part of the comedy. Another fantasy of the old man: we should accept that Rodney's figure is an athlete skier. actors must simply be desperate to work. Strange nodding of political correctness later in the movie does not actually do anything for the movie. For those who love their films politically correct, non-PC humor is still there, and apparently apologies for him still do not understand the point. For those who hate watching a movie cave on political correctness, PC add-ons are just boring digressions. There are some funny jokes, and the scenes of the bedroom would make a shocking TV 40 years ago, but that's all. Maybe they are men in kidding. DVD contains interviews in which members of the acting team find the depth and importance in this film and in their roles. I wondered if they were serious or joking. They seem to be serious, but I kept thinking, "They must be joking!" There is also an unusual renunciation that suggests that, since the film never names the Mormons or the Church of the Saints in the past few days, this is somehow not about them. It does not matter what the film contains a polygamous religion in Utah and mentions Brigham Young. In short, We 5 Vives was disappointing. I was hoping Rodney was on the scroll, but the best I could say for a movie is that Rodney looked pretty good for the guy who was pushing 80 at the time. \ T
