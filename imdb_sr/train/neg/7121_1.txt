When you have a whirlwind skull, an empty villa, a schizophrenic wife, a joker and a gardener, insert the minister and his wife - what do you have? AIP Response to Insomnia. "Screaming skull" gets points of bravery, offering free crates for anyone who dies of fear of watching a movie. A fairly safe bet, when you're silent in people who think they are in production "Suspense for Dummies". But Peggy Webber was candy anyway. She had a few good moments acting there and there (especially when she was trying to communicate with the gardener) and no one else filled the nightgown like her. But this frightened face is terrible in itself. On the whole, however, there is a bit of uncertainty and everything is telegraphed as a blow thrown by the mimicry. You can not be afraid of this movie, it's impossible. It has its moments, but it's not enough. However, thanks to a certain Mike Nelson and his two robotic friends, there are a few moments of pure joy, especially in the copy they own ("The movie jumped, and it was really scary!"). One star for "The Screaming Skull", eight and a half for the MST3K version. Bored "screaming" ....
