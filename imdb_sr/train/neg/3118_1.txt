I felt that the film was a ... very disappointing no complication .. I waited for something to happen and nothing was dry as a bone .. helpless money. One of Robinson Villiams's worst movies .. if you do not believe me wait a few months to be on DVD, because it looks like a sample for movies that do not work well in theaters are like renting a year ago is over ... This is One you do not want to see or say why I spent my money on it! In addition to being such a new movie, there were only 8 people watching it ... This was on Friday night at 9:50. I also felt it needed some more excitement or something that would keep us awake. When the characters spoke in the movie, the voices were also very low that you could not hear what they were saying.
