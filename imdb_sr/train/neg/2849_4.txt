A comparison between this film and the 'Last Detail' has been made by some, but 'Chasers' is more than the end of the Interstate Highway in West Texas. And like a landscape in the desert, there is not much to be distinguished, even the fact that the two inmates carry the prisoner this time. No one in the acting department comes too well; This is not surprising with this ludicrous script. Dennis Hopper, the director, will not give much space to this, if he ever writes memoirs, I think.
