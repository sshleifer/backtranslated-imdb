But what's worth watching is the scene in which OJ's angrily grabbed a colleague on the throat as if killing them while the jukebox was playing a song with the lyrics "I have evidence of you!" (I want to hear the rest of the verses - attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren, but I could not find it on iTunes). Talk about seeing you into the future ... It's too funny for words. The rest of the movie is forgotten. Scenes and songs are more interesting than scripts. Likewise, the sequel. Which leads to the question why they would have done a sequel at all. As far as I understand, sales abroad are powered by many B movies. She does not say much about the world of watching habits.
