It does not take long to see why the code name: Diamond Head did not have a network layout. Television film does not exceed credits before it is obvious how bad it will be. Maybe I missed something because the plot did not make much sense. Based on what I pulled out of a mess, a terrorist or thief or something called "The Tree" (Ian McShane) is going to Hawaii to steal something with a secret weapon. The deepest secret agent in the world, Johnny Paul (Roi Thinnes), wants to stop him. Maybe it was more, but believe me? It does not matter anyway. Action movies should have an action. Annoyed moments need to be uncertain. And dramatic moments should have a drama. There is none of it in the code name: Diamond Head. I saw others using the word "turgid" to describe this for TV snoozer? and it's better than any description of the words I can think of. No character is at all exciting or worth worrying. A Roi Thinnes makes the worst possible trace. His charisma is just a little north of the snails. Ian McShane is simply the best thing for a movie, but unfortunately for everyone else involved, it does not seem to be a regular member. If McShane was dropped in a series, then you may have had something. I quickly discover that these Gavd's horrible 70s made for TV films make up the great Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes. And that goes double if Kuinn Martin is involved. Very funny stuff from Mike and Bots. So, although I can give the movie 3/10, I evaluate Episode # 608 and 4/5 on my MST3K scale.
