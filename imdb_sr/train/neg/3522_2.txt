If you like the standard Sli flicks that include superb action, incredible shutdowns (incredible are not intended to be here) and retarded dialogue; I'll love you this bunch of mountain goat bales. I had great hopes about the trailer. I thought Stallone would be forced to give up smarter people in his "past days" and to make an action film that would put the credible hero in a credible situation in which the story, the setting and (convincing) action will prevail. I am curious about the action that is at least close enough to the reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that will come from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects made at least one scene ridiculous funny. Judge Dredd is better just because you know that you go to the theater to see the comic strip that was filmed in the movie. Character, environment and everything else are out of comparison with anything that could be encountered. On the other hand, Cliffhanger turns a hiking guide to Rambo before you can say "and, Adrian!"
