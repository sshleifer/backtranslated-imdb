I do not usually say that the movie is not worth watching, but it is certainly a mitigating circumstance. The only truly positive effect of this film is Cornelia Sharpe, which looks pretty attractive, and the fact that this film is really short. No character is interesting at all and there is no reason to worry about anyone. I'm not sure why Sean Connery agreed to this film, but he was definitely supposed to upload this film. The only reason I saw that I was watching this movie was if you died -Hard Sean Conneri fan and just wanted to see everything he did. Save this for the last time. Well, if by some miracle you see this despite my review (or some other review on this site), I hope you enjoy more than me. Thank you for reading.
