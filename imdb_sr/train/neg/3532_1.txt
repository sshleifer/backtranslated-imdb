It looks as if you took the general themes of The Usual Suspects and Fightclub, stripped them of all style and class and blended them together with a much pretentious new wave "I'm an intellectual, so my movie must be hard to sense" a garbage dump film mixed in a few additional styles for a good measure, cut off from the end, there's the Revolver. Yes, I have a little thinking about it after watching, and that it was kind to make sense, but it does not prevent it from being trash. Money Laundering. Waste of time. It's up there as the worst movie I've ever seen, not even a bad novelty in the movie to make it a little rewarding.
