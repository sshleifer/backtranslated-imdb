This movie is horrible. In the end, you will realize that from your life, you have stolen a few hours that you can not return. The final ending is very fictitious. The development of the character leading to this ending is not in line with their final actions at the end. Ninety minutes of preparation - assuming that the character of Rob Love will die on Christmas Eve - is explained in literally ninety seconds from "No, we just deceived you." Then the Rob Love character is not even upset about it! "I will forgive you if you can forgive me," he is upset as he does. If someone took a week to convince me that I would die, then he said, "No, I'm sorry, I just deceived you." I do not feel bad because I gave the spoiler because I could save some of you there from watching. Please rescue yourself and do not watch this movie.
