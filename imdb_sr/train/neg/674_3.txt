I'm known to fall asleep during the movies, but this is usually due to a combination of things, including, really tired, which is warm and comfortable on the settee and what I have been eating. However, on this occasion I fell asleep because the film was a garbage. The development of the plot was constant. It's always slow and boring. Things seemed to happen, but without explanation what caused them or why. I admit, maybe I missed a part of the movie, but I watched most of it and everything just seemed to happen on its own without any worry about anything else. I can not recommend this movie at all.
