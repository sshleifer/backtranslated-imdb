I've seen fantastic stories already, but the rooms of this are so incredible that they approach the absurdity. A rich and young man is transplanted with hearts the day after his marriage, and in a way is the witness of his own surgery and the conspiracy of his surgeons to kill him. Even if there is a medical explanation for such a phenomenon, what is going on is a mixture of dialogue between ... say ... soul? ... maybe the real life in which the consecrated mother will do everything to save her life to her son. There is no tension of tension or excitement, only a combination of a bad and simplified complication with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life. It does not mean that the film lacks quality - in fact, for the first time, director Jobi Harold does a decent job in directing a good team of actors who includes Haiden Christensen in his first major role after stripping Anacin Skivalker's costume, the incredible Jessica Albu and super-donated Len Olin. Everyone would earn a better story.
