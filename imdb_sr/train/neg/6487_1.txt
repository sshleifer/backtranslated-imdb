Well then, thank you so much DISNEY for DESTRUCTION of the beautiful memories I used to have my former favorite movie. I was about 5 years old when the original movie came out, and that was one of the first films I remembered. So, now that I am 16, and when I am sufficiently masochistic, I decided to rent this film. So I managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this sad pronunciation for the film. This film takes everything that has been done by the original precious and destroys it, until the last detail. In this film, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughters, Melody, and leave to show everyone in the ocean ... BROADWAY STILE! After completing the music number, in a few minutes, the witch of Morgan appears and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does not give up the troubled man. So he gave up without a fight. Erik stands there gagging, though Ariel realizes how to use a sword and saves Melody. Morgan escaped, so Ariel and Eric decided that Melody should never go near the sea until Morgan was caught. Well ... uh, nothing is happening. Eric is a total cunt. Never fails. Ariel does something. Melody manages to screw up things. Plus, animation is a new low point for Disney. Computer graphics clash with the background. One chance for character development is lost. Songs bite. Look, do not waste your time. I'm pretty sure that small children will also get bored out of the skull, because nothing that is even exciting never happens. They do not want to sing songs. If you manage to take a copy of this, throw it in the ocean and hope that no one will ever find it. Ever.
