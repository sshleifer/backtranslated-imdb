Now, I will not deny that when I bought this on an eBai, I had great expectations. It was incredible work without printing from the comedy masters I like so much. However, I will soon be disappointed. I apologize to those who enjoyed it, but I just found that Compleat Al is very difficult to watch. Of course, I got a few smiles, but most funny came from music videos (which I have on DVD), and the rest was basically filled. It could be said that it was not Al's biggest video-achievement (this honor goes to UHF). Frankly, I doubt that this will ever lead to a DVD, so if you are an ultra-hardcore fan and you just have to have everything, buy a tape on eBa. Just do not pay too much for it.
