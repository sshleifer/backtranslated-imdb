this movie is really trying. if you want to make a horror movie, at least you give him a reason to believe in connecting the viewer. Wait and wait through a movie that expects some great explanation, but no. Instead, he tries to be too smart and does not reveal anything. What was the purpose of the film? where is he going? and more importantly, what the hell happened. . . Why were they there and how are they linked? just another weak sci-fi horror. I love false IMDb reviews saying it's great that related press releases hit the movie (or that people have a low horizon). It's not worth your 2 hours. I do not say that the movie is better than fragile, but at least it gave you meaning and why things happened and have the ultimate result. This does not happen and it's just a waffle with a ton of coating to make everyone feel scary. this film is as low as when a stranger calls. God who was also lame. Great advice, if you make a horror, make it convincing with the explanation and explain to the viewer what's going on, so they have a hook in your story. because if there is no reasoning or conviction then there is no firm hold on anything and this can not be daunting. There is no disrespect for actors or crew because they did a good job. it's just bad writing.
