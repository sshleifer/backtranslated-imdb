This video was initially banned in the UK, and was allowed in November last year without any cuts. In it is the Plaiboi Plaima of the Month October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The aperture is cut back and forth between the images of Buchfellner and the foggy jungle. I'm not sure what the purpose was. It would be much better to focus on the bath. Laura (Buchfellner) was kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beiond, Zombie) was sent to find her ransom. Of course, one of the hijackers (Antonio de Cabo) succeeds productively to pass the time, while others (Verner Pochath) flourish continuously. Will Peter save before they can have a meal? Oh, yeah, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think the video was nasty? Muriel Montosse was found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Maians - Angel of Death) on a hijacking boat. Montosse is very comfortably disassembled. Peter leaves them and goes alone to find Laura, who has been captured so far. They go through the time of sex, and they do not see that danger is approaching. Guts, anybody? Great fight between Peter and the devil of the devil (Burt Altman). Blood, head off, intestines, full of frontal, some big cramps from the Cannibal priest (Aline Mess), and the lines, tearing her heart, "which is funny if you look at the movie.
