A slow, boring and one-dimensional movie! Good casting with clich√©ped dialogue, boring story and soulless direction from the g. Marshal! A conventional and predictable story of the most famous form of prostitution from the Asian continent, there is no heart, new insight and depth. The main character looks inappropriate because of his small contact lens. The Lexicon of the Geisha sounds forced and somewhat sophisticated due to their limited exposure in education. The story continues and continues for hours trying to convince you that this little, boring, straight Asian girl is the ultimate geisha, they actually say in the movie "She is destined to become a legend" I say stubbornly! The film is just boring, it's great to watch, there are very few interesting moments to find if you go out for cigars. Basically, if you do not trust the messenger, you will not believe the message, and this girl has not filled her shoes! Borin, boring, skip!
