In Cold Blood, he was one of several films from the 60's that created a new vision of violence in the Hollywood film industry. Capote coined the phrase "novel about fiction" to describe the book on which this film is based, and the spirit of this form was transferred to a film script, written by a co-author. Despite the fact that we entered the era of color films, Richard Brooks chose to present this film in black and white to emphasize both the sharpness of the landscape and the gloominess of the story. This is the first problem with a TV remake - the color changes the tone of the story. In addition, the movie recording limit for television reduces the ability to capture and focus shots. As a result, we lose the dramatic conflict that the other part of the original film (police talks, trial, imprisonment and execution) seems claustrophobic. On a small screen, it's just another version of the spin-off of law and order. The Hollywood quest for scripts is continually coming back to films that were successful in another age. This is usually a mistake, and this is no exception. All actors are competent. The script is OK. The director does not mind. Only the film does not work like the original precision instrument. This does not bring the viewer into ambivalence with Smith and Hickock, which the original film causes. At the end of the TV version, there is a feeling: "Ho hum, who cares?" First look at the original, on the bigger screen, then watch the TV version simply to understand why the first was such an important film in 1967. It would not be harmful if you went to the line and read about Capote and the original book. It will help you to understand the extraordinary efforts it has invested in the material, as well as some controversies over books and movies. In fact, I only gave this because I kept the bottom 3 rankings for real bombs - those that angered you because you were drawn into consumption
