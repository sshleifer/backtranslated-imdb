You know that the movie is bad when the highlight is that you can see a short moment of "danger!". The hardest thing is that white people can not jump to have a huge potential. For several years I've lived in the area shown in this film; racial tensions were high, and basketball meant everything to everyone. A film about members of this "basketball culture" could have been very interesting, but the central acting and poor scenario in white people can not leave something that you want to want. The series of events in the movie is cyclical. First, Billy either wins or loses money playing basketball. Then he returns home and lounges around with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. Most stories relate to the climax of some sort, but the "peak" I've seen was just another sequence in this repetition (this case is "Billy either wins or loses money playing basketball"). In order for a complication to develop, a dilemma must be solved; and this dilemma must be interesting if the film will be interesting too. Obviously, writers of the Wit Men Can't Jump have forgotten this rule, because the plot can be summarized as "Bills need to pay bills." I appreciated changing rhythms from other sports films, but - I'm sorry - this was simply horrible. I could have less to worry if Billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment. In spite of all this, White people can not jump is a successful movie. It seems that some tough sport lovers will reject the horrible writing for several basketball scenes in them. The other, I'm sure, has attracted great names that played leading roles. It leaves me wondering if the actor has been replaced entirely with unknown actors, and the basketball theme has been replaced by lacrosse, will anyone watch this film? I really do not think so. I will give this film two stars of ten; An additional star is for "Jeopardi!" a scene that kept me awake for a few minutes. Thank you, Trebek.
