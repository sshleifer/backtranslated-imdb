This film has little to recommend, although there is little to do with breath, cinema and the direction of wild animals, it is difficult to outline its weak points in the company of such criticisms. These things, however, constitute a disappointing lack of satisfactory plots and its execution. I watched this with my kids and none of us was too impressed at the end. Yes, the pictures were great, wide areas in the forest and the mountains magnificent, but what happened in the foreground? A rather boring story of the stupidity of a devious girl who slowly teaches a very basic lesson about friendship with wildlife - and is easily withdrawn in view of the trace of such things. This is certainly not a new story, in fact there is nothing that could be called a novel about the way it was said, and we all saw it before, and indeed, much clearer than Antoine de Saint-Eupperi. The only thing that really can be heard from this movie is the feeling of working with these beautiful lenses and forest lighting; there is a waste of time.
