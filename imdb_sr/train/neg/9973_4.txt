"Problem Child" is one of the most beautiful films ever recorded. It's not the worst (though some people do not agree with me about it), but it's not the best. It is a devilish 7-year-old boy who destroys a comical desolation on a couple without children (John Ritter, Ami Iasbeck) who stupidly adopts it. This movie is too stupid and incredible, because I do not buy for a second so that the child can behave equally irrational as the boy does in this movie. It's asinine and absurd, even though I laughed many times (I really do not know why). But I can not recommend this movie. I know I'm too kind to him. If there is one positive thing about a "problematic child", that's better than a continuation that was horrible. ** (out of four)
