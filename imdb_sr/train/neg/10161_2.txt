I really did not expect much from this film when I saw how people from Parkersburg VV, whatever it was, live in it. This city is boring, as is this film. There were several decent scenes in the film, but I was distracted by all the shabby orientations they made to show. This movie may have been good if there was a real acting in it, but it was not. Unless you are from Parkersburg, you are interested in seeing what you see on a daily basis, and then stay away from this movie. The dialogue will slow you down, the act will bother you, and Steven Soderberg should lose credibility after this shit. It's a predictable film without surprise. What you see is what you get and it's a 73-minute tour of Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a narrator.
