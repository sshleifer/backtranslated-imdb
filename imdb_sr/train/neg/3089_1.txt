This film is so bad, comical. In fact, Misteri Science Theater 3000, a television show where three characters watch and parody bad films, used this film to be washed. I suggest you watch it (maybe on iouTube) instead of watching this movie. Please do not see Hobbobline if you are not ready to stand in the first scene. Actually, you do not see this movie, period. Please. At least not seriously. His jokes are not ridiculous (at least), and you will have much more fun parodying or watching a parody on it, then watching a movie. Book yourself. Read a book. Wash it. It's all funny to watch Hobbobline.
