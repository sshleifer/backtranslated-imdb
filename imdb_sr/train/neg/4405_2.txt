All I can say is that before watching a movie I had no indication of who Annemarie Schvarzenbach or what her life story is .. and I must admit that the movie barely helped to get to that data .. and even she did not manage to persuade me to do some research by typing a few words on the google website; however, all I can say is that actress Jeanette Hain was brilliant with her mimic expression of a person who really played well and showed a deep mental status of depression, as it is in reality. Eventually, the film script took place in Turkey and Tehran, as well as in Afghanistan .. but, believe me, I know the area, everything was around the Arabian desert in Morocco. Turks and Persian people are completely different in terms of face and culture, and in a language other than Arabic. I assume that for this film - a documentary type - a mandatory detailed study of all these minor elements ...
