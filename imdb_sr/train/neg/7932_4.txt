What a disappointment. For decades I've been watching old Westin on British television, and I was not aware of this until their yesterday's show - most of Scott's other Westerners come around for some years or so, and it's usually worth watching them again. Rich colors and open-air sets were good, but that's all I can say about this movie. I have to agree with most of the other negative comments. Several times I wanted to turn it off, and in the end, halfway, something I hardly ever do. bandit lad. I feel that military uniforms were 20 years old or too modern, not that it disturbed producers of many other Western ones. Perhaps it was better in the second half, but I could not wait and see.
