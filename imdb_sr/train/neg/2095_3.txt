The wounded Gallactica was so big because she had solid writing, great looks, great actors and interesting stories ... And yes, there were hot men and women who were running in and out of uniform. Caprica was just lying. Lazi vriting. Actors who smoked a storm in order to give them "character". External sequences that destroy the feeling that you are somewhere else (yes, it's the Ford Focus sitting in the background). A lot and a lot of teenage fears. MANY gitarized naked women (but in the background, they will surely be cut out for the series) and a symbolic look at some men in towels. None of the actors except Poli Walker ever attracted my attention. For an hour and a half, I was still wondering when it would be over. So what is it that I should be back? Science Fiction? It's terribly bright. Actors? In addition to the excellent turning point, Poli Walker, there is not much interest here. There are not even "hotties" in the acting team, except maybe Esai, although for the younger set it's pretty old, because it's over 25. I loved the BSG. I was skeptical when I heard about Caprica, and unfortunately, I think I'm right. I anticipate a very short run for her as a series, unless they truly sharpen their pens in the SciFi and come to work, making it more than OC on the other planet.
