If you want to see a movie about two totally impersonal characters, this is one. The acting is brilliant, and John Cassavettes as a crazy paranoid, whom, as it is said, really STILL, and from Peter Falk as his best friend for whom he is turning to rescue. A big mistake, but since both are amateur mobsters, and the misogynistic bifurcation bug, it's hard to decide who will be the root for LESS. Only writer / director Elaine Mai could get away with this. I thought it was interesting that in a long interview with producer Michael Hausman on DVD he discovered that the two stars had "very different ideas" about the script, that the director was almost impossible to work with, that the director of the photo had impossible demands from him, that the crew is constantly angry because she is forced to sit and wait, and so on. This mood of a large, highly dysfunctional family can be clearly seen on the screen.
