This is a science fiction film of the formula B, and the director did not talk about it. It is a dragon that has been renewed in life by a scientific team. All you've done is what you've seen many times before. It's a bad script, with no real characters. In fact, she is full of stereotypical characters and situations. The director attacks this by just making a movie for the formula, without trying to deceive us, which gives the movie a mild attraction, but that's not something you will probably remember. It's best to see yourself cooking, cleaning, practicing. Some foolish party. It has its place in the party, but it's certainly not something you're sitting with your friends to watch, unless you're just drunk and does not care. Mass rating of 3.2 is probably right. I do not think it's a burden like most people, but I'm surprised that some people in the messages thought it was spectacular. It really escapes me because I do not see any attempt to make this an unforgettable movie.
