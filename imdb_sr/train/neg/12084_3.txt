Take: 1. famous game 2. director with his current ideas that he uses 3. Copy of the scenic design of the popular theater production performances mentioned in 1. 4. Actor for the lead - who does not have a sense of the role he plays and you will get: "Hamlet, Prinz von Danemark" I listened to the radio "Hamlet" with Maximilian By hell like Hamlet and I were so disappointed. I hoped that the recorded version would be better, that Schell would at least have body language to emphasize what he says - nothing. Then it's set ... minimalist design is not everyone's taste, but I usually like it when there's enough on the scene to clarify what the setting is and nothing more. Away, it's on the stage, in the theater. He will not work in a movie based on a show that actually has convincing settings. Had the idea of ​​a set been copied from the theater production in which Schell had already played Hamlet ... let's say that's the only thing I regretted ... I wonder how Schell could get a piece of Hamlet anywhere in the first place. place and how someone else could allow him to play Hamlet the other time. If you have the choice to look at any of the sixty Hamlet-based films, do not look at this, unless you are a masochist, or really hardcore, or you like to have fun on non-talented actors.
