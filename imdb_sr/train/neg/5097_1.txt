Contrary to most other commentators, I deeply hate this series. It starts to look interesting, with mysterious aliens and huge robots, and I was hoping for the last episode. In the end, I still do not understand what this is about extraterrestrial attacks (maybe I missed something, who knows?), And I realized that I went through 26 episodes, which mostly consist of my own hatred, selfishness and self-pity. In fact, it is shifted between the alien / robotic struggle and those dark, depressing, blinking scenes where one or more characters can only say or shout: "I hate you" 10-12 times in a row. /> <br /> I can not see either Shinji or Asuka (two of the main characters) who show growth or change. (I also can not see any of the other characters who are learning or growing.) I wanted to kick them and tell them to get bloody life during the first episodes, and the feeling did not change during the last. Shinji really owns the kind of helpless hopelessness that makes people angry, not charitable, and Asuka is such an unscrupulous knowledge of everything I wanted to break the TV screen every time she appeared. Oh, and more than anyone else, these two hate everything, and they say it often. I'm otherwise a great fan of anime and manga, and I've never liked it before. I read that the author / writer of the series wrote this while suffering from depression, and I can believe it; It depressed me to watch it. Is this the goal of this series? I sincerely ask. Is it designed to confuse and disturb the viewer? And if you suffer from depression, why not simply write a book or a biography about it, instead of mixing it with aliens and mechanics? This extraterrestrial war plot, as far as I can tell, does not lead anywhere. Finally, since I'm really fascinated by how many people claim to love this colorful dead end, I can help, but I wonder how many actually thought it was good, and how many say that it works because which they were told to be.
