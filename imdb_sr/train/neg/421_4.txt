My title above says everything. Let me clarify that. If you've seen the BBC's Planet Earth, which I'm sure most of you have, then this movie will not appeal to you too. And I own all of the "Planet Earth" discs that I saw that the rating for this film is very high, and I read good reviews about it. I was excited to check it out. By the way, I went to the theater and the film started, I saw it was a Disney movie with production houses that were announced by BBC and Discoveri. And when the first scenes of the polar bear began, I recognized them from their DVDs at home "Planets of the Earth". The movie continued and continued on and on, and me and my friends on the recognition of the scenes were all from the "Planet Earth". We were very disappointed, because I think 90% of the images from "Planet Earth". I'm talking 90% because I did not recognize some scenes. I have the feeling that I simply did not remember them. So, finally, what this film is is a compilation of different recordings from different Earth planet discourses, with a narration directed at the kids. Yes, narration is pretty humorous. Let me give you an example. When they show polar cubs to move away from their mother's youngster, the narrator says: "Polar cubs are not like human children, they do not always listen to their mother" (I do not recall exactly, but this is the way it is.) This is a condensed "Planet Earth" for children !
