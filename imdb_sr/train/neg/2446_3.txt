Rajkumar Santoshi, without any doubt, directed the biggest films and the largest offices of hits of Indian cinema. This film is short of all expectations like this movie star two great actor g. You have these two actors in the same movie that you have to make magnum opus. In the later part of the film, you can extract that voice by Amitab Bachchan that there is another person who needed for his illness. Still, the film did not have the proper character development Plus Cinema was not good and one thing Bollivood should learn is to use visual effects only when needed and when the application needs to be done with a high budget. The script had so many drawbacks that it gave the viewer an excuse to attend his phone calls, not watching a movie. The new comer shakes his feet, but he could not react to the film "Well, but where the film loses time" is the screenplay script and film Matography. Talented actor like Bhoomika Chavla is lost in the film as well as Sushant Singh. But every director once in a career makes a bad movie. So watch only if you are a movie starter with multi-starrer.
