They watched it on a DVD in the original language with English subs. Either filing was very bad or a real dialogue does not bring much talk and gives any character development. There are a lot of HK stars in this, but the film does not need their presence to be better or worse. That's just bad. Light and colorful scenes made in CG are attractive for pure colors and shine, but they can overflow. If nothing else, it makes me think of a kid's film with the continuous firing of cg, martial arts and shit. I'm sure I understood what happened in the film, but the whole delivery of the story was pretty bad.
