Does anyone think this show actually helps some people, or just angry people who watch it? when I scroll through the channels and come to this show and half to look out of morbid curiosity. I understand Roberson's patron is not all together. what I do not know is whether his viewers are similar to him or are good people and they think they will have a better life if they listen to what he has to say. Pat Roberson is not very important. He is an old man who thinks the old way. fear of damnation no longer has the same impact as it used to be (thank God). now, if someone is going to answer my question, I will avoid lightning for the rest of eternity.
