This version is probably available in the local DVD store. The print is not great, nor is the sound, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 minutes or less, you will get your money (which does not say much). Anna Neagle is extremely shallow as Nanette. Whatever their preferences are at that time, they are not visible in this movie. In this film, a large number of actors appear (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material is extremely weak compared to their talents. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see that these accomplished artists use the most of the letter. Music numbers (there are only two) are pretty scary. Obviously, the studio did not feel compelled to cash in on the rich musicality of the original "No, No, Nanette". For what's worth, DVD can be for $ 1.00. It's worth saying that you saw him.
