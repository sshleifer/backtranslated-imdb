Spoiler warning. When the main character's sister pushes down the stairs, the killer smashes the vodka cup next to her, in order to appear to have been drinking. But, before she was killed, she tells her sister's telephone partner (Terry Garr) that she did not drink in 4 days. However, the police never mention the results of a toxicological report! And, the characters say it was drunk when it fell down the stairs. Huh? It's a really bad mistake in this movie, which is pretty scary. Amazingly bad, given the big cast. Some mistakes: writing is not very good, music is made for TV bad, and no tension at all, because we already know the answer to the mystery of the first scene in the movie.
