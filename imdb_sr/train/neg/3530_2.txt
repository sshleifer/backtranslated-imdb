When Ritchie first shot on the film scene, his films were greeted as funny, witty, well-directed and original. If one can compare the hyper that he created with his first two attempts and the almost universal contempt that his last two exits made, one should consider - did Ritchie find out? Is he really so talented? Does he really have original ideas? Or is he simply a pretentious and egoistic director who really wants Fincher, Tarantino and Leone all in a colossal and unorganized crowd? After watching the Revolver, someone could be justified in thinking if everything went wrong? What happened to his great sense of humor? Where did he get all these mixed and intricate ideas? The revolver tries to be clever, philosophical and sullen, trying to be intelligent psychoanalysis, trying to be intricate and complicated thriller. Ritchie makes a tremendous effort to fulfill all these goals and invest great scenarios in existential thinking and numerous bandages. However, in the end, all this serves to build a seriously disconnected, unstructured and ultimately hostile film to the audience. His plagiarism is so sinister and obvious that, although Ritchie at least tries to turn around, he should be punished for even trying to dismiss him as his work. So, what the audience gets in the end is a terrible scenario intertwined with many pretentious onelines and awkward setpieces. Fiction. The goal is a high, but inevitably a large number of strokes. Revolver deserves to be lambasted, it's a really bad movie that turns into the masterpiece of the winning author. However, she descends to her farce face and only collapses in everything she wants and achieves.
