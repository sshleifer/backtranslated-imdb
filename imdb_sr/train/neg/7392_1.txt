I'm looking at the video and still in shock as Steven Seagal, with his previous ads on Bad Action Movies, can still have 3 movie films in less than a year. Sci-Fi Genre for our growing Seagal. Visions of bad movie parties flashed in front of my gullible eyes. It is by chance that this is not the case, without entertainment and film as bad as they are. Seagal recovered a small piece with Trashi-but a nice Shad Man Man last time we saw him. However, Attack Force must be his absolutely worst movie ever! Do not argue about Kill, Ticker, or even Black Dawn people. Anyone who says this Steven Seagal's return to form should be forced to write a 100-page essay on the Taste word. Seagal is another agent / I am a top criminal and again called Lavson wants revenge for the murder of his team that leads him to evil conspiracy to distribute bad drugs harmless I do not mention that the dealers are not from here. Complete production from directing to acting is bad. Is this film shot in the dark? 2. Action is terrible and very badly made. Producers also unreasonably decided to do what fans hate most: throwing a duel after a duel and terribly called Steven Seagal. Show some enthusiasm here. Can you blame him? While it is said that Attack Force is not a movie Stevie signed for (originally Harvester) and must certainly be better than Attack Force. - The production manipulation did not make it more coherent and made Seagal look even worse. I feel bad about the director Michael Keusch and writer Joe Hal while they will be forever condemned for poor production recommendations. So now this leaves Seagull in an impossible position to make sense of what he will redeem for this mess. the bad Attack Force turned out, do we really want to make another movie?
