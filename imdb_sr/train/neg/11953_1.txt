Do you know the movies you captured in the cinema? You got stuck in the best place in the house, in the center of the order in your special sweet place that you replaced three times before you got the right seat - and after what you feel like 13 hours you're still trapped, uncomfortable and rustling, thinking "When is F *** this movie ever going to the end? " (You know the feeling - think of A.I. and the village). Well, visitor K delivers a strange variant of that feeling. I sat there for the first 30 minutes, wondering when the thing would start! It's endless! So "Arti" hurts. This is the first Miike Takashi movie I've been watching. Apparently, he records dozens of films and, if everyone is pretentious, this is how I suppose it will be the last. I am not against Pretentious in @ nk. David Linch is among the top 10 directors for me, but Visitor K is cheap, cheap and nasty pretentious in @nk. As you have already done so far - I hated it.
