In my opinion, Snow White is a bad movie on the artistic point of view. The action is quite predictable, the characters are stereotypes, editing is too exaggerated. In any case, the film seems to have few artistic ambitions. Instead, I think this is a real commercial matter. Inclusion of a character from the French part of Switzerland (actor IS leader of the band with whom he collaborates in the film - a band called SENS UNIK) seems to be striving for a larger audience. A real German Swiss film would not be sold in French - and vice versa. What really went on my nerves was the placement of products all over the movie. Some scenes remember advertisements! I also think that the theme is "young people who take drugs without any other goals in their lives" is a widespread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be elaborated in more detail. I hope that Samir gets enough money with the Snowman, so that his next film shows his true artistic skills.
