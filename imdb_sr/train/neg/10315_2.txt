I can not believe that people thought that this stinking bunch of garbage was funny. Switching the humor attempts between cruelty, disgust, and stupidity, "Something About Mary" leaves little reason to stay to the end. Of course, Cameron Diaz is very pretty, but it will never be enough to save the movie. Ben Stiller tries to work in a plot and is obviously very talented, but the film is a loser. None of the scenes was convincing. Shots were poorly timed and badly framed. Farrelee's brothers should stay away from films at all costs. I'm checking IMDB to see what they're doing just to know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; The bonus is since I smiled. It's not that I am immune to humor or I am in my opinion. And my wife hated it. The next day we saw 'Rush Hour' and laughed. This film just stinks.
