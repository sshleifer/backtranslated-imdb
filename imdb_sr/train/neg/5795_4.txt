"Lies" talks about an affair between an 18-year-old student and a 38-year-old married man with a couple of protests that run about half the screen in naked sex and hockey screaming, and the other half intertwines through a pathetic naive story that looks a bit more than excuse for sex scenes. With a very poor production value, including apparent sanitary appliances and fake softcore sex in a story that is a messy mix of comedy and drama, "Lies" quickly becomes a redundant phenomenon. With almost 2 hours of work, titles, and so few content, "Lies" is simply not recommended. (C-)
