Totally wasting time .... This movie is not a comedy, it's not a drama, it's not a romantic ... even a teenage comedy !!! The story ... there should be some turning point ... but it's so disappointing! When the movie has a reversal in the end, I expect the movie to be even better (the "Fight Club"), but this reversal makes the film even worse ... When I watch a teen comedy, and not often I do, I expect crazy jokes and a bunch of nudity ... jokes are too bad and no nudity ... you only have one .... very good looks I have to admit ... a girl, and that's it! And she's completely dressed in the whole movie! The acting is bad ... like a series of soaps ... Do not waste your time! There are porn with a better story and acting! <br /> <br /> (I'm sorry, bad English)
