Just the fact that the cover is a drawing, like those old B-movies, should warn you about the quality of this movie. This, however, is not a B-movie. It's D-movie! No known actors, and animals - VOV - this is the worst data-animation ever made over the last two decades. It's hard to ever see a SCAAARI sabretooth displayed on the front cover. You just hear people screaming, bleeding and dying, and you occasionally see teeth or a tiger's paw. So amateur! Maybe worth seeing, just because it's so bad. Give it to a friend and say, "This is the best movie I've ever seen, and wait for their reaction." He, he. The film is weakened to give it a Spoiler Alert! THIS IS A SPOILER.
