I saw it on the Sci-Fi channel. It came right after the first. For some reason this film has made me interested. I do not know why, stop asking. --- SPOILERS --- Okay ... It was stupid that this guy was involved in filming. In the first film, he had a "reason" to kill people, but in this sequel, half of the murders / attempted killings was for no reason. Stanley killed the director for creative differences, caught the co-writer for creative differences, but what about the attempt to kill an actor? No actors, no movie. He wanted to "look real when they died"? If this should have been such a high budget, use special effects, MAN. Of course, like the first, a captured girl escapes, and Stanley ends up messing up and disappearing. Voooooov (sarkazam). This film has the potential. And the saddest part of everything ... a really sad part ... I would look at "Cabin next to Lake 3". Just because I like Judd Nelson, and he's the only good part in this sequel.
