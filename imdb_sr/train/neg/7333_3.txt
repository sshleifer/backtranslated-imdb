I enjoyed the feeling of opening a few minutes, but for 20 minutes I greatly applied the quick-swipe button in advance. Too many recordings of Stevart (Michael Zelniker) walking from room to room, down the corridors, through the door and down the street, and as many shots as they seemed thoughtful and confused. He gave me the impression that the story was initially conceived as short (20-30 minutes), and then spread to character as the work of love between directors Grieve and Star Zelniker (they wrote the script). Maybe it was more fun if any of the characters had anything to say I had not heard before in many other films or that it was not the end - disappointing - one that I predicted for three minutes in a movie (atypical for an independent / minor studio Movie). At least his heart was in the right place - it was not your standard Hollywood manipulative nonsense.
