Imagine his, say 12-1 - your home, your boredom, your murder. This scenario happened around, say, for four years or more. I turned on the TV and switched on several channels and found that this movie was turned on. OH MY WORD This is the worst movie I've ever seen! A car that can not be stopped (because the brakes are cut or something similar) in the stopping of the highway - what will happen ?! This film was so bad that it's actually funny - I think it's about two dollars behind in order to make it, there's been one case when a baby / little child pulls out of a car with a helicopter - in an attempt to excite the viewer - a well-fitted bridge is approaching. .. THIS IS THE BEST OF THE FILM EVERYDAY - shows that the child soon misses the bridge, but it looks so bad - you can almost see the look of dummies they used - a totally low budget classics! I can not remember the end of the movie, but I bet it's BIG I doubt it will ever show up this movie again and I'm glad to see this piece of trash!
