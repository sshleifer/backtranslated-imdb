Priiadarshan - whenever someone heard his name, his first thought would be 'comedy'. That's what this man is known for, or rather, known. After giving great comedies such as Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train slid slowly with movies like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I do not remember now. Now with disgusting movies like Dhol, the first word that would come to our mind after hearing his name would be 'torture'. uncertainty and idiocy. The only good thing at Dhol was one or two scenes that were funny, but not funny, and second, apart from Kunal Khem and hysterical grandmother, the acting was decent. Speaking of acting, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (if you compare them to others in the movie), then Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and at the end of the two above mentioned idiots came. The disadvantage in Kunal Chem was that he was louder in his jokes, even in the acting. Grandma, she was first to look like a ghost, plus she was not funny at all, but rather stupid. The plot was the same, seen before. Four boys behind girls and who need money, but with several turns. There is a 'bad' man who is senseless stupid and stupid. And finally, it's good to win badly and everything is fine. The idea that you have a Dhol with a tune full of money in it is simply not witty. The worst thing in the movie is its length. After an hour or two, you are exhausting and want to leave the theater. But as a critic, it is my responsibility to tolerate the entire two and a half hours of film. The film continues and continues, and the same jokes are repeated over and over again, and the situations are perennial only in the second place. If your mother-in-law arrived at your house and started to work, she scoffs at everything, then send her for this movie and have fun. 3 of 10
