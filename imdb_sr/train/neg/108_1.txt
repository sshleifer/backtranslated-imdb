Professionals: Nothing to Stop: All Summary: A female journalist encounters a photo writer who tells his story of the deaths of people who have killed zombies. > Review: Never in my life did I come across a movie as bad The Zombie Chronicles. Recorded in the budget of what looks like $ 20, the TZC is a horrible horror film relying on chromium, forgetful actors who could not save their lives and blood which is more than frightening. How can a movie like this be made at all? Simply put, avoid TZC as a sexually transmitted disease. My last 2 cents: Pretty humorous, this movie was filmed by the film company Brain Damage Films. Must be really damaged by the brains to get to this kind of film. My Rating: 1 out of 10 (If it was up to me, this movie would get a negative rating of bajillion)
