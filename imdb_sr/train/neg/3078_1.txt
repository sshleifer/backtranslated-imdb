I did not think it was possible that the comedy of horror films would collapse so humble on both fronts ... really terrible. The fact that this is not taken seriously (usually a good thing) works against it, primarily because the actors are so wooden that they really swear to read the cards. In the end, though ... MST3K version, as always, has a few laughs.
