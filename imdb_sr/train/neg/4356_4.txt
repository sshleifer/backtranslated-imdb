Since I am not a fan of blood and heart, I thought that bloody scenes are completely unnecessary (you are writing) and are too real for my affection, if you are the type of person who gets his stones on the Internet or snuff movies, for example, The person dreams this sick crap though. In addition, she had the potential to be a great movie, the music was also top-level (through the film) and especially the ultimate credits). Some parts, although they were a bit incredible, just like you just discovered the trust of your girlfriend, waiting for torture and death, all you do is tell her what happened and how you got there (why did not she ask if she had any wipes or even something fresh air or a piece of rubber while it was on it?), come on now, most would probably just scream "hurry up and unload me then let's get out of here KUICK!". where there were flies, worms, etc., and if a girl accidentally came in place, the smell of rotten flesh would sound a few arousal! I would recommend this film to Dennis Nielson's friends only, and I am sure that such a video would make hospitals such a happy Christmas.
