as always, this is the innocent picture of the homeless. TV has published many lies about begging in the early nineties and made everyone look bad, and we claimed that we all made over $ 100 a day when $ 20-40 a day was much closer to reality. when someone drove where I held a sign that offered to work and offered me a job, I actually went and took a job if I was physically able. And if I were offered $ 100,000 id damn safe securely invested in apt prepaid for At least 2 I kept the most in the bank and I still left $ 10-20000 for NL $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 cash game in the casino. I usually win and I can get decent if I have a bankroll. Instead, I get around $ 1000 a month and everybody always plays minimal shopping because I do not want to lose everything. I was just a homeless person because I did not want to spend all my money and broke, sometimes I had over $ 1000-2000 in my stock while sleeping outside. anyone who wants to talk with the contact of sevencard2003 on Yahoo messenger.and I admit that I was different from most homeless people, however, because of the fact that I never drank or took drugs. I am no longer a homeless person, I am now in government apartments for $ 177 a month and I get SSI and spend most of my time online poker. Mum and sunflowers worked a lot to give me SSI. I'm glad that my days of hiding under the stage at the casino convention center were sleeping at night, taking care that they would catch me, finally finished. that this TV crew chose me to have gone much earlier. It is a shame that they do not choose the best they choose.
