I was crazy when anyone made this movie. I was even more angry that I lost my precious minutes of my life sitting and watching this. I could have a job with wax and I had a lot of fun. At least Cherry smiles before he hurts. At first, I was a little confused, but then I realized what was going on. Until that moment, the film was halfway, and yes, I'm a procrastinator, but I always want to see things to the end. So I threw it out, I watched everything. Not only actors are not as attractive as in the Cruel Intentions, they are simply not convincing. I saw my nephew crying for more careful attention than the alleged lust on the screen of this film. If you love bad movies with bad acting, watch this.
