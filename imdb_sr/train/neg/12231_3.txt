I saw this film, and occasionally, I was upset by believing in this movie 'seen me'. Munchie owes "Farce". Look back at Star Vars, Don't-vatch Munchie. As a responsible parent (I speak to those who are now parents), I (you) would not allow my (your) child to ever participate in this pseudo-occult video festival. To insinuate that Munchie is a sotonic, co-viewer, is likely to be an unlawfully cooled 'ghost'. He is devilish, alien, rodentan, and totally malicious - like a man from Bogei made of meat, invisible to adults, causing children to lifestyles that they would never be able to afford (without income that has been made possible for years of self-discipline and careful management) . He is a trader with easy answers and false ideals. He is everything that the morally conscious viewer is not. He's the devil Ron Popeil. I pray (I mean it literally and figuratively, with an emphasis on the first) that this movie did not make the format jump to DVD. I hope this kind of 'making a yellow film' has died a non-sad death in the cold nights of 1994. Munchie also likes pizza. I forgot that. Much coming.
