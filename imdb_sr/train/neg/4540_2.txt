At first, three words: READ THE BOOK! Really, guys - this shows the difficulty of properly displaying esoteric issues. I loved the book and I was completely disappointed with the film. It was funny, half-hearted, and the stories were poorly explained. Roman - in the first place! - It should not have been focused on the adventure! It's just the environment. In the film, the focus only turns on and the message is taken by the back seat! Additional, visual effects that show the energy of all living beings and the illumination of events were ultimately dubious! They screwed him! ... I will never watch again!
