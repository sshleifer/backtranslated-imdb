Get into your favorite chair and turn on the play station while throwing it into the waste disposal unit. Spend useful 90 mins. Live your favorite game. Uncoiled - poorly recorded - non-ferrous waste. She takes several pieces from other "science fiction" films and fails to link parts to a pathetic, weak story. There is nothing new here, the film's authors do not realize that providing simple entertainment could achieve a monetary game, but it is necessary that the imagination and the sense of skill become a good movie. Any money spent watching this is a waste, and personally I would like to get my 90 minute life back.
