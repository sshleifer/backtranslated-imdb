In the first 20 minutes, every possible cliché came from the writer and director. There was a primary NTSB investigator with a family life; a politically tortured member of the NTSB board he plays [can kill any TV] Ted McGinley; tortured father of a crash victim; Hollivood still has no idea of ​​the fragility of planes. The plane that fell was 737 and was mostly sitting on the ground as a Nile horse who decided to sleep. The first third of the hull was intact, the last half of the plane was untouched, and the debris field did not show wings or motors. Most people were supposed to go in the light of how many people survived that plane that was chopped in Iowa after losing hydraulics. Most of this plane is not even burnt. He reminded me of the scene in the "Air Force One" where he hit 747 in the water and then skipped like it was made of an inch of thick steel. The show was so bad it was impossible to watch. Even my wife, who accepts more than me, commented on technical shortcomings. What stunned me is that this POS could be made. Are the manufacturers of these things so accustomed to clichés that I can not even recognize them? Someone read this script and said: Yes, I want to spend millions of dollars to make this real. I wish I was next meeting. I have the title of a beautiful bridge in New York that I would sell cheaply.
