Think of this movie as a Saturday morning program for live action from ancient times. Even small ticks will find this difficult to satisfy because it runs like a molasses! I can not fully understand how terrible it is to do something too typical and uninteresting, especially in the costume department! Too many films about wizard warriors there used the same old poster many times, but this is very scarce given its appeal to small dear people. And who would let the toll in the world at all? I thought this was a "family" movie! MST3K, here's another nice gem for your TV season 1999!
