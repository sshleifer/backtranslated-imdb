I am a great fan-horror / sci-fi fan regardless of the budget, but after watching countless horror films late in the evening on cable and video, this must be the worst of all the movies. With bloody special effects (what looked like a roasting covered with fake blood or ketchup that was repeatedly shown again) and people running around shouting from the left, then right, and then back again. He should have stayed with the initial sales scene and stopped there and has 15 minutes. Instead, he's been dragging himself for a long time. It's a very, very small budget. Many scenes were very long. The narrator sounded very amateurish, as the casual person from a junior talked about. This is the only film I think is lower than Manos, the Red Zone of Cuba, Benji and Godzille against the megalomanias, despite the higher budgets. 10 aggressions, try to be awake through the whole movie in one environment or better still, avoid it as if you were a real mobster. Why-is-ever-see-this-piece-zombie-dung-blues. Epitome of nauseating of bad films etc ... and infinitum. -infinite / 10
