Jesus, as a gay man living in New York, can say with gratitude that I have never seen the underground gay culture shown in this film - and I'm glad !!! Whether this film was broadcast on TV across the United States, there would be a huge anti-gay backhand and I can not say I would blame them. People in this movie do not represent the average Gai American or even the average Trangender of the Americans, what they represent is the pure and ultimate nightmare. The inclusion of obviously minor characters is terrible and obviously racist feelings (anti-white) are obvious and disturbing - society can not be blamed for people who chose medication, unemployment and rejection of education in the part of "film" - the actions of these people are not acts of despair, the rejection of anything that resembles personal ambition and the willingness to do something out of oneself.
