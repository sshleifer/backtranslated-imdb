I saw a movie last night at home, but I thought it was too long for the first time. Secondly, the things I saw in the movie were too out of the text to even think about what I thought would be a comedy movie as before. Things are not ridiculous in the film: the fianc√©e strikes his girlfriend, fights. The film was too long - he was talking about the desire to go to bed and wondering when it would end when you woke up and you are still playing it! Some things at the rally were too much to shoot - as the lady sang - I felt like I was almost watching a spiritual show here! Come on Perry, you can do better than this!
