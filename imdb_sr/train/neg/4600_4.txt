I've read all these reviews about how this is such a good movie. Jesus, this film was predictable and pretty boring. Most of the acting time was below the average, especially Mckenna. I did not see another pathetic attempt to "kiss" someone in the movie. Oh man, this film was a disappointment. I also read somewhere that this may be a cult classic. I know there are directors' followers, but this film was just an average movie. The scenario was chrome, mostly acting was chromatic, this film was chrome. > Oh, and pray for the guy who was in Cheers. It looks really bad. The best actor in this movie was probably a guy in Office Space, and he was only in this movie about 8 minutes. 4/10
