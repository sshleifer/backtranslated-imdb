This is the second British film that adapts stories to Sommerset Maugham. Everything except a Quartet story does not travel well in times of contemplation; and the speech of actors is definitely "scrubbed", as only the delivery of British actors before 1950 can be. In any case, the 'Trio' seems tougher and more cinematic than the first film adaptation. One of the problems that these two films can not overcome is that their original material is written 25-30 years before the movie. Accordingly, until the 1950s Maugham's (pre-war) popularist "small morality" seemed rather strange, if not rather shy.
