It was so terrible. It was not fun to watch at all. Even the scene in which a girl uses a vibrator, it's not even fun to watch in this movie. I repeat, the scene in which a girl masturbates with a vibrator is not even fun to watch. Or maybe if it was the only part of the movie you were watching, just a girl on a couch with a vibrator. Perhaps it was necessary to publish only one scene in theaters, perhaps the film would be pleasing at a certain level. My advice, fast forward to that point, watch it, rewind the movie, watch it again, rewind, repeat. Maybe you could enjoy 2 hours that way. This film spilled onto my grave and the generation Doom in the category of the worst movies I've ever seen.
