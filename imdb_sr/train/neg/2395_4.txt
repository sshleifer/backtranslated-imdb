Could this be done by the same director, like "Do not look now or bad weather"? He behaved poorly, foolishly edited. You just need to compare different scenes with these disasters similar to "Don't Look Nov" to see how Roeg lost his touch. Even the generally trustworthy Teresa Russell (looks a bit sturdy these days, I'm afraid to report) can not save this. The action is a pure pseudo-religious hockey, the action is wooden, and Roeg's attempts to change the time is sad. Avoid this as a plague.
