This film was stagnating and missing a sign. It's far off compared to 89 Batman who is trying to get back. She's a singer whose name she can not play, and we see why her filmmaker died. Pay attention to how this movie died in the cinema office no one on television saw this movie. My uncle and dad expected Batman, and the film impression is more like Cop Rock. It's not worth renting 3/10
