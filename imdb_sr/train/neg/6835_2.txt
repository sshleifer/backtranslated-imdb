I do not see anyone who loves Van Damne could love this movie. The film actually starts with some promise. I would say that the action scenes at the beginning of the film are great. Action scenes with family classes that try to save twins is a great start and a good introduction to the main story. However, the film is downhill. It would be nice that the director remained with the original premise. This means that brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills. One brother should be skilled in martial arts, but another brother should be skilled in firearms. How pleasing is the time when a brother who never picked up a pistol before suddenly being a big shooter, and a brother who has not been trained in any martial arts, suddenly cracks and blows. Br /> <br /> Action, action, etc. are simply meaningless. My favorite scenes? And when Van Damne confronts an armed soldier with AK-47. The soldier is about 100 meters away. Instead of aiming and firing at Van Damne, he is doing a war cry as if he were fighting a combat ax and running towards him. Van Damne continues to take a pistol from a dead soldier and shoot at him ... while still at 75 to 80 yards away. This film has one of the most remarkable endings. Bolo Ieung is a skilled fighter. However, instead of choreographed a decent fight. Bolo throws a barrel in Van Damne like Donkey Kong. An absolutely aggravating film that had so many promises. If you are a Van Damne fan, save time and watch Hard Target or one of his earlier movies.
