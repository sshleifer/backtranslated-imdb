I think this piece of garbage is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed, why all American animators think that children want a stupid GI JOE version of good stories these days? Loonei Tunes are some of the most liked characters in history, but they were not created to be the Crests, I think you come! Tini Toons was a great example of how the old idea can be updated without losing the original charm, but this piece of garbage is just an example of stupid corporate decisions that just want to create a cheap idiotic indication that kids will love because hey !! ! kids love Superheroes right? the whole show is just a waste of time in which we see the new versions of Loonei Tunes, but this time in superhero, this does not sound bad, but the problem is that this show is trying too hard to copy a series such as the batman animated series, or a new Judicial League, score ??? Bad copies of the flash (runner) or superman (which is still a foreigner) is a problem in the fact that Loonei Tunes should not have been dramatic, it should have been ridiculous !!!! As I said before this series is bullshit, and many people are wondering why anime is taking around the world? this show is trying to be dramatic and full of action, but it's something that several series and anime are able to do, if you want to see a good upgrade to old shov vatch Tini Toons, this is an example that can be brought back to life by old characters, but with a good story and respecting the original roots. Too bad the show is already dead, I presume another corporate wise decision.
