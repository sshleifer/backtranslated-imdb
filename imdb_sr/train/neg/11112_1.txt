Vov, how badly he can. This was seriously bad. Not in terms of the above - which was mostly funny CGI - already in the act, the atmosphere and the direction. The story was terrible - the arch of the protagonist was a total joke. Within a few nights of pursuing Vinnie Jones, he becomes "persecuted" to the point of crying when he is photographing his girlfriend. Um ... are all New York photographers this childish, suggestive and weak? His character development did not have absolutely any justification or indication - and to the very end, you will laugh loudly at the extremely predictable and completely absurd turn of his character. poor, low self-esteemed efforts to jump on a modern MTV styling wagon - all cgi, blood, but without any real emotion. These parts were unintentionally ridiculous - and distracted from their self-consciousness - the camouflage angles of the camera, etc. What could have an atmosphere (down to stupid monsters in the end) was ruined in favor of 'a look at the style of self-conscious directing. This film was not made for the audience - it was made for a resume - a deep selfish motive.
