Mario Levis of the Institute for Competitive Entities wrote a definite killing of a 120-page film, in line with the line of this fake movie, which should be called A CONVENIENT LIE. The Internet address on which his disclosure report is under the heading "A SKEPTIC'S GUIDE FOR INVESTIGATION OF TRUTH" can be found at: vvv.cei.org. A short version of 10 pages can be found at: vvv.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf When you read these demolitions, you will understand that the supposedly "global warming" is no longer real or dangerous than the I2K fear of 1999, which Gore also supported , as well as the pseudo-scientific film DAN NAD SUTRA, based on a book written by the alleged UFO by Vhitlei Strieber. As James "The Amazing" Randi makes the psychics, and Philip Klass makes UFOs, and Gerald Posner JFK the theory of conspiracy-idiocy, and Mario Levis works on Al Gore and the whole "global warming".
