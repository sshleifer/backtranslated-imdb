Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... but it's not one of them. Ah, another crime Breda Sikes. The acting is terrible, except Emma Smith showing some promise. "Camera direction" should be seriously processed. And no longer "hold the camera and run" tricks; just does not work. Special effects are unimaginable, there is a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you want to tear your ear, please do not let us see the actor's right ear underneath the blood. The landscape is dull and boring (same as Mr. Sikes), and music is a cross between a cheap motel and a bad guitar (see a landscape commentary). Have I mentioned the lack of any real complication or character development? Obviously, the screenwriter is not. Whoever finances this type ... please stop. I've seen some of his other "home movies" (which I will not include) and they are equally bad. Normally, the "director" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not of this type. One is to be an amateur film maker, but anyone can be hacking. Definitely not even popcorn ... of course, chewing the core of popcorn would be less painful than this effort. /> Prize: The Worst Military Pulls in the Movie.
