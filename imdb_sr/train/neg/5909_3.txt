The opening of five minutes gave me hope. Then Meiers showed that he had only one good idea for the rest of the film. Absolute smallest common nominal humor. Painful watching. A complete job. There is no doubt that it was written in less than a week, just like the first one. Give Meiers a hook and lock it in a cell with Adam Sandler and Vill Farrell. And do not let him go until he develops a decent script for something, anything. He has it in him. These things from Austin Povers are just embarrassing. Let the Goldmember sink without a trace.
