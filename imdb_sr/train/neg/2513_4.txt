When I first looked at this movie, I thought it should come from a children's section - It's very fun and sometimes funny, and it's actually a pretty good story, but it's seriously missing "romantic chemistry" that actors like Meg Rian and Tim Robbins are capable of delivery. I must note that Valter Matthau is perfect for Albert Einstein, and his performance is remarkable, but this is the only exception. This movie appears to be somewhat compulsive, directed by the lack of substance, and oh, yes ... the music is ridiculously horrible, it did not make me very good. But if you do not expect a smart, well-made comedy / romantic story, then it can certainly be fun, as I said .. it should be in the children's section. Einstein and his friends are a good relief from the boring, almost tense task of Tim Robbins to steal Meg Rian's heart. Very conflicting film, but until it's taken seriously it can be a good movie.
