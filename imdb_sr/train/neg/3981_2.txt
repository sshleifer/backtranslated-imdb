This film does not really have any beginning or end. And it's really incredible. Mari-K and Ashley should be trainees who work in a post office for an Italian fashion company. But, for some reason, they are located in a 5-star hotel (located on the opposite side of the Colosseum Street), and all the other interns they work with are as abnormal as they are. One thing that is obvious in this movie is the way one of the twins does not end up with a guy. I guess they tried to do a little bit of the usual plot. Good attempt.
