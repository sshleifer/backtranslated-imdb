I'm going to record as another person who, after years of using IMDb, searched movies motivated by Nach's film, The Abandoned to create an account and post a comment. It was the worst movie I ever saw in my life. The action was on the verge of non-existence, and none of the "puzzles" has in any way been summarized. The acting was funny and the writing was embarrassing. How this film got support and came completely outside of me. The only rescue grace I could find was a cunning and repetitive use of the word Anastasia Hill. (and a brilliant sound design) If I were faced with an option to look at this movie again or to wander wild bores, I would be against a tough decision. I'm disappointed that I'm not able to give him 0 stars.
