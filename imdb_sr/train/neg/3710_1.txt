The king is dead for a long time, the king lives! The Caddy Shack Triad, The Families Under the Stairs and the Troop Beverly Hills were tied to the worst movie ever so long that they seemed to be icons by themselves. But there is a new king ... iep ..... everything is greeting the new king .... "Down to Earth". But some things, like Tina Tim, are so bad they are good. Someday, this could take the unique "Rockie Horror Picture Shov" as a cult film. So look at this .... this .... so just take my word for it. Go see. Say hello to the new king!
