"Vitcheri" could only be the most complex and unhappy scenario of the horror film of the 80's, but, fortunately, it has several compensatory qualities such as fantastic effects up, exciting musical score and some great choices. Frankly speaking, the script does not make sense, but who cares that Linda Blair (with an exploded haircut) shows another girl possessing evil forces, and David Hasselhof shows a photographer who can not fit. a film that constantly contains bloody voodoo, sewn up lips, upside-down crucifixes, wicked glows and an exaggerated but truly furious melody. Eight random people gathered on a deserted vacation island on the shores of Massachusetts. The young couple is here to explore the dark history of the city; a dysfunctional family (with pregnant Linda Blair, although no one seems to care about who the father is and where he is), re-opening the hotel and a delicious female architect simply labeled for random sex. They were forced to spend the night at the top hotel, and then suddenly the previous landlady? an elderly actress or something that is always dressed in black? it starts to run them in different ways. Everything is somehow related to an introductory sequence that shows that a woman is accused of a magic jump from a window. In any case, the plot is certainly of minor importance in the Italian horror franchise that began as an unofficial spin-off "The Evil Dead". The atmosphere is occasionally disturbing and the effects of makeup are undoubtedly the most striking element of the entire film. Something is extremely morbid and disturbing to look at a helpless woman hanging upside down in the chimney and waiting to be fried.
