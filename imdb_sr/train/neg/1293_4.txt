I'm probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this movie. Thinking visually stunningly, like all the works of Ang Lee (every time it looks worthy of the press), I was really disappointed with the disjunctive pace of the film. It really was too long. The story was set in the civil war in Missouri, and it talks about a young man (Roedel) who joins the wild force of Bushwacker, somehow the rebellious sympathizers of the Confederation who are guerrilla-type fighting with Jaihavkers, their colleagues from the Union. He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles, played by Skeet Ulrich, joined the group after Chile's father was shot and set on fire, and his home was burned, probably by Jaihavkers. The story follows Roedel and Chiles' adventures and their interactions with other war victims, including former merchants fighting for Bushwackers (Daniel Holt, starring Jeffery Vright), and the war widow played by Jevel. It seemed that every time a film develops a story to an interesting point, it will turn to some other medium and leave things underdeveloped. For example, the anxiety between Roedel's group caused by former Holt Holt who participates in a confederative cause is briefly illustrated through some conflict of law and protocol, and then fell down until later in the film. The young villian Bushvhacker hates Roedel and directs a lot of torment and violence against him, but we never know why. Some characters never look on the surface; I think that this is because the film combines too many of them, as well as large amounts of history. Historical detail was excellent. I loved to look at living space, furniture, clothes, etc., and I thought that the leading actors did a wonderful job of humanizing characters, although they stumbled slightly on the dialogue. Unless you really do not enjoy the history or are a great fan of Ang Lee, however, take this.
