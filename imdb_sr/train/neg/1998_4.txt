My roommate got Well, Well, Nanette soundtrack as a dub on the cassette and continued to listen to her non-stop. After finally completely draining my brain in submission, I found that the songs are irresistible, especially famous, I want to be happy, but I can not be happy ... But from the rough soundtracks I had no idea what the movie is about. The other day, I saw a copy of the video and rented what it was supposed to be a long lost version of the movie. I thought it would be incredible, because the soundtrack was so cute. Unfortunately, most of the songs I loved are not found anywhere in the video I saw. Now I've never seen the version of 1930, but this version was unfortunately disappointing because there was very little singing and practically no dance, and besides, the sound was very bad and you did not understand how people were talking. a lot of time. Really the only accent of this film was the incredible fashion of the 1940s. Nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that protrude like rabbit ears, and Kansas Kitti has a bizarre feather feather on her forefather, and then she is wrapped in this mesh scarf. One dance sequence is also a little strange to Nanette who is doing this strange ballet thing with pictures of pin-up girls over her. In fact, another bright spot of the film was the artist Guillespe who dreams of being a good artist, but is currently convicted of drawing pin-up girls for money. I like how Guillespe kept him in the old school, and Disets Nanette, when his masterpiece, the work he was supposed to make his career, sold Nanette for insignificant $ 5250. Does not he realize that this piece is his immortality? A silly rabbit / girl with your ears on the rabbit. When will you learn? Why not just pencil in a cigarette before men take Rad?
