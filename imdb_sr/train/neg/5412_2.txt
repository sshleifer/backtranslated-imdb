Piare Mohan can safely get into the black list of one of the worst films ever made by mankind. The film, one of the many disadvantaged people who emerged after the phenomenal success of Black, makes a mess to the handicapped fraternity. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are just cartoons of handicapped people. While Black portrayed the sharpness and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us insights into her world, Piare Mohan shows two monkey-like monkeys who have no doubt that they are handicapped and crushed half of the world in order to protect their love interests. Anu Malik's music is honest. Vivek Oberoi, who promised to start with Saathii, unfortunately quickly loses his eggs at the Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan has never been an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned in the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just beautiful girls in trouble who have nightmares in Thialand, and no one can save them - in addition to the above-mentioned desperados. Boman Irani, as the evil Don Toni, is somewhat acceptable. Avoid film if possible.
