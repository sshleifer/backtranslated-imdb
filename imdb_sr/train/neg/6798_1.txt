This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Everyone involved should be ashamed. All of. Ice-T is poor, the dialogue is absolutely horrible, and the hockey does not begin to describe the performances of each individual actor in this movie. The plot heavily steals from the Executive decision, but compared to Air Rage, the executive decision is the Oscar material. I've never been so disappointed when I watched the movie. The air rage should be burned with ashes locked in the vault and will never see the light of day again. Anyone who saw him should be showered and washed away from the horror of a terrible film. The best part of this film probably comes from the end, when the credits are deleted. It was the worst movie I ever saw. Ice-T should stick to the law and order, and other people in this film should retreat earlier or commit suicide. In any case, they should never try to be back in the film.
