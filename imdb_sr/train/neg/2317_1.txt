The direction clearly stated that the idea and the action of this film are completely original ... however, as far as those who read the "slam dunk" comic book, we can clearly see that the characters are very similar, and even some jokes ... Another note is that I'm Jai Chov I DO NOT KNOW Kung Fu, he will not impress anybody if he tries to act as he can, many people today see the difference. Luckily the movie does not contain much fighting against KunG Fu- and many of them enhanced by the admirers and visual effects ... I think Jai's acting is still a pain to watch, especially as and almost everyone else in the film much better. The only reason I think Jai is the main actor is simply because of his popularity. Despite how much I want to prevent anyone from watching what makes this "original" movie what they do not need to become one of the best budget films in China for this year.
