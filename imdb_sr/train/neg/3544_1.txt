The volcano massacre should have been the title of the movie. And the tag line was supposed to read "Guaranteed your kids CRI!"

The only speech is in the narrative of the tree that stands above the lagoon, gives insights to the animals that they love and live ... Beautiful scenery and wonderful shooting of animals. Sounds good? From there, things go straight to hell and then they start punching towards the core ... *** Spoilers below - Or they can be Warning! *** For the first time we know that one of the foxes is born blind. But it seems that we agree well enough and is accompanied by a beautifully cheerful music party ... And then he dies ... Next we have one of the adventures of our brothers and sisters. And then she dies ... One of the sisters gets her time on the screen ... and then she dies ... And so it goes like some horrible movie like one fox for another killed by nature, in traps, just and gone, so even a bunch of snowmobiles! Nearly all the foxes were massacred to the end of the film. Unfortunately, no death is displayed on the screen. (At least not in the version we've seen.)

It's still a film about nature. But not nearly the whole family. Do not go to see this movie cheated by a cheerful box that thinks it is safe for children. Look at it with some knowledge that things will not go well at all and that you or your children can feel very bad, depending on how sensitive you are. You can enjoy it. Or you can not ...
