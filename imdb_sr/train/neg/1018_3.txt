There is a great reason why Edison went directly to the video: it would crash into a cinema with demolition. The film lasted too long and was quite boring. Just a little above the low rate (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who apparently had two weeks before their next films), bad guys are equally funny and seem almost non-existent as Justin Timberlake's acting. I hate to hit a guy, but as soon as he realizes his pop is forte, the better. The film is not very bad ... mostly. I love the fact that LL Cool J got what appears to be a bullet in the guidance of a man. He deserves it. And, unlike his fellow musician and co-star, he can play. Kevin Spacei is almost always fun (you can see him sipping a few times while the landscape burns), and Freeman has the ability to raise this flick to three stars (out of ten ... he's not good). /> When everything is said and done, the ultimate mistake in this movie is that it's a mundane and boring piece of pseudo-action poppicock that fails to keep anyone up. He also does not manage to make someone remember anything of any character. All in all, it's just boring. If this is the case, rent it when you suffer from insomnia.
