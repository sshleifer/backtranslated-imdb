I love a good lovely story (and I'm a guy), but when I rented "Love Story", I prayed that the end was as fast and painless as possible and exactly the opposite of the character of Ali McGraw. But McGraw as Jennie alienated me and made me angry in fifteen minutes. When we find out that she was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, I could not help but wonder if her death would have been such a terrible loss for the poor Oliver, or if anyone watched this film at all was caring. If she had not died, her personality would probably push Oliver across the edge and eventually bring them to the divorce court. People love this movie, but it's one of the worst seventies.
