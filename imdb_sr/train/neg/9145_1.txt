Let me first say that I enjoy watching "bad" movies. It's weird that some of these movies leave a more lasting impression than the true tops. This film is bad in a disturbingly mean way. This means for self-satisfying ego Sam Mraoviƒç not only borders with helpless incapacity, but redefined the meaning of the word. This should always be a barometer for bad films. Some sort of Mendoza for the movie. Mr. Mraovich writes, directs and plays the dumb object of Arthur Sailes, who is fighting against the despised women and the Christian forces of evil as he and his partner Ben "are dead behind the eyes." As a libertarian, I believe that gays should be entitled to marriage. Ben and Arthur do more damage to this goal than the homophobia army. Showing all things that are Christian are so ugly and fake, the trademark Mraovich, that you can not take them seriously. Arthur's brother, Viktor, the Bible that seizes Jesus' fury, is so terribly evil / feminine gai that you have to wonder how he was thrown into this role. This is because Sam "multitasking" Mraovich was also a director. Worst of all, Sam Mraovich himself. When you think that the leading man thinks of these words, he is balmy and chubby? He also delivers lines like domino pizza, cold and usually wrong. Final shot: Sisate in writing, directing, acting and casting. That's Ed Vood's quadruple crown. Congratulations, you terrible little man.
