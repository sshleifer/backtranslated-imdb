A long time ago, in the mid-nineties, I wrote about DOKTOR who was a fanzine and the whole fandom kept breathing about the new American producer DOCTOR VHO TVM. As soon as it was announced that the doctor's enemy Master would be led by Eric Roberts, they all scratched their heads and shouted: "Who is Eric Roberts?" I should like to point out that this was before the IMDB came to the Internet when all you had to do was type in the name on this website in their summary, but one helpful soul wrote it in a publication I wrote to explain that Eric Roberts was best known for The Role in which he acted opposite F Murrai Abraham, the film was called by MOR and was a fencing school. In fact, looking back, Roberts is best known for the GREENVICH AND RUNAVAI TRAIN, but this did not stop the person who put the trunk in Roberts and SVORD, and his mind was invented so that this American master with his southern guidance was going to debakl. Strangely enough, many fans were furious because Roberts played the masters, but after seeing the DOCTOR VHO TVM, a large number of fans (themselves among them) thought Robertson's performance was the best thing about the disappointing US production <br /> <br /> /> To MY digressing but BI THE SVORD was a movie I wanted to see simply because it first heard the name of Eric Roberts, but I did not have the opportunity to see him this weekend and I was pretty disappointed. I do not know anything about fencing (everyone else on this site is obliged to mention whether it is a fence or not. I do not hide it) so I do not know how much this is true, but as the mentioned movie feels a little anachronous even if you saw it on his release in 1991, hairstyles appear to have been out of date for several years along with their mixed teenage actors who make a small dance routine, which makes you wonder if it would work much better if it was produced. Jerri Bruckheimer would have been in the mid-1980s. It could be said that this would mean that the relationship between Maca Suba and Alekander Villard was out of the center for most of the film, but I was not convinced of their relationship of love / hate, and Abraham and Roberts gave much better performance before and after.
