If this film was a comedy, I'd give it 10. Oh, where to start? Like this - I've seen many terrible horror films, but this makes Troll 2 look like a freak Saving Private Rian. It's as if a group of porn movies decided to make a horror movie, changed their minds in mid-production and decided to make a comedy, and then returned to horror, and then decided to just get stuck with the porn movie. Everything about this movie is simply horrible: music scores (someone kills the guy who invented the Yamaha keyboard), script, direction, cinema, acting. There is simply no word to describe. Wait, that there are: Holy $ *%!.
