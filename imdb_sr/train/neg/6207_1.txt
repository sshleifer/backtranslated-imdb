This film does what I would call the emotional rape of the viewer. The film allegedly caused great uproar among critics in Cannes, but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt to spot the newcomer. It's hardly a voice in the discussion of the problem of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue). The main figure is metamorphosis from a good, but troubled boy to the rapist's violent practically nonexistent, while the scene of rape (as an overly drawn, exaggerated version of the rape scene from an "orange satellites") is unbearable and I refuse to comment on its aesthetic values. There are some things that an artist should not do to try to achieve his goal. At least in my opinion. To end this: shockingly brutal, disgusting and DO NOT WANT YOUR TIME. Instead, look at the "Orange Clock" or "Le pianiste".
