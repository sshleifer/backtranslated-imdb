It's weird that less than 2 hours can look like a lifetime when you sit through such a flat, uncomfortable ball. If the story is as personal as it was allegedly Salli Potter, would not you expect some passion to be shown in her performance? Her acting was completely separate and I did not feel any chemistry between Salli and Pabla, and the scene of tango, which was supposed to be frenzied by the nature of dance, were instead unpleasant and painful to watch. Apparently, discovering such a personal story on the movie can be daunting, and as such, Salli Potter would be wise to allow the better actor to take on the task, not that her passion becomes a victim of her own shame.
