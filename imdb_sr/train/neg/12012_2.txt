The dialogue was pretty awesome. The action is not all that is inspired beyond the apparent turn of the present. It's not visually stunning. Actually visually inconvenient. Definitely one of those movies that will be easier to finish if you hold one finger on the rewind button in advance. If you could watch for free, you do not have absolutely any other options at this time and you really are digging to see a little poltergeist lady ... well, maybe I would recommend it to you but not to anyone else I can remember at this time.
