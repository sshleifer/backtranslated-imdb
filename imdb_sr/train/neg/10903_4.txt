Rob Schneider is a famous comedian for his movements, faces and performances "not people". This time the animal. Marvin is a loser trying to be a hero and one day, no one receives a call from the man who is attacked, so Marvin must take this case and save the attacked man. But on the way to the crime scene, he collapses with his car and becomes really damaged. He does not remember what is happening on the next ordinary day; his life is not the same when he finds out that he has animal instincts. Of course, we got our female who our main character tries to achieve, but his attempts are useless. She plays Collen Haskell. There are no negative signs. The negative character is destiny if I can use this metaphor. Marvin should find out how to become a normal human being again. Otherwise, his animal instinct helps him in some situations. Schneider's performance is so. The movie is so unrealistic that at some moments it becomes stupid, but that's one of those films, which are called senseless entertainment, as I wrote above. So watch him for Rob Schneider's monkey style, but this is definitely not one of the best comedies ever, or one of the best movies in which Schneider appears. He's a great comedian, but that's not his best movie.
