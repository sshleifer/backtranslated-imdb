I'm watching this movie right now on VTN because it was a channel that the TV was facing when I turned it on. It's not a very credible and quite boring story about minister's wife (Alekandra Paul) who lusted with a young pastur / lutali (with a toothpaste) played by Corei Sevier. It may or may not be complicated. Corei takes his shirt off quite a lot and Alekandra disappears. I have the feeling that he should be good, and that's why he is crying with thin Alekandra Paul. It's not important, because as I said, it takes a lot of shirts and I just saw the d√©colletes. There is a lot of saxophone on the soundtrack, which is just painful.
