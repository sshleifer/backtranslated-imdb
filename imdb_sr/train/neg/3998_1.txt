Can you say "All shock, no complication?" There were so many unexpected directions in the film. There was no history of a room other than death. * WHY was that evil? What was that? Why "Countdown"? Then unexplored things appeared; For example, we saw a camera in the ventilation hatch, which he mentioned. But when he climbed up, there was no camera. How about the fact that all ghosts looked "digital" and things "wink" before they hit the ground, creating static noise? Hmmm ... when you put all these things together, it makes room 1408 look like a hi-tech house. Except there was no continuation of it. Oh ... by the way ... electronics does not work in 1408. Well, apart from the TV ... the mobile phone has no signal, but the wireless Internet works well. How much incontinuity can you add? I'm sorry, but this film was nothing but "shock after shock". Everything was done earlier. Reflections in the mirror. Things are out of town. Change pictures. Blood walls. "Oh, it was all a dream ... no, it's not." And if the room was "evil", why would our main character agree to the death of his daughter, if that would have kept the prisoners there forever? It simply did not make sense. In addition, there was no background information about the "first book" he wrote. Only some unclear information about "Dad was a jerk" and so on. When we're with dad, what happened to his father? "You'll be in my place." All in all, really HORRIBLE movie. It was a 100% adrenaline shock factor, without any new or innovative effects, and certainly without a background story, character development, etc. My general impression is that the entire movie was shot at "Cheap"; pretty much using one set and a couple of snapshots of the location, and was nothing but a film effect from recycled, cheesy, "seen-before" effects.
