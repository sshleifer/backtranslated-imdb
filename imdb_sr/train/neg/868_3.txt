Instead, go to the zoo, buy peanuts and feed the monkeys. Monkeys are funny. People with amnesia who do not speak much, just sit there with empty eyes are not so funny. Black comedy? There is no black person in it, nor is any funny thing in it. Valmart somehow buys these things and puts them on a rack for the dollar. Unrated is marked. I think they took a scene in the toples. Maybe they got out other things, who knows? All we know is that everything they extracted does not exist anymore. The act seemed to me OK. There are many inconvenient things. Should it be a city? Should it be a big lake? If it's so hot in the church, people are crazy, why do they all wear coats?
