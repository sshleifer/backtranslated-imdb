... but the problem of this production is that it is very far from a good musical. Of course, one can not always expect witty masters such as Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; yet the music of this work even makes Andrew Lloyd Webb witty. It was deadly boring and uninventive (with one or two exceptions) and immediately after I watched it, I could not remember any significant melody - which is quite tragic of someone who has learned a whole hundred other people from three listening. It's also oddly non-theatrical. It happens on an incredibly large scene (it's really necessary to be pitied by those people in the front lines who broke their necks to see something that happened 50 meters to the right or 100 meters left) and do nothing with it. When there is one person singing on the stage, that's exactly what you get - and the rest of the huge stage is empty. It was almost painful for me to be an ambitious theater director. The fact is that Kol Porter seems to have caught the French culture in his works better than these non-talents can come nearer. And I'm baffled by the popularity of this potentially legendary musical.
