"Valentine" is another horror movie that is added to the list of movies (think "Halloween", "Friday 13.", "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer"). It's certainly not as good as those movies I wrote about, but it's better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first "Friday of the 13th" film. One of these films was a Canadian clip from 1981, "We Bloodi Valentine," which I hated very much. "Valentine" is a better movie than that, but does not speak much. Action: A young boy who is reluctant to pronounce and jokes a few of his colleagues at the beginning of the film. Then the film moves years later, when your colleagues grew up, and then they picked up one by one. It is assumed that the killer is a young man who has now grown up in search of vengeance. But is that him? Or could it be someone else? "Valentine" has an attractive role in which Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marlee Shelton, Jessica Capshav and Katherine Heigl are. They do what they can with the material they have, but the inefficient script does not actually do them. However, there are some terrifying moments. ** (out of four)
