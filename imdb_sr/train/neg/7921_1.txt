The Corpse Grinders 2 action is very similar to the original Corpse Grinders, what's left of the other movie is strange aliens. I believe this film will be # The worst movie on IMDb - if someone really watched it. The action is interrupted and in some (too many) cases it makes no sense. It's a real wonder why this sequel came about in such an unsuccessful and horrible (but somewhat better) movie. I would highly recommend this movie if you like to watch terrible movies for good laughter.
