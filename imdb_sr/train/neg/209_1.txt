I could never watch Happi Dais after Chachi joined the actors, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this film was Scott Baio (scateboard Chase Scene!). In her first "adult" role, Jodie Foster turns into a normal professional performance, but this is not an excuse for this boring mess. Two hours from my life I will never return! Without significant characters, incredible stories, questionable editing and horrible cinema, but worst of all, I could no longer worry. A story about California teenagers in the 1970s, where children live poorly and all their parents are idiots. Do not waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.
