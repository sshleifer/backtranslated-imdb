Although this is mostly a stupid adventure jungle movie, it has some highlighted points - the settings are pretty nice, and the tempo of the adventure is good. You will not be bored to watch it. Keith is the brightest possible player who leads the eponymous track, an impeccably drunken jungle guide shanghai'd accompanied by a wealthy boyfriend Van Hofman and his beautiful wife Shower at the expedition's expedition in the Cannibal country. He never takes serious things. Shower is like a decoration, and Keith is intensively used - she does not really have much to behave. She is not the only woman to show her body, and sharp aspects of the film make it half way to the T / A image. In this film there is nothing that would attract special attention to it, or far from it. Produced to be shlock, works without too much noise. A good 2 AM cable programmer.
