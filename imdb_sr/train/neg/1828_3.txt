I watched "Envy" two nights ago, on a DVD, in a friend's house. The premise of this film is quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential, but completely fails. I watched him with about five friends and nobody laughed for the whole movie. Jokes (which are few and far) are NOT funny in any way ... the story is shit, and they never answer the question ... WHERE SH * T GO? Of course, the answer to this is NO ONE AID. This film has no value in comedy, and as several other users have said that the only thing that makes it virtually valuable is Christopher Valken as J-man. None of the characters has been developed, the plots are so thin that it's almost transparent - and is that song a funny movie during the whole movie?
