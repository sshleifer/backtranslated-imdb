****** SPOILERS ****** unfunded Radio Quiz host Kiser and his central band are an excuse for Lugosiem, Karloff, and Lorra to pick up the pay in this mild, controversial watch under stress . Lugosi is a mystic whose seances are exposed as a false attempt to appropriate inheritance; Karloff is a butler, and Lorre is a professor who exhibits false media, but it turns out that both are plotting with Lugosi. Of course, Kai Kiser and his 30-year-old "kids" reveal the truth with the least possible humor along the way. It is not recommended to anyone except an absolute harasser.
