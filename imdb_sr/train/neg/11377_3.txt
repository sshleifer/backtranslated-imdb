OK. To begin with, the taxi driver is incredible. This, this is not a taxi or incredible. that's bad. but I thought it was very funny, which means he had some features. as a dialogue ... wow. there were more or less complications, the characters were all stupid, and the film was insightful. there were places where I thought the movie would dive into the type of taxi driver's violence, which would be much more difficult at the end of the film. I can not even believe there are 20 more people who saw this movie. Yes, it's worth watching if it's really boring and you want to confirm the fact that anyone can shoot a movie, or at least try it.
