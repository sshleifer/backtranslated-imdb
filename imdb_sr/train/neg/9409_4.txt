I like this show! I do not think there was anything wrong with it! Only Spidey does not hit anyone, but only because the show is not bullshit! Some people just think this performance is bad for that. The story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared as X-Man, Punisher, Daredevil, and Iron Man! That Sandman never appears, but I like it! Best Spidei shov ever !! My favorite episodes are: 1. Turning Point 2. Spider Vars 3. The Hobgoblin 4. The Alien Costume 5. Mutant Agenda But there are some episodes that were really bad as: Rocket Racer and The City that was embarrassing to watch. And I do not like Morbius and Hydro Man. The first Morbius sucks plasma instead of blood and I do not like the vampire. And it irritates me that he was almost the chief criminal in season 2. Of course, I have to mention the Hydro Man! He was terrible! I'd rather see Sandman! His last appearance was so terrible. And I do not like Spidey like a spider man! But I guess it's all bad than this!
