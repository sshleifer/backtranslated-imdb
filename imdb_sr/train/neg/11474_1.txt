This relic of a short film begins with the teenager going through the process of trying to get a driver's license. He quickly turns around with every conceivable topic that relates to cars. Talk about such things as long buggies, expensive racing, custom paint jobs and auto shov. He often tries to be humorous, but instead the film is boring, withdrawn, and even sexist. None of the people in the movie actually do not hear. Instead, everything is done in narration and voice. I'm sorry, but I can not stand it. There is nothing instructive or interesting about "Dad, can I borrow a car?". It's just another piece of a senseless filler that takes time at their Vonderful Vorld Of Disney show. 1/10
