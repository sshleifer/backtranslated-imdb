What is left of Planet Earth is inhabited by a few poor and hungry survivors. They have to eat bugs and insects, or anything else, after a poisonous war, or something like that, almost completely erased all human civilization. In these dark times, one of the few people on earth who is still able to live comfortably, we will call him the Supreme Grand Boss, he has a great quest to prevent some secret seed of the dispute into the air. It seems that the Supreme Being is the last person on Earth who knows that there are disputes. Spores are far from any living soul and are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. Anyone who knows The Great Chief wants the secrets of disputes to stay in their secret-protected containers. So, he plans to send a Cat Action Team to remove spore containers from all security systems and secret locations. Sending people to a secret dispute is no secret. Sending people to disable all protective systems allows spores to be easily released into the air. How about letting dogs sleep ?! One nice feature of ENCRIPT is the shiny and elegant Vivian Vu. Since the inconspicuous members of the Cat Action Team lower down with a mechanical pace predictable time, engaging the charm of Vivian Vu makes an acceptable idea of ​​its old employer that he so wishes. She is the subject of love, the object of desire - a very convincing concept! RUSH. DINNER RUSH is recommended. ENCRIPT is not.
