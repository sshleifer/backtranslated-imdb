I wondered why John Wood did not play Doctor Falken until I watched the movie. Poor story, bad science, bad acting and bad movie at all. Please do not watch this movie. Rent original "war games" if you feel nostalgic. I did not like the bending of the action to win the idea of ​​a terrorist threat. The first film, V.O.P.R, was created because Russia had 1,000 warheads directed to the United States. On the side of politics, one of the good things about the first movie was to emphasize that even a stupid computer can understand the idea of ​​the pointlessness of the war at the end. This film does not offer such an insight.
