I grew up watching Inspector Gadget. He was, and still is, one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from Field Trip. I wanted to slip on the banana bark and become the greatest detective ever. But the film has ruined the reputation of a beautiful cartoon film. Matthev Broderick, actor with potential, was definitely not the role of Inspector Gadget. First - in the film, the Inspector Gadget is smart. Not in a cartoon. In the Gadget film, I solve the mystery myself. In a cartoon, it's almost always Penny, Brain and a terrible book (I still want her book!). If the Gadget solved the mystery, it was a coincidence. The gadget in the movie looks like a competent detective, but in a cartoon it was pretty stupid, where humor came from. Another thing is that it's too "Good Gui v. Bad Gui". in the movie. Does not mean it's just a dumb cartoon on Saturday morning. Also, the Gadget should never have a love story, but Disnei Corporation is full of idiots. I also miss the real gadgets that the Gadget had, and especially the Gadget Car. The movie was a chic convertible. In a cartoon, it was a limousine police car that could turn into a van. He hardly had any gadgets and was mostly there to take him from place to place. But, if nothing else, the only thing that was terrible in the movie was that it was a feature film. Inspector Gadget was a stupid cartoon on Saturday morning. The film was too serious, too excessive, too complicated, and was not even funny. EVER. Watch the cartoon, it's a real classic.
