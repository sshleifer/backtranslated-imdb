I've seen (too) many shifts from this company - this is around the middle of the package. One is a good side, a little more stylized and under the control of some of them - less than sophomoric attempts of humor and more attachment to the story (for what is worth). Many of their titles, such as Seki Sikth Sense, are buried with baaaad performances and amateur sensibility. On the other hand, I've found simulated sexual scenes that are not as hot as some of their other shifts (such as Vampire Vikens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mistress Frankenstein). Misti Mundae is always 10 Petar meter, as well as Darian Caine. Barbara Joice found something hot in school, and Ruby LaRocca is a sexy little hottie. Watch this with the remote control firmly in your (free) hand, the night you need a break from porn. Do not waste your time trying to check the story - you have better things to do your life. It's not a movie, it's pure T & A, but it's not bad on that standard.
