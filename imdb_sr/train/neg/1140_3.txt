It's terrible, but mostly in the sense that it will be over before I reach the age of 70. I saw it as a late night ride around 1976 and I thought it would never end. Like a cracker, it's better than nothing (or just). Rai Milland is a bit daunting because it looks like it was filled with a preparer. Ivette Mimeuk seems to have smoked all the beautiful Dovntovn Burbank Brovn. This is the Roi Rogers version of Rosemary's Babi. This is a party that should never have been made. If you have insomnia and it's 1:30 on Saturday morning and there's nothing but a repetition of the 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship, then I think it's better. But God will help if this is your only choice for fun.
