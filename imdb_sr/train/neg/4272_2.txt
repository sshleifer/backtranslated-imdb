Such films in which the psycho of one or another type attempts to damage the reputation (and possibly completely eliminates) some naive person to take over their life. Fatal Attraction, Pacific Heights, A Hand That Raises the Cradle, A White Woman and a thousand movies made for TV are some of the examples of this. But, although several, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights, can offer at least some extreme paranoid, uncertain characters or several complications, illegal entry plays all over the book. And if there were no famous stars (Kurt Russel, Rai Liota and Madeline Stove), this film would sink into the middle of the faster than the miniseries of Danielle Steele. a naive guy who calls on two officers when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stove). Unfortunately, he quietly opens his anger about the feeling of helplessness in a situation for the wrong policeman (Rai Liotta), a typical psychopathic criminal without the limit of his power. When empathy with Carrom (probably just pretending to be so), a cop fights with a couple. But soon, policemen want Carr to pull the road, destroying the lives of the guys almost in any way (which is quite easy when you are a policeman, and when you are a policeman who installed the security system of a guy in his house) to take over and assume, wife. It seems less oriented to the ends, and more like a policeman just wants to prove his power. In other words, the woman is more like a trophy than the end. And the story is fully reproduced by the book, you can probably predict each occurrence before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these movies. From the "shocking" moment, our main, naive character realizes that he is a victim of credit card fraud (committed by a psychopathic criminal) to the end of a non-real-dead final.
