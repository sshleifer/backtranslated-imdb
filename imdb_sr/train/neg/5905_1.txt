You do not see this. This was one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. It's hard to be Mormon sometimes when there are movies like this. What a sad look at the Mormon life. I can tell you whether you saw this movie that it was not at all in a single department. If so, I do not think I could get through. It's a pity that most Mormon movies are a real group of geeks who have nothing better. The acting was so bad that we were my wife and I barely managed. I guess we could say that he had all the signs of B film. or are there C movies? in any case ... I just thought this film was sucked and full of cheese. I would like some mormons to start making high quality movies.
