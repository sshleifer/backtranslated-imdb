In this film, I have not practically seen any redeemable properties. The only thing I've seen was Quentin Tarantin's crazy obsession for that ... There were some attractive women in this movie and maybe that's a decent quality. All in all, this film is surreal and funny. Manually making films combined with slow motion and other movie tricks I found clumsily and dizzy, even painfully. Overall, the music was horrible and repetitive to the extreme, reminding me of the US military's psychological war against various dissatisfied. unresolved in its content and "conclusions." Depressive film (not a real movie, an expression I hold for true art) that left me with a bad feeling. Do not trust the various people who are trying to turn this into a "romantic comedy", although there are surely isolated elements of both films, which reject content, form, and conclusion of any connection with this genre. suggest that you stay away, despite seemingly immense positive views on IMDb and other sources of assessment.
