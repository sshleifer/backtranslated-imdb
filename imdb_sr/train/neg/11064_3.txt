Well, it's hard to add a comment after reading what's already here, but I think I have to say something. I was not just asking for a 'splatterfest' like somebody puts or even 'blood and guts / up'. I have respect for the relatives of the victims, although I really felt that the film was not. - They were nameless, impersonal and meaningless. Just a dish for Dahers's sexual antiquities. I watched this movie with a morbid curiosity that made me think: "What makes a guy a serial killer?" as well as to wonder about the specifics of Dahmer's story, which I know very little about. It seems that people here think that the film did not have to cover the events of the Dahmer story. his history, what happened when he was caught, the consequences, etc. but it's important! You see, I assume that if you are Americans, you will know all this. We do not all live in America. To tell this story about such a man as he was obviously, he asks that at least some of the history and actual events are told / shown. This does not mean blood and bravery, there are ways to portray terrible things in the film by implicitly or smartly shooting without resorting to the above. Even when he did not touch what he did (I learned more about reading the user comments on this site!), The film felt like a void. A moment in time with very little substance. I would like to know if there is a movie about REAL DAHMER, because with its lack of direction, a VERY slow pace that NEVER changes, Strange portrait of homosexuality and a VERY unfortunate lack of any attempt to end, this film is POOR. I would not recommend to anyone that they spend the time needed to watch it. Definitely 1 out of 10 (for acting!)
