This is just a joke of film, they've lost me in the introductory scene (Spoilervarning), the dangerous creature kills the other creature in his cage, this is seen by a scientist working there on the monitor and guessing what he is doing, so we go to the cage to check things, how stupid they are writers think that human beings came in the same way as they jumped into the aquarium with a large white shark because it ate the goldfish ... Pretty useless and even stupid and I will not even talk about the actors because they are not worth the effort. why they did not fire the guy who wrote it right away is a mystery to me ..... And this kind of stupidity continues the whole movie. Just a good thing where cgi is better than the average for these low-budget films. If these things do not bother you to see them, but be warned if your IK above 60 will probably hate it.
