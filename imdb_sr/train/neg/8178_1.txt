Did you ever sit watching a movie when it was 20 or 30 minutes and suddenly you realized that you actually already watched the movie? It happened to me "Young graduates". The cover of the video box, if you can find the video, is extremely deceptive. I would swear that the two women on the cover are not in the film. In any case, or I was born a decade too late to appreciate the finer points of this movie or ... it's simply meaningless trash. I very much bowed to this other, but I suppose some of them have developed a relationship with this film. Hmm ... complication. Conspiracy. Let's see ... somewhere there must be a plot. No, I can not find him. It's quite that some of the older high school students are doing nonsense and drugs and speaking in a language that has been outdated decades ago. One of the students is in love with her teacher. The teacher has a frigid wife (which she really calls an iceberg), so she is receptive to the girl's progress. It has a lot of driving and meaningless dialogue and a lot of spastic dance. Our cat, BooBoo, was enchanted with high school dancers. She watched with incredible intensity as the dancers wobbled and shivered on the dance floor. It's nice to see that at least one species found something interesting in this relic. 1/10
