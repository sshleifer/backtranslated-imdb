Something had to be terribly wrong at a time when the director noticed this plot. The film, which was supposed to be a remake of one of the most favorite movies in the cinema, fails to deliver in every aspect of film creativity. The best artists also could not pick up a tuning, which simply shows that the film itself was a big mistake. Edit is poor. The direction is bullshit. The acting is beyond this world (omg)! Characters that should look terrifying force people to laugh at the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes. A free hamburger with her.
