A potential film extravaganza, created during the 19th century, failed to produce. With great actors such as Maggie Smith, Albert Finnei and many others, there was no reason for the film to collapse. However, the film lacked the end, a sad excuse for the tricky line, and fell into pieces with its continuity. A typical story of a rich girl and poor boy, merged by love and destroyed by beauty (or lack thereof) and disapproval, has a touching side of an early mother's death and a father in the absence. The father, played by Finnei, is a disturbed man, torturing his daughter in life, as well as death. He believes that the lack of a good look of his daughter will ruin his wealth by marrying under their social status. The actors tried in vain to save what was left of the story. The Washington Square is a black hole of ruin and destruction, spending the precious time of those who look sad. I am giving this film 1 instead of 0, purely for the actors' attempts. Save yourself, do not get closer to the Washington Square.
