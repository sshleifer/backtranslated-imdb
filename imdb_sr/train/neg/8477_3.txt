Personally, I hated this film because it was predictable, the characters were stereotyped, and the whole idea was torn off "The Cutting Edge" and "Cadet Kelli". The main character is a girl who gets to a place where she does not belong. The whole place hates, and things get worse, there's a hot guy that she does not seem to like (it's good that the whole damn school can not stand you). It's astonishing to find a way to fit in and make everyone love her, telling a man to fall in love with her. Then there is a choice where she has to choose between skating and hockey. She picked up a hockey, then went to the skating national, and began to be in the Olympic team. There is no real surprise there. Full of this film was so damn predictable. You knew what would happen before you even saw him. It was so terrible that I almost threw out, and when I finished watching it, I had a terrible headache and the need to kill myself to watch such shit. Do not watch this unless you're under ten, or you actually like shitty movies.
