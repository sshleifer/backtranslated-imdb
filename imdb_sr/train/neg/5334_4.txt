After a few lean years, 1968 was a very interesting moment for Elvis: not only did he celebrate "Comeback" TV Special, he became a father and acted in two pretty decent films? SPEEDVAI AND LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE. Therefore, I personally can forgive him the wrong step that was STAI AVAI, JOE, which at best appears as an interesting flipping jump and is not that bad due to that. Of course, Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell are really embarrassing? As an important, Indian father and Elvis character and engages a bartender who has an eye on Mr. Presley too - but one is pleased to see Elvis surrounded by top veteran Hollivood talent such as Kati Jurado (like Meredith is a Mexican woman), your Jones ?? Henry and L.K. - and Thomas Gomez, who is especially fun as a sarcastic boss Thundercloud, who is Meredith's stubborn father who still dresses his old chief today! Although there is a surprising (if not undesirable due to the usual tenderness) lack of songs, it seems that there are no missing free party parties that the male Indians have repeatedly hit the bottle while Presley practiced his marital ability behind his back! As you can expect, the typical 'western' landscape of Arizona is the main advantage here, and the drowsy snoring of the bull is not only good but also the main point of the plot. On the other hand, the climatic 'destruction of the house' episode is what we've often seen and does not work too well here ...
