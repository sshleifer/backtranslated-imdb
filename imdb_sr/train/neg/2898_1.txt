Vovvvvvv, an hour ago, I finally finished watching this horrible movie !!! I wanted to turn it off within the first 10 minutes, but I thought I would give him a chance because he just had to be better. Or at least they have some redeeming qualities, as I thought at least there would be some sort of film, either really intelligent, or very well recorded or something like that ... Needless to say, it was not the case and lost about an hour and a half of life. I will not even understand why this is terrible, because it's my waste of time to explain that this "can contain a spoiler" ... IMDb, you should calm down on the things of the spoiler and pay more attention to making sure that people who rate the movies and comments that they do not pay to write good reviews or somehow get involved in a movie or anything else. I thought it would be humorous after this terrible film that will come to see how bad the score was and I was very shocked to see pretty high scores ... all grades with about 7-10 stars obviously have to be about some COMPLETELY DIFFERENT film .. I'm still a big IMDb fan, but I seriously consider this appraisal process because this film should be rated no higher than maaaibbbeee like 3.
