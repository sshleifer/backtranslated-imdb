An extremely terrible story I can barely say. The best part of the film was when one of the victims of the murder appeared in the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again. There is a chance that I missed some key elements of the plot, because I may have been in a coma for as long as this baby was. The box in which the movie appears shows the scenes that are never in the movie. I am impressed by the crude images of torture related to slavery and promises of "Eurobasket, sexy horror". I have the feeling that it was a budget version and that one quarter of the film was omitted. All good things are more than likely. I added the PG-13 plug-in that made sense as the end of the new film 'Planet of the Apes'. Watch this with a friend and a bottle of hard things. You'll need it.
