Joe Don Baker. He was great at "Valking Tall" and had a good part in "Goldene", but here in "Final Justice" all the hopes disappeared ... the dark side won. Like most people, my main experience with this was on MST3K, and what was the experience! Mike and robots dig their claws deep into Baker's abundant flesh and completely shake this momentum. Obviously, they just started with "Mitchell" on their anti-Joe Don kick, and that's where their continuation is on the topic. Still, it's a funny experience: there are many election riffs. My favorites - "John Rhis-Davies for Sale", "It's" Meatloaf: Tekas Ranger "", "none of them is worthy of a sponge", "Why was she wearing her dress for a supper in bed," and my favorite - " "The son of ..." "What? What was he a son: the son of the MAN? "" The Final Justice "itself, as Joe Don puts in the film," a big fat hope ". But here, it actually has some fun value. You get an opportunity, grab the OVU version of "Final Justice". Two stars for "Final Justice". Ten for the MST3K version ONLY. Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don is in town.
