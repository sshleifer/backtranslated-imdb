this movie is just an excuse for the writer to make a movie of 2 failed scenarios. His characters are merely a set of characters with clichical tragic or comical attributes whose total sum of the neurotic dialogue is only wooden Allen could write. The woman loves this because she looks like a mirror so she will enjoy this film, probably this movie did not enjoy me, because there was no automobile hit, and the film had no fight. there were no masters of drugs or gangs either. Not to mention the lack of snakes. This film did not have a snake. Not my cup of tea and maybe not your ether, so think about what I said before you see that you are watching this movie. Unless, of course, you look like a feminine person, weight problems enjoy sex and the city and ally mcbeal then this is meaningful to you.
