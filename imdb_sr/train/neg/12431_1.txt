I'd like to say that curiosity got the best. If I only saw a trailer, I could tell you the entire story of the movie; I could save myself for half an hour and forty minutes in my life, and twenty dollars. This film was a catastrophe waiting to happen, and it's a disgrace to Hollywood. The film shows vividly ignoring reality. For example, a racing car on remote control of this child goes everywhere in the neighborhood, and even enters this house. It's even covered with clothes. Is it not rational to believe that the remote can no longer transmit a signal under these circumstances? Hollywood obviously did not believe it. The common logic and every concept of electronics dictate the contrary; I doubt that a racing car could even reach the street, let alone houses across the street. Another unrealistic feature is the lack of intelligence that criminals possess. Why are these criminals rocket scientists in all these films until they find the eight-year-olds? The kid should be the most intelligent person in the film instead of professional terrorists? Please, there are more realities in the Matrix. Also, the leader descends his real gun and "accidentally" takes a plastic pistol; Obviously, he could not distinguish the difference. Even with gloves, it should be able to. Just because they look the same does not mean anything; others have heard then sight. Traps are unrealistic; If any of them really worked, criminals would be dead. But Hollywood intends to "laugh" at the "funny" results of the traps. I did not laugh; I sighed and kissed my eyes. But I recommend this film to anyone who thinks he's seen a really bad movie; The film they see will look like Citizen Kane in relation to this one. Otherwise, skip this because of your pride. Alone in house 3 also asks the question. We all know Alek D. Linz stars in the movie, but did he write it too?
