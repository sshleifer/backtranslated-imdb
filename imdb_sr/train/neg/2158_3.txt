Now I can clearly see why Robin Hood jumped quickly. The first episode is probably the worst thing the BBC broadcast. The initial scenes were so intense, meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys fought, Robin Hood had no character, and the fight with the sword was just funny. The worst part of the episode was Robin Hood, who at the beginning of the episode swallowed a cow dressed in makeup - how many people wore a pencil for the eyes of the 12th century? No one. The series may have been drastically improved since then, but this first episode quickly dropped hopes of people, and essentially a pile of cr * p. The great hero of England is embarrassed. <br /> <br /> "Will you tolerate it?" I will not, it's safe, unless the BBC starts to understand what a wise investment is. 3/10
