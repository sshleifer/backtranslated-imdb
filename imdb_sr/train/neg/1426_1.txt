One question: Why? First, the premise is not funny or not at all interesting. They use recorded interviews and take sounds to make animations with animals talking parts. Firstly, the interviews are not funny or fun to start, and even if they are, I'm sure it would be much more fun to watch them as if they were original without being turned into cartoons. How does it add some joy? I turned CBS's sitcom series on Monday night (which became a regular way to relax after a busy Monday working day) and found this. Of course, the series for the sitcom would have been a reprise anyway, and that would be a year, but watching these episodes again would be more fun. I tried to give the chance to "CC". I really am. When it started, I thought, well, it might be funny. Nope. And then he went on. It's been a long half an hour. I can almost see if there is a purpose, if the interviews are presented as a whole, and they pointed to them. But no, they were just line clips, cut and glued very fast. It was like a terrible horrible version of the "Robot Chicken" Cartoon Network. I was not a fan of CBS's now canceled series "The Class". While it was, there was a half an hour on which I would fight. But if everything comes down to the fact that I've decided the entire season or three more episodes of "Creatures" .... let's just say "take" Class. Given that it has been a couple of hours since it was broadcast, I come here to see how I first commented ... I guess it's a good sign that nobody watched it, and it will not last much longer. Cartoon roadkill.
