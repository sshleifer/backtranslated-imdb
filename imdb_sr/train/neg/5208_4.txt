This mini-series, also based on Alec Haley's book, like "Kueen", tried to use similar formulas, i.e. Building a long history that monitors family life over many years. While in the 'Queen' the result was masterful, here in Mama Flori there is inspiration missing. First of all, perhaps in the book itself and certainly in this TV production. Too much is accumulating over the years, so the saga that takes place is shallow, superficial, and not as authentic as in the 'Queen'. A complete assessment of the scene in the earlier parts of the film, which was prepared with great care, but as the film progressed, seemed to degenerate into a kind of dallasian-forsithian delusional mixture in the last third of three hours. I was hoping yet; but apparently, Haley was less inspired by this story than his "biographical" Kueen, and Peter Verner III is not for John Erman. It is recommended only to those who have an appetite for this long story of growing up generations.
