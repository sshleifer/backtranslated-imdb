This was a really insane movie. The performances are the third in a row, and the dialogue is so persistent that sometimes it seemed to be just overturning and dying. My reason for renting was simple: Find a scripting script. I needed visual help for the presentation, so I figured out why not use a piston? I made a mistake. After I searched my local video store, I encountered this, where it was dubiously dubbed "Starstruck." I thought, "What is hey," and decided to try. Well, I was very dissatisfied with my results. Perhaps I could use one scene, and in the meantime I practically fell asleep because of the ordinary banality of the film. Well ... ... I took this back and picked up Ed Wood. There is a movie that I can use as an example. Then again, everything would be noticeable in comparison with the stink that is "Starfucker".
