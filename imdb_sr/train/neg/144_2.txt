There is no way to describe how this film really, really, really bad. It's a shame that I was actually going through this movie, this very tedious and predictable movie. What's wrong with that? Play: There is no performance that is even close or parallel (at least everyone is very pretty). Soundtrack (songs): "If we get the Orgy on a soundtrack then everyone will know they are watching a horror movie!"; Soundtrack (score): Okay, but everyone with the keyboard can make a good soundtrack these days. Do not even start me at "What the hell?" Here are a few: Killer can move at the speed of light - the door opens the actress turns, no one is there, turns, something is in front of it; From here, where the killer appears with an electric drill, it's really big! Movie creators get points for at least inclusion, but can they really believe that the killer took the time to find the socket to turn it on. Where did you get an electric drill? I could go further on how bad this film is, but I only have 1000 words. I'll give this 2 out of ten stars. One star that laughed at me and another star for the whole décolleté. Seriously, do not waste time with this.
