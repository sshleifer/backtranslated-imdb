After the success of Scooby-Doo, Vhere are Iou, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggi their show. But unfortunately, they added a new character that has always spoiled Scooby-Doo's success. They invented a new show with a new title, Scooby and Scrappi-Doo. This Scrappi-Doo made this shov a complete failure, probably for both adults and children together. Scrappi was a stupid brave puppy who always seemed ready to beat someone. Scooby and Shaggi were afraid of the villains, and they also tried to stop him. Scooby Doo does not need a little boring puppies. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they should either have killed or never imagined Scrappy. This was just poor, maybe your kids will love that more!
