After finishing watching "Trance" or "Eternal," or whatever the producers call this film, I wondered: "Of all the bad films that I could see, could not I at least see the one that Was it fun? "Even if the film is not well-made in terms of acting, directing, writing, or what you have, it can be at least fun and therefore worth the effort. But not only is this film bad in artistic value, it is also incredibly boring. For a complication of such skinnyness, it moves very slowly, with little dramatic tension. At the very least, in a weak attempt at fun, the death of characters could have been cool and / or bloody, but the creators of this shit failed in that department. Is this movie going for it? Pretty nothing, unless you get a fun watch of Christopher Valken, who is capable of being brilliant, put so little effort into acting as a parody (WHY he still decided to do this?) <Br /> < > I give this movie 3/10 because, God help us, there was actually a worse film.
