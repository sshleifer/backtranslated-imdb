One really unforgettable part of this otherwise quite boring and lukewarm British kitchen is Steiner's wash hose, one of the worst colors ever. That, and the magnificent eyebrow crawler on an old evil guy who was trying to steal Steiner's invention. MST3K makes an amazing job of making boring boring and gray film. I especially like it when Clov kills Mike with his "touch of death," and when he is brought to life in the theater, Mike cries: "Boys, I've died, I've seen it". it's this movie ... "It would be a disappointment, I have to go back from the afterlife to watch the rest of the Projection Man." A movie could sell wealth as a sleeping aide. Some of the movies in the movie were evil: the police inspector - "electric shock!" The roof- "Shocking, is not it?" police inspector ... "That's LOve, okay" Tom Servo ... "Very low, right down!" police inspector ... "May I continue?" Tom Servo - "He's dead, but knocked out" MST3K is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer.
