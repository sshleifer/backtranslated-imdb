I watched this movie for a love project. please tell Nicolas Cage to find out what his character would be, and then read the words he says again. My life can not continue ... I accidentally cut off my hand ... my brother was close. Obviously his mistake. And since then, the happy endings have also included a good guy who is worried about mom mournfully and alone. There is no shutdown, bad scenario, and there is not enough expansion of smaller characters. Save yourself, unless you're funny. The carries were carried out appropriately, and the stats did a fantastic job. I'm sure it would be a fun movie, but to be more specific to the genre, I can not recommend this film to anyone I know, because it's not an intellectual film. It's not a fish. It's not a strict romantic. And I can not show to children about sex and the issues that should follow. All in all, it's just not a good blow.
