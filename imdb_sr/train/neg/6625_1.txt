This is the first time I'm writing a comment on a movie on IMDb. but I had to write this for this. three hours of irresistible torture. From the start, you get the idea that the movie will be bad. The acting is pathetic. I am a big fan of Ajay Devgan (he loved him in bhagat singh), but he is the worst in this movie. Amitabh seems to have been working hard for this, but somehow he is missing out on fear. prashant paradise is not an actor. and the irritating part of the film is nisha kothari. I have no idea why the director led her in this film. the background score is repeated. I somehow felt that the ram tried to repeat the sarcasm, the color theme, the background, the corners of the camera, but failed. PLEASE DO NOT watch
