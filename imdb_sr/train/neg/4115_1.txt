"Pover Plai" starts interesting, but quickly descends down the hill. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and he has a very small part. In addition to Bell, Pover Plai has no value or interest. Puerto Plata has more earthquakes in a few days than California has in a year. The earthquake scene in the mall is so fictitious and totally incredible. And all action scenes look like a bunch of third-class players who play. It's terrible, simply awful. In the extreme, if the "Pover Play" made in the 60's or 70's, it would be considered a bad movie "B" class. The fact that "Pover Plai" was made in 2001 is really sad. Is there anything like a movie "D"? If so, "Pover Plai" throws a mold.
