Rock star John Norman Howard (Chris Kristofferson) turns singer-songwriter Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into a night-singing star. Esther's star rises as John goes down, thanks to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John makes a self-destructive-red-convertible-160-MPH-crack-up-on-desert-highway. The best thing about this movie is music, especially the song "Evergreen". Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can not grasp her seriously as an upcoming star when she's already * a star. The first time he appears, sings in the back street bar, he looks like a well-established star of a nightmare singing star, not as fighting an unknown who tries to start his singing career. She's too self-confident, too professional. Her apartment looks like a page from "Apartment Living", not in an apartment in which a real singer is going to live. Chris Christofferson manages the selfish, out-of-control role of rock stars as ... well, as a singer who is trying to be an actor, but there are not many acting talents. The direction is lukewarm, the story is slow and boring. But the worst thing in this movie is not acting, neither direction, nor slow story. It's hair! After staring at Christofferson's and Streisand's hair style in the 70's for 2 hours, your eyes hurt you.
