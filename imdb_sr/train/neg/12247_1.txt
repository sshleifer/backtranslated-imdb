This movie is really awesome. Terrible as it's losing 84 minutes of your life. Special effects are so terrible. The acting was not convincing. About the crocodile that attacks spectators while filming a documentary about "surfing the blood". Blood-surfing is surfing around the shark, but it seems terribly wrong when the 31-meter crocodile breaks off this holiday. Sharks do not look real. The Crocodile is even worse and becomes even more pathetic when it flees from the creature, but the crocodile stuck and the two females burn it. Deaths are fake, and pirates just fill the time. Senseless, horrible movie that is not worth the attention !!
