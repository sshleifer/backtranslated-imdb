This does not really match the Castle of Cagliostro. The lupine is not so ridiculous or unwanted or hyperactive. Scenarios and music are not inspired and the plot simply is not interesting. The only good thing about this is nudity (only in an uncut version) provided by Fujiko. This helped spice up some boring scenes. CoC had a huge villain and set up a movie for some imaginative kits. Locations in TSoTG are not very clear or interesting. Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen do not even offer a decent party this time. As if they were just fulfilling their contractual obligation by appearing. DVD is in full frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of accessories, including a lot of trailers. But one strange thing. There is no chapter selection on the drive or time code that is displayed on the device. Although you can still go to the next scene using the remote control.
