I am a Catholic who teaches nuns in parish elementary schools, taught by Jesuit priests in high school and college. I am still a Catholic practitioner, but I would not consider myself "a good Catholic" in the eyes of the church, because I do not believe in certain things, or I behave in a certain way just because the church tells me. to the film ... it's bad because this monk killed two people who are supposed to be a satire as an embodiment of a female religious personality. There is no comedy in it, and satire does not go well with Diane Keaton. I've never seen a show, but if it was very different from these movies then it might be good. First I thought that the gun could be a fake and the first shot of all the plans by the female water of four former students as an attempt to show the emotional and intellectual intolerance of the sister Mary's. But it turned out that the bullets were real and that the story was a tragedy ... the tragedy of loss of life (except for the two former students ... the lives of aborted babies, the life of a pupil's mother), the tragedy of dogmatic authority over people's love, the tragedy of an organized religion that replaces true faith in God. This is what is wrong with today's Islam, yesterday's Judaism and Christianity.
