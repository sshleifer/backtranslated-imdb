Not an existing action, tons of badly-directed / super-cheesy scenes (Snipers / world famous shooters who can not even hit their targets a few meters away? Plus what's happening with the end? ---> Bunch of laws that vandalize the carnival shooting gallery? VTH ?), technical errors (how many bullets you can fit into a 100+ magazine?) These people shoot guns without the need for recharging). The film is so bad that even a higher Hollywood actor like Michael Biehn (Aliens, Terminator) can not save this garbage. Do not watch this movie (I realized I lost some 100 minutes on this one). I hope the director will either stop filming, or will learn more about his next film.
