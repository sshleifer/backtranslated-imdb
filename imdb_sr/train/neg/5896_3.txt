One missed call, another Asian-based horror based on a mobile phone. I recently rented a Korean horror movie based on a mobile phone called "Mon". One missed call was just as boring as that. Perhaps the phones are simply not intimidating or something similar, but this move was boring and gray. For me there was no tension or excitement, and the last monster was disappointing and disagreeable. The film retired in many parts and felt too long. I did not keep my attention. It seems that phones are difficult to make scary, it's like trying to make a nasty machine for pop stores. And it's ridiculous to compare it to "Ring", it seems that every Asian horror movie compared to it, and I have not seen any one so far changed. To the horror directors - remove the phone from the headset as a device for horror.
