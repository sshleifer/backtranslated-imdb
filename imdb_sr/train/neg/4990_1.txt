I can enjoy the wrong pleasure, but this is only bad. And it's not bad in the way you could enjoy watching MST3K. It's just nauseatingly bad as you can not find anything to enjoy about it no matter how hard you try. I am really sorry that I spend 2 hours of precious life on this shit. Looking at him you can say that no one was asked to act and everyone in him knew that this movie would just bury their career. It seems that "Valking Tall" has earned enough revenue that someone has decided to make money from his investment. If it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's so bad that he has deleted the movies from my memory.
