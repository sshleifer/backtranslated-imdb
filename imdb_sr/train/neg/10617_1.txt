Probably encouraged by the fans of her much better "Orlando", Potter here delivers the car for himself in the worst way: she writes, directs, plays stars and actually co-writes music, including a mavkish love song. The film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager who is convinced that her intimate love and melodramatic obsessions are fascinating for us and for her. But Potter's character is insensitive as the object of her romantic obsession, and the entire film is an uncomfortable display of narcissism that turns into a celebration of tango. Perhaps, if you did not throw it, it worked. It just can not work, either to play or not. Pretentious, preambiguous, boring and funny.
