I have two good things to say about this film: the landscape is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (considering what he had to do in terms of dialogue and direction). However, I said that this film is extremely tiring. Looking at dry colors would be more fun. It looked much longer than 97 minutes. Starting with the opening order, where everyone is talking to each other and Paul Reiser repeats everything that is told to him by the phone, the film is irritating. The film is filled with clich√©s and shtick, not to mention the endless incidents of sound flair by Falk. Also, the director seems to have difficulty deciding whether to laugh or cry. There are some sequences that touch, but they all play for laughter. If you like, sentimental and "sweet", you will be pleased. But if you were hoping for something with more content, take a look at another movie.
