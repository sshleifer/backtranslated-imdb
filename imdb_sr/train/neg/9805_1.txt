I've never quite understood the popularity of Shaban's Power Rangers, which was quite another American version of the Japanese ultra popular super-sentai series over the past three decades! What was great in the Japanese version was completely lost in the American version, characterization, special effects, and so on. Of course, many kids will say that energy rangers are the biggest, but that they are incorrect. I'm sure that if you spoke Japanese, you would find out how great sentai is better than the American version. Pover Rangers is completely terrible, instead try Super Sentai! In search of a better performance, try the Voltron Third dimension!
