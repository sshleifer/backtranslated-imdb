This time we get a psycho toy toy called "Joe Petto" (you know?) Who lives the living, evil toys that kill people. He went for a family who was lucky enough to live in the same house where he lived and his son's mutant robot "Pino" (again?). The easiest (and I hope this is the last one) in this half-series, this and the previous look like soft core porn movies, but without sex and nudity. This is something like the hybrid schedule of "Halloween III," "Puppet Master", "Dolls" and bad home movies. Allegedly, in 2000, they began to work sixth in the series, but were abandoned and never completed. We can only hope that it will remain so ... 1/2 star from **** <Br /> <br />
