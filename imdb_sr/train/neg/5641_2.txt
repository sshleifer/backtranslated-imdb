Predictable, told thousands of times a story with the usual drama between, a couple of rather rude sex scenes intertwined with some characteristic paranoia, the 70-year style of random violin horror music that is occasionally comical, I could not recall myself. /> Usually I like Defoe, and it must be said that the acting is not so bad, that the "plot" develops at a reasonable pace and that it occasionally affects you. It's just that everything is too predictable, I felt like watching TV drama instead of a new movie. Perhaps it was the style that the directors wanted, but it should be said that the review I read here before I saw a movie could only be written by someone involved in its production. Do not expect. too, and if I could get the clock back, I would not go to see him in the movie. I would wait for cheap boxes in your video store, I'm sure it will not last long.
