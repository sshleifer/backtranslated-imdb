Nintendo !!! VI #% $ @ ERS !!! How could you do that to me? I can not believe ... this movie is actually worse than the first one. I went to see this in a theater with my brother, because my mother forced me to agree ... God ... where to start? Plot SUCKED. The voice is SUCKED. Animation SUCKED. Completion of REALLI SUCKED. If you liked this movie, IOU SUCK TOO. And Futuramafan1987, who said that this is the best movie ever, you are TOOL, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. This is not a movie for everyone, but for ten-year-olds touching the game with boys who think Pikachu is God. I still cry today thinking about this horrible movie ... and then there was Pikachu's adventure ... not even to start with this terrible mess of the movie. That, in all likelihood, is one of the boring experiences of my life. Do not look at it at any cost. Lower line: go out, find all the copies of this movie that you can burn. Burn them all, then continue to rent a good movie, such as Aliens ... or Bovling For Columbine ... or even back to the future!
