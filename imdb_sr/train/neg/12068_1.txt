The family of horrible people must stay in the house for a week, otherwise they will lose their inheritance to be given to servants who will receive their inheritance only if they agree to stay in order and keep the house in order. People die (and so will you, if you try to get through this) If you ever had a desire to see bad actors - many with bad dentures-act or try to behave in a bad horror movie it's your chance. This is terrible. It's so bad that I thought that Al Adamson, one of the worst directors ever, directed, but I was wrong. It's so bad that I do not want to say anything more about it, not because it is not polite, but once I start, maybe I will not be able to stop. I avoid it
