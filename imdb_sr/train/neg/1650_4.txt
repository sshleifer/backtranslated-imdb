The four best friends are a young male chauvinist pig (with an emphasis on pigs) meet once a week in a restaurant in New York to tell their relationship with sex in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. Peet is a common denominator that dated three bachelors in the group, leading to conflict and inevitable "whipping." Although the premise of the film has potentials and has some funny moments, overall, the film does not work especially at the end where the girls are made to look no better than the guys who are contrary to the core of the story. One of those flicks with one band with about a dozen producers, "Vhipped" is likely to enjoy only one guy who thinks that "The Man Shov" Emmi material.
