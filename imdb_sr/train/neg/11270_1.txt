I saw bad movies, but this took p ***. It does not make sense, and all the characters swear every couple of seconds, and I think one has a low number of sperm. That's good. Veljanmen plays cursing. An exquisite English boy plays a pink pink pink lure, and some smaller lights play vague cakes. And there are some Russian gangsters. Oh, yes, somebody has a gun and maybe talk to the trash while he's high on drugs. Avoid this film as a plague.
