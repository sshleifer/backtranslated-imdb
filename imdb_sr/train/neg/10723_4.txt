The soul of the ancient mummy was transferred to one of his followers so that he could punish anyone involved in the desecration of his tomb. Transference of the soul makes a young man an old step until he himself reminds himself of the mummy. One by one, the blood is exhausted from those involved in bathing. To be as short as possible, Pharaoh's curse is quite a close affair. While the film presents several good, original ideas (bloody mummies, soul transmission, interesting makeup effects, hands-on scenes, etc.) and a few atmospheric moments, the direction and tempo are the very definition of awakening. To make matters worse, the first 15 films of a relatively short duration of 66 minutes are not only complementary. I usually go to these mummy films that are slowly moving, but Pharaoh's curse tests even my patients. The head helps very little. With only one exception (Ziva Rodann is a lonely bright spot that wants the film to focus more on her mysterious character), the acting is as boring as the script. Finally, I do not know whose idea was to put a mummy-looking servant in a pajamas, but it's a funny, funny look for a creature that should strain the audience. In spite of my largely negative comments on the Pharaoh's curse, I estimate that this is 4/10. It's not a good rating to be safe, but generous considering all the problems I have with the movie.
