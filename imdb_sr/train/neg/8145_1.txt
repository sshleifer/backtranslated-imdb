This film is so bad that I can not believe it was actually filmed. People who voted 10 or 9, 8, and even 7, are you crazy? Have we really watched the same movie? Or the same sh ** I should say. Everything is bad in this movie. The story (is there a story?) It does not go anywhere, it is completely incoherent, the acting (some dialogues are simply funny), the musical result (what is it?), Installation, and especially the art direction, a pure disaster. It reminds me of old macho films ... In order to give you an example of production amateurism, the siren costume is a sleeping bag with glued spangles. I'm not kidding, that's exactly what it is. Another example of the huge mistakes we find here: on the scene you see an additional, fat woman of about 200 pounds, talking about her mobile phone. The next shot, which is in a completely different location, you can see the same woman who still talks on her mobile phone (!) Yes, it goes so far. A lot, huge, waste of money. Useless.
