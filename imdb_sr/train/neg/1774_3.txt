Ok, for the first time I saw this movie at 9:00 on Cinemaku a few weeks ago and I thought it would be a reward, the boy was 180d on it. This film was big. I mean, the mother of the monsters shows her true form only at the end of the film. I'm Going "That's it? Why it does not show up at the beginning of the movie." The act is a mother and son on the feast of the blood of young women. Would not it be better if you just proceeded, you know, murder, like killing a couple of young women, and then the sheriff or a policeman find out something about the old and find a way to kill the monsters, save the young woman / woman, and whether the process was killed another 1 or 2 people? I think it would be much better than that. And that's bullshit because the son is the main character and he was first killed. Why do not you get rid of your mother first? Plus, how does she have that power at the end of the movie when she starts killing people? She said she was too weak too. What the hell was wrong with Stephen this time? I can never, never neglect the acting of any movie by any actor, after all, they try the best they can. If it was not good acting, I would give this film 1/10. 3/10.
