Contains a spoiler Film work can be summarized in a few sentences: Three guys go hunting in the forest. Two of them, together with other people, have been hit in the head without explanation. The last guy can stand in sight, yell and do anything without being hit. He goes through the old factory and has evil people who go straight to his scope without fighting. Zlikovci are dressed well in black and look like wicked ones. It's a whole story, not summarized, but detailed. Everything is taken out with a guy who bells on the door. We'll wait with him. The long shot of the guys is bored in the woods and sleeping. We can sleep with them. One of the drawn footage that followed a female jogger could be redeemable if we could see her ass or chest bouncing. The characters just do not speak. And then they do not even have an old one to say: "I'll be back." If my friend recorded it on the weekend, I would cheer him, because it's an opportunity to figure out the controls of the camera. Paying money for renting as a DVD is completely inappropriate. The only thing that's a bit ridiculous is extra with the director who says, the local police did not realize they were firing and treated them as a random guy walking with a gun. Had they taken it, I would be sure it would be more fun to watch a movie.
