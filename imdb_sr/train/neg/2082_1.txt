What a waste of time and money! My husband and I saw this film - after we looked at the performances and thought it was "maybe funny". VRONG! This movie is too long for 90 minutes. Actors are trapped in a badly written script and can not get out. Jokes are weak and tired, and even the sight of Wilson's naked behind can take any part of this film. Special effects ... are not. I expected to see the belt and wires that hold the Mind in its flying scenes. And when people obviously could not master superhero flights faster than quick bullets or battle scenes, they covered everything with a swirling whirlwind of a blurred screen - which pretty well hid the terrible effects. Wilson's assistant was a poor excuse for a man, and Wilson had no chemistry with either Mind or his colleague from the office. Scenes of sex were not sexy and funny scenes were not funny. I guess I've been expecting too much of these actors. None of the characters was sympathetic, so I ended up not taking care of the flying figure of any of them. The only striking performances were the kids who played Bedlam and G-Girl as teenagers - at least they had some chemistry. All in all, a super cinema movie - I would not even recommend it as a rental - it would still be a waste of money!
