If you ask me, the first one was better. See Sarah G. G., she's a real, evil, cruel girl, look at Amy Adams, she's just a little fool around. She's nothing! People do not adore it! Secondly, Sebastian was cute and hot in the first movie, now "baby's face." The story is not so good and I do not understand. Why did not they do this first, that's the beginning. Diligent actors, nothing with the story. This is not cruel, this is playing. The first has better actors, a better story, and its mean value. I think music is better in cruel intentions 1, and music is better in cruel intentions.
