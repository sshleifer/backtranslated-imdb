What? Is Jamie Fokk ridiculous? Does he really believe he's ridiculous? Well, it's ridiculous to watch his confidence that he's ridiculous. Man has no identity ... I mean, you can immediately see who his idols are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lavrence, because he is really trying to imitate them in most of his films. The only problem is that he does it badly, unevenly, and what comes out is some of the parts he seems to look like Denzel in some way, with this tough ** T attitude and then suddenly going to be Martin Lawrence, a funny and clumsy-comic strip . There is no personal touch in all of this, I do not think he contributes anything to the person he is trying to sell, and I'm sure he has nothing to say in person. It's really a g. Dull-boi. I really hoped Hollywood, and the black community in America would find someone better to launch in a super star like Don Cheadle, for example, but maybe pathetic Jamie is better for a generation that removes the old one.
