Parasomnia has interesting spaces, but the story is poorly performed without tension or even logical approach. Actors in the infallible, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who played great roles in movies such as Copper Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest of the actors are unknown (and not very good), except Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert Vest from the big Re-Animator trilogy). But he can play such roles in sleep (which is a bit of what he does here). The main problem is that the action of the characters does not make any sense at all. The story is pretty boring and predictable with inexpensive computer effects mixed with some bloody scenes, especially at the end. It's really below the average.
