I've been sitting through almost one episode of this series and I just could not. I felt like I was watching dozens of episodes, and then it struck me ..... There is nothing new here! I heard that Zeynfeld joke, I saw that someone fell so badly on friends, the episodes of happy days had almost the same story, etc. None of the actors here is interesting! Some were good at other shows (not here), and others were new to the profession they should never have entered. Avoid this stink!
