I enjoyed seeing commercials for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The film, however, did not meet my expectations. After I read the book, they have recently prepared me for a great downturn, which often happens when stories are translated into movies. It seems that the characters did not fit well in the book. The direction was weak. It was hard for me to get into the characters. There was no real connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialogue did not adequately explain what is happening. It looked as though he had slipped and rushed. All in all, I was very disappointed with the film. I suppose if you did not read the book, it might be in itself okay. At the very least, maybe your mom will read your book, which you will probably enjoy more. <br /> <br />
