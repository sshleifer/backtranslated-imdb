KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963, which I recall that he rated BOMB) was my introduction to the work of the cult director Hone; This is not necessarily better? I just learned to be more tolerant towards such an innate tariff! Here we actually get two Kongs at the price of one: the ugly and small looks of the giant monkey and the variation of the robot that looks even worse! The Simian creature lives on the island of Mondo (!) ?? where he is shown fighting several other monsters, and he makes friends with three people. Of course, it falls on blue (and mild) heroin; in fact, more intriguing is femme fatale in cahoots with movie crazy genius? who is called Dr. North Pole; Apparently, the giant monkey is more resistant to radiation than its mechanical counterpart (and, to ensure its full cooperation, who even caught his three 'followers')! A female agent then has a heart change, helps heroes (one of them, typically, an unwritten American) and kills them. Kong eventually escapes and arrives to Tokyo, where he finally confronts a robot. The doctor escaped in a later chaos in his submarine? who, at the request of the Konggong Dreamer, was quickly destroyed by the giant monkey.
