I found this film as an interesting study of the causes and consequences, but a bit more than that. The basic action follows the lives of a few people and how their actions (intentionally and otherwise) affect the lives of others. The premise of the film has a big promise, but I do not think it fulfills my promise. Too much time is spent talking to the audience about the theory of chaos and for too little time it actually shows. As a result, I never got the real feeling for any of the characters and I never had an emotional connection with them. By the end of the film, I had "so what" attitude about all of them. A more powerful direction in character development would make this film great, but as it is now, that's just the case
