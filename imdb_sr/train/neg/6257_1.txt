SPOILERS. Strange people with generous tastes are considering this film. Let me add a balance indicating the following: Script: Dreadful. While Tom and Dan "get to know each other", chatting about movies, the conversation is obviously the speech of one person, and I suppose it was a director, who carefully worked his words to sound intelligently. At one point, Dan asks: "Have you heard of the HIV virus?" and sounds just as natural as to ask, "Have you communicated with nine alien races?" Working: white teeth work, and the carved face does not make a sensitive person. I guess Speedman was good enough with what was given to him, but Marsden was terrible - uneasy, incredible, and openly self-satisfied and frugal throughout the whole bondage. In its embodiments there is a void (see also Interstate 60). Plot: Spare me! The half-fleeing moments were not exciting, but irritating and weak. Remember Marsden pretending to try the keys on the door and then throw them away: "They do not work, man!" Tee Hee. And beware of half-black-and-white flashbacks, initiated by some sound taken from CSI and other criminal drama. Most important of all, the most dangerous, evil, and insulting is homophobia (external or internal, you decide) in a film where HIV is considered a weapon. Tom says Dan may have removed the condom or did not use it at all - excuse me, where was Tom while they had sex? There is some sort of a venture about a partner who inserts it as a crime of gai men in general. All in all: Beware!
