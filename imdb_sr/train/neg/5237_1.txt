One, if not the worst film from Britain since the 1980s. This story of a medieval lecher that "seduces" two teenage cleaners who guard it for him and his fauk-posh husband have nothing to buy it. Alternately free, childish, undernourished and unrealistic, this film makes the depths more difficult because in its attempts to be ridiculous, provocative, intellectual and controversial, it collapses. Perhaps the worst thing about this movie is the way the powerful actors George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely crafted by such a chromatic scenario. It is no surprise that it was the only job of the late Andre Dunbar to appear on the screen. Complete and completely garbage on every level.
