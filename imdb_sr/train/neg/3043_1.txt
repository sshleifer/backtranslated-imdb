This film should be a "joyful" story of Santa Claus and his "magical and mystical" miracles. But, instead, it happens as terribly creepy. Two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as scary are 1) the way Santa looks. - Have you ever seen an even more terrible Santa Claus? and 2) "evil representative of Satan" Pitch is just plain dance, they are just troublesome to watch. Watch this movie only if it happens to be MSTed version or if you like a good laugh. I can not believe this is a kid's movie.
