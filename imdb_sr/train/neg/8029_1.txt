my friend bought this (very cheap) and decided to give it to me as a birthday gift. I thought I would never watch it because I knew it was a joke and the cover of the DVD looked pathetic, but then my friends and I really got bored and watched. from beginning to end! I know quite a bit of accomplishment, but it's really a masterpiece. it's hard to describe. you should see it, it's a real lesson about what people are capable of when they believe that they are creative and smart and really are not. "Gluma" is a sous-terrain (in fact, it can be seen that the "lead lady" laughs at some occasions, she is definitely the worst). The "story" is that it is dumbfounded and really everything in this movie is sucked. Please pay special attention to the "sheriff". The type is an adult and therefore there is no excuse to get involved in this. and he's very bad. whatever he had some hilarious moments. Check it out, haha
