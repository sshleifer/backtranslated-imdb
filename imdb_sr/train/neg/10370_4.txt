I'm sorry every second in the time I lost while I was watching this movie. Unfortunately, it's always hard to turn off the movie when I started watching it. Especially when it's a classic or what people use to call the classic. I think this is one of those films that every movie lover should have watched at least once, so I looked at him. Do not misunderstand me, I love Humphrey Bogart and his wife, Lauren Bacall, both as a couple and as actors, but this film was, in my opinion, a big scam. There's no really good plot, no spy movie, no romantic love story. Well, not even a convincing blend of both genres. The only thing that caused the tension was that it was uncertain whether Bogei and Bacall would stay together at the end or part of each other. I think "To Have and Have" is very overrated, and Bogart has been in many of the better films of the 1940s.
