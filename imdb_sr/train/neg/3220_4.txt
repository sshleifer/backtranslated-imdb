I absolutely hate it when the film is completely broken at the end, since you have already invested an hour in it. And that happened with this movie. I was intrigued by her actors and the fact that Malamud wrote his original story. I did not go to read that story, but I can not imagine it ending like this movie ends. Fortunately, I did not pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it. Ohhhh such a loss of great acting (the wife was especially so perfect) .also milos o'shea as a gay? !!!! Now that was ridiculous. I did not explore his making, but he played as if the director had lost his marble or died 3/4 times through the film. Prior to that point, the story and characters were developing, there were many neat points and there was not much time. but ooh that lasts for half an hour - if it was not the most exciting, the most worthless failure I've ever seen, I do not know what it is. I just hate him when such faith is so destroyed; It feels like the act of violence.
