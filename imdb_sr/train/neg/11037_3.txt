I love an episode in which Jim becomes Greenman. That's great! When Jim throws that little person out of the window, the expression on his face is invaluable. Then when he starts addressing a priest on behalf of his wife just to find out that he has become Pee-Voman? A lot of writing and brilliant casting along with a great acting game makes this one to be seen. I'm trying to find a particular photo from that episode. I'd like to use it as my avatar on the bulletin board, because I think Greenman is hilarious. Does anyone know where I can take Jim's photo as Greenman? Can someone direct me in the right direction to find such a photo?
