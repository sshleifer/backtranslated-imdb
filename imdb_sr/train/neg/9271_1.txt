The small minority seen here, praises this film GORE SERIOUS. I know that at the end of the day, they are reduced to the personal opinion of people, but anyone who has more than a few brain cells can certainly see this as a total rubbish. It's so bad that it does not deserve to be part of this franchise. I can only assume that those who say this is great, are friends with someone who is involved in the film and are trying to give their career a push. The poor in every way, do not oppose people in any other way. The story is a poor re-processing of previous entries, the script is the same. Attempts to cover up the lack of originality with the use of a girl (VOV!) Do not hide the lack of ideas from filmmakers, and unfortunately there is a complete lack of any fear. Absolutely not redeeming properties, utter dullness. I rewarded this couple of hunters just once because I had the nous to find someone to fund this shit. They must have put more effort into doing it than making the movie. Shame.
