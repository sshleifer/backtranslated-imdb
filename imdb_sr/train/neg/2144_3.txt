I always thought that Cinderella II was the worst movie I ever saw (after Peter the Pana 2 and a few sequels like King of Lions 2 and Hurricane Notre Dame 2). All these films are made with the same idea; because the film has no plot, they are trying to make up for jokes. I'm not saying jokes are bad, but they make most of the movie. The first time I saw a movie, I'd give him 1/10. But now I'm thinking about it, most kids do not care how good a good movie is, they just worry that the movie is fun. I still think the movie was a bad sequel, but that does not mean it's horrible. Now I think he deserves 3/10.
