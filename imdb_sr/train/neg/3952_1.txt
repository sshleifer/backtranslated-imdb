The return of Boogiman is a horrible movie that does not play as a movie, it plays as a TV sitcom episode when they return to older episodes. The return of Boogiman is just a video clip. Mutch film is a constant and boring flashback from the first movie. Again and again the same clip. How is that boring? The film is actually about a woman who has a vision of the first movie. I saw the first movie that I do not want to see the same scene over and over again and I do not know who would. The whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a couple of dollars and that's it.
