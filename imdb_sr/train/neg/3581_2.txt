I was not able to decide whether this film is so bad that it's good, or, to quote Enid Coleslav, "it's so bad that it went well and that it's back to bad again." Regardless, I made me look the same way as a bunch of strange colored vomit, and offers numerous scenes that you will not forget even if you want. Young Ray Liotta says Pia says her creative writing trophy looks like a penis. A little later, Rai again, abused Pia, not with a suitable trophy but with a garden hose. There is a Pina company that tells its dominant mother that she wants to go to bed with Rai's father, Walter. There is an actress on the scene of a graveyard that prides itself on the best line ever written by Pia or anyone else: "VVVVHHHIIIIIII!" Again, there is a garden hose, as Valter waving Pina's face and shouting: "Is that more in your favor?" There's Pia and her meeting, so they turned to the big plans of every other chewing salad, to start tearing up their clothes. Pia takes a shower but forgets to take off her dress. Perhaps best of all, there is Pina's typewriter, but instead of the buttons there are miniature voice heads of those who tortured him the most (after that I was afraid to open my laptop). And finally, Pia at The Avards exposes Hollivood to the Septic Pit, throwing out the second best line ever, "I suppose I'm not the only one who had ever had to make his way to the top." I see that I have spent more time commenting on "Lonely lady "than I have in far better pictures, so I will stop. Be warned, however, that when you begin to watch, you will probably not be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours of your life disappears forever.
