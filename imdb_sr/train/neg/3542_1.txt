After reading the comments on the site, I have to write for the first time. It looks like this movie, like Marmite, shared the audience. I must say that although I agree that films do not have to make sense to be comfortable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they still need to hire you with characters. Now that I was absolutely absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Linch's opus, I must say that I could not give a bunch of g. Green or other gangsters from the cartons that inhabited this daiglo world. Also, while many people are trying to say that you did not enjoy it, because you did not get it, I would have to agree - I did not enjoy it because I was bored. I wanted to finish the film and keep listening to these quotes over and over again. Call it smart if you want - I think it's repeating. However, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers one question - there were no final points on the press of the film I saw. Only music over black. Have I seen a fake printout or is it a proof of GR's pretentiousness? Or, did everyone who took part in the movie watch a rough cut and their name was removed?
