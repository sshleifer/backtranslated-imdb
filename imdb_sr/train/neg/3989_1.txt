Who in the right mind play a lyrical song at the same time when they show the emotional scene between two people? When Flipper confronts his damaged wife in the dressing room, the song with lyric content is as loud as the dialogue, so it can not be felt to dilute any emotional influence that the scene may have had. The scenes of Anabela, whose father was fisted with fists, a lamp, and then a belt, were so drawn that they were absurd. All this film is a cartoon, unbridled prejudice against whites is literally astounding. The discussion of black women after the flipper's woman finds out that she has cheated her with a white woman - as if it was a discussion of a debuffing team at Oxford, is ridiculous. Widespread racism could endure, but the soundtrack and mixing of sound during this 'movie' are too many. It was a technically bad movie. There is no understanding of the basic craft of film making, sound, editing, and desperate attempts by big actors to try to keep this film on the surface. I was really sorry, Anthony Quinn, wondering why he accepted the role in this film - his appearance in this is painful. This is the first movie I've ever seen from this director, and that will be my last.
