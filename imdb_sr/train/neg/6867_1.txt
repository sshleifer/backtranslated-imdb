We can start with a wooden act, but this film is a catastrophe. When I grew up in New York, I can tell you that this film is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or people. I am not in any way a defender of culture, and I consider it to be a holistic garbage that fits into my fictitious, funny presentation of culture and the language that anyone who sees Seinfeld knows as inaccurate. This is a huge waste of time and, worse yet, it's not very interesting, because the outcome is obvious and scenes of the conflict are ridiculously bad. Who does it? No one. The writer's name sounds Israeli or something similar, but it's clear that he has no idea about the topic he's writing about. Looking at his biography, it is shocking that he lived in New York and wondered how much he had real ties to the community. Even major films such as "The Stranger Among Us" are better and closer to the truth than this shit. Reading his guys, it's no wonder he wrote scenarios on all C films that somehow have stars. shocking. Maybe he knows someone because this scenario is even below the money for the bad movie Dolph Lundgren.
