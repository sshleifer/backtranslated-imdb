This was a bad movie! Although I have not seen all the Burton / Tailor co-operation, I can say with certainty that this is the worst. This wealthy, but sick woman (of course, Tailor) owns this beautiful island in the Mediterranean Empire, ruling over the staff when suddenly visiting this traveling poet, who pronounces dumb words. In fact, the whole movie is just a talk about conversations, and most conversations make no sense. Even in 1968 nobody could make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense, and the passing of time makes it even clearer. Had there been no great cinema and landscape, it would have earned a negative rating. The only thing for which this film is good is its unintentional laugh at the expense of the star.
