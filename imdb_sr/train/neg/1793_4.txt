An interesting concept of a virus-related vampire (but so far this has been done several times) Overall, the film is too long and drags a little. Editing could have been tougher. I'm sorry to hear about the problem with credit. Maybe the movie hurried to the market. Lighting was too dark in places. But the worst technical problem is sound. The level was good enough to hear the dialogue, but many of the interiors have eased them, which is very disturbing. Or they were not careful in filming, or the sound could have been better. Also, too many background noise has passed. It was necessary for somebody to make sound effects for martial arts scenes. The bite of the swords he hit was not the sound of an epic battle. Especially in combat scenes, editing had to be tougher. And the acting was a bit straight. I'm sorry, but when I see that the same person writes and plays in a movie, in my experience, it's a red flag. But that was a good effort so I gave him 4.
