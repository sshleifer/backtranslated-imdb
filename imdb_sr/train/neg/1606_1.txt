In this film, Chavez's adherents (or Venezuelan and non-Venezuelan) just lie about the dramatic situation in our country. They did not say that the conflict started due to Chaves's announcement that he fired many of the best VATSA workers for political issues only. They did not say anything more than 96 TVs. Chavez transmitted the interruptions in just 3 days to "CADENA NACIONAL" (some kind of private TV signal seizure). Each of them lasts about 20 minutes. They did not tell us anything about the announcements made by General Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero, the general inspector of the military forces, who is traditional Chavez supporters. Even now, despite his announcement, he is the Interior Ministry of Justicia. After Chavez returned, he was indicted as Defense Minister of the Defens (equivalent to the Secretary of Defense in the United States). They did not say anything about the Chavez order ordering the concentration of the Pacific People who were running for elections. They did not say anything about the people in this concentration who killed Chavez's supporters (either civilians or military official forces). They represent some facts in the wrong order, do not lie. They did not say anything about Venezuelan civil society that even now demand elections to solve the crisis and Chavese's actions to avoid elections. So I tell you .... This movie is just a lot of lies or big lies.
