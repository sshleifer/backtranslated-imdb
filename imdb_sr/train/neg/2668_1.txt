Do not be able to rent this movie. It has nothing to do with the escape from the death penalty, despite the (English) title. I can not remember a good word about the movie. Poor acting, bad montage, bad directing ... funny "plot", and sound / music is so irritating, it's amazing that this movie has no warning sign. The only possible way to watch this movie and enjoy it is its historical quality. They just do not make movies so bad anymore.
