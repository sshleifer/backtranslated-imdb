I simply give this three because it fulfilled what my friends and I hoped would do: have fun. I was not stupid enough to hire this thinking that it would be a zombie movie up with such as Romero or Fulci, but what I rented was laughter. If you are looking for a movie for fun, or a movie that will force you to squeeze your head in disgrace, proceed accordingly. This is perfect for fans of "Mystery Science Theater", but the only drawback is that it's so bad to be washed. I personally think it's a shame to connect it with any other Hollywood headline that we may know, because when the film shit has its own genre.
