Minimum script, minimal character development, minimum stable camera. Maximum stretched scenes, maximum headaches that cause buzzing, the maximum number of characters walking in the woods do nothing. As long as the time does not start to shine on the screen at 12:01, you can accelerate forward and miss anything, because there are three hunters that we do not know anything about not doing anything. To be honest, the film has some strings of music that was interesting, so it might be a music video that was a way to do it. Unfortunately, this did not have to be, and what was supposed to be twenty minutes shortly stretched over belief. Forget about the "Trigger Man," I know I'm trying. - MERK
