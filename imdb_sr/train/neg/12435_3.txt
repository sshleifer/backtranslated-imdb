Alek D. Linz replaces Macaulaia Culkina as the central figure in the third movie in the Home Alone Empire. Four industrial spies get a computer chip of a rocket launcher system and smuggle it through the airport in a toy car to remote control. Because of the confusion in luggage, the silly Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) gets a car. He gives his neighbor, Alec (Linz), just before the spies appear. Spies rent a house to rob each house in the neighborhood until they find the car. Alone with chickens, Alek calls 911 every time he sees the stealing that is in progress, but spies always manage to evade the police while Alek is accused of making a joke. The spies finally draw attention to Alec, unaware that he was installing devices to wipe his whole home smartly. Home Alone 3 was not terrible, but probably not supposed to be made, you can not just replace Macauleia Culkina, Joe Pescia or Daniela Sterna. Home Alone 3 had some funny parts, but I do not like when the characters change in the movie series, they look at their own responsibility.
