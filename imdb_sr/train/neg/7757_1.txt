I have a tip for people who made this movie, if you want to make a movie like this, be sure you have f / k to support it. Also, do not get a bunch of actors from the playlist. One more thing, we almost all saw the Jurassic Park, so do not copy it. All in all, this film is sucked, f / k sucked, played sisao, tells the non-original. Let's talk about acting for just a moment, type Carradine who reached his career in 1984 when he performed "Revenge of the Nerds" (which was actually a great comedy). He's not right on the list, he can work. He was just supposed to refuse this bag. He had to do what Mark Hamill did after the "Back of the Jedi" and quietly went into the night. He made his seal as "Nerd" and that was supposed to be it. I understand that he has billing accounts, but it's hard to justify this bag. Have I already called this movie? OK. I just wanted to be sure. If I sound a bit hostile, I apologize. I just spent 2 hours of my life that I could spend doing something productive as I was looking at a peeling of colors, and I feel cheated. I'll close that message. Thank you for your time.
