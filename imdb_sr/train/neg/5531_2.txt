"After the First World War, the expedition of allied countries was sent to Cambodia to stop the efforts of Count Mazovia to create zombies like army and labor. Through the jungle of Angkor Wat despite the dangers, the group includes Armand who has his agenda contrary to the wishes of the group," according to synopsis of DVD sleeves. Heads up! the zombie makeup department rebelled before the cameras started rolling. Also, this "Revolt Zombie" has little to do with his alleged predecessor, "Wake Zombie" (1932) *****, in which she starred White Lugosi. If the zombies of this movie did not delight you, this will certainly not. The younger than the usual Dean Jagger (like Armand Loukue) plays a man obsessed with blue Dorothy Stone (like Claire Duval). Several supported performances are good: Devil Roi D'Arci (as Mazovia) and subordinate Teru Shimada (as Buna); however, none of them got enough material to really pull this out of the dumps. ** Revolt Zombies (1936) Victor Halperin ~ Dean Jagger, Dorothi Stone, Roi D'Arci
