Especially a bad example of an Italian cult film with a senseless title to launch (if nothing else, the alternative label of Satan is even less relevant to the plot!), This hybrid only Gothic Horror and Giallo (with a strong dose of eroticism) builds a flat atmosphere all over the world? in fact, pairing that is really terrible! Here we have a common group of people (actor's hull) stranded on the island (called by the count, because he became in love with a leading lady, a dead ring for his missing spouse)! The characters are mostly stereotypes: the medieval, but the heroic hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and whose family history carries more than his share in a violent tragedy), a modest heroine, a lousy companion (recalling Mae West and appearing the most boring)! , but a dedicated theater manager (forever left to one and everyone for his ruthless behavior!), a couple lesbians, a mysterious gardener (omnipresent Luciano Pigozzi who, once, takes action, if I know what I mean), an enviable housewife (nominal star Femi Benussi, for what is worth, this is truly an ensemble), a religious fanatic butler, an impressive maid, etc. This means that the elusive, horrible synchronization, the speed of the snail, the poor production (with scenes showing the angry sea raised from a black-and-white film!) And the fact that the killings happen only in the final half hour do not help things. In addition, the result of Marcello Giombini, although in itself pleasant, becomes unusually modern in the given circumstances; In this connection, the revelation is proven by a surprisingly elaborate (since there are certainly no shortcomings of the suspects here).
