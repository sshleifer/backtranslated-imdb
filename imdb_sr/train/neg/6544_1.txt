I paid one dollar for this DVD and at first I felt burned, but then I began to think about it and I should be grateful. I found a holy grail, a real stumbling block for bad cinema. If you think that the opening of dramatic shots of an empty stadium passes through Evel's monologue with an unpleasant camera address, then wait until the first credits appear on the driver. It seems that the script is glued together with press clippings and ESL textbooks. But ..... I can not believe how George Hamilton is bad. It seems that there is absolutely no connection to anything he says, the only internal monologue I can discover is "God will bet they think I'm cute. Really sweet!" This is Epiphany! Now I know how bad it can be.
