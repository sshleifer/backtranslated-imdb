Pretty crazy girl with a black color trying to figure out who killed a trumpeter who just wanted to go to Hollywood to make it big. Was that his wife? His girlfriend? His bi-girl? Her father? His Butler? Journalist? Who knows? And who cares? The result is just a little uncomfortable, and the actors do not really get me to worry about in one way or the other. Why a snake poison like a weapon? Who knows? Who cares? The music in this is fine, but a little bit, and the majority is pretty "let's finish this" This is not worth your time. There are better black and white films there.
