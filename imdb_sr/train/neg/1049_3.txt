This film has a very Broadway feeling - background, acting, 'noise' - yet that's all it has. Some "feeling" of Broadway without scratch. The film is slowed down, the picture is fragmented, the singing appears on you so you suddenly remind that it is a musical. Disappointing: Sinatra Unbearable: Sinatra's fianc√© --- surely, the height and accent of her voice were unnecessary. Tolerable: Mr. "I remember the numbers on the cube" Delight: Brando's unobtrusive singing (very biased!) Surprise: How Jean Simmons Looks Like as Vivien Leigh in his Havana scenes. It's a bone structure! How would I kill if I saw Ms. Leigh in the role that Brands again challenged?
