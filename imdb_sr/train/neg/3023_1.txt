It's rare to find a movie that's so horrible, this boring and this irritating. It's no doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot, when it's not blurred by confusing and pointless editing, is ridiculous. Why did Domino become such a bad bitch? Because her goldfish died while she was a child, and this "traumatic" event left her emotionally stiff and hated everyone. When the dialogue is not clich√© or banal, it is full of ridiculous lines such as: "There are three types of people in this world: the rich ... the poor ... and everyone else." At one point, the head hunters have a type attached to the rear of the bus with a combined number of tattoos on their hands. Because of the confusing mobile phone call, instead of turning around with the sleeve and only reading the number, they release his hand with the shotgun. At another point, blackmailers take a bomb at a meeting agreed with the mafia and threatens to throw a bomb if the mafia does not let them go !? It is clear that going to the meeting would not be too easy. Keira Knightley is incredulous and terribly wrong. Mickey Rourke manages to save some credibility from this mess. I enjoyed some of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance as one, but all I could think of as I suffered from this confusion was that it had to be made up of a complete idiot.
