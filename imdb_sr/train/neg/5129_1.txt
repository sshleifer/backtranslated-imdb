The message of this film is "personality more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo should be a "ugly duck," but it's ridiculous that she is not at all ugly (she's actually much more attractive than Uma Thurman, a friend who looks like a model). > Now, would this film work if the "ugly duck" was really unattractive? When will Hollivood stop this hypocrisy? In my opinion, despite the message he wants to convey, this film is simply funny. <br /> <br />
