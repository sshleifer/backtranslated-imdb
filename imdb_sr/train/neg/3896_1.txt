Okay. Astronaut Steve West sits in a plastic space capsule, commenting that "you did not live until you saw the sun through the Saturn rings," as long as it is clear that the sun's light flows through the window in the middle of the day, when suddenly there is a bleeding from the nose. Then, West returns home to a secret hospital, a blubbering gelatinous cough that causes a coarse sister to run through the false glass door. Apparently, the West is "getting stronger as it melts," which makes as much sense as anything in this hopelessly purlin, adle-brained moovie. Then that stupid Armi Brass, who looks like Coleman Francis (director of many bad moovies) is trying to cover information, but the goo man runs around killing everything he sees because he melts. The old bickering strikes because it melts. He made a terrible actress and drove helplessly for about 10 minutes because he melts. It melts because it melts. Fk by Rick Baker who should be a star here should be a star, but they just look like hockey. The film is badly recorded and everything looks so dark and confused it's very difficult to figure out what it is - not to help anyone. MooCov says who cuts cheese with this? : = 8P ps - "Did not you get any crackers?"
