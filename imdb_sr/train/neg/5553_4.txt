This third Darkman was definitely better than the other, but still far worse than the original movie. What made this better than D2 was the fact that Bad Gui was changed and Durant was not returned again. Moreover, there was a hint of character development when she came to the family of a bad guy and Darkman himself. It made my heart soften and I gave this movie a 4/10, i.e. ** / *****.
