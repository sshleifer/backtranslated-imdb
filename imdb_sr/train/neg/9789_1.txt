They should have called this film: "An adopted mouse brother who was a little inspired by someone's obscure memory of Stewart Little who just wiped out the book a little, but mostly just remembered the cover" is a better overview. But seriously, make your children a service and let them read the book. Maybe they will learn something instead of disturbing what we all know as a Hollywood movie. Stuart's book does not talk about a mouse, it's about a person who is very small and like a mouse. He was born to his parents, he was not adopted. The book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and traveling on which he is moving. There is a cat named Snackball who thinks that food is eating and wants to eat it, but Snovball can not talk. In the film it all screwed up. I think the only things that were kept in the book were the ship's races and names.
