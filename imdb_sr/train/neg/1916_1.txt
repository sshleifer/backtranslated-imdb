This film is totally trash. Some intelligent intellectual is comforted by the fact that he does his best to claim the superiority of the aristocrats over the working class. Nothing more than catharsis of complacency. It's disgusting. If this type of film is set up in the US, it will surely be a big joke. And simply because it comes out of the other side, it seems a masterpiece, a wonderful party for certain brainwashing and / or brainwashing (perhaps some George V.). Typical cold war consequences, anyway a kind of joke. I would say, if this is - as expressed in this film - all what Soviet intellectuals thought of all these years, then they deserve all the troubles they claim to have passed. BUT NOT! Because, like many others, I read and watched the real masterpieces of real outstanding Soviet intellectuals. For example, something that is also relevant to the dog, "White Bim Black Ears" - and Gavriil Troiepolski's book and Stanislav Rostostsky's film - is a masterpiece. Real life, real tragedy, real sad, real pride and dignity, one of the best Soviet times.
