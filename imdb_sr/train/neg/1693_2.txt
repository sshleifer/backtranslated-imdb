My husband and I went to see this movie as lovers of horror films that we are. Two hours later I found myself wanting my money and time back. I was so disappointed. Tizers for this movie basically contained the best movie spots. There was nothing terrifying in the film other than a good time for sudden entrances, etc. I considered most of the "horrible" parts more comical than anything. After watching other films based on the work of Japanese writers, I must conclude that what is terrifying in Japan is not what is scary in the United States. My advice: If you're a fan of real horror movies, be sure to get through this movie. I can not say that I would recommend you rent it unless you get a free rental.
