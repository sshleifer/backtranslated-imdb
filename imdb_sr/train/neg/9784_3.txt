Um, my friends and I watched a movie based on the title itself. It's cute, although it's obvious in its direction and direction-- you know where the movie goes in the first five minutes. My main quarrel with a complication is that, although it remains tolerant, they never explain a lot of things behind the characters. Father an alcoholic, an overburdened mother, a stressed sister ... it's a bad family, but besides the occasional mention of a sister, there is no resolution. I was also confused as to the bottle scene ... it seemed quite accidental. to be desirable. Unfortunately, what could have been a nice niche movie was pushed aside for one, the blah special effect, the lame script, and obviously obvious plot.
