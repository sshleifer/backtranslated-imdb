This film is S-L-O-V. He spent most of the film, actually waiting to "start". The setting was gloomy, the scenario was gloomy, the cinema was gloomy, the action was gloomy, the budget was low (it's not all Low-budget films are bad, but this did not make any difference. The action was more consumed with a vindictive, somewhat disturbed hunter from a real Wendigo who made a short look at the end of the movie. That was in itself disappointing because this 'Vendigo' was just a bizarre blend of wood and deer. Everything about the movie was unkind. </ p> <br /> <br /> <br /> Parents of a little boy were doing p Alike, and from time to time, they seemed completely separate from my son. Whether it was a bad behavior or a bad script I'm not sure, but it only boosted my disappointment and level of boredom. There was no food for thought, nothing which would cause interest. Without a real intrigue or a cold factor, this movie screamed so painfully that you did not care what happened to the end. Vendigo Ambient reminds me of the boring film shown at the awards ceremony the end of 'Mr. Bean's holiday': a film that is artistic and meaningless, d and be profound and meaningful, but appears as pretentious and boring. I would never like to watch this again. I just looked him to the end in the futile hope that something interesting would happen ... but it did not.
