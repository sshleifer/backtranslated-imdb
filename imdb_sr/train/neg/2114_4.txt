Their corpses were stolen by the famous horticulturist Dr. Lorenz (Lugosi), and a couple of his strange servants as his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) need injections of glandular fluids of young virgins to remain forever young ... forever beautiful. An eager local reporter (Luana Valters) realizes that every missing young woman wore the same line of orchids on the altar; Orchid in which Dr. A typical horoscope storms a bit of scary visit to Lorenz's estate; especially with a dwarf and a slimy humpback in the rooms. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
