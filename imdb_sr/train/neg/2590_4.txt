The American pie has gone a long distance from the first. At first, I believe actors have no idea what they are doing and instead it's just a remake of a college that has gone crazy. The story is described as two freshmen (with a young stifler) who set their dreams of attending college just to experience nightly entertainment, sex and of course a drink. The plot is stupid and comes far from the original pie. In fact, once again they did not have apple pies somewhere in the movie. Fortunately I work in a video and can rent for free. But, please, remember that it's a waste of time, unless you enjoy sexual movies without a brain with absolute nudity and crazy drinks. I am a teenager myself, and I believe even Evan Almighty would have been a better choice.
