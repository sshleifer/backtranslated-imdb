This film is a mess. I'm surprised he even has a theater edition. Without Robin Villiams, I would go straight to the video. It's badly written. She's poorly focused. Gore is an insult to taking an interesting theme and she relied on a ridiculous and boring thriller that does not have excitement and no tension, no internal or emotional logic. It's so over the top that the audience I've seen laughed with. Save money. The trailer is totally misleading - it's not tense and there is no excitement - in fact, the movie is really the worst offense that's simply boring.
