This film is shown in the trailer as a comedy. It's an extreme tragedy. He left my stomach pain. I hated that. I think that if they want to make such a film, then there should be enough men to reflect the real intentions of the movie in the trailer. I would not have seen this movie if I knew it. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of the film. I'm tired of it. I really wanted to have a fun comedy and I'm very disappointed. It's been a couple of days and I still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie. I've never been more disappointed in the movie, nor did I ever write a comment on a bad movie. I really think that the real scam was involved in this story, because if they showed the true intent of the film, no one would see it.
