Police Bangle allegedly labeled debut Keystone Kops, named after the studio they worked for. In this, however, they do not dress up in silly costumes of policemen or drive a fast car that is their trademark. In any case, Mabel Normand is a farm that prayed to my father's calf. Later he sees some strange people in the barn and promptly calls the police. One match and the chase is on. Next, Mabel wins the door as someone enters. It turns out that her mother jumped to the conclusion that the robbers are there! While Mabel blocks the door with furniture, the mother and father are trying to break through! This may have been the most fun part of the short line along with some explosions of a police car. It was a short 7 minutes that went so fast that it was almost before it started. The only real characterization that has evolved is Mabelina, who only charm with her face and big eyes and looks so optimistic cheerfully, of course, when, of course, she is scared. It's easy to see why it became a star. Mostly I recommended that I see this at least once and why I am giving this.
