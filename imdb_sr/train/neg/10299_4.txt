I must confess that I stuck this and thought that something would have to happen, except for the dead body in the first scenes ... and its disposal. I was wrong. It was the cinematic vertex of Betti that struck the beach for the first part of Mordant Morven. I really do not care what the young girls from Scotland are doing these days, who are you, what drugs they take. Visually, a walk through the Cabo de Gata in Andalusia was a cozy and safe peak for me. Nadir was a steak for her dead boyfriend. As the film came to an end, I had two thoughts ... 1. That's all there is? 2. Now I see why her boyfriend was killed. Rename it. "Bare Bitch Boredom, or What I Did on a Trip to Spain." I'm such a fool to keep these things out.
