This is the worst movie I've ever seen since "I Know Who Killed Me" with Lindsey Lohan. After watching this movie, they can convince you that only frustration and disappointment await you if you choose to see it. Hey, Tim Burton, I used to be your big fan ... did you even show this movie? I mean seriously, what is f% # k? Without giving anything, here are the stories in vague short lines ... Nine wakes up, for things, his actions and decisions are irrelevant. .. and the movie ends. Wait ... comes the spoiler ... Warning! Spoiler alert! At the end of the film ... it's raining. I think a part of my soul died while I was watching this movie.
