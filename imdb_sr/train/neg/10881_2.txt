My girlfriend's mom worked in the video and she had to check the films before they came out, and when she brought home the Convent, a movie about the horror, I was barely waiting to see it. Since it should be scary, but it's actually really funny, I can say it in some strange way, I like this movie. Yes, the acting is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie I've ever seen, but it's so damn funny! "WHAT TO KEY CA-RACK?" I did not know that this movie has ever been released ... I thought it was bad ... Yeah, well ... the movie is pretty bad (you have to admit it's pretty much the least) but I promise you that make a good laugh of it. * This movie is bullshit, but it's good to laugh ... especially the guy who holds the 'dagger of despair' .. DAGGER DESPAAAAAAIR!
