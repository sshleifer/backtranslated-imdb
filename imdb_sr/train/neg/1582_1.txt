argh! this movie hurts my head. not in a good way. Perhaps this is just my growing hatred for the action genre, but even as a child if I swallowed a cave like a navy seal, I still looked at this film with disdain. now I completely despise it. Take one pretty good story. Hold the title and throw the rest. instead they use some semi-perspective stories about gladiators that are so full of tricky holes that all things are at risk of collapse (why is the base of rebels in the middle of the arena, and what about the cameras? Why did they clearly mark the footage of what really happened? in the bazaar in the unprotected room?) the whole film screams from the '80s, from the rush of a terrible jump to stupid shiny bones. ugh. Do not watch this movie. I know that some people liked it, but some people are searching for them and I do not understand them either.
