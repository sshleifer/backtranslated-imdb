The movie is just as fun as watching the sun. Sheriff Pataki is a total retard who does not like anything other than sit on his thick back and makes a smoke ring of his inflated cigars and drinks alcohol while the doctor acts like a zombie version. Nicholas Cage sucked all the so-called "Blood" that really figured like Fruit Punch. Most of all, drawing seemed very scary that even this piece of shit would be called a movie. in this film there are total losses of time, the end was horrible, the contours were cheesy, and the scenes were terrible. What else do I tell the viewers there? My advice would be to record a frenzy if you've already watched the movie. This film can give you foam in your mouth if you have not received the latest footage.
