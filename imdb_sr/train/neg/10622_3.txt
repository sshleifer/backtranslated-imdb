In fact, I have a sympathy for Christopher Lee, but it was not in his other performances ... and he was one of the better actors. The film does not fulfill its premise. Not so scary, too melodramatic, and draaaaaags. Every time I thought: "Oh, HERE comes a good part" a good part has never arrived completely. Evils are not at all convincing. Most of the other characters lacked depth. Perhaps, if I were in the right spirit, I enjoyed the MSTie-fiction at the expense of this film, but ... Naaahhh ... It does not seem worth the effort. It was not very good, it was not so bad, it was central.
