Too bad, I really like Kristen Cloke and Garry Busei. But the director did not manage to connect. There are many actions, many promises, but all of this happens. The director did not do his job. Promising action is weak. It seems that it was so much a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of "The Rage" (DirecTV deserves it as 1996) is simply not worth the time to watch it. The other director would do a better job.
