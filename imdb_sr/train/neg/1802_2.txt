Bad. Oh, my ... this is one of the films, which has no positive effect. Only from acting to the story stinks to the sky. I'm just wondering how low it is. You should watch this kind of movie and even enjoy it. Is there anything that is worth watching? Well, there's a lot of nudity, but that's nothing special. And when you think that it can not be worse, realize that all naked ladies looked like they were forty years old. Come on guys, where are you looking for these actresses. In the nursing home, maybe. In any case, the leading actresses have sexual attraction and know how to show it. Again, it's a pity that it's too skinny and old. All in all, skip this. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
