Ho-hum. The deadly biological weapon of the inventor (Horst Buchholz) is in danger of falling into the wrong hands. Unknowingly his son (Luke Perry) worked all the time on the antenna. Enter CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and start hunting and shooting cats and mice. The main roles are: Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and old Roger Moore. It looks like Moore tirelessly moves through this mess. Perry fans will accept. d'Abo is not right for the role, but it's nice to look at it.
