All you need to know about this movie comes after an introductory scene where a man falls into the lake and eats. Then they start rolling the titles of the title: See "Snows"! in large letters, shortly afterwards "The Movie". VHEV! I was worried that I accidentally walked into Slugs: The Musical or Slugs: The Game Shov. In any case, the film is getting worse in the murder. See how someone cut off his arm because he had rustles in the glove in the garden, two people were attacked by snails while having sex, and a girl who fell on her back in an underground passage was stabbed by killer killers. It's a pretty stupid movie, which falls into the category of "so bad - it's good." It's also so badly filmed with such a grainful movie that you are shocked that you learned it in 1988 (I suppose it was 1974). I am very surprised that it has got such a high score as it is here, because most people here do not give that kind of film any kind of love. But if you want a movie that tries to be daunting but ends up as ridiculous, this is one of your main candidates.
