As a historic nut who is particularly interested in this historic event, I was very disappointed with the film. But costumes and scenography were quite authentic, but the Hollywood portrait of this "British little big horn" was really boring. The amount of film shots dedicated to marching or parade troops had to be unprecedented in the history of the film. Whenever I heard the triumphant background music, I knew I had to prepare for another tiring scene of a meaningless filler. Obviously, the producers have invested a lot in "staging" and were determined to get their money. In spite of the extraordinary roles, their dialogue was, again, boring and their characters were never developed. Whenever Peter O'Toole or Burt Lancaster would finish the scene, I would be worried with disappointment. Their lines were so weak and meaningless that I could hardly believe they were two great actors who portrayed Lawrence Arabia and Birdman from Alcatraz. It has more epic gaps, but this is not much better.
