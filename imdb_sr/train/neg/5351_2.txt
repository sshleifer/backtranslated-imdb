If you like the first two films, then I'm sorry to say that you will not like this one. This is really garbage and unnecessarily directly on the video, probably a TV extension. Still idiotic, but fine scientist Rick Moranis still lives with his family and has his own company, Szalinski Inc. his brother. Then he took off his wife and snitched. Now adults have to find a way to bring children in the house to increase them. The other two repeat with just one or two new things, for example, toy car roller coaster, swimming in a dip, etc. Pretty poor!
