Well, I had to be generous and give this to 2. This was mainly due to the free holes in the shirt of the ladies where her breasts are. It was a little fun for me. In addition, this film does nothing more than just a few good laughs with a friend. It's funny if you're ready to throw a "mysterious science theater" to comment on it with someone, but it's not better than 2. A 2 pretty shit.
