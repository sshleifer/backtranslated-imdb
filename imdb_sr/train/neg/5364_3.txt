Complaints are valid, for me the biggest problem is that this soap is too focused on women. I agree with this nighttime souvenir, such as Grey's Anatomy, or Ugli Betti, or West Ving, because there are stories that are interesting even though they will never end. However, when the idea is parallel to daytime sapuns, which aim only at placing boasted men (Taie Diggs, Tim Dali and Chris Lovell) into sexual tension and romps, as well as a number of ridiculous difficult situations in the so-called small hospital, it seems like the General Hospital. ... or female colleague Baivatchu. That was what men wanted and had, and if that's what women want, then the idea is that this high forehead (or something that men will look at) is unrealistic.
