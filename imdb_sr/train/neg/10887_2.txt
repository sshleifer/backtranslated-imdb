...... this movie is pretty horrible, the only thing that prevents me from giving it an estimate is the fact that I unfortunately saw it up. Jungle music, Yummy demons, and fluorescent UV style / teeth / eyes give this "horrible" look, and the scenario is awesome ..... this movie is more like a test to see how long You can withstand before you give up. It is also predictable, but not in a good way. Nothing to do with this movie is in a good way. I looked at him 10 minutes ago and thought I'd freak out a little, so you're there. (oh, the acting does not release a movie, it's also terrible)
