OK, this movie could have been soooo good! All generations were exposed to Thunderbirds and they came to love him and this movie had some of the features they would look for in a good bird movie. The ships themselves and the island of Tracei were actually transferred to the big screen, while still keeping the designs that we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was just fantastic, like Ladi P and Bill Pakton, although they were not exactly the one I imagined Jeff Tracei was solid enough ... but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 - Years can fly 200 tons. It's not so much the fact that the film was focused on the kids who made me feel like Jonathon Frakes was trampling on me with wet fish and laughing at my hard-earned money. on the film, it was the fact that Alan Tracei was so disgusting in the film that he seemed able to fly machines as well as his brothers ... who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some pretty damn machines to use if that's the case. It seems that the movie did not know if it wanted to be serious or farsane. She tried to honor her as she sat down and she just fell on her face. 3/10 (2 for machines, 1 for Lada P)
