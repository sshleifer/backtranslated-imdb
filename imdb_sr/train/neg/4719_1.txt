I just want to say that this production is very one-sided, to break the impartiality that is needed if you want to take it seriously. There are no people interviewed, so you can not have the idea of ​​whether they are worthy to be heard. This is very dangerous, because the next generation learns a bad idea, and therefore wars continue to come. I know this is not the only reason for wars, but it does not help either. You can look at this documentary, but much earlier on the internet. The Balkans are as complex as human history.
