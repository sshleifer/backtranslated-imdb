I do not think this is bad for the show under the right conditions. I tolerated the first season. Unfortunately, this is a notion of lawyers who are not lawyers. Save me, will anyone go to law school on the basis of these shows, what I heard when I watched some of the interviews. It just kept silent for me. This side, Spader and Shatner, who should be the stars of the show, are the most bothered. Although it may be a compliment in some situations, it certainly is not there. Their constant harassment of women in the show is at first ridiculous. But since that's what they do literally all the time, I realized that this is as deep as the show will get. The attempt to intertwine some serious, dramatic and even tear moments in the midst of this humorous humor can not compensate for the progressive loss of interest I was going through trying to enjoy the show. Alan Shore's luxurious and unpretentious "public notices" in which he refuses his opinions does not impress. Denni Crane is just boring. I was embarrassed for him and for the broadcast writers for Crane's speech in colonial clothing. I gave two stars because there are moments in which I thought that emission attempts to deal with some contemporary problems. I think the broadcast writers became aware that the sexual harassment shown by Denny and Alan became even more ubiquitous even to those who had been urging them from the very beginning. The thing is, I do not care if the sexual harassment in the show was done well, but I only felt that the writer was insulting me with artificial implantation of sexual customers throughout the show in the hope that the libido would keep me back for more. I'm no longer a teenager and I think this show promises if its goal was not to satisfy the smallest common denominator in order to get grades. Of course, this I write after I realized that it will not be much better than this. It's a shame that this is one of those shows I would love to love.
