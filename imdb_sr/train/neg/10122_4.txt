Another early film by Alfred Hitchcock, which seems to have been made out of a contractual obligation. As with Juno and Paicock, you can say that Hitchcock had little interest in this film. There is almost no style or craftsmanship. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young married couple, who come in for some money and go on a cruise that turned out to be a test of their marriage. Emili is given a chance for a new life with a good heart, a wealthy man who falls in love with her, but he decided on a high path and stayed with his husband. This might look more convincing if Fred would not be a totally impassive, pompous ass who jumps for the first time to leave his wife for another woman. The couple stays together, but the film lacks any real scene of reconciliation. The third rank goes in a completely different direction, with a steam that is stranded on an abandoned ship and saved by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry does not give a very exciting performance to the faithful wife of an unbelieving husband. That's all you can say about this.
