I am a great fan of war films and, as a Vietnamese fighter, I have some experience with technical details. I worked with the bombers many times and had nothing but respect for them. Other veterinarians, especially veterinarians in Iraq, have well summed up the inaccuracy of this film. A poetic license is one thing, but this film is a complete fantasy, and that's why it's badly broken. No bomb disposal unit, or any unit, would ever tolerate this hijacker for more than 5 minutes. Military units for good reason reward compliance and discipline, save lives. The introductory scene made me very special. A guy with a mobile phone would be shot right away. Vika, Stop Stop is not an effective deterrent. From there it is up. Scenes with a sniper were particularly unpleasant. As others have noticed, your average EOD type does not know how strong a sniper is, and think that any Arab sniper is that it's good to grow imagination well. The abduction of an Arab businessman for some kind of personal revenge would simply not have happened. Someone could kill him, but this kind of risk-taking is limited to movies. I could proceed, but, as I said, others have pointed out these things in detail. This is not a good movie, and if it wins any awards, this is an additional reflection of why La La Land is so named.
