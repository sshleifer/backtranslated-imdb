"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) gathers a group from a high school gathering in the cabin where his twin brother, Ves, disappears. While there, a reptilian creature in the form of a man (reminded me of Gillman from the CREATURE OF BLACK LAGUNA) is waiting in the desert to choose the right time to separate them one by one. Biker, Ellen Riplei's type of female bad spirit, Kat (Chase Masterson) has an underground military bunker in which he practices experiments, while also serves as a place of safety for things on bloody rampage. Ket knows more than she says (she also suffered a loss of a child), but there is another novelty that most groups do not have. This creature can only be more human than they realize ... and his former identity could illuminate the deception that another person was hiding from Vesna's death. The floor holds the key for many unlocking mysteries while the group stays close to the cabin. Fortunately, a large part of the film stays far from creatures that jump into the air while we also see the dim screen when we look through the eyes. The film has a melodramatic of Davson's Creek, which often hinders any real tension to be built in a small monster film. The course is very mild, which leads to a relatively boring experience instead of provoking fears. Actors are less lively and uninteresting. Pretty Maggie Grace (THE FOG REMAKE) could be the only draw for this film.
