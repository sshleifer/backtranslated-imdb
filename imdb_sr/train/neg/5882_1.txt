I do not know why this movie has been advertised as a wild, strange, funny comedy. There is not much in this movie that will entertain, nor entertain cinemas. Annette Bening (whose act has been proclaimed a worthy Oscars) comes from the side, as if she's gentle, with her performance that looks routine. Brian Cox's face is confusing and irritating, and the leadership of Augusten? Joseph Cross ?? It seems that there is simply no personality to perform their role. The best thing in the movie is Evan Rachel Vood, but she is not enough to support this boring, distasteful movie. The film has quickly disappeared and seems to be a good reason. Some of the scenes were tiring to me (the scene with Brian Cock and his just-used toilet contradicts some of the worst scenes in 'You and Me and All We Know' and 'Skuid and the Vhale'), some embarrassing and most disturbing . I found the whole experience as a waste of time. Do not waste your time?
