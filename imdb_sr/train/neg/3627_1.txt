I'm never much for classical movies. Films such as Patton, Going My Vai, How Green Was My Valley, Kum, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Sprung with the Wind, Lavrence of Arabia and Citizen Kane brought me. Still, I'd rather watch any of these movies, 3469 times while I was tied to a chair, and not watch the American in Paris once in the most luxurious apartment ever. If I did, I would probably sleep all the time. Artistic color and music were not interested in me, Gershwin or non-Gershwin. Dancing and singing could help insomnia to fall asleep. The dialogue does not coincide with Singin 'in the Rain. Basically, this movie is boring. The only movie I fell asleep while I was watching was Butch Cassidi and Sundance Kid. But you can not blame me. I only slept 5 minutes earlier. 1 star / 10 (Too bad we can not give a zero.)
