I completely agree with other reviewers who were satisfied with "For Birds" who won the Academy Award in 2002 for "Best Animated Short Film" and not for this sick material, which is at best pretentious and appealing to everyone, of course, who does not faith in paradise or hell. The animation was good, but also many animated short films. And, by the way, I love dark humor, but this from the beginning was unattractive. As for the story here: a guy walking and surrounded only by gray (the symbolism here). TV (which appears every few hundred meters further) that it is in heaven, hell, or purgatory. Each time he puts the gun in his head and shoots himself after hearing the news. I suppose it would be ridiculous in two out of three cases.
