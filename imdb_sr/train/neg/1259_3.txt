Thank you, Hollivood. Another movie classic that is completely destroyed by cheap, shallow, effectively heavy and redundant remake. The original "Planet of the Apes" was an intelligent and thoughtful film with a very clear message. It was a movie that almost completely focused on the dialogue, which sounds very boring, but it was actually very interesting. This film, on the other hand, seems to have stopped with almost all dialogues. Instead of a great movie, we get an incredibly stupid two-hour movie. The dialogue is minimized, interaction and character development do not exist, and most of the time it is extremely difficult to understand what is happening. Instead, we get a bunch of meaningless action scenes, some slightly funny single-layer and some very quasi-quasi-intelligent conversations. The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. Monkey makeup is magnificent, and sets and wallpapers are also beautiful. However, this does not deter the fact that "The Planet of the Apes (2001)" is a very shallow and simplified film, filled with thin characters, stupid dialogue and almost nonexistent complication. Please, Hollywood, stop ruining great movies by turning them into meaningless movie hits. , mainly for visualization <br />
