Scari Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea. The last movie was a major effort. Put it next to this load, it's a classic comedy. While the other part was filled with a lot of obsolete humor and cheap recordings, at least it was funny. There is nothing ridiculous in forcible humor. Jokes, rioting and gagging eyes should be naturally funny. Shooting spectators over the head with tired shawls is not cool. The humor in this film was suitable for minor imbeciles who would laugh at anything. When they were concerned about a bunch of high schools, every sense of self-esteem was thrown out of the window. Parodies of the ring are not ridiculous. I watched them in comedies since 1998. Michael Jackson jokes are not cool either. Worse, the ridicule of two spoiled "performers" whose best days were NEVER. The American movie's death was slow. Such films are nails that bang into the trunk. What happened with real humor? I did not laugh loud in the cinema for a long time. Too bad movies rotting the brain. You want proof? Go to the local video store and see what's on the shelves. This movie is bad. Do not believe hyper-u. I'd rather watch Scari Movie 2 in an uninterrupted loop than to suffer through this bad excuse for comedy ever more!
