... and this is this movie. I suppose, if there really is a negative, life-threatening life, the damn souls are tied to a rather unpleasant couch and forced to watch this film on a continuous loop for eternity. Well, maybe it's not that bad, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen next to "Manos, the hand of destiny" ... and I've seen a lot of bad movies, believe me. This is just a movie B, a bad work on the movie at its best (or is it the worst?) What I really did not like in this movie is the moronic duo who threw on the comedy relief. A little comedy is a good thing, but the greater part of the film is focused on the adventures of these two morons, not the "heroes" of this movie, which are actually in it for less time than they are! To be fair, Crovn International has really destroyed the film by adding bad music and poorly editing a job. But honestly, this was probably a bad movie to start, so Crown could not do so much to hurt him. This really needs to be at the bottom of the list. I would not want this on my worst enemy. Actually, it's my kind of camping movie B. It was bad, but I still liked it, despite the rating of one star.
