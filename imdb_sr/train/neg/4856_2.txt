For my life, I can not understand the blind hypothesis and loyalty to this totally incredible movie ...... and I think I have the qualifications to say it .... I am a former Special Operations Specialist with 14 years of "lifestyle" ... This film was totally unrealistic and obviously it was written by someone who did very little research on life in the army, in the battle, or at the team or water level. Three EOD guy Trouncing around Baghdad on your own ????? Get Real ... No Chain of Command ????? Get Real ... EOD Building Cleaning ??? Get Real .... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper Qualified Soldier Sergeant ???? Get Real .... Wait ... I shot and killed a bad guy, and then the two of them left me without shooting or even hurt. Get Real .... I'm a carjack of an Iraqi civilian, while I am only armed with 9 mils, break into another house of civilians, get punked from his wife, and then return to the camp on foot in the middle of Baghdad at night without as much as a scratch or conflict? ??? Get Real ... There's absolutely no compliance with the military protocol {Armi} and there's no resemblance to any military unit I've ever encountered. Totally unbelievable and disrespectful for men and women from EOD who, unlike this poor film, are not wild adrenaline looking for riders but extremely qualified professionals who work an incredibly difficult job.
