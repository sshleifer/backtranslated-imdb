Private practice should be a medical drama. I think my biggest remark is the lack of originality in medical stories. Just watching House, I've "solved" two (out of nine) medical mysteries before doctors did it. Boooring. Seriously, if you are a lazy writer, why not copy some cases from older ER or some obscure Brazilian medical soap operas? The house is latest and popular - it's hard to get your ideas out of recycling ... The second biggest complaint: these people should be forty and something, right? Why then must they behave with the emotional maturity of a 15-year-old? Is three weeks (ie Three Whole Cursed Episodes) of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend does not want to be your "friend with benefits," maybe it's not because he wants to hurt you, but because you do not You do not want to risk your friendship? The character who is doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way - the whole story is so unrealistic that it can not really get into the alleged "drama". And I will not even complain about what the show did to everyone's favorite Addison as we met her in Grey's Anatomy ... In view, do not you think it's funny how Addison ends lusting after the loser Petea (I'm sorry, but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with Mozart's Rechui is a loser, Doctor or not) and Derek ends up knitting with the fierce, irritating Meredith miles away in the rain Seattle? Apart from that small throw with Mark, they seemed to be perfect for each other. Sometimes I think subconscious Shonda Rhimes is trying to tell us that in our relations our first choice is often true ...
