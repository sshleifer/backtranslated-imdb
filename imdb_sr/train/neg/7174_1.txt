I wanted to read other comments before I left my review, and most definitely prescribe: This film is thrilled! From acting to unrealistic animation to innumerable errors. In fact, I was hoping that the clusters would expand with imagination (it can not be extended with the calipers without the engine). The chassis can not be lowered if you do not have electricity. That little fan that went was not enough for one stretch to lower the chassis. The only thing I thought was pretty strange when they landed, the last wheels dropped, and then one nose broke off, and so suspended the plane from both the rear tires. How did the captain apply the left and right brakes to tires that did not touch the ground? Did they forget the spoilers? Tell the Director: Find out all * about airplanes before you try to make a movie. We are sorry about the technical war, but I give this film 1/10.
