This film must be the largest pile of C * ^ p pets I've ever seen. See, What else can I say than BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD. There is nothing that could save this 'movie' and I pray that they NEVER talk about the sequel. If you are thinking about watching this, then you need to know that the story is that two men of garbage dragged on to rescue the earth. Movies like black men were torn into pieces and returned together to make this comedy, but TOTALLY fell apart. Please avoid this film (save yourself).
