I actually retreated from Asian horror films some time ago, after I became completely ill when I saw trash with a history of ghosts. However, recently I was getting explosive shifts all the time, so I decided to give them another chance. My first port was a high-ranking director of Takashi Miike, 'Visitor K'. I already watched Audition, and although I did not like it much, I regard it as one of the better modern Asian movies of horror. So, I went into this with reasonable expectations; and unfortunately, she found only boredom. I suppose this film is really smart and it just crossed my head, but it seemed to me that it was just a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no coherence between them. Any comparison with the work of Louis Bunuel and David Linch is blasphemous about me; everything Miike did was to make a movie; all the intelligences that surrounded him were carried by pretentious fans, desperately seeking some kind of meaning. My headache set in about 10 minutes (after a father for some reason had sex with his daughter), and did not calm down until the film finally ended; at least twenty-four hours later, or at least it looks. Do not misunderstand me, I am not against violence in movies, and I'm actively looking for the most notorious films; but as long as this can be violent, it is just as absurd and boring and I have not received a single ounce of enjoyment. Takashi Miike may have many fans, but I'm certainly not one of them; and I hope this will be the last time I get in touch with one of his films.
