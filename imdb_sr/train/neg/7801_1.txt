I will keep this as short as possible, because this shit hardly justifies the mention. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst films ever made - right there with Schnaas' second terrible zombie - ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films are so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be recorded. Somehow I succeeded (hardly ...) to sit through ZOMBIE DOOM - but the ZOMBIE 90 is so awfully incapable - even compared to Schnaas' second horror movie - that I had to go quickly after all the first 10 minutes. A ZERO actor's skill, an incompetent bastard, a horrible camcorder in the camera, funny dubbing ... just goes on and continues. I really can not find any one thing to get rid of this garbage - and usually I can find something that can be used in any movie. This is really one of the worst movies ever made - You are warned ... 1/10
