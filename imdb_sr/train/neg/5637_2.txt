I understand that I want to make a movie that is sharp and different. I understand that the previous commentator comments that this is a film that is misunderstood. The point is that as soon as this film is over, my first comment was: "It happens when a rich princess wants to be a movie star and has no talent" ..... she uses daddy's money to make a movie that she writes, directs, and pays for ..... apparently close to the film to realize that there was no character development and there are no directions such as the beginning, middle and end ..... part of the voyeur was good and nervous, but what is the point? I saw women go to the house, find some pictures, watch the guards, come out on a very cold night (not convincingly) to check the noise and run over her lover .... the movie ends ... .do anyone teaching my ignorant Arss? I really want to know what the point is ... what was the director's vision ... why there is no development of a dead lover? Why is there no background guard? What is the point of night vision? What is the meaning of rose on a car? Why the dead guard? Why are you telling us about the escape of the soul? What about the hour? Oh and the lamp is to suppose this is a house? Territorial? Why? Why would the guard feel like his house? this aspect was never persecuted ... as for Villiam Defoe ... I rented this movie because it was in it and it's known for sharp characters ..... write back and tell me what I have to learn .. .. I am only mom in Central America who loves movies ... Chris ....
