In the days before the Toxic Avenger, the kings of the low camp in Troms Films tried to take a high (OK, something less-low) way of producing flat slider paintings. I'd like to think that watching the results here is what convinced them to give up all the pretensions and go on to self-aware parody.

I would pay good money to see someone from a jerk with a pregnant girl, or a stupid Lothari who was joking with his girlfriend's girlfriend, or any of the creepy priests. No justice.
