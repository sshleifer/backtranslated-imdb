I do not know how this movie got so many positive reviews on this site! I'm a big fan of the fan and I'm very familiar with the story about this original Shovtime movie, which is incredibly ruined, but even if I'm not, bad acting, VERY bad casting (Sean Astin as brilliant, athletic and everywhere around you), Harrison ?? The man is completely generic!) And substandard writing has made this trophy barely visible. Somebody showed how sweet the line is Maculai Culkin. If you read it and thought it was a pure comic brilliance (unfortunately, this was probably the most interesting part of the movie), you might like this movie. But if you're a Vonnegut fan or not quite crazy, you do not see him. Please.
