I looked at Netflik and came across this movie. As a child I had a nice memory of the book, I decided to check it out. This is a movie you really should download. It's simply not worth a look. It's very boring and uninteresting. I feel that it would be the same for young children. It does not have the magic that the book contains. This movie is not horrible, but you'll just find yourself not to worry about ten minutes for it. There are moments that simply turn out strange. The magic figure is not very good. The family behaves as if it does not matter what happens to these strange things. I know this is a children's movie, so that as an older audience we should not look too deep in fact, but the entire film only feels like it was written and produced by people who had never had any experience in the movie before. DVD that I started to skip in the last moments of the film, and instead of trying to fix it, I turned it off and sent it back to Netflik. I really did not care about that. Skip this movie and read the book.
