I see a lot of movies. I've seen original war games years ago and I loved them. Computers that are still a "great mystery" for most of us and the movie were convincing, in their own way. This, however, looks like a low budget Wednesday. Totally shit, from beginning to end. The action is so weak that you will not believe until you see a movie (which I would not recommend first). I can not point out an actor who really did a good job in this movie. But hey, with this script I would be surprised if anyone could do a good job. A lot of clich√© scenes. CGI looks like it was removed from the '86. Baha, no, in a bad mood, I'm just writing about this. DO NOT watch this movie. Life is short to spend it on watching a shitty movie.
