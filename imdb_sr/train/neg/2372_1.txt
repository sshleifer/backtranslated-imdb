The unthinkable stupid, superfluous and humiliating closure of "Nightmare on Elm Street" - a series! Part 6 is so incapable that it seems that the director Rachel Talalai deliberately wanted to transform the initial premise of Vesa Craven into a big and unpleasant joke. This is not just the worst entry into the Elm Street saga; it's also one of the most shameful horror movies ever made, and this is an insult to the fans of this genre! The story is stupid, the drawings of the characters are funny, the structure is blurred and ?? mostly? special and visual effects resemble those from the Tom & Jerry cartoon. The sequences in which Freddy Krueger kills his victims are endless and very uninteresting. Should we be petrified when Freddy fooled Breckin Meier in the video game and hit him around the walls of the house? The story takes us back to Springwood and it seems that Freddie suddenly has a middle-aged daughter. I would think that he would mention it in one of his previous adventures, but no? In Springwood only one surviving teenager is used and Krueger uses it to get in touch with her long-lost daughter. Another reason why this final war is so terrible is a completely illogical structure. John Doe-boi is presented as a leading figure, but then he suddenly dies and the plot continues to turn to two adults! What do you say: Freddy Krueger, who spent five whole movies killing only teenagers, eventually gets beaten by two adults in 3D glasses! It's like destroying the whole essence, is not it? As far as I'm concerned, "Nightmare on Elm Street" has always been a terribly overrated series, but so far, even the weakest entries have had at least some of the elements that they have bought. "Freddi's Dead" is, however, simply unbearable and nobody should lose its precious time looking at it.
