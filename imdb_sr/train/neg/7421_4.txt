Watching how beautiful women are sneaking around, playing cops and robbers is one of the most pleasurable pleasures that the media gives me to enjoy. So, the House on Carroll Street was not a complete waste of time, although the story is fictitious, and the script is unexpected and somewhat irritating. McGillis is in the lead. She's dressed like Grace Kelly, not far away. Not at all. But her character is not convincing. The way she is familiar with the audience, she should be someone with political beliefs and purpose in life. After all, the film deals with a clearly defined time period, true events and a specific issue. But in the first minutes, the story degenerates into a sad criminal story with incredible coincidences, high predictability and a series of two-dimensional characters. It's even more sad, because performances by actors are good, as are photographs and scenography. Finale at Central Station, New York is taking breath. It starts in the underground, then moves to the roof. The film boasts a good use of architecture.
