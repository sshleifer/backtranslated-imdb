Alan Alda plays the real "Sports Illustrated" writer George Plimpton, who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. Instead, the ineffective drama is curiously restrained by fantasy. Director Alek March makes an interesting story about this material, shoots it on a quasi-documentary mode (with swordsman comments), yet gives the story to the touch of the Capraeskue capricorn; yet, bringing film glamor in this setting, he turns the main narration into confusion. Aldin's self-inflicted, non-hazardous performance is another handicap, although the auxiliary act is filled with real pro-sportsmen (and the great Lauren Hutton as Aldina's girlfriend - how about fantasy?). * 1/2 of ****
