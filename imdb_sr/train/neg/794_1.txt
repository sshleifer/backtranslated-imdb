Unless you are already familiar with pop stars playing in this movie, save yourself time and stop reading this review after you arrive at the end of the next sentence. ABOVE VI EVERY FILM AND SEE ANOTHER SECOND. But if you insist on reading, consider: Lame for a Japanese teen idol-beautiful boy with a meaningless, intricate "plot" pulling out for an unbearable amount of time until you be ready to scream. Nothing in this movie makes any sense. It is an endless series of people expressing different emotions, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, NON-GOOD REASON. Obviously, something incredibly "dramatic" is happening, but we simply DO NOT GIVE SATISFACTION for why there is no background. By the time this film is over, you will be sick and tired. these stupid, long, feminine faces. You will be upset by spending all this time watching them laugh, laugh, cry, look mysterious, be "serious", and any other meaningless expression that spit on the faces. ever go so far as to refer this piece of meaningless garbage to the "soul" of any of her "actors", which should prove to you beyond the shadow of suspicion that your trailer and countless comments on this website will not say: <br /> Only "turned", foolish minions will love this movie, most of them teenagers with pathological worship for everything that is androgynous. Freud would have a day on the field. Unless you are one of those foolish "fans", be away from this horror.
