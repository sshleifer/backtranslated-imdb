The previous poster obviously worked on the film. It's a joke that's bad and nobody would look at this kind of film the way it did. Recollecting all the names of the actors and of what was previously certain is a sign that he is involved in some way. > Now at Cinemaku and I was sure it was a movie in which the porn stars (those called Ava are beautiful and well-endowed) were forced to do something else for some crazy tax reason. Also, when I first saw it, I was sure it was made around 1986, and I was born in '73, so I thought I knew what I was talking about ... but no ... 1993! Incredibly! Although I would call it one of those so bad that they are good movies. It's like watching a wreck of a train.
