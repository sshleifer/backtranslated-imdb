I admit that I liked the first one, and I was really looking forward to it. <br /> <br /> I was betrayed. We are sure that the special effects are technically incredible - but they were not convincing. It looked more like a cartoon. Okay, I admit I love 80% of the hunting scene - but the fight with all Mr. Smiths? It was too obviously animated. All I can accept. What I can not accept is that parts that did not work were shit. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew that for a speech that lasted forever and nothing meant anything. What this film did is tell us that there was no truth in the first film (except for the existence of a matrix). This movie looked a bit like watching a DALLAS episode where you learned that the whole previous season was a dream. Ugh! I want to back my $ 7.00!
