This documentary begins with an interesting premise - it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus, as is commonly believed, is probably a myth. Unfortunately, after it has brought us to this, the film completely changes speeds and becomes more than a non-stop attack on Christianity, and mainly focuses on light targets. there are some problems with the Church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some lawful anger) and this film looks like his form of release. It would be interesting to see the first 20 minutes, but in general, the film is disappointing.
