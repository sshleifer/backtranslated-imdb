I watched this movie on March 21 this year. I can say disappointment. But much better than "Tridev". The plot is hacked. In any case. Azghar Jhurhad is plotting to kill his young brother. He made a plan by sending several people. They came to school pretending to be friends of Prabhats. He and Aakash go to Kenya to find him. \ TSunni gives a good performance, Chunki is at best boring, Naseerdun is consumed. The film was cute. He's sorry he had to kill his character. The girl was sweet, but she was irritating. The other kid was doing a good job. Alok worked fine. The script is poor, but it has some good dialogues. It also retreats. Movie. Music Was Okay I liked only one song "Saat Samundar", the songs of that song were good. Other songs were forgotten. Do not look at this. Score-3/10
