DVD with Treasure Island should be needed for watching any course of film production! It's a textbook example of NOT filming a movie. Watching a movie and listening to writer / director's comments graphically depicts a huge gap between what he knows about characters and what he is communicating with his audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I consider films to be a means of communication, and communication is not complete if the audience does not know what the hell is, the director says. The director intends to make a film without any "Hollywood convention". Among these conventions, unfortunately, is the consistency of the character and the clarity of the term. The director himself realizes that the audience often does not understand the points in which he deliberately avoids "Hollywood clichés". However, he does not seem to realize that the clichés exist for a reason. They are short for quick and clear transmission of complex ideas. It's okay to avoid them, but they need to be replaced by some other way of communicating the same idea, and not simply eliminated. The film was built on an intriguing room, rich in potential. Two dolls are in charge of inventing a personality and background for an unidentified body to be used in the misinformation mission in the last days of the Second World War. Soon everyone starts to reduce his personal fantasies to the likes and their invention becomes more and more realistic for them. Someone with less contempt for the Hollywood convention of traditional narrative can create a wonderful film with this idea. This film is certainly not! The dolls are doing everything they can to bring these characters consistently, but they are more often defeated by a stunned and confused scenario. Especially I am more impressed with Gonzo, who plays a live body. In a large number of muppet movies, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.
