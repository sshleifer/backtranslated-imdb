1st vatched 12/24/2009 ?? 4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): An emotional Christmas cereal that is not specific enough to explain how the real story happened in this factual incident of a man who was wrongly put in prison trying to get hired to make his family make Christmas for them. Three family children then escaped from home on their way to Washington to hire former US President Herbert Huver. This move provides some stories from the side such as their positive encounters with a rogue and a puppet, which makes the story a Disney movie "Animal on the move" and does not fit right here. In the end, there are no details about how the president helped the family and this is another weak side of the film, in my opinion. The film eventually brings tears, but it takes too much time. The film should not be an original TV movie (according to IMDb), but there are obvious fade-outs that make it look like this? so I'm not sure that their information is correct. All in all, this is a simple movie (which could have been more complex) with a happy Christmas story, but with a barely played and without much content.
