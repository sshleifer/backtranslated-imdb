I gave these 4 stars because there are many interesting topics that many have mentioned here already. From domestic violence, to sexuality and many taboos in it. Above the mountains I would not call this horror as much as I would a science fiction. It is gloomy, depressing and hopeless. Although I do not mind less than a happy ending, I am really tired of the clich√© "people are coming down" which is crucial for every movie. I know that today you can not acquire a diploma of liberal arts without falling in love with hatred towards yourself as a member of the human race, but as a writer / director, we pretend to be different from all the others in the pack, noting that strangers who kill human race evil! Right now, if you read this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go outside, find the lake and swim until your arms are tired. In this way you will not be near to direct the next movie or write the next book that tells me that I deserve to die for life. It's stupid, not imaginary and boring.
