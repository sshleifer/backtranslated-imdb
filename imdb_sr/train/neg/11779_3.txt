I do not like this movie much. If you read Puzine's book, or you watched at least two first films (especially first), you will agree with me. Compared to the presented Corleone's saga by Puz's novel, the screenplay of this film is sometimes even ridiculous. The characters and relations between them are distorted. The story ends nowhere, although it seems to go in a certain direction during the film. It is understandable that for Corleone's saga in the 90's can be expected different times, and that we will not be able to find things as they used to be. But, on the other hand, I do not know why they had to copy some dialogues from other films, in contexts when they did not respond. Why is this? It sounds like they're badly made sequels that just try to copy the quality of the original movie. What will never be understandable is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino have teamed up to do this. The man who directed the pieces like Apocalypse now and Kuma must be forgiven for almost everything he does in the cinema until he dies. Like Al Pacino, he's an actor. But Mario Puzo was not supposed to write this. How to? He has damaged all his previous works. What a pity, my friend. Puz's novel "The Last Don" is a 90th story about the mafia, and that's great. We can never say the same about the Kuma III plot.
