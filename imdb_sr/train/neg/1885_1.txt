If you are looking for a movie that shows the meaningless and boring existence of middle-class life caught in a network of non-communication and false ideals, then this is a movie for you. If and what you want to attract and keep your interest in, you should look somewhere else. There are many movies that do it much better. For example, try some of Bergman's darker films. The film creator felt that, in order to demonstrate spiritual poverty of the middle class, he would have to subject the viewer to a painful and senseless incident after another until the film finally comes to its curvy and pathetic end. If you appreciate your time, there are far better ways to spend two hours, such as cleaning your home, for example.
