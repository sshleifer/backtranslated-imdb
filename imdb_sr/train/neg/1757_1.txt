Do not misunderstand me, Dan Jansen was a great slider. If at the Olympics there was one guy who deserved his gold medal, it was Dan. But how is it possible that Bill Corcoran made such a bad movie about the incredible story of Dan Jansen, because the real story of Dan Jansen is truly incredible! Especially when you look at this movie to an athlete's eye, everything is wrong, as Matt Keeslar and other actors glide, their technique, the dimensions of oval speed skating, everything is wrong! Shame on you, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves better, much better! <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
