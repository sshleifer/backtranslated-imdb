Possible compounds, maybe. I must say that "Cinderella II: Dreams Become a Reality" is one of the worst films ever made. First of all, the film was filmed during the climax of Disney's continuing rampage. It was created around the same time as "Little Mermaid II," "The Book of the Jungle II" and "Peter Pan II," all of which were negative services to their original film classics. (Disney also recorded "Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II", but I will reject this theme because their original films were never really classics. ") Let me say that I am a passionate supporter of good Disney movies, and absolutely In the original, the Cinderella was kind and polite, and the new Cinderella had very unusual moments with current phrases such as "I'm going to make this banquet in my own way! "you this new Cinderella (as I am her I'm trying to find the best in people, but below, Anastasia, one of the shepherds, is good! Why? They made everything to be like Lada Tremaine and Drizella are just horrible family members for poor little Anastasios My question to the world: Did Disney people watch the original "Cinderella" when they made this sequel? Well, it certainly does not look like that. If I remember well, Anastasia was equally offensive to Cinderella as Drizella and Ladi Tremaine. I am all for redemption and forgiveness, but in this film there was no point in Anastasia. In the first, Anastasia was evil. The other one is good. One can not leave such a story. I hope that Disnei understands that this film, besides the other films, is disgraceful with the name Valt Disney. Maybe now that Michael Eisner has gone, things will begin to form around the Mouse House.
