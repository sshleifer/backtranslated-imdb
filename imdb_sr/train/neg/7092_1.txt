This film (not a movie - clearly captured on a cheap camcorder) can be one of the biggest movie stink bombs in history. Beware: the packaging advertises a movie as an erotic exploration of sex addiction. The film does not explore anything and is not more erotic than looking at its own nipples. The scenario is pointless and curvy, with all the elements of the plot that serves as a segway between the alleged scenes of sex. However, even scenes of sex are lame lame. Apart from the first, they are about three seconds long (so again, maybe my version is cut out) and comically overwhelmed. If you are looking for a decent movie, you do not want this. If you are looking for a wild movie, you do not want this. Whatever your life goals, desires or perspectives are, you do not want to watch this movie. How they got Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski and Ed Begli to act in this stinking bomb is confusing in extreme sense.
