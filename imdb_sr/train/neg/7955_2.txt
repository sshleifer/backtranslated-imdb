Carrie Fisher has said on several occasions that she made this film during her lifetime when she had a severe problem with cocaine, and she does not remember that. It would explain why she made this film, but that does not explain why anyone else in the actor's crew or crew worked; I can not believe that EVERYONE had a problem with the chicken. This has to be one of the absolutely worst films ever made, and it's saying something. The guilty can not be placed on the feet of "director" by Tim Kinkeid or "writer" Budija ƒêovinacza, since it is obvious that nobody has written or directed this picture. Apparently, it only spontaneously came together because it has little evidence of coherence, consistency, design, complication, sense, intelligence or anything else. What's really amazing is that there were some real professionals who were involved in this bastard. Co-actor Robert Joi did a good job in other films, and composer Jimmie Haskell and cameraman Arthur Marks are industry veterans, Marks was also a director, but not bad. Why are they involved in this pile of intestines from within is not understandable. Tim Kincaid, the alleged "director", has made a few low rentals of sci-fi and horror films and, after seeing most of them, I can tell you that none of them is good. This, however, is by far the worst thing he has ever done, and that is a great success on his part. All, absolutely ALL, about this film is at best the twelfth rate. Cinema is terrible, acting is ridiculous, "special effects" make "Plan 9 out of the Universe" look like "Spider-Man," the story is truncated, derived and stupid. Do not waste time even if you look at the cover of the video box, let alone rent it. Complete, complete, boring, total stupid.
