Note that I gave this 1 star if the given option would give this zero. While I put this DVD in my TV and sat down on my couch, I expected some of the worst film achievements at its best. I looked at this IMDb movie and saw that it was the worst-rated movie, so I guess I came up with it critically against every mistake. But that did not prepare me for the shit that was supposed to be thrown out of my television screen. The box makes this movie a good looking okay. DO NOT LEAVE YOURSELF. This film should be banned on all shelves around the world. The best way to describe this movie is like porn, but without any sexual scenes in it. Act (if you can call it that way), "plot" (so many holes must look like Swiss cheese), and special effects are really just horrible. Hire this movie because you think it will be fun to watch. At the end I'm not saying I can make a better movie than this, but I think.
