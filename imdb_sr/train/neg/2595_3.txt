Are you joking that it's AVFUL !!! But, no matter what I got this movie and 3 more, all were on DVD. The film begins with a great deal of OK film, but goes downhill from the middle to the next. And it's good to say that it was one of the most colorful anti-climatic finishes in recent film history. Much worse at the end of the sequence, and if you love the horror horror dose then this is a movie for you ... <br /> 3/10
