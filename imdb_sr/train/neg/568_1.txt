This "debuted" today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is "I am without a word". I had great hopes, now I tear the cabinets looking for the length of the rope so I could hang it. Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. I wish I could say something nice like "It was fun to make fun of this movie," but this film does not give me anything to do. I know you should not be putting a spoiler here without a warning, but I'll go anyway "This movie is bullshit" I said there! They need to show this film to filmmakers to show them what they do not need to do! My nine-year-old niece could make a better movie. The only decent thing in this movie is sound and / or soundtrack. OH! I just found a rusty C-terminal in the old toolbox. I will put him on the thumb of my left hand and tighten until the pain removes the memory of what my eyes have seen. I could just shoot it through this VHS, but I think I will burn it in the fire. I can wash with soap, but I'm afraid I will never be clean anymore. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to people you hate. - Mike
