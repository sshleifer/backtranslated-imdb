This film is another Christian propaganda film in the Omega code line. Not that it is necessarily bad, but because of the fact that most propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message they want to achieve. If you enjoy the portrait of a styrofoam of life in the streets and the way the Gospel can change your life, you may perhaps enjoy this movie. I say, save your money and rent a cross and a switch or mission. When will Christian leaders know that sometimes people say bad words? It was frustrating to see that criminals who are not allowed to swear are shown (huh? The criminals say bad words?) And the plagiarized characters that I really could not relate to. Also, it would be great if the film showed some T & A. It would be something I would like to pay to see. Who was the stupid one who compared this story about a tiny story about a movie with Saint Boondock and Sting?
