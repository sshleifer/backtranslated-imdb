Cuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent who blames himself on the murder of the American president, I will immediately point out that this is not the kind of role for which this talented actor is known, and this film shows us why. He unites with a persistent news reporter (Angie Harmon) to discover a plot about the death of the president, and so on, blah, blah, blah. Even with actor James Woodes, Cuba Gooding Jr. , Anne Archer and Angie Harmon 'End Game' fail to attract your attention, simple and simple; Some of the actions are good, acting is not all bad, and the story, although clich√© and done before, could lead to a fun and enjoyable movie - GOOD TO DO IT! Writing the script and direction are absolutely certain that it does not get you into a story at any time or make you think of any character. 4/10 It's boring, predictable and Dull.
