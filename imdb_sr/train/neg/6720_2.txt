Here's a movie that would, if it originated in Australia, be easy comedy. Sadly and boring, here he is, relaxed and syrusly and overflowing from the land of Lala. How did the di-erector make such a mistake? Well, mostly because you are serious about a job that is so astoundingly astounding that nobody in a healthy mind can not seriously grasp. Unless, of course, they were a nerd solitary gai cliché (but somehow cute) ... or this cliché is piled on clichés. There is no value in a story that almost seems to be a sign to GERRI's Gus Van Sant ... and with a headline like FLUFFER, how is it all such a lead weight? Well, this author must be crazy that he did not get to Burt and BOOGIE first to make his own. Intricate and undeveloped, apart from the theme of "unrequited love is boring" that remained from the faded Lyrical music of Streisand, we only left the story of trouble and TV series. The necessary fourth act of this long-running sharp drama is really terrible because the film is cast as Geri's in the desert and stuck there. In the late 1990's, Oz made a similar, but actually hilarious film called MONEISHOT. Originally recorded as VENUS FACTORS, he suffered too much from the author more than Orson's, so they recorded a half, received a ruthless TV editor to cut it and drop it for 72 minutes and hey-presto .. comedy, tonight! A lesson in which bad films turn great. I guess FLUFFER got stuck after the release and after I saw it did not work, I can understand why.
