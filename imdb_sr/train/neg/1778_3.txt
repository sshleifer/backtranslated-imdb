I have nothing against a quick jerk, but this stupidity from Stephen King is too freshly ejected, too bright and modern. The plot, about a new teenager in a small town called Sleepwalker - a kind of cross between a vampire and a werewolf - and fed by the blood of female virgins, prays for a mysterious, ambiguous treatment. This thriller has an inadequate colorful look and feel, with almost no atmosphere. The children are predictably beautiful and energetic, but the big plus is Alice Kridge as the boy's boy; Kridz, from "Ghost Story", never came out of filling-female molds, and that's a huge loss that was no longer used. Its performance is creepy and intense, and suggests that "Sleepwalkers" may have been a much better movie with a different focus and a stronger direction. It's too over-the-top and commercially driven, with an uneven tone that swings wildly from the thriller to comedy to drama. Stephen King appeared in the kamaja, as well as real-life directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 of ****
