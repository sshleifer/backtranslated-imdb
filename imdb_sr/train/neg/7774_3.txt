In about half an hour, I remember thinking: "Hey, this could be the best achievement of Bill Rebane ever!" Introductory sequences are atmospheric, there are immediately terrible moments to enjoy, and our director even plays a playful way on his notorious stink "The Giant Spider Invasion". The concept is shamelessly stolen from the House of Defiled Hill by William Kastell, with three old and very boring millionaires who cheat nine losers in an isolated villa to win $ 1,000,000 in an elimination game. Of course, the participants begin to disappear quickly and one by one, and the remaining greedy bones need too much time before they realize that the old people are sadistic ... or that there is another killer among them. The film begins and ends with a strange storyteller who talks a lot of pointless things that are not relevant or even interesting for the plot, but there are some nice T & A we admire for the first ten minutes and that stupid bimbo (Shelley, I believe it's called) is really funny to watch. After the first half an hour, of course, inevitably happens and "Cold" turns into a Rebane-production tape with backward complications, a slight dialogue, and a complete lack of excitement. There was no budget for the bloody sequence of murders, but our multi-talented director (?) Is trying to make up for this endless recordings of disco dancers and amateur rock band. The film also has four or even five different climax and none of them is slightly satisfactory. Maybe it was an inspiration for LOTR: The Return of the King? Avoid this film, you will live longer and happier.
