I just saw Dick Tracy and I thought it was terrible. Images in the background of cities looked terrible. Also, the mafia characters looked too weird. Varren Beatty did not do a terrible job like Dick Tracy, but he was definitely not one of his better performances. Madonna needs only to keep singing. Glenn did a good job in this movie. I gave this film 2/10 just for the incredible acting of Al Pacino. In his career that was not a big deal, but he did a good job.
