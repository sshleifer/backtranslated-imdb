"Man in the attic" was a film set up in the 1910s. He was inspired by the true story. Unfortunately, this is a story that really should not have been told. Watching the box, the people responsible for filming the film tried their best to make this movie look odd and erotic. They use terms such as "unlawful passion", "forbidden affair" and "unlimited pleasure". They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris holding a gun! The story includes Christ, played by Anne Archer. She is unhappily married to a gentleman who owns her own business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband's company. Christ and Edward are falling in love each other. Allegedly, the "shocking" part of the film is this: Kristin's husband finds out about this affair and forbids them to never again see each other. So what do they decide to do? Christ ends up with Edward on the attic. Wow! Christ sees someone else, and Edward is very jealous. And so on and so forth. The "Man on the attic" does not cover any new territory. This is the original image of Shovtime, which explains why the stars are a couple of actors from the B-list, and both appear briefly in the basket. <br /> <br />
