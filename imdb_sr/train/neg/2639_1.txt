Let's start this review first with the fact that I MUST ENCOURAGE TO WRITE A REVIEW AND WARNING THE PEOPLE TO SAVE MONEY! This was one of the worst pieces of garbage I've seen from The Hulk. The story was most likely a garbage you could come up with. If you expect 24, but on the big screen, immediately flush this expectation in the toilet together with the money that you will use for the ticket. This way you can get more enjoyment. The act was terrible, the plot was completely unrealistic (along with the so-called "twist" in the end. I have to say that .. The end has surprised me. I do not mean the complication that surprised me, but without the effort that put together what would be could be regarded as the only scene of somewhat decent action in the whole movie, they rushed so quickly to the end that I did not realize that it was almost until I saw how the credits turned and then I was thinking of burning the film if I could just figure out how to get in there room to show. Casting was awful from for several reasons, because Michael Douglas played a role that CLEAR Keifer Sutherland was supposed to play while Douglas shuffled around the agents, listening to telephone lines, hacking systems and pulling out the people who followed him, Sutherland plays a less capable agent who is always in ab \ t advertising mood even when things do not go so bad.He plays a very mild agent, nothing like his Jack Bauer type who loves us with 24 fans. I can promise you this film will disappoint in all areas. It can be best compared to the remake of "Fugitive" / "In the line of fire", but written by people with mental disabilities.
