The basic action in this movie is not bad. The lady makes him big and returns to her alma mater that she adores. But, despite the good acting of Robert Jane and Eve Arden, the film is a mess. I'm putting the blame on Joan Crawford or the director or both, because her performance is terrible. Instead of being a real person, she makes a beautiful presentation of deer caught in headlights. In other words, it looks into the universe and has "naked I'm SOOOO stunned" term. After only a few minutes, it really bothered me. Now that certainly is not the only Cravford film I do not like in her performance, as she did more than her participation in films such as JOHNNI GUITAR or many of her later films, such as BERSERK! My advice is to try another Cravford movie - it must have been better.
