warning: Contains a spoiler. If the film starts with a scene of sex then it's a bad movie. (see, for example, 300). This confirms the upper lemma. The second scene is the center for rotating all the actions. The fact that we know the end makes the movie boring. Moreover, other plots are discovered as the story goes back and forth several times. And it made it even more frustrating. To compensate for the lack of uncertainty, we learn more and more about how the characters are unbalanced. And yes, they have a lot to show. Andy (P.Hoffman), for example, is a drug addict, more ?, he cheats on his wife, more?, Plans to rob her father, more, his wife cheating with his brother, more? I'm sorry for my complicity in the death of his mother, more? He's a serial killer, more? etc. etc. there is not enough room for writing here ... I wonder how he could have a top job. And why his wife had not left her before. On the other hand, I enjoy the performances of actor Hofman. Even here PSH saves what's left of my $ 7 spent on this absurd. Why absurd? Because it does not make sense, why should I take care of the scary characters? Another broken sheet is that the film should have a nice (at least pleasant) character. Likewise, there is a lot of sentimentality, for example, we should take care of the suffering of the widow without knowing anything about the parents before the crime.
