By working in a video I see a lot of movies and occasionally I try to watch some of the not so big movies. He was proud to be one of them. The original idea of ​​talking about a black boat that was primarily black in the Second World War had some credit. However, in less than 10 minutes of watching the movie, you find that the primary point of the film was to talk about racial tension in World War II. The story is about the ship, the crew and their undertakings in the war. This primary point is pinned in you to the point of exaggeration throughout the film. I commend the people who served at USS Mason because of their triumphs over the troubles and difficulties they suffered. It was necessary to make a film that focuses on the accomplishments that these people have done for themselves, for the navy and for their country, and not for filming the film whose focus is racism during World War II.
