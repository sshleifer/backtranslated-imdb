Ugh! Another one of those "duped DVDs". I expected some sort of action at least with bears, cats and the like on the cover. I have nothing! Bad movie! I forced myself to look at this through thinking that something will eventually happen ... no luck. is due to landscape; Otherwise, he sucked. The kid was terrible, I talked to myself (although I suppose they could not just run a movie with stupid music and without any dialogue), working their silly karate views on the wood hive, threatening to run through the cheek, chewing worms , and (what is stupid) hitting a dickster. And he would not drag those feathers as easily ... as if they were sticks. At least, I fought several times with a bear (weak). What about the flashback thing? That made a bad movie worse. I wanted to see a survival film, not a dramatic picture of a child suffering from divorce. What else can I say? Well, maybe they should have a baby eat a baby or something. At least that would be more exciting. People, do not waste time on this.
