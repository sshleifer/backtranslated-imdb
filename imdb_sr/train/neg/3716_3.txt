The main character of Lance Barton was killed in the sky before his time. When the paradise finds out the mistake of giving the body to only the late rich old and white Mr. Velington. The young black guy in the old white body still behaves like a young black man may be ridiculous if you see him from an old white actor. In this film, I repeatedly recalled: "Chris Rock should be an old white man." The whole concept does not play properly: "Illusion" is not transmitted well and the love story is not convincing at all. The fact that everything you see is that Chris Rock plays a young black guy, because he is an old white person that everyone should see shown only in small scenes, for the great challenge for viewers is the "suspension of unbelief".
