I'd give her 2/10. I was really, really disappointed. The story was poorly developed, for example, the incidents were too short and short, so the morale was not clearly stated. I thought Brenda Song did a good job, but Shin Koiamada seems to be having difficulty in managing her role. I could see the need to put western elements in the show, but there are certain parts where Chinese elements were needed! For example, a criminal. His physical appearance resembled a robot, rather than something in Chinese culture. The ultimate and worst defect was the inaccurate and distorted fact in the show. Others can point out that this is "Kid's shov" and hence there is no need for such a high level. standards. However, there are other Disney shows, such as Mu Lan, which were much better in terms of developing stories and presentations. In conclusion, I consider that Disney movies need to be better explored and better planned. A good performance is not enough only with a series of martial arts movements that will depend on it.
