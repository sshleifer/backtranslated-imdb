Seeing men behind the Sun, I hope that evolution in style and technique will correspond to the larger extent of this film. I was also very interested to see someone making a hard-fictionalized story of what happened during this most notorious Japanese crime, but that's not it. This is played as one of the lowest European Nazi exploit films from the 1970s - for example, SS experimental camp, etc. (Perhaps more like deported women from a special section). It is permissible to have a larger volume and more people running around, but recourse to the same cheap and unwieldy device of many unfortunate non-actors who throw themselves at the sound of funny fake shots spiced by occasional bad bumps. However, the terrible documentary footage is roughly embedded between the scenes that are so distorted that even these real images take away much of their power. See Channel 4 "Holocaust" (which has recently been broadcast (still ongoing?), Since November 1, 2006) for a truly disturbing documentary about warfare (with excellent use of images in context). This is the kind of treatment that Nanjing deserves, and not this spent explosive waste (a better exploited film less for disregarding the use of images would be fine, but again this is not even a good exploitation film yet). Rating: 3 (5 as exploitation, 1 as a subject's treatment).
