This movie may have poor production values, but that's what makes it good. Special effects are rough and well-done. My favorite part of the movie had to be Chrissi in the performance of Janelle Brady. She is super hot and also has a good naked scene. Robert Prichard as a gang leader is hilarious, like other members. This film is actually trying to point out the fact that nuclear waste facilities are bad. 4/10 Fair comedy, brutal film.
