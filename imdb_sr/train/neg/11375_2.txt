Are you telling me this? (1987) is a rather bad movie starring a guy I've never seen before or acted as a neighborhood guy trying to become an actor. He has heavy jones for taxi drivers, who are trying to use that skate to make it big. When he learns the tough facts of life, he does what everyone else is doing, he changes his image! He goes from a good guy to surf overnight. His friend can not believe the change (but he gets a score with Faith Ford and gets a cool concert). Can this young punk retain his street credibility while making him big? This is a real chromium movie that is too busy to include too many things at the same time. An interesting idea that breaks down due to poor execution. Who knows, maybe somebody will pick up the ball and run because this time the filmmakers wiped the ball. Do not waste time with this movie. Unless you want to see the hot Faith Ford and the young Bubb of Forest Gump. Kk
