After watching this movie on DVD, I watched a trailer. Negotiating voice describes the film as a surreal. Well, there is a surreal, and surreal. It was really just one part of the movie that seemed to me surreal, but honestly, it was more confusing than surreal. Another strange picture, especially the lunch scene in which everyone was on the floor, was so meaningless that they did not have any meaning. I do not mind painting that does not mean anything, but these scenes just looked unimportant. My impression is that the director was trying to pass Logan's internal monologue. I do not know what else would explain what is happening. Unfortunately, nothing I saw did not give me the idea of ​​what Logan was thinking about, what his perspective was, and even his emotional state. All I could say was that he was not particularly pleased with his physical appearance and fell in love with the older boy. I thought the end signaled the relationship between the boy became, but not much else. Intentionally opposing ambiguous scenes to those who were clearer looked more like a copper than an artistic decision. However, as boring and without content, the film was for me, it was definitely a change in the pace. I liked Madagascar Skin very much, and I had the feeling that this film sought such a narration, and maybe even a style. She did not even come close. For me this does not call into question: this film deserves A, but D for execution.
