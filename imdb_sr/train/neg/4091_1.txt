Ah, Lucio Fulci, rest in peace. This notorious Italian is mostly known for "Zombie" and absolutely unobtrusive "Psychiatrist" and "Manhattan Babi." Add this invisible list. The plot, as it is, concerns a non-wearing woman wearing gold Mask and G-string Wants the power of a young flask with a set of magical arrows and onions They are magical because they are bright Arrow boy joined with a guy in a bad wig < br /> and they spend most of the film rescuing each other from straight action sequences. In the end, some chick is defeated, but not before the skin an unea mask and reminded me why I broke up with my girlfriend from high school. Fulci smashes every shot in orange shine and fills the screen Smoke Nothing like a smoky orange series of actions that will make you want the Sunni Delight and the cigarette Special effects are ridiculous In one set, our ambiguous gay duo is attacked by dozens of arrows that are obviously scratched on the film itself. Most of the budget for the effects must have been spent on Fulci-licious Mountains, which consists entirely of wound scattering. Hey, we can all use a good wound once in a, but when you enter the spiral, it gets bored. I always had to play with the lighting setting on the TV anyway just to see what was going on. Much is talking about fulfilling prophecies and prophecies, so let me take a little look into the future ... if you find this movie and watch it, <br /> <br /> < > you'll regret it. The scene on the video field (by the media) does not appear in the movie in any context. "Conquest" is a job. What MST3K could do with this! This is rated (R) because of strong physical violence, strong ups, female nudity, short male nudity and mild sexual content. <br /> <br />
