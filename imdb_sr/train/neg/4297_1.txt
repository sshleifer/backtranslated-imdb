Suddenly I woke up, aware that I would slip on a plastic couch and realize that it was warm Saturday afternoon. Why did I sleep? Have I hit my head? Or accidentally swallow all of my grandmother's intoxicating muscles? Is it narcolepsy in adults? No, for a moment I paused on Cheap seats while surfing the channels, and the stunning lack of humor and talent exhausted my vitality at such a speed that I fainted. Head shaving, mouth-agape, shoulder-shrug shoulders bad. But I have to give these moronic and boring twins credit for selling this idea. Perhaps they had the same effect on the ESPN program executives they had on me, and when he / she woke up, several horrible episodes had already been in the can and he / she hoped that, since all viewers would sleep, no one would now be horrible and will be able to withhold an annual salary of $ 425,000. You are warned.
