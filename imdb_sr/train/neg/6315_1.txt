This elegant, sexy movie is unavoidable. Only in multiple views can one truly understand the uniqueness of this film. I personally enjoy the narrator for his intelligent, no object that has remained intact, the style of narration. Introducing you immediately grabs and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. It provides a wonderful insight into the world of training and allows the audience to truly "connect" with the inner horror that this film exposes. The script itself saves the movie. Not only for children, but also for the elderly, who will better understand the training opportunities and the modern understanding they have about sexual experience. In front of his time and revolutionary work in cinema, he definitely defines the word 'masterpiece'.
