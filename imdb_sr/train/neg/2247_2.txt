Chris Christofferson, at her drugged peak in the mid-'70s, is barely able to push into the screen next to La Streisand's humongous ego and feminism in discounts. No figure is really likable; I was pleased when Kristofferson Ferrari crossed that hill and collapsed. If you want to see a good movie about rock and roll stardom, try _ Buddy Holly Story_ (made only a year and a half) after this shit).
