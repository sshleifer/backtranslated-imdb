The first Cruel Intentions, original, is my favorite movie of all time. It was an absolutely masterpiece. So, so that they can make the sequel so bad. Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in her first movie. In this, Amy Adams is a shit. She's terrible. And could not they find the fish that really looked like Sara Michelle Gellar? At least the same color of hair !!! I mean, come on. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but it's absolutely horrible in comparison to Ryan Phillipe. Sebastian in the first film is cunning, deceptive and much more perverse than Sebastian in the previous film. And what about the story. Basically this goes like this ... 1 - Sebastian has a bad reputation in his first school, so the film says, although there is nothing mentioned about him and his life in relation to life, and how the girls were 2. Sebastian moved to New York, and suddenly decided to turn. He "falls in love" with Danielle (maybe I'll remind you that in the original, Sarah Michelle Giller says the quote "you broke up with the FIRST PERSON you ever loved because I said yes - so that he could be in love with the previous event and everything is nice charming, and all is "a good person," while refusing sex from the chick that his dad worked on. 3 - He ends 180, and ends up. In the three at the end of the film, and then seduced Cherri. </ br /> I mean, it's terrible. I hope God will be better than this predecessor.
