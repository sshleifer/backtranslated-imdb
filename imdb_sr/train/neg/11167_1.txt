Jack Black usually makes me just asleep by breathing, but in this movie ... In addition to direction, writing, lack of complication, constant robbery (with the help and encouragement of constant direct camera shooting), and the average number .050 jokes, it was still the final loss of time. The idea sounds promising, but what kind of potential is lost with the complete lack of comedy and some of the worst directions I've seen on this side of your pipe. I've always heard that this movie is shown to the Mexicans very negatively. Although this is without a doubt the truth, I really do not think this film should be racist. I think it's more the result of a "creative" team that desperately tries to find something ridiculous in this mess. You can almost hear them shouting behind the camera: "Hey, look, it's a nasty Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, love for all things, persistent, laugh!" But put racism racism aside. When you get to that, anyone who has invested good money and time to watch this bunch of residues of processed grains that should be offended, IMO.
