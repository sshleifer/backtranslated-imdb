This is the movie I'm most afraid of. Arrogant and irresponsible, presents a sketch of a Colombian conflict that is so distorted and stupid that it is an offense for all Colombian people. The performances are goddess, from Grisales (her naked scene is absolutely poor), Beyarano, for Fannie Mickey (who looks right from Tim Burton's nightmare), to Diaz, which makes a significant effort to bring life to character both-dimensional, so clich√© and so badly written all he has to do is a mustache. Not to mention the free end, so fierce that Ed Vood was trembling. It does not succeed in all ways, cinematography, artistic directions, costumes, make-up, editing and, above all, directing, Jorge Ali Triana has always been a bad film maker, but at least his previous films had some dignity. I can not say anything good about this waste of money, except that I hope that Colombian filmmakers will learn a lesson about sincerity, integrity and responsibility from this deliberate fiasco.
