(aka: Bloodsucker leads dance) Many naked babies in this with a couple of lesbian scenes. The film should be held in Ireland, but it looks more like Rome and the Adriatic for me. Gothic lesbians are referring to the castle countess island for the weekend. One by one, they seem to miss their heads because of the madness that runs around. It is not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are illuminated by reflectors even though they are candles lit. Go figure ... (sic) Dubbing is worse than usual and the shop serves only as an excuse for eroticism and nudity. Directed by Euro Choir actor Alfred Rica, this is one snoozer. Pretty boring 2 out of 10
