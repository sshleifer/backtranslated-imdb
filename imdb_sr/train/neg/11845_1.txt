... is the only way to describe this film about topics that should be safe: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst laughed with her role as German movie star Marion Davies as if she thought she was in "Legalli Blonde". The guy who plays the Villiam Randolph Hearst game goes to the point where you want to get to the screen and charm it. Eddie Izzard is pretty good, apart from playing Charlie Chaplin, and about 125 pounds is too hard for a role? It is hard to believe that this impeded, uneven wreck directed by Peter Bogdanovich, but again, he did not make a movie that can be seen, what? 30 years? Sometimes there is simply no return.
