This film was so badly written, directed and acting as a proselyte. He should be transformed with a better script, director and casting service. The worst problem is acting. You have Jennifer Beals on the one hand that's polished, professional, and completely convincing, and on the other hand, Ri'chard, who's a misconception and just jarring in this piece. Peter Gallagher and Jenni Levine are terrible as slaves who hold (and hold) a pair, even though they both work normally well. Actors (and the director) should not even try to work accents - they are inconsistent and incredible. It's much better to concentrate on a good job in real English. Casting is funny. Why are the children of the "African" trader (which is less socially desirable for gens de couleur) thrown with very pale actors, while allegedly socially desirable Marcel expresses African lines, including an apparently colored blonde? It is as if Casting Directors can not strive to read the casting scenario and choose the right actors from the large pool of highly talented and physically diverse actors of color. It's so weird! It could be a great movie and should be done again, but with people who respect the material and can choose the appropriate and skillful actors. There are many good actors there, and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would work with the right acting, a good script and a decent direction.
