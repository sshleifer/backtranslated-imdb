Warning: This overview contains a spoiler. Vov. Almost impressively bad. I noticed, "almost". This is nothing but a lot of random scenes that are connected in a loose attempt at a story. Protagonists (who can not be called "heroes") kill innocent food passers-by, and also rob the same for similar reasons. There are also tons of homoerotica, which was a turning point for me. (SPOILER: It seems as if a criminal (who is only in a tople, not naked, as claimed by other comments) kills early, but he miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes of torture to the audience. The abuse has happened many times in this movie horror. you are in favor of MST3K, it may seem to you to be visible, but you can mostly forget it. Instead, rent the original Conan DVD.
