From the beginning of the film I had a feeling as a film about another Jason from the fifties of the 13th century. And that's ... The slow thing that the movie is beginning to be interesting. But as time passes only a pointless film about a dull, supernatural, quiet serial killer. I mean, he goes under the bed without any sound, no one sees. He should have been blind after unsuccessful execution, but he is walking and killing people as he once did. I'm tired of it. It's all the same for me. In other words - unreal. Too many mistakes and confusing information. The scene with a dance woman looked impressive, but only for the first time:} For this and for an intriguing introduction of two stars.
