Creep - "Your journey ends here." Some very graphic scenes and ... well, yes, that's all about this movie. No real complication, no story. There are no sympathetic characters, so 'characters' are not correct since you have no idea who really is. I mean, they are being persecuted by some strange "thing" in the sewers (who is this thing? Why is he there?) That's pretty scary, I suppose, but do I really care? No, I do not know. Why not? Because I have no idea who these people are and I do not know if I would like to live or die. It's one-dimensional and relying on the upside and sound effects to scare you, which is rarely happening. This film has no meaning, no purpose. I feel like I fell asleep and missed 45 minutes. Get right into action. Basically, some women and her friends are locked in London underworld, followed by strange beings, and then eventually escaped from her. Creep has its moments that make you jump, art is good, the location is great and the sounds are fine, but that's not what makes a decent horror movie, so unfortunately it all loses. It is nothing new. Another predictable modern 'horror,' where Kate (the main character) consistently works stupidly 'Hey, I know you sit at home, thinking that in this situation you should do a smart thing, but, oh no! to do the opposite, because I'm stupid blond. I wish they would not do it, it's done many times, it's boring and it's predictable. In fact, I'm quite upset that the kiddie's wife did not stab the knife, the gray creatures that look like a stranger. "Your journey ends here" is the movie line. Well, the Creeps journey ends only briefly in the movie. If you have a few beers, return a couple of friends to your own, then be sure to watch. But if you want something original and smart, avoid it.
