This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Branaugh seems to have had so many problems to remember his accent that he could not deliver his lines. The act was definitely not a worthy name to John Grisham. No wonder it has never been published as a book or published in theaters. I did not even look at the whole thing. I decided that I did not care who did it, and then I realized that there was no "anyone" to worry about!
