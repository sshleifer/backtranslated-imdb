I must admit that the drawing of this film is directed by Eduardo Sanchez, who led the wildly popular and successful Blair Vitch Project. In addition, this is an unusual movie, and it sounded like Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, one of those movies that critics hated, but I enjoyed it. , Altered is a waste of time, so I'll keep this review brief. The space is always promising, and Altered is nothing else. She tells the story of a group of men who have experienced strange encounters while younger, and as usual, others will understand you as crazy thinking things. Tales of alien abductions must always be carried with probes in the openings, so I will not go into details, but you get that damn uncomfortable, and something you want to forget. What if you get a chance to revenge? That is, you manage to successfully catch, and catch a living person. What will you do? For this group, it's a good time to repay, or they thought so. And this is where the film begins to develop into a snoozefest, with a bad, non-inspiring dialogue, and even worse acting. Even if it is low budget, there are not many factors that redeem money, whether it's about the power of a story, or any kind of help from actors in making their characters just a little interesting. It's a standard cardboard treat from a simple vanilla letter, along with some cheap intimidation tactics. <br /> <br /> What is good though is makeup. A lot of effort has been invested in making some of the things I will not mention, because it will ruin only a few elements of what makes this film bearable. In addition, there are also common cheap special effects, bloody and bloody moments that are nothing you have never seen before. Take this only as a finishing tool. Compared to another monstrous movie in the city - Blagdan, this is less fun, and taken too seriously. Stunned by the unsuccessful direction, you are warned.
