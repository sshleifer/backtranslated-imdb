What a horrible movie. It's bullshit. It was scary. I do not know what to say about this movie, but DinoCrap, which I stole from some nail-picking critics. AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's not Roger Corman I hate, it's this horrible movie. Well, really? But what can you expect from a homoeric computer graphics video. What is another thing, CGI is sucked out loud; I hate this movie terribly. This is no doubt the worst Roger Corman B-Movie, and probably the most beautiful B-movie. That's - DINOCRAP! I'm sorry, I must have offended some of the blemishes at those moments. It's just a horrible movie ... 0 / 1,000
