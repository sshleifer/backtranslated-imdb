The film opens with long recordings in factories full of workers. What we did to the planet you might think. I hope we'll see other things. It is very rare. When you are not looking at the terribly recorded corner of the narrator in the lecture room, you watch it set up your camera to capture photos in different locations. It would be nice to choose areas that are more suited to his subject, but he does not. Then you will hear some more narratives, watch a few pictures and watch it set up the camera. Why not use a camcorder to shoot more landscapes? He really kills any sense of pacing and portrays a man as a futile jerk. I could read tips on how someone uploaded the camera, accelerated the entire film and spent less time.
