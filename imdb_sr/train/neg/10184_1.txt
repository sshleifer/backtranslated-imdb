I've been hearing about this little movie for months now and now I see it. I think it's sweet, sweet, as many young directors make films that combine the creative ideas of other people to make their own assumption about the film. Soldiers, Swingblade, any one million Blair Vitch parodies come to mind. If all the directors want is a foot in the Hollywood door, then they are doing the right thing and should continue to work, because with the combined drawings, Hollivood makes movies. How many times have you heard the term "The House of Animals Returns to the Future"; "It's Wall Street encounters the Society of the Dead Poet"; or "Shakespeare in Love Meet Star Wars"? I remember when independent films meant genuine and brave, not safe and predictable.
