First, nothing happened in this film, except for a woman who had unexplained bleeding. Secondly, it was not terrible. Thirdly, he had the worst sound record of any movie. Let me explain. Sound edited by Beavis or Butthead? I'm not sure what, so we go with Beavis. The film gradually becomes quieter and people murmur and murmur, forcing you to amplify the sound (I looked at it at home). Then Beavis explodes some really loud sounds with allegedly terrifying / shocking images, forcing you to re-reduce the volume. This happens many times until the film, by grace, does not end. I can imagine Beavis laughing vulgarly behind the two-way mirror as he watches a test group that takes a breather for the remote. If you have children and you rather watch scary movies after falling asleep, this is a big mistake. But then it's a big mistake. Here's the thought? If you want to make a movie about the horror, at least add a non-returning head off, a 19-year-old blonde girl screaming to the top of her lungs before she can take off a sweater, a shadow on the wall of someone eating alive from the camera, the cat throws into the camera to scare an audience, a weird freak with a maniacal laugh, or a monster that looks like a scene arm covered with aluminum foil (a la TV is lost in space)). These people did not even try to scare me. They just wanted to hurt my ears.
