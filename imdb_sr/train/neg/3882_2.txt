Why do I constantly do it to myself? I mean, really, there's the title - "The incredible man who melts". What else can I expect? I have to admit, I'm a ginger for everything I've encountered on the Monster HD channel, but the only feature of this painting would be that truly grotesque makeup from the legendary Rick Baker. As for the dreaded, I will give a nod to this aggravated old mammal couple who sucks the lemon a little before the light goes out. Now they were really terrifying. Something I could not figure out in terrible shifts was the reason why monster victims would not simply escape when they were confronted with virtual destruction. Like a fish in the cabin. You know, there was a fully visible door in the kitchen that could have started at any time. The incredible Steve-O could not collect much more than a quick walk, so why not just blow it beside him? I do not know, maybe I miss something. This film had the feeling of the episode 'Crypts of the Crypt', but 'Stories' usually had a cold or grotesque twist that was often not coming. This was one picture you could not handle when you arrived. For example, in the early scene, it can be clearly seen that the eyeballs of the melting falls out of his head, so how did he manage to approach the rest of the story? I suppose we should not ask. For eighty-four minutes, this picture was about an hour and a half ago. When it was all over, I was ready to take over General Perry at his earlier suggestion - "I could really use the drink now."
