While I was sitting under this TV station, I wondered why? Why did Dianne Keaton agree to this trash? The film uses ridiculous, fictitious parcels to deliver rubbish to homes for thousands of people. The film takes the political program to a new level. The film was insignificant and all credibility was lost due to excessive use of stereotypes. It was obvious that Keaton tried to make this film worthwhile, but in the end he should remember the old saying that you can not polish shit. I hope you have not missed your New Year's Day by watching another foolish film for a TV movie. Now I know why the networks started broadcasting the series on Sunday night to free us from the rubbish!
