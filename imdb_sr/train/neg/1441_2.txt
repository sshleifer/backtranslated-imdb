I chose this film just on the cover, thinking that I am up to the level of "Indiana Jones and Temple Doom". Unfortunately, I was on virtual call. It's not like any kind of talk I had before. This yawning was so great that I hardly found anything of the quality in this movie. Incredible special effects are described on the cover. There were none. The film was so easy that even stereotypes were terribly depicted. This gives you the idea that you can solve the problems of violence. Good if you want to teach your kids that. I do not. Stay away from this. If you're looking for family fun, you might find something that is inspiring in other places.
