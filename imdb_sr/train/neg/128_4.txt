This film, sometimes sensational for its far-reaching politics and displays of free love and sexual liberation, has long been reduced to mere curiosity. It seems absurd that these mostly boring small films have been banned and seized by governments in many countries. Given that socialist Sweden eventually became, the "radicalism" of its politics, sometimes controversial, seems to be naive and almost mainstream four decades later. And his sexual scenes, sometimes the subject of sensational trials for lack of jurisdiction, look quite charming in a modern context. However, the film and accompanying documentaries that describe in detail his numerous controversies and influences remain slightly visible as the early relic of the youth rebellion of the sixties. One part of the film that is still held: his self-esteem in relation to the "fourth wall". From time to time, filmmakers make a movie. Satirical playfulness of this continues to cause humiliation.
