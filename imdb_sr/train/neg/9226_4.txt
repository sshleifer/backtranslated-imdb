Ok, the movie audience loved him. But your average, popcorn cooking movies that scratched for ten or fifteen dollars costing to see a movie now will probably be wondering why he or she made this choice. If it's certified "Copolla", it's an automatic thing, is not it? Wrong! It's a neat subversion of movie pretensions. But it's terribly "inside." I worry when filmmakers are more concerned about entertainment than for the public. It is interesting as a movie curiosity and has two smilies. But once a course takes place in movies and on TV, the dust will rise on the film bins and boxes with the tapes that hold it. Difficult or epochal or epic!
