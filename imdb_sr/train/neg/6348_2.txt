Pretty pretentious nonsense. The material is boring, boring, boring, and most actors would not even make insufficient images in Allen's earlier films. And if I have to listen to the barren Vill Ferrell to do his Voody Allen imitation, I do not think I like the second-rate (though mysteriously popular) Ferrel. It seems that 70-year-old Alen had to overthrow the job when the clock rang in the new century. I honestly tried to get involved in the film, but it was simply impossible; my sniaps could not light it slowly. So, rather than hurting and killing the afternoon sleeping in an upright position, I got up, left a woman and daughter in the theater, and went to the car where I had a really good book to read again (the great book of George Bailey) 30 years ago, "The Germans. ") The day turned out to be pretty good, not thanks to Voody.
