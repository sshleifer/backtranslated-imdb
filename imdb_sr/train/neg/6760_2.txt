Famous writer Mark Redfield (like Edgar Alen Po) is trying to win old addictions and start a new life for himself, as the publisher of the Baltimore magazine, Maryland. However, shortages of electricity, delirium and rejection threaten to disturb his efforts. He would also like to replay romance with an old dear, which is a rather wrong perspective, how things turn out. Redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious last days of Edgar Allen Poe. Redfield uses a lot of black and white, color photos and tricks to create a mood. Кевин Г. Shinnick (as Dr. John Moran) works well, relatively speaking. Not enough.
