Sometimes it starts with a good assumption, but because of the need to overcome it to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention deficit disorders, it is transmitted into an unconvincing mess. And for three prominent actors who worked better before and after, this is a fatal shame. So let's see. Premise: A beloved couple living in a beautiful home is jeopardized by a bad cop. It is interesting to say the least. Let a disturbing policeman a little upset, why not. This has been done well in the HANDSHIP FOR A PERSON AND ONE WHITE WOMAN, and this is a proven track record for a successful thriller. Now there is a dilemma. Make a disturbing story that actually does bring a real threat to the main characters until it never goes so far as to look funny or throw any kind of illusion of reality, increase the shock factor, and make this cop so extreme - ultra bad The variation of every other super-bad guy who hit cinemas from a quiet time. Manufacturers and directors chose this other. So the resulting film - poorly made, with actors who are trying their heads and heads to head or tail in the roles they have previously described, and nothing much less than that.
