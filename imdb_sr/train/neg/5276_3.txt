No, it's nothing about that fairy tale with a pumpkin trainer, fairy-tales and glass slippers, but if I wanted to explain, I'd have to spoil you, I will not. But do not let your curiosity be better, because this movie is not fantastic. It's one of those films that start promising, before they release their audience with cheap tactics and an unrelated story. And that's a real horror. Ioon-hee (To Ji-Von) and Hiun-soo (Shin Se-kieong) are your ideal mother and daughter. One is a successful plastic surgeon, while the other is your obedient, obedient and beautiful daughter. Their relationship is like a glove in the glove, so close that you consider them more like brothers and sisters than your parents. But things are starting to go wrong (or not always) when Hiun-sovi's friends, to whom Ioon-hee operated, start crazy. Perhaps this is a warning to the public, and for those Korean ladies who do not let the eyelid go under the knife, if the news is believed. The only really terrible moments are those scenes in plastic surgery, although I somehow thought that Kim Ki Duke's time was actually worse when describing and describing what was going on during the operation itself. It's a story about the two halves, the first song was an attempt to shock the audience with a standard scare tactic, which, I admit, came to me now and then. However, the other half turned the film into meaningless mumbo-jumbo melodramatic, and was quite shaped into her forcing her ideas to the throat. Some things begin to make no sense, and while attempts are always shown to explain, you probably will not buy them, and not that horror movies are logical to begin with. there is a marked lack of male presence besides the negligible role of police officers. But hey, I do not regret it, although the story could have been greatly improved. I would recommend that you watch this, only if you are a fan of Central Korean horror, on VCD. Beware of the moments that face the diet!
