This is the first Guinea Pig film from Japan, and this, in my opinion, is the worst. A bunch of guys tortures the girl a few days before he finally kills himself. And at this moment, I'll tell you that these movies are not real! These are fake horror films that try to be as realistic as possible. The scenes are disgusting, but in many cases unrealistic. For example, when hitting a girl on the floor, we can clearly see how they hit and hit the floor near the girl! And how this looks stupid! Sound effects are also unrealistic and do not make sense. Other scenes include animal hoses thrown at a girl, a girl exposed to loud sounds for many hours, tearing off her nails, worms on wounds on the girl's body, piercing through and punched in terrible details and similar things. He was very sick and gave a witty film and there is absolutely nothing worthwhile or kinematically significant. The first entry is the worst and most humane guinea, although it is not bloody as the next part, Flowers of meat and blood, which tries to be as shocking as possible. Guinea pigs: Devil pigs The experiment is perhaps the worst thing I've seen and the closest thing I can kill. This is still (of course) faked with (n / a) uff, the only difference compared to a real "snuff film" is that no one in this film dies or really hurts. I can not recommend this to anyone because it is both **** and odbojno. Those who consider it a great horror movie do not understand anything about the film and its true meaning. I looked at it as curiosity (as well as other parts of the series) and now I know how insignificant it is. They work only at the level of shock, and this is not a very valuable film achievement. The devil's experiment is perhaps the happiest movie I've ever seen, and the siren in the shaft (Guinea Pig 4) is perhaps the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. So, this is pretty extreme in my book, but that's all they are.
