Three stories and insufficiently connected them, "Inside Man" was a very nervous and incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Though he had his moments, the movie began to look like a quick thriller that quickly landed to a slow creep, quickly jumped between climaxes and falls, and barely received it again in the past 20 minutes. I will loan Denzel Washington, he played his part extremely well with a full understanding of his human side, and not just a typical "super-detective" with all the answers. Clive Owen was also pretty good with his duality as "evil genius" and "criminal" (both are not retrospective). All in all, each person has created an excellent sub-individual individually. However, when the parts finally merged and all the computers, there was no sudden "ah-ha!" or summing up everything. Everything ended with very little energy with which it started, with many cavities, tons of questions, and as I said earlier, not where Spike Lee was a normal level. I must completely disagree with the so-called "professional critics" ... this is not a movie they play.
