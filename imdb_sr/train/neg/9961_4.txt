Amelia and Michael are married couples who cheat each other. Amelia has a long-standing lover in the hospital and Michael hires a prostitute who does not meet him. The two are shrinking with their disbelief, but eventually they succeed in merging. There is not much to do for this short circuit. The direction is straight and dramatic, which is good, the acting is sincere, but the story leaves a little desired. Why, in fact, we care about these two people? It's hard to see how this story separates itself from any other story of unbelief, except that it is much less shortened and does not require meaning in it (welcome change of rhythm if anything). I do not know, it is possible that I do not associate with these stories because I have never experienced them. But I noticed that blocking in these narratives is typically the same, i.e. Couple talking together while avoiding eye contact pretending to be immersed in magazines, etc. to try something different, and I would like to see a different take. <br /> <br /> - PolarDiB
