I watched this movie, in the dark, and it was a full moon outside! I did not do it on purpose, it just happened in this way. So all the elements were there to scare me! Well, it was not, in fact, I wanted to turn off the DVD plaier after only 8 minutes, but I thought it would give me a chance, unfortunately, I did. The acting was terrible, the only one with decent acting was Samaire Armstrong. The action is not genuine, if you are a lover of horror, then it's the same thing you've seen many times before. Some scenes did not make sense at all, and you got the feeling that the director wanted to make the film longer! The monster was the biggest disappointment of the film. (Scari) scenes looked like they belonged to a horror movie from the '80s when there was not enough technology, but then some good movies were made! I was surprised to see the name of the big production company at the beginning of the film, I thought I could not invest some money into this and make it decent? !! I can no longer agree with the ratings that the film got, that's my rating for them, 3 out of 10.
