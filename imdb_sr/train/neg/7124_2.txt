A man brings his new wife to his home where his ex-wife died of an "accident". His new wife has just been released from the institution and is also VERY wealthy! Suddenly he starts to hear noise and see the skulls everywhere. Are you crazy again or the first woman returns from the dead? You probably hit the end, so I will not write it. I saw this many times on Saturday afternoon TV as a child. Then I liked it, but I was young. Seeing this now I understand how bad it is. It's terribly acting, badly written, very boring (even an hour) and has a huge number of five people (one is the director)! Still there are some good things about it. The music is a bit dreadful, and the very setting with a huge empty house and a nearby lake is a pleasant atmosphere. There are also some terrifying moments (I jumped a bit a bit when I saw the first skull) and a somewhat effective ending. All in all this is definitely not a good movie ... but not a complete disaster. She has a small cult. I'm giving it 2. Also try to avoid the Elite DVD Drive-in Edition (it's paired with "Attack of the Giant Leeches"). It's terrible in shape with jumps and scratches. It did not even look so bad on TV!
