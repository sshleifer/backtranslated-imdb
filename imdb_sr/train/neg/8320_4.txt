After watching Avake, I came to the conclusion: the director and scriptwriter Jobi Harold made the Avake with the intention of laughing at the viewer, because the film is full of funny elements. absurd and absurd elements (for example, a hospital uniform in the spirit of the protagonist ... was the doctor's spirit left in the floor?). The concept of this film is somewhat ingenious, but all the holes in the plot and the absurd things make this a dumb and shy movie. With the exception of the great Lena Olin, all actors bring bad performances. Haiden Christensen has zero expressions and the same goes for Jessica Albu. Funny and full of absurd things that can not be seriously understood. My recommendation is: skip this shitty movie.
