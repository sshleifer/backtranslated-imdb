The return begins to look promising, with the brutal scene of death by the mask carrying the killer. The very mask itself is pretty cool, and it looks almost identical to that used in the "Granny" film from the 1990s. Since then, the film is mostly boring. We got a few more deaths, which is good again, but there are not enough. The reason that makes death so good is because they are faint and bloody. The story behind the movie is actually quite interesting and it would be very good that it was not so boring. I avoid this, unless you are a stubborn collector - there is not enough to make even an average blow.
