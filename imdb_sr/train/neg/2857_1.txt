I've seen many original Sci-Fi movies since I started watching them in 2002. (My first one was Sabretooth - which is actually one of the funniest Sci-Fi channels in my opinion). Their quality varies. Some of them are average but decent (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cri Verevolf, Swamp Devil), some are ridiculously bad, and then there are some that are really terrible. Raptor Planet lies in the other. Raptor Planet, a relaxed sequel to the 2004 Sci-Fi Channel Original Raptor Island, is a barely visible mess of the movie with a truly terrible acting and lazy scripting scenario. The effects of the dinosaurs (a combination of puppetry and animatronics, as well as CGI and Raptor Planet images) are some of the worst looks I've seen in a low-budget movie. The effects above are even unconvincing. The plot includes a bunch of commandos, which for some reason (I forget why) travel on the planet of extraterrestrial dinosaurs. These are real people, dinosaurs are aliens. Dinosaurs in space. What's next, sharks in the universe?!? The rest of the plot is simple. Human actors are buried and eaten. So far we have been expecting this in a number of dinosaur and novel films that have been released, but this is the first movie of the killer of dinosaurs that I've seen where I actually became dull of all dinosaur attacks. Still, he has a few laughs. There is one scene that emphasizes the man's battering Carnotaur (revived on the basis of the original film), which later became a giant raptor. Also, a bit of triviality, this is a scene in which Steven Baur records his scene of death from the first film. While Raptor Island was not a good movie to start, it's a masterpiece in relation to its sequel. Believe me when I say, this is probably the worst movie. Sifi has ever been broadcast. Damn close to the invisible.
