Class of '61 <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In 1861, members of the class from West Point Academy are torn apart by the outbreak of civil war. <Br /> <br /> The historical drama of Gregory Hoblit fine seems an obvious point - valiant men are blind due to a conflict - although production seems a bit stiff, despite the authentic detail periods and starring talented newcomer (Clive Owen, Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linnea, etc.), who is Dan Futterman declared conscientious yank who fought to defend slavery, pushing him into direct conflict with his former friends from North America. The focus of the film in such a wrong - even lovable - the character is particularly brave, but the drama is flat and sloppy, a direction Hoblit is more efficient than inspired.
