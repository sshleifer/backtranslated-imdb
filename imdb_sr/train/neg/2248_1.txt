This film is a huge steamed crowd. I have no idea why anyone thought it necessary to repair the Garland / Mason version, nor why Striesand would be the first choice to play. In this case, I have no idea why our people (GAI Americans) tend to tend Stries as a kind of treasure. At least in my opinion, she had the peak of professional experience with Funny Girl, and Bogdanovich is What is Doc. Make yourself a service and rent a Judy classic, or even an original (a fine movie in your own), but please, skip this stinkpot!
