I rarely give up film, without seeing the whole show. This is especially true when I rented it on a DVD. Siriana was the one I gave up. Halfway through, I put him down in annoying shooting. This film is unconnected, boring, confusing and gloomy. The acting was dry and without credible displays. The general action was good, but it developed in such a ruthless and boring way that it did not manage to capture my attention or interest. Multiple bases often failed to connect to one another and looked more like casual stories than the actual connected plot. It's a shame that it's such a serious issue and such great actors could create such a flop. I can not imagine this film getting nominations less than a reward.
