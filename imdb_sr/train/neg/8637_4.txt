More about a mysterious movie with some pointless elements of horror that were thrown; Average total. Begins with a woman who has a nightmare in which her sexual partner leaves the bed, enters the room of her crying child, and kills him. She wakes up. Then, this man dies in the hospital, spitting blood. His alienated daughter arrives, and she manages to contact her through her dreams (I think), and she wants to find out who killed him before his body was completely disintegrated in the grave. No too much mystery about who did it, or even how; most viewers will understand this much before it is discovered. I'm not sure the way he was killed really worked. In any case, the elements of horror enter through: bloody autopsy, repeating the dream of a man who kills a boy, a nightmare in which the plate of eggs turns into the eyes that are then cut, and a few shots of a broken man, as in nightmares, as well as in the grave. I was a little surprised when I finally saw a consultation in the end. Clive Barker! Interesting.
