I would give this film 1 out of 10 if it was not for ms. Performance Claudine Barretto. and I'll take this time to overlook that Chris Acquino is here. and ... the end. I really avoid watching Pinoi horor movies because the stories do not have originality and I really think that (some) writers do not devote enough attention to the characters (and their advancement) in their stories (superfluous?). It was as though they "pushed" the film away when the narrative story stunned them. and my goodness, creative exhaustion led them to take away other films. why?? Why did this movie get a good review? I would not give so much credit. the film was a SCORING horrifying, but the film seemed even more strange when it came to the Philippine folklore ... it enters my list 'most likely'. I just wished they had spent more time improving storytelling and fixing these flash sequences, regardless of whether the lighting was exhausted, it would not be very important if the contents were going to squeeze you ..
