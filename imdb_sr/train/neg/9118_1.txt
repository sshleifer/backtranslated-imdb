This is, literally, the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Perhaps this is the worst possible movie. Some movies are so bad they are good; this film is so bad that it passes by a pleasant camp and it just becomes annoyingly horrible. It's an anti-enanthiodromy. We bought it with the intention of getting out, and all of my family gathered to have a good evening of good memories; Instead, we sat in astonished silence, condescending the poor Peter Sellers. This is worse than the animated Lord of the Rings. It's worse than Matrix's sequels. It's upstairs from Krulla. It's worse than any Batman movie. Do not, under any circumstances, allow this film to reach ten meters from your TV.
