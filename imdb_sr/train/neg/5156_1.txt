"Laughter is a state of mind," says the tag, and I reluctant to comment on Barry Levinson. What could he think during the creation of Toys? When he watched the jury, did he see a successful, fun fantasy? If so, then he works at a different level than me. This is a painful picture, in which the production design is 90% of the stuff (and even the color is disappointing). Robin Villiams and (in particular) Joan Cusack are humiliated as a brother and sister of mogul toys that circumvent the successors of the factory when their father dies. There is nothing entertaining (satirical or splashing) here. It is evenly tight, ugly and one of the worst "big" films ever made. NO STARS from ****
