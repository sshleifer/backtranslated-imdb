This is Peter Falk movie. Period of time. I was 10 years old when this movie came out; At that time I was already a movie of the waves. Of course, neither my parents nor I saw this movie when it came out, but I was in love with the font of his commercials and the aura that this was an important movie. Okay, 34 years later, I finally saw the movie - I never saw Cassavetes before. He's a hacker. Zero sense of timing, editing. Genin's performance reminds me too much of the length of Dustin Hoffman's "Rain Man": technically on a pair, but completely unambiguous. As Tom Cruise stole a "rainy man", Falk takes a cake for this movie. I was angry about Gene's performance, indeed in everything - it seemed to be better suited for "awakening". It's not all her fault: she's a basket from the first scene to the end. We never found out why? But Falk's character looks real and is performed by Falk as a marvelous man. Shave at least an hour (an editor is needed!), and that would be a portrait that did not catch a woman. under the influence, but simple, chromium, the man who faces a woman who does not work and still can not deal with his three children and her husband long hours of work. I prefer to remember Cassavetes for "Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemari's Babi". He would have been a better director to cut off his preference for surplus - as he clearly demonstrates with this film. Bob
