This is no doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This makes your movie movie look like Reservoir Dogs. Based on the book of one and only Britney Spears and her mother, this is a garbage without any bar for a reasonable performance from Virginia Madsen (I hope you paid well) to save it. The story of a red neck from a country that conquers a scholarship at a prestigious music school is a bit, but a pedal vehicle. Nothing good happens here with all the rhythms that are predictable as the next day. Never again.
