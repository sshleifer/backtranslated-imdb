A very outdated movie with terrible, clich√© and mossy dialogue and a very bad design. In addition, Cassavetes and Falk are constantly reacting. Pseudo "good movie". It does not take time to discover how much this intellectual party is catastrophic. The first scene is total boredom, filled with hysterical and hysterical exchanges. The sound is terrible. Motion cameras are without imagination like building characters. There is no poetry, no subtle psychology, no interesting footage. The actors are constantly smoking and we see commercials for beer. Very cheap. (one exception: Ned Beattie is a nice and easy way to play the killer).
