The story is similar to ET: an alien runs around and tries to get home. While it remains on our planet, it will create friendly relationships with people. But, unlike ET that draws drama, comedy, poetry, this movie is just fun. It is truly pure Disney production: its primary audience is children, and the film is more in visual than in the message. So you will find some funny scene (first sight of the city). , a "cosmic" toaster that went astray and casting was experimented, with a special emphasis on "Doc," which rejuvenates the "Mac Fli" character, and Hurley, which looks open to auto-derision. <br /> <br> Ice on the cake: the main title is Danny Elfman, and like any other great composer you recognize his "voice" before he even deserves it.
