Feh. This film started in an interesting way, but quickly ran over the scale from confusing to annoying. The confusion took place mainly at the beginning, where the cutting scenes are so numerous that it's hard to say what's happening in the first twenty minutes. The dead come later, with a lukewarm romance between two living beings (both pizzas). The avaricious spirit of a dead girl is actually the most lonely person in the movie, which is sad. If the rest of the actors were on her caliber, the movie could be better. Perhaps. Because the story becomes very interesting, because the crazy priestess seems to be the mother of a dead sixteen year old girl trying to raise her daughter from the dead, with an extremely unfortunate unwanted effect that all other dead people will return too, take a firm human form and probably begin to kill everything. Some kind of Japanese mystical nights of a living dead guy type. But this does not happen. Although this hairy, unpretentious priest with a tiny basket on his head tells uninteresting young people that this will happen if the priest completes his ritual, she does it and the only dead man who manifests her is her daughter. There is no massive rise of the dead, nor the walking of the army of corpses, nothing. The priest just makes the spirit of the girl return to the land of the dead, taking with her a washed boy's chin, as she broke his spine as peanut fragile (at that moment I was tempted to loudly wind, because this idiot went to kiss and caress DEAD girl, evvvv !!!). Robitussen's suckler, the best homeless man, has a long, introspective record at the end, after leaving the village for the last time, and that's it. There is no real horror, there is no real creepiness, that the Japanese tend to work far better than American filmmakers with an emphasis on over-the-top cheesy make-up, without screaming mimis. I was very disappointed.
