This movie was very well advertised. I am a passionate person watching movies and I've seen reviews for this movie for months. While I was a little skeptical about how this movie would be funny, my friends thought it would be great and that they would cheer me up. Then I went and saw him, I was drowning in my seat almost asleep while I remembered I paid for this movie. I smiled at most of the things in the movie, so I would not feel bad and ruined the good mood I was in, plus I wanted to get the money out of the movie! I'm always going to open-minded film, not trying to get into them with too much expectation, but this film was not so funny. Now it was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly worth the wait for HBO. If you have not seen many reviews for a movie or you like very slow and dashing comedies, you can enjoy it, but for the right fans of the comedy Id say pass. Perhaps I look once again at The Kings of Comedi. Something told me to go see Meet Parents !!!
