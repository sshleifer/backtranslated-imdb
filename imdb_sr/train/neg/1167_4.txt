I really tried to love this movie, but in the end it simply did not work for me. I saw most of Kitamura's exit and I found it very variable. Alive, like all his films, has an interesting plot, some beautiful sequences and a lot of creativity. However, these qualities are in painful short supply in Alive. The action is cool, if not so original that she could make a good movie. Unfortunately, pacing is painfully slow, and the movie gets age to go, before reaching pretty predictable spots. The action is almost passable, and the final fight is pretty cool, and the previous one is OK. The former is also corrupted by work over the camera, which makes it less coherent. There are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas that float in the dialogue, but the film continues to get distracted. The characters are not well drawn or well-executed, and the setting and general color scheme is gray and dull. The movie is not quite awesome and has some interesting points, perhaps it would be a good idea to use the quick-swap button to improve it. With about twenty minutes to get off the running, this could be pretty decent sci-fi thriller. But a full-length movie is boring. It is recommended only for very patient and determined fans of Kitumura.
