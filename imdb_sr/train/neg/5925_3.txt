Is this a "bad" episode of Star Trek TOS? Perhaps, at least I get my voice as if it's at the bottom 5. I mean, this episode has absolutely no strange meaning. Do you see something that makes you crazy? Give me a break. This episode also has a different feeling, the music is enhanced, almost forced to improve the feeling of anxiety, to the extent that it is bullshit. Give me some Klingons, horns, Tholians, Romulance, higher creatures like Triskellion or anything but Medusin, these are very boring aliens to make an episode. McCoi gets to say his famous phrase "He's Dead, Jim". Spock puts protective goggles when transporting an ambassador, but Kirk does not. They are going through this fucking "barrier" now for the third time I can remember, boring. The next episodes of the third season would be "Specter Of The Gun", "Dai of The Dove" and others to follow, making Trek a decent show to watch in a syndication to choose people like me as passionate fans. Personal observations, Trek liked to use a purple color, her pinkish purple color, as when in the hallway outside the section, a bridge that is normally gray is now purple. We never had a purple bridge, but it's interesting to see, I noticed it in several episodes, it made a light filter and it works very well, but in this episode, the corridor of the ships is quite limp.
