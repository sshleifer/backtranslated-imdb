It's not really a horror movie, and Glenn and Keitel are top actors. Furthermore, they are doing an acceptable job with a very bad letter. The landscape is booming and the plot has some interesting crafts. Next, I understand why these actors and crew made the movie, they are professionals and they are paid for it. But I wonder why the studios spend time and money on filming the film and then do not let it go for a theater audience? Even if the film is a failure, it certainly makes money. If you are a Keitel or Glenn fan, rent a video or grab it on TV, like me. Television today.
