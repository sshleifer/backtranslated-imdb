When someone comes to the film of this type of film, one should not say that the overdosing of this great brain receptor, the Suspension of Unbelief, is in a mighty hand. Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna / Brigitta, a woman whom Nelson Eddie ignored since the dawn of time, but who is also an angel sent to Earth. My reaction when I saw that it was a mute sigh of "Hunh?" Where did I see this before? It turned out that I already saw it, but in a film made much later than this. DATE WITH ANGEL, a bunch of dreck that is forgotten in 1987, redeemed the ethereal beauty of an Emmanuelle Beart who did not have a voice line, he also wore a blue wig and made hell for singer-actor Michael Knight. Much worse at any imaginable corner with ultra-low values ​​of the 80's, but more than probably the updated version of this turkey in 1942. In any case, do not elaborate, this is not an unforgettable movie and stands as the door information so what was the last time that MacDonald and Eddie, not very good actors, but brilliant singers, together played the "innocence" and "pure" romance they were famous for. After that you may need a cold shower, not because there are any pairs of scenes here, but to get rid of memories.
