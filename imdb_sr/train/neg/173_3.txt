A decent sequel, but does not combine the blows of the original. The murderous screenwriter (Judd Nelson) takes on new identities to direct his novel CABIN OF LAKES. Still ruthless killing, but the movie seems very linguistic. Every humor is not ridiculous. It seems that the overall project has the quality of the fast and sometimes Nelson is far above the top. This film refers to a script that is transcribed before going to the screen ... this should have happened to this script.
