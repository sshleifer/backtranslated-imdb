'Major Paine' is a film about a Major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in marinas. This movie does not have much to offer, but it offers a few hilarious moments that are worth the watches. However, do not expect it to be an unforgettable movie. Expect to mock through the film and at the expense of other people. The clash between Paine and the fat boy was hilarious, and that's really what I remember about the film, except the boys who wanted to take revenge on Major Paine. Again, it's not a great movie, and it's probably best to watch in the rainy days when you need a laugh.
