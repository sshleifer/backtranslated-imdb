This was a short movie that was a little exciting and I recently saw between the games at Turner Classic Movies. Although the film was released due to the very intense Technicolor, the film was not so mobile and sometimes the shop looked quite sour - as if it was made for use in the classroom and attracting the attention of a wider audience. consideration. I especially hated how many times in the movie things were repeated - like when the characters talked to her, they usually spoke "Clara Barton" instead of "ma'am", "Miss Barton" or "Clara". In addition, a sick soldier said that "Johnny Reb, Confederate Rebel, ..." - almost as if he was a character from the cartoon Mojo Joyo of Poverpuff Girls. This was just messy writing - a period. It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later, "Perry Wake" on TV show SUPERMAN) in a beard as President Garfield. Yes - it's under the beard.
