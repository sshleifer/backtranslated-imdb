Even when I watched this movie with a teenager, I wondered how much irony Pia Zadora was in the film about the artist who slept to the top. How beautiful and sexy, like Mrs. Zador, even she could not preserve this distorted excuse for a movie from a tank. Even her Penthouse photograph, in which The Lonely Ledi was promoted "backwards," could keep this film out of the tank. The only thing that could have saved this movie? A completely different scenario. Give this omission.
