To date, when you talk about a Japanese movie, most people will not talk about Rachonom, Seven Ronin, or Rana. For masses, Japanese cinema means all these monsters that we liked to destroy these Japanese cities over and over, many times in battles with each other. The first and greatest of them is Godzilla, who came back a dozen times or more, and in several films she faced three heads of HIDRA like a monster from the universe, Ghidrah. Strangely according to the times, special effects have gotten better. But a part of the charm of these old films was to destroy the city mass media suite, they looked so fake, maybe three steps above Ed Vood. Some visitors from the future traveled to Japan to encourage Godzilla to be destroyed since it was first discovered. In fact, it was first discovered as a surviving dinosaur during World War II when it protected the Japanese garrison on a Pacific island from these American troops. But later, testing on Bikini, Godzilla, a friendly dinosaur, just like Barney, became the medium machine we knew in the cinema. Of course, you eliminate Godzilla rather than giving Ghidrach a clear field to destroy Japan, so it does not become an economic colossus, that was in 1991 when the film came out. I will not say any more, but we all know that Japan is doing pretty good as in 2010. Like all other Japanese monster movies, just sit down and enjoy the mess.
