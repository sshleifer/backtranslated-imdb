STAR RATING: ***** Works **** just miss the mark *** It's a little between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Some plutonium is gone and some very nasty people Josh McCord ( Chuck Norris) and his young protégé Deke (Judson Mills, a different actor from the previous film) with the help of Josh's adopted daughter Kue (Jennifer Tung). This was another film dealing with terrorism one year after the September 11th event. Filmed in 2001, Norris even commented that the shameful line of the film was similar to what happened that day in the center of New York City, so there would be those who would be in favor of a film where Norris and his side are being kicked off by a terrorist guz , if nothing else. In addition, it is as interchangeable as anything Norris has ever been. That's why you are wondering what the original did to keep up the lead in the first place, and whether this could be pronounced soon. If you have seen a Norris film, you have really seen them all, and really nothing new or unexpected happens with this, but at least you know what you get and, as I said, maybe it was just what Some people should drop a little money. **
