Can a false landscape destroy the picture? You would not think so, but that's actually for me. Listen, I've got a lot of movies from the classical age and I know a lot of things, except for drivers who drive fixed cars in front of the screen, etc. But a lot of work has to do with action scenes. To have a false landscape, false mountains and flowers taken after being filmed in "Brigadoon" is angry after a while. As far as musical entertainment is concerned, this is always subjective. What songs one person likes, the other one can not so be a great deal of judging the movie (does anyone love songs). I could blow this film out of my 1950s banal songs, dances, romances and characters, but that's been the fifties and many people like this stuff. The musicians were very good in the 50s. I liked the 30s and 40s with big taps. By the 50s, tap was out and these new things - which I can stand - was it. Is this a bad movie? Not. It just makes me not care much. Despite the good actor, good director and high expectations, this film was bombarded at the box office and with me. I should have preferred it, that I am a dreamer myself, and that this is a good part of this story. I'm not a cynical guy and a nice city, and lovely people make me feel good sounds awful. Then why could not I connect with this movie? Part of that was dancing. I do not care about things that have been replaced by tapping on the screen. But - no - the thing really rejected me. There was not Scotland, not a plateau, only a hockey background to make it look so and it turned me almost from the very beginning. Make one point for today's realism where most of the time "go to the site".
