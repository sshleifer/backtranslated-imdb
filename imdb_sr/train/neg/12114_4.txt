Strange people living in the city live their lives. There's a guy licking everything, a diver for a container that finds the body that leads home to live with him, a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her, a guy who wants to clean the girls out of their evil ways ... in the end, this shot in black The white film is better without color. It monotonously separates two steps from the home movie. Like Troma, this movie is funny in attacks and movements, but it's mostly weird for strange sakes and soon becomes a ruinous bore, from the one you see screens that can guess where a lot of time will be - not always - but enough not to be fun. (Although I did not see the cleaning coming). It's worth trying if you have nothing else to watch and wait for the next Golden Girls come from Netflika.
