I read the book several times and this film does not follow exactly the way it should be. I could play this slide, it's still a movie. However, I have serious problems with placing the movie. Nobody mentioned that this film and the book on which it is based is based on real events in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in a city where this film should be based. First of all, the "small" city that is spoken of as a place is the third largest city in the country. With a population of about 50,000. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Second, the landscape for the film is wrong. Grand Island is located in the valley of the Platte River. Which is very flat with very few trees. I tried to watch this movie, but it made me angry that my hometown was treated so badly. This was a real event. Large parts of the city have been erased. In the book they talk about riding a bike from the island of Mormon to Fonner Park. I suppose you could if you do not mind riding 15 miles in any direction.
