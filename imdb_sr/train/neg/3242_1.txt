Here's a review for people like me. This movie is shit from start to finish. I threw popcorn on the screen and resorted to fun in the MSF2000. The action depends on accidental events and relies on the stupidity of people who need to be smart. Lead falls to the fraudster and does not fall to her mind so she could be deceived ??? And she's rich ???? And she is a famous psychologist ????? Come on, people. She enters the bar at the most opportune moment when everyone gets together to talk about how to cheat ??? It was so stagnated that it seemed like it was hit even by half-smart movie viewers. The man with the rain would be offended. Also, I recognize that I despise Mamet's dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for carnivores, those who are engaged in the war, and those who carry them. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But I will give a chance. That should not sound really. I do not care. It's all that they say SAME. Mamet can not create characters; all he can do is to tirelessly transfer his voice through various actors. No wonder his actors are so wooden. They are confused because they are all the same character. (However, his later films are improving.)
