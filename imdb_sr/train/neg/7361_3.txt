Mr. Perlman gives exceptional results (as usual). Unfortunately, he has to fight the script and some meaningless sets. Larsen is in the "Die Hard" mode with singlet and prominent muscles. to make a grimace and cut through his part. Beautiful Erika is very decorative (although completely dressed!) and shows some signs of "getting" at the end. SFKS are mostly poor CGI and steal from other movies. Shots are poor - Decent A-team It's Not Worth Looking For Perlman - AVOID
