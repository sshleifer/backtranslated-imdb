I recently saw it on a faded old VHS ribbon and I remembered it dark. Looking at him now, he seems charming. When it was first published, it was recognized by almost all people as a gimmick to go out as a gay teenager. To record the starting point, the mother was seen reading a "1 teenager in 10", the most popular book of exit of that time. David Warner swallowed him up as a vampire hunter who fights [gai-hating evangelist], who is, of course, a self-adhesive wardrobe. A list of gazes and jokes that were involved to ensure that no one missed the point would be too long. Producers had some kind of fun, hoping, without a doubt, to clarify and enlighten themselves. But I have no idea how the audience will watch this movie, today. In some places, where there is education and culture, the terrifying temptations that gay teenagers have had to pass are a thing of the past. But I'm sure there are many dark, nasty corners of our continent where it's as bad as ever.
