From a badly-created plot that almost does not make sense to bad dialogue and unrelated scenes to the ultimate downward, bad acting (even Peter Falk can not find his way) "Finding John Christmas" is better left to be lost. The performance of Mrs. Bertinelli is without depth and emotions like her co-stars, Villiam Russ as Brother Hank and David Cubitt as Love's interest in Noah. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of one daddy Noah is almost unbearable to watch, let alone to listen to singing. But who can blame them with material like this one. Scenario Michael J. Murray is at best a minor. Every year at this moment I search TV guides and I'm eagerly waiting for some of the classic Christmas and inspiring holiday movies to appear on the small screen. Films like "Miracle on 34th Street", Ernst Lubitsch is a wonderful "Shop around the corner" and, of course, the version of "Scrooge" from 1951. There's Frank Capra's classic "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Meet John Doe". Hey, forget the classics. What about "Home Alone" or "Home for the Holidais" with Holly Hunter and the great performance of Robert Downey Jr.? My gift to you is through the advice. It would be better to spend your time searching for these films than finding "Finding John Christmas". Merry Christmas!
