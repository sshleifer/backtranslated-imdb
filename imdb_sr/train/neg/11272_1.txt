... the first movie I had to get out of. And that was the pre-screening of the actors and crew (not that I was involved, I'm trying to add it). I went through the first hour, so I think I'm just qualified to comment, but that was my limit. Like other comments here, how did this go through any KA. Stacking the worst in dialogue, a summary of the woodwork, terrible casting, all wrapped together without complication. It has the worst Russian accent in the history of the film. As I left the screen, the director and producers drank in the bar outside the cinema. And they obviously could not go through it anymore. <br /> <br />
