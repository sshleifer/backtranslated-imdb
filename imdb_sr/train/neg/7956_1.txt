This film should be number one at the bottom of 100. The acting is so terrible that when we saw her son and I looked, we almost got sick physically. And the story is even worse. I could go further on how badly it is, but all I really wanted to do is to add a warning to the frankbob review, because I see that nobody else went in trouble. Do not waste time, money, energy or anything else in this movie. Thank God we saw him on TV that we did not spend anything on it. If we were, we would be forced to write to people responsible for this horror and to be forced to execute executions in their general direction. In conclusion, I would like to say that I have always enjoyed watching Carrie Fisher act. But I'm sad I can say it's not worth watching in this movie. Do not spoil your opinion on Carrie watching him.
