Gadar is really a dumb movie because it tells a false story. Too unrealistic and typical is a sunny film aimed at breaking up Pakistan. I'm trying to hide my own flaws will not work. And all the songs and music of the movie are all bad. It is likely that Sikhi will worship the film because they are wrong. I think only Amish Patel was good in the movie. If I can give 0 of 10 bih, but the lowest is 1.Please save 3 hours of my life and not watch this stupid boring movie. Disaster.
