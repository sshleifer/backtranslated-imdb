I like the time period, I like the attempt, but watching a movie that looks like I'm watching it through a bottle of coke causes headaches. If I played computer games that were vague and out of focus, I would upgrade my computer. It might be that it was the look the director asked, but not so it hurts, and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I had not brought someone with me to this movie, I was out. Although it was a series, not a movie by word, the Band of Brothers did it. They looked like World War II footage, only with a dose of graininess, but it was still a pleasure to watch. Movies need real people, with real gatherings and real locations; Use CGI when appropriate, not for the whole movie.
