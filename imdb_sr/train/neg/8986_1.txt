THIS FILM IS LAME, LAME, LAME !!!!! It takes a lot to make me exaggerate in the exaggeration of the film, but this movie set me on fire! I have not finished filming yet, and I had to stop commenting on how bad this movie is. I never did it! As a consumer, do not spend money on this movie. Wait until it appears on the cable channel or something. Hardly a TV is worthy. I really hate the demolition of the film, but this film is a malfunction! Barely above pornography. There should be a Ks rating! A good plot, let the frontal nudity (if it floats by boat), but the HORRIBLE acting level. I do not know how this movie got distribution. (It must have been a contract matter.) Really, if you really love to watch good movies, do not waste time with this. From one movie lover to another. You'll be crazy behind you! Let me also say this, if you have gone through something like this, you may be able to relate and it will have some value for you. In that case, I say that I watch, you can take away something from it if you not only see something that happened to you that someone else acted (has a therapeutic value).
