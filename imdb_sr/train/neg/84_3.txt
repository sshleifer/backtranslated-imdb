As a kid, I thought that the weapon that the killer had was cool, but I was a kid and I was a little stupid. Even as a dumb child, although the film story was stupid and a bit boring, when the killer did not use his knife to kill people. What is astounding is that the film has a really solid role. What scripts did they read when they agreed to be in this movie, because it is certainly a boring and only means to show light saber very little. The story is sometimes incomprehensible and the end is completely chaotic. It seems that the entire film revolves around aliens and one weapon. The plot has two children and some type of an alien encounter, a few years later, and it seems that there is a return as in a mixture. Dead animals and those to be explored and for some reason that guy gets weapons from aliens and continues to use it to go on a very light killing. Seriously, you have to wonder why this film was shot, if you have the killer to have some good death scenes, if you have extraterrestrial encounters, you will show more than a strange light whirlwind, and if you will have bright swords, then you call yourself starfish.
