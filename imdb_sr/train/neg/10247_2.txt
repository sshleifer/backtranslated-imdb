This is one of the saddest movies I've ever seen. Christopher Lee is good, but hardly in that, the only good part is the introductory scene. Do not be fooled by the title. "The End of the World" is a really bad movie, I stopped watching it near the end, it was so bad, only for fans of b-movie who have the brain to handle this vengeance.
