I just looked at Convent for the second time. I enjoyed it before and thought it would be a good drunken movie on Friday night, some upstairs, some style, a bit of humor and the like. I was sad when I discovered that I could not appreciate it much more. It seemed as though someone had begun to question epic cheeses such as the Night of the Demon for a modern audience, but lost what made the original worthwhile. For the record I'm not even a big fan of the Night of the Demons, but there were some things I really dug about it. Convent makes a cheese, but not so good. Apart from the main girl (the cute Joanna Canton), the goth girl and the sweet comedy of Adrienne Barbeau, almost all the characters were unusually unobtrusive, pushing at the absolutely lowest levels of moronic, offensive undercover. The film is then severely hampered by the complete lack of free nudity, which means that, in view of the terrible dialogue, it is difficult to watch the characters and it is more difficult to appreciate the good side of the film. The evil nuns are original in design and they get a lot of good scenes, although they are not scary, they are certainly cool, and the movie also combines a fair amount of tidy ones upstairs. In the end, when Adrienne Barbeau is on the scene, the film becomes quite fun, because all the disgusting people are dead and his evil nuns break the rage. The stylized direction also occasionally gives good results, although sometimes the camera simply moves too fast. All in all, this was a movie in which great good things for me can not simply compensate for the things I hate. Those who prefer this type of film can enjoy it much more, but for me it was not a good moment.
