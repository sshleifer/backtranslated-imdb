'Iedereen Beroemd' has everything we can expect from a direct video-movie. It is a story about a man who believes that his daughter might be a star. The only thing he needs is to bring him to the stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan for which it must be abducted and blackmailed. The film problem is not a basic plot, but the way it is made. Everything should be funny, but not. It's trivial and clumsy, the characters are shallow, and the bottom line is completely without climax or emotions. The last order is probably the only scene in which you feel like you're laughing, but just how pathetic it is.
