As some other reviewers have previously used to aloud, I would like to know what the moron actually read the script and went, "Yes! That's it. This is the next movie we go to the green light!" And whoever this person is, it is necessary to examine his or her head for the actual activity of the brain. For whoever is responsible for actually leaving the money to do it after reading the script, well, I would like to give you my email address and you may want to just give me some more money. This movie is terrible in every way. Vaiani are funny, at least they can be. They made some good movies and had incredibly funny performances along that path. But not only does the premise defies every logic, not only is the act horrible, not only is the entire film offensive from start to finish, not only is it an amateur route as you can find, but you actually want to pay to see this movie. Maybe it was free ... naaah, it would still be a waste of time. I would normally be inclined to write a long, detailed overview of why this film is so bad, but it's enough to say that some of my subtlety says. This is the smallest common movie denominator, and it is roughly as immature as a heart attack. 0/10 .. makes my top list of the worst movies of all time!
