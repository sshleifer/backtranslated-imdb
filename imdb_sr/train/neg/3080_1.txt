Hee hee hee. This film is so bad that it does not even try to hide the fact that the shit is very long. I remember the day I first saw this on MST. The sun shone, it looked like a good day. then I saw this product of Rick Sloane, which consisted of horrible dolls that caused desolation on the land of the 80s. Kevin, extremely unusual, tries to impress his girlfriend, runs a security assistant, fights with grab, and much more in this very bad series of images. It does not need a plot or story. Obviously, acting is not needed until the film is proven. A guy from the army and his crazed girl will make you jump from the cliff, and a friend who has sex with a sex friend will make you say, "He has some nice red shorts." Besides, I really hated an old guard and wished he had an accident in his basket. Just when you think it's over, wait until Scum Club scene appears. Ask for a rash on the road. I advise that after watching this movie, you have a good month for the return of senses and common sense. And if you see Rick Sloan, give him a good blow to the groin to show how much we value this thief, called Hobboblin.
