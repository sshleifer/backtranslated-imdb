Sli Stallone is hardly the best actor in the world, but compared to his brother, Frank ... well, add those prizes right now! It seems that Muppet Frank thinks that every part of his call is that he performs the role of American / Italian wise refugees from the godfather. Please, somebody offer him an action offer "he can refuse!" This movie only stinks the place, even because of the terrible exaggeration in it, Frank continues to steal acting dishonesty. All people compensate for their lack of talent by shuffling their lines and throwing their hands around them, wildly gesturing in a style that emerged from fashion fashion films. The plot, what's up there, does not make sense because the meteor is drifting and turns all women into sexual nails, but since this is a certificate film, it just means getting off with your underwear and realizing the sound of burning like dogs in the heat. What happens in the end, I'm not quite sure that I've lost the will to live long before the film finishes. Avoid this as a plague and watch 'Deep Impact' for a sensible film about the meteor that will hit the ground. NB Order: When one of the women leads strips to the underwear, she has her panties / panties under the shoulder straps / belts for garters, these are panties over the shoulder straps to allow women to go to the toilet with less effort. A trivial point, maybe, but it shows how stupid this movie is when I can not even understand this!
