Nightmare Veekend is evidence that some people are so desperate to be "in movies", they are ready to do almost everything. I do not mean innumerable women who seem to be quite happy starkers in this terrible piece of garbage (after all, naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of). No ... I'm talking about those who are more than willing to associate with a bad-made hand-doll named George. Now this is unpleasant! Bio-electronically created by the brilliant scientist Edward Bracky (Vellington Meffert), George (who looks like a crazy clown with green hair wool) is an artificial intelligent interface for an advanced computer system that controls a revolutionary device (silver sphere the size of a golf ball) that, when swallowed, can reverse character disorders. Edward's personality change experiments were successful at an animal lab, but a cautious scientist reluctantly tests humans, fearing that there are still undesirable effects. His evil assistant Debbie Laster, however, has no such doubts and continues to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs. Inevitably, they all turn into repugnant murder mutants. With the special effects of a cheap cellar, an actor totally deprived of talent, and a plot that is almost impossible to track (I recorded notes while I watched the movie, and even then I was not completely convinced that my synopsis was correct), Nightmare Veekend is a complete and utter disaster that can not save a few sexual scenes of a soft core and a touch of blood. This film also has one of the most devastating characters I've ever seen in a horror movie: Toni (Bruce Morton), a Valkman wearing an idiot who is struggling to bake 80s music in a way that makes me Justin Timberlake in comparison.
