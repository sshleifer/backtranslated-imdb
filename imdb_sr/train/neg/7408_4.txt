I'm not quite sure why I clicked "contains a spoiler" because quite frankly there are not enough explanations that would ever be given in the movie to know what should be spoiled. It is visually mainly delivered. Well, except for some of the '80s, a monster of rubber mask. Now I will say that before I watched this album I never saw Lordi's band, nor did I know about them at least to win on Eurovision. Obviously, monsters in these band members, mostly in their scenes. Whatever. In any case, I did not know it when I was watching. I just thought that monsters / demons are mostly passable. I'm almost sure. I am almost sure there is a semi-coherent explanation behind what we see on the screen, but maybe it's better not to know that. It would probably be incredibly lame to think about it. The action keeps it well enough for the viewer to mostly entertain, even if half the fun factor jokes about the tff just happening in this movie. I gave her four. mostly because I was laughing, especially because it explains almost nothing. It must have been the mood I was in, but I found it to be ridiculous for some reason. Then I looked at the movie on the internet and learned that NITKO does not know what it is about. This made me more entertaining, and raised my extra half of the point to 4/10. It's not scary, or especially coherent, but it's pretty nice visual and audible. All in all, far from essential, but visible. Do not expect too much and do not expect it will make sense and can entertain you if you are in the right mood.
