Drss1942 really pulled the words out of my mouth. I loved Early Segal's films and I felt like the only one who remained faithful to me. I just watched this movie (ok, I fell asleep 90%, so I did not see the end). When I woke up and saw that I was on a DVD menu, I was grateful that I did not deal with this film anymore, and I did not dare discover what happened at the end. There was something strange in the voice of Segala and others. Kinda reminded me of the original crazy poppy where the voice was synchronized, but in the same language (the australian is English, right?) Anyway, if I had 10 thumbs, everyone would now point to this injustice Segal.
