I read reviews for this and while I did not expect private Ryan, I expected a movie of some substance. the killers. But in 1944, you are not sure where everyone is. Accents, etc. They are very bad because this unit should be a Hawaiian / Asian American, but everyone speaks in a very poor sense of the Harvard English imitation of a Japanese person. because after 10 minutes I could not watch. The characters were 1-dimensional and although most probably they were based on real people, I did not have the feeling for them and that left me not to worry about them. Very bad direction of a very average TV movie that will be shown at midnight on some cable channel. I avoided and worried for better efforts. This is a good story, but it deserves a better saying. You have the feeling that the director saw the bands of the brothers and thought it was enough to sell his movie. My advice, avoid and watch bands of brothers, Tuskegee spacecraft, Glory or any other movie like when the trumpet faded ...
