The Eastern Palace, the Western Palace, reminded me a little about the detective, with Franco Sinatra in the role of a policeman, and William Windows is a boy. It's a progressive film for China, I suppose, but it also maintains myths about the femininity of gay men: it is much made up of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The film focuses on a feminine man who desperately wants to dominate him and hurts a macho guy. He is free to cruise the park - he hopes a policeman will take him to the station. And that actually happens. Then he told the policeman his entire life story while he was subjected to gentle torture: he was forced to squat for some time, with foxes, a sham. This is what a gay man wants, and implicitly, a gay man provokes the self-esteem of a policeman as a masculine man. The story of the life of a gay man (including memories) is tolerable, but when he begins to describe ancient Chinese myths and dramatic works, the film becomes unbearable. This becomes a scream of pity for Chinese gays, who just want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. I'm sorry, I can not speak.
