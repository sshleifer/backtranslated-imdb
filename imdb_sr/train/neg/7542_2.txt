This film should be a mysterious, serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. However, for 30 minutes in the movie, it turns into a funny, unrealistic story with boring characters and random scenes. I can not imagine that nobody laughs when Cage randomly releases that blonde girlfriend to a girlfriend or when a "bear" strikes that old woman. Lines, characters and acting are poorly derived from the very beginning. I've always loved Nicolas Cage as an actor, but this year he made some terrible movies; This is by far the worst (yet ...). I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, go to rent an original. However, if you intend to watch it, get ready to laugh at some lines and end scenes instead of taking them seriously; It's the only way to enjoy this movie.
