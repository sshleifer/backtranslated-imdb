This film is even a big step down from the typical Bollivood ride. The performances were terrible. Even Boman Iranian, who always thrives to shine, turns completely like a villain. No soundtrack is unforgettable. And despite the fact that we are working hard, women's leaders do not manage to be "sexy". Vivek Oberoi is capable of far better projects while Fardeen Khan seems to be stuck in a similar tariff for now. But this monstrosity is even below its limited capabilities as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are horrible in poorly written roles of the clich√©s. It's high time Indra Kumar to drop the director's hat. I hope they will never direct another one like this. The future of films in Hindi is now in better hands. To summarize, stay away from celluloid waste.
