Before I continue, I must admit I'm a great Bon Jovi fan. In fact, this is what attracted me to the DVD first. I would probably buy him as a great fan of horror and enjoy so much in the first title of the vampire. But this is not half good. Not even Jon could save this film for me. My main problem would be that it just is not scary. Apart from Jon's character Derek Bliss, none of the other characters gives you the impression and you do not care if it will die or not, especially an unfriendly woman vampire / addict. A female vampire is simply not horrible or sexy. She rather looks like an anorexic 14-year-old girl, no wonder she's so desperate for blood. Another big problem is that everything is just "too bright". There is no atmosphere or a feeling of fear. I know that the first vampires set up in New Mexico were not exactly a twilight zone in terms of horror, but still managed to be dark and hopeless when it was supposed to be. This film has no such tension. The story is essentially the same as before. The vampire wants the Berziera cross to be able to walk one day. However, this time the story has fewer cool bits. There is no wow factor in the fact that this is the master of all the masters - the original vampire, as in the first movie. It really does not care who it is or what this is. No army of masters. Instead, it is hiding in an old ruin that looks more like an attraction in Disneyland, and then to a creepy temple. So you have it. Lack of fear, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting story. Right for me personally.
