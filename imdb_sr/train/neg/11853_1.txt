Let's face it, romantic comedies are considered light compared to drama films (just look at nominations for Oscar each year). But nevertheless, good are really artistic forms. See "When Harry met Salli", "Sleepless In Seattle", and classics such as "Roman Holidai" and "It Happened One Night". I have a good feeling to see two men destined to find happiness. This film is trying to build something that looks like a romantic comedy. But no one believes in the romance between the main characters, and there is nothing ridiculous to compensate for this great disadvantage. Modine is a past leading man - especially romantic leadership. I'm sure that as an executive producer he had the means - but not the meaning - to cast himself. And Gershon ... I see the possibilities of some comedy talent, but she did not have a script and a badly developed character. And whose idea was an English accent? Nonsense. Others have stated this, but I want to repeat: this story is poorly conceived, poorly derived; actors are terribly wrong; and the characters, well, we just do not brag about them. The form of art is not. Re-rent Moonstruck.
