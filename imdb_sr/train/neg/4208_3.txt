There is a really good movie lying just below the surface of the Pagemaster cheese. I discovered this when I looked back this morning after I ignored it for years and years. I remember I hated him with passion when he first came out, but this time I discovered that special effects are pretty good. The plot is just "Neverending Story" with creativity-endectomy, but that's a fine move for anyone who just wants some really great sweets. The animation is incredible, and I especially like how animators allow their characters to look and act a little more realistic than the norm. I give her a grade of three, because I gave her two (only for parody value) that I have ever decided to watch this movie, expecting me to absolutely delight the story.
