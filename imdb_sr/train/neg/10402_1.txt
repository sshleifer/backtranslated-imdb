Well ... the jitter, I started the original in 1990, and I found a movie pretty cozy to watch. however, they continued to shake II and III. Believe me, these movies started to descend immediately after they finished the first, I mean, asses? Now God is only able to answer the question "why would God create another one of these diving from the film in the name of God?" Shaking IV can not be considered a bad movie, in fact, it can not even be considered as one of the bad films, because it lives more than that. While I was trying to sit, I noticed that my eyes began to bleed, and I was hoping that the girl from the ring would crawl through the TV and kill me. did they really think that dressing people who stared at other films as if they were from the wild west, make the film (with the same events) better? Honestly, I would never suggest buying this movie, I think there are cheaper ways to find things that go well up.
