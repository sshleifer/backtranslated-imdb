I've seen this movie many times, (and I have recently read the book on which the film is based), and every time I see her, I just want to slap them. The fact that it does not point to the fact that the character Tom Hank goes into your D & D (oops M & M) :) persona ( "Oh, he's acting in character.") Out of the game. That and the fact that after three months of treatment, let's destroy it all and we feed his delusions! These people are what RPGs gives a bad name. <Br /> <br /> Also i shabby "love ballad", and the music that make "cat on the piano" and "stop us if we too boring" Almost enough to make your teeth on edge!
