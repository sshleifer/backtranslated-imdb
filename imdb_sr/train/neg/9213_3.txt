I captured this film on a small projection held by the members of the gaming club. We warned that this would be "madness" for playing, and this film is more than delivered. Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man who begins his career again in college after a "break" for the semester. What we, the viewer, find out how the movie is progressing, is that Robbie was hopelessly dependent on playing a role called "Mazes and Monsters", a game that he re-introduces after the gaming group recruits him for the campaign. This film is funny at many levels. One scene is characterized by a group playing "candle light", which is probably the best way to describe it. Although I'm sure this should have been "cult" in a way, as most players know, it's awfully wrong. Most role play sessions take place in well-lit rooms, usually through some juices and soda. Acting, although not an Oscar-caliber, is not at all terrible. This is one of Tom Hanks's first roles, and Bosa's Friends and Bachelor Parti were still a year or two on the horizon. Supported castings, although not very memorable, still give decent performance. Mainly bad is that it was a movie made for a TV that shows "the dangers of playing". Look if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
