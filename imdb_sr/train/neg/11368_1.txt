This film was more effective in persuading me into a Zionist conspiracy than in a Muslim one. And I'm Jewish. Somebody goes to the journalism school? Read the editor? Rhetoric of the first year? These alarming statements, presented in a pleasant way, can prove to be convincing. But, without offering any recognition of possible conflicting arguments, nor sustained (or in general) solutions, several sources and each of them of dubious origin, makes the argument ineffective. I would not want anybody to leave the theater, VERIFYING any of these racist pitfalls. Good lesson for me - and I hope a cautious story for you - that you actually read the movie before you see it.
