It's boring ... this is next to the land on the battlefield in a science-fantasy dream. genie francis (the so-called general hospital laura) has a small role as a reporter and this alone should tell you that this movie must be bad ... there's Ben Kingsley (actor who awards the Academy) in this stinker and a few others competent actors. You have to ask yourself what they had to decide to do this horrible movie. Music dramatically goes up and down as if it's a great dramatic story. Even if you pay attention, the plot is impossible to follow. The effects are also central and look really outdated. All actors speak a monotonous voice and do not have realism in their dialogue. I could still continue as a bad movie. At least with Battlefield Earth is so bad it's ridiculous, but this is just a bunch of g. Avoid if you do not want to be sleepy.
