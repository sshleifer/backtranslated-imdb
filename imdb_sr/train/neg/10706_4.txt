Vov and I thought that any Steven Segala film was bad. Every time I thought that the movie could not get worse, I turned out to be wrong. The story was good, but the actors could not do it. They also made a lot of mistakes about how to do the correct archive copies. For example, you do not handle artifacts until they are catologed and accounted for. The biggest crime in casting was a girl-archaeologist. She is a poor actress and I felt that her acting really made the film less realistic than it was already. The whole concept of the templars of knights that were underground all this year seemed pretty stupid to me. I like the idea of ​​how things have gone missing, so it almost seemed depressing. I thought the characters did not explain well enough. You did not reveal much background and this made it harder to connect with them.
