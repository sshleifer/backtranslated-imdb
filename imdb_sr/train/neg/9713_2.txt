For the first time I watched Cold Case after running for about a year on Danish television. At the time he came to the TV, he almost drowned in 4 or 5 other US criminal broadcasts broadcast at about the same time. I saw it and I was boring to death. The actors who were not in line with the proper faces and morals were pain in the background. The whole premise that so much money has been given to the team of investigators to deal with murders of 10-20-30 or even 60 years seems to be unlikely. Time is also a factor because they only have 50 -60 minutes to tell the story, which means they break through just at the moment to resolve the case and bring justice to surviving family members, if they are still alive. This is combined with the "personal" problems and relationships of researchers that time to leave the show completely obscure. I give him a score of two stars for music to the end, which is really the only reason to watch it ... which then, of course, you will not do it because it is too much a reason to watch this shit.
