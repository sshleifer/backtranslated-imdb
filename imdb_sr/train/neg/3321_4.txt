I usually know after the first minute of the movie whether I will hate or worship him ... but now, I made a mistake. The beginning was excellent; "this is based on a true story" and blah blah blah thing was ridiculous. After that, cartoons and a description of the lives of the guys with pictures made me think that I made the right choice. Then, looking at the hilarious fake look of Toronto, it was cool. Likewise, the situation and the appearance of the house have confirmed my first idea. It was perhaps the first 10 minutes of the movie ... which later looked like eternity. Maybe it just does not understand English Canadian humor (it's possible, English Canadians also do not always understand cookie humor), but hey ... it was enough for a short film, * nothing more. Perhaps this could mean the title? In any case, almost everything was filled, and very few things were even funny in my opinion. In fact, "making" was better than film. At least you understand the motivation behind everything that has done everything wrong. The potential of this idea was great; so I rented a movie, interested in "boring disappearance of people". But yet, I did not know that the whole universe would disappear, and with it even show a film. If you are an English Canadian, it looks like you could appreciate local humor, considering the amazing number of people who gave this movie 8. Otherwise, just think twice before you lose your precious time ...
