Tasteless. I can not even write intelligently about the movie. I was laughing the whole movie. It should not have been funny. Matt Farnsvorth has no idea what he's doing. His story seems to be written without any knowledge of the Iowa culture and the problem of the target. I know Farnsvorth is from Iowa, which makes my film even more confusing. Why are two main characters accents? Does not make sense. The act was at best central and sometimes difficult to watch. Happy violence and sex filled the movie. I suppose that violence and sex should make the film more difficult, but it was incredible and insulting. The ending of the film is so brilliantly bad that everything I could do was smile and look at the rolling of the credit with the unbelief. While I was leaving the theater, all the others who were leaving laughed together with me. The purpose of the film was to cause tears, but this was quite the opposite. Do not waste your time on this horrible movie, unless you want to see ignorant, dark, exaggerated, clich√© rings.
