Neither Timothy Hutton nor David Duchovny could save this dead fish film. To begin with, the script is definitely written to be made in the B-movie, but somehow Duchovna (looking for a starry vehicle to climb out of the television) and Hutton (seeking "two" from "one-two strokes") he hoped will define his career after "ordinary people") become attached to the image. Cheesi lines, big bad wigs from scene to scene (Come on - who uses wipes after the 12th grade of telecommunications?), And a common old bad actor this movie. Even Duchovny is not immune to the bad acting plague that is this movie. Only Timothy Hutton rises above the material. I have to admit that I feel the Duchy's pain as I read the lines that are the voice. As I laughed when I was sure the director wanted me to feel terrified, nothing prepared me for the lineup of Duchonvey's voice: "If you ever need a doctor, be sure to call 911." If only the studio called 911, this dog's movie would not have been made. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
