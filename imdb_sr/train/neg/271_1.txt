I can not believe how popular this show is. I think I'm a passionate fan-sci-fi. I have read countless science fiction novels and enjoyed many sci-fi movies and TV shows. I really would not even think about this true fantasy. Every episode I went through was a chrome, diluted version of Star Trek, minus anything that could make it interesting or exciting. a story about something boring, which occasionally passes through the Stargate and ends on a planet that looks like Earth, with people who look and sound like People! It looked extremely low. Characters are all one-dimensional cutouts that can be forgotten, and many humor attempts fall. It reminds me when you see an advertisement with a famous athlete, trying to be funny, but not. It's just sad. And the film was horrible. You can do so much with the portal through the universe, but every place ARMI people move is boring! This does not show the imagination! I thought that the TV series "Alien Nation" a few years ago (based on Alien Nation) was much better. That broadcast actually had good stories and decent characters. I was not crazy about Alien Nation, but compared to this overrated crap, that was great! From the chrome film too tight! They should have at least updated the special effect of "flushing with the VC" whenever someone passes through the Door.
