Hollivood Hotel was the last film musical that Busby Berkeley directed for Varner Bros.. His directorial style has changed or evolved to the extent that this film does not contain his signed footage or huge production numbers with thousands of statists. Until the last few years of the thirties, big bands in the style of swing recorded the biggest popular hits of the year. The "Swing Era", also called the Big Band Era, dates back to 1935 to 1944 or from 1939 to 1949. Late 1935 was certainly one of the earliest indications that the swing entered the consciousness of the American youth. When Goodman showed his swing repertoire, not dance music in the social style played by his band, the audience in the audience admired. It was the beginning, but since radio, live and mouth concerts were the primary methods available to spread the phenomenon, it took some time before swing made enough penetration to produce the big hits that popped up on the pop charts. In the Hollywood Hotel, the performance of Benny Goodman and his orchestra and Raimonda Paige and his orchestra in the film indicate that the film industry is ready to use the change of musical taste (the film was produced only for a year and a half). after Goodman's engagement Palomar Ballroom). There are several interesting music moments here and there at the Hollivood Hotel, but besides Benny Goodman and his orchestra Sing, Sing, Sing, there is not much to be praised. Otherwise, the most interesting music sequences are the opening of "Hollywood Time" and "Let It Be a Lesson to You" at the restaurant. The film is the most interesting to see and hear Benny Goodman and His Orchestra and Dick Povell and Frances Langford.
