I am a big fan of horror / spraying, I even enjoy horror films that some people consider stupid. I love it too. The more he is pleased with the point. After I read someone else's reviews on the site I was sure this movie would be a little gem. But, to my great disappointment, it turned out to be one of the pointless films I've ever seen. Editing was probably done by someone who's been dead for the past two years. I usually discover that all these features make a big b horror movie. But not in this case. I took 11 euros to get this DVD. Unless you really do not enjoy meaningless burning (eg "violent movies"), avoid at all costs!
