Yes, I'm sure it could be a nation. . . if all four stood at four corners of the world, and the other two cloned several billion times. Man, I'm really glad to see this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting it. I'm a big fan of George Romero movies and I'm pretty sure that if he saw this movie, he probably would have vomited himself while he was laughing too much. I mean, what about the racquets that were presented as zombies and walked around like Charlie's Devils? It really helped the music composer choose shy music for fashion shows when zombies came to their killer, especially the part they enter into the store that is presented as a furniture store / police station / flat / apartment / any gong room in the background, and a lively wife fought around the closed furniture store. I could not say what the killer nation was and the fact that his accent indicated that more nations did not help. Well, what can I expect from a movie where they throw a scene of random fight without any reason in a warehouse where they obviously deliver air boxes around the world. So for those who bow to the Mystery Science Theater 3000 or if you just love to turn bad C movies (C for Craptastic), then this is the movie for you. . . or not.
