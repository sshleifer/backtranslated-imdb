First of all, as a long-time student of Titanic Disaster and a member of several Titanic clubs, I feel that I can comment on the film. I do not really care how many awards and recognitions have the film won, but for me it's still an absolutely horrible movie. Cameron had the resources to make a "real" semi-documentary film about the disaster, but unfortunately he decided to turn him into a romantic pulp. The fact that so many people around the world fell on it only shows, in my opinion, the sad state of taste and common sense that film critics and audiences have these days. Who said that all films should fall in love with hero and heroin? In fact, most of the real events are all just not romantic, and the catastrophe in Titanic was certainly not one. I feel that she needed a better script and a director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic licenses as possible. I almost vomited in the last row where 'dead' mistress meets among other lost passengers and crew who break through the applause. Is this an intelligent movie? Ask yourself.
