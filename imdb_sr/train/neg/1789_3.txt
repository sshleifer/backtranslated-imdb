Although I enjoyed Bing Crosby in other films, this film seems to me particularly appealing. Maybe because I was from another era and from another country, but I found Crosbi's constant reference to Good Old USA at first, banally after a while and then finally boring. Do not misunderstand me - I am not an anti-American - but it seemed that the English could not do any right and / or they need this brave, so smart American visitor to show them the way. It's a story of "fish off the water", but unlike most of the films of this kind, this time it's "fish" that has the advantage.

(Last night I watched another Crosby movie - Imperial Waltz - And it caused the same reaction in me, and to my surprise, even my wife - who is for what is valuable to the American - found the position of the American Crosby "in your face" is irritating.
