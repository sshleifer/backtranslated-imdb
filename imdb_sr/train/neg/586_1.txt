After what I thought was a masterpiece of two roles in a man from a snowy river, WHY was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehi? It was not the same without Spur and Harrison, as Douglas showed. Perhaps he realized how much the plot was bad - Jim returned after a long absence, to find Jessica being persecuted by another man. He could not have expected any girl to wait so long without contact with him, and she would not find the competition. For Disney Movie, this contains an ugly tongue, plus a very unnecessary part when Jim & Jessica shuddered without being married - very LAME. All the insults for observer intelligence, according to my family members. I'll stick to the first, and try to forget that I've ever seen a sequel!
