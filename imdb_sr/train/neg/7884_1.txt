Things I learned from the "List". A decent cameraman, a hot girl who can play and Malcom McDovell could not stop this movie from sucking. I give you money back. Even when reading the script and saying, "Uh! Really?", Malcom McDovell continues to try. . Rent a writer. Jesus hates me and punishes me by paying me $ 5.50 to see this movie. When I make a movie, I do not need you to end. Just leave everything unexplained, unreasonably insensitive enough for the audience to fall asleep before the end. Genius. Any casual renter can cure death only by drawing a cross on the window. That's why they are friends. Your maid can sang you into life. Chuck Carrington still needs courses of acting. Make fun if you take this movie home. Apologies will not be accepted.
