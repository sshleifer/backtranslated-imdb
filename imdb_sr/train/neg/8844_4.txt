I watched this movie after I saw other comments about the IMDb, even convinced my wife that it was a "unique horor movie". I wanted to love this movie, but I was not able to. "Love story" was good, but the horrible aspect was pretty bad. If the story is only about a young man who fell in love with a girl suffering from a parasomic, then it would be a better movie. It was pretty funny. The doctor gladly reveals the law on privacy and professionalism. The nurse enters the room for the routine feeding of a dangerous patient (without safety escort), empties the tray and expires from the room screaming for no reason. The forensic patient (and the criminal of the film) is tied in a standing position completely dressed - apparently for years? None of this makes much sense. The film even had some actors I loved in other things, such as detectives, but still I can not recommend this movie.
