If the reviewers love this film, they surprise me. The plot is a mess. The characters are wooden. Michael Boven spends most of the film by spying on other characters and misjudging them all. Nobody has any redeemable or interesting quality. This is not a hard work. It's not imaginative. It's not ironic. That's not smart. There is not any real progress in this hard work. This missed theater issue is no surprise. That "This Network" is broadcasting this place. I certainly recommend that you turn to the re-introduction of Garden Smart on PBS or even good information if you have encountered this mess on the television late at night. If you find him on a long-distance walk on a long walk. Even if you walk smog, you will feel better that you have not suffered this mess. Life is short. This movie is long.
