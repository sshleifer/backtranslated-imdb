This film had so much potential - a strong role, a reasonably strong idea and a clear decent budget. I'm not sure where everything went wrong, but each of these elements is lost. The story did not go anywhere, the characters were the least hollow and the result was a very boring, meaningless, scattered movie. I hated that. Judging by the other voices, I am in a minority and I must be some kind of freak. However, I thought this film was terrible. I had great hopes, but I was very disappointed. A special disappointment was the character of Jody Foster. A very self-confident "fixer" of a kind of idea. Jody was safe and sexy, but the character did not do anything and did not go anywhere. Denzel Washington has played the same character that always plays - nice but nothing new.
