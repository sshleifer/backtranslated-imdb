Basically, the adaptation of "Threepenni" by Mark Blitzstein was not so "divine" as it is generally believed. (I have a special interest in "Threepenni"; my dad was part of the first full-length production in the US, In Illinois The Theater Guild did it at the end of the Second World War. He was so successful in suppressing the performance that they had to reconstruct the script and record from images in two different languages ​​(not English), the German Shepherd Script and similar sources.) Blitzstein's adaptation - not the "translation" - which had the full consent of Lotte Lenia - was much closer to the original than which was generally believed to be. The problem is that the version most people know is a MGM footage (recently available on Polygraph on a CD) (which includes Beatrice Arthur {Like Ports, "Big Complete Girl", and I can not see it her hands on her hips and shoulders thrown back to that line - Bea was the main baby in the 1950s, Paul Dooley and John Astin) was highly censored by Mike Curb, head of MGM Records - I mean, 17 (I think it is ) "Damn" is cut to "curse". (Once, MGM also offered a 2-LP set * full * games, no doubt as highly censored.)
