I saw this movie last month for a free review and I went out. It was pretty awful. In the process of too difficult attempts, they behaved and made a horrible movie. I was disappointed because I felt that all the actors in the past brought honorable choices, so this could not have been so far - but, I was wrong. I was hoping to give a poll at the end of the movie to tell them not to publish this movie. I was lured by the free aspect of the review, but it turned out that it was a waste of time - and, usually, it amuses me a lot.

I'm usually not picky about movies and I usually do not feel the need to show my opinion about movies, but I had to warn everyone not to watch it. I signed up for the IMDb just to tell you
