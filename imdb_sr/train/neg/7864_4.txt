Hills Have Eies II is what you would expect and nothing more. Of course, it will not be nominated for an Oscar, it's just pure entertainment that you can lose in 90 minutes. The plot is basically a group of trainees of the National Guard who are fighting the notorious mutant hilly on their last day of training in the desert. They only fight during the entire film, which involves a lot of violence (which is basically a whole movie) because the blood and intestines are constantly flying through the whole thing, but also another scene of graphic rape that is senselessly inserted into the shocking audience. I would like Hills Have Eies II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment, and that's just. Although I even watched in my watch more and more how the film continued, as it began to drag on because it continued to shock the audience with the graphic mountain and the occasional scene just to convince the audience remains awake. Hills Have Eies II is just a decent party, something that will pass you if you are bored and nothing else. 4/10
