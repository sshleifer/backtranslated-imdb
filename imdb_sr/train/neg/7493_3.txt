I could not believe my eyes when I was watching Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television. It begins very slowly, the backgrounds of the Nuremberg trials become clear step by step, the Germans have a ridiculous English accent, but then, suddenly, in the last few minutes of the first part of the series, the audience sees the most shocking, terrible shots I've ever seen. It's important that people see such recordings (although I absolutely do not agree with people who claim that there is no minimum age in which children can be exposed to this kind of material), but in this movie it was completely funny. This exclusively meant to improve the influence of the ordinary TV series. It was supposed to shock the audience, which is very cheap and incredibly easy. Instead of trying to move us with well-made scenes, inspiring dialogue or an interesting view, the audience is struggling with horrible pictures of inmates with skin and costumes. He does not show respect for the victims of the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> I am very angry.
