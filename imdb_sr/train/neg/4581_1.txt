A pathetic attempt to use science to justify the religion / philosophy of the new era. The two of them have nothing to do with each other, and much of what has been said about quantum physics in this mess is simply wrong. Examples? Quantum theory supports the ideas of Eastern religions that reality is an illusion. How? Well, in the world of subatomic, you can never definitely predict the location of the particles at a given time. It is only possible to give the prospect of being right in one place at a time. Also, the act of observation affects the event. Solid particles can pass through barriers. All this is right up to now. But then they argue that this means that if you sincerely believe that you can pass through the wall, you can really do it. This is a complete poppicock. Instead, the theory claims that at our level it is possible to walk through the wall, but this is only by chance and has nothing to do with belief. Likewise, you should continue to walk on the wall forever to have even the most frustrating chances to pass through the wall, chances are so astronomical against it. It's just one example of how wrong it is to present science. But it's a boring story of an unhappy photographer, played by Marlee Maitlan. About half the image becomes so confused that it is incomprehensible. Something about negative thoughts that leads to addiction and hatred towards oneself. There may be some truth in that, but quantum physics has nothing to do with it. In addition, string theory is today a new hot thing in physics. Instead of wasting time with this shit, I suggest you rent Elegant Universe, an amazing series made for NOVA on PBS that gives you a history of physics from Neuton and gravity to Ed Vitten and M Theori in just 3-hour episodes. Quantum mechanics is well explained here if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation.
