What about all Turkish actors? No offense, but I thought it was all for all these actors. The film did not have a script to test any actor's acting ability or ability. He demanded unnecessarily that I bought this film to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors, but this film was another failure for him. The scenario was so bad. Theirs was nothing to affect your teeth and all the characters were two-dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass, but the script and direction did not even allow him to do enough with his character to make him more interesting or more three-dimensional. Even the sound effects of shooting at the beginning of the film sounded like a noise of a gun gun with a shot in the clash. It was really weird and did not sound like a real gun. The video game had better sound effects than this movie. At the beginning of the film there was also a very boring guy who was a member of the gang of robberies. He had that American whimpering voice as a girl shouting, "Let's get out of here F # $ a" and "What are we going to do with a man". He sounded like a girl. Positive It was funny to watch and I laughed too. A few seconds, Vhoo Hoo! Glup film, the poor Madsen.
