It's hard to say what was the worst in this show: bad acting, bad acoustics of different parts, bad CGI, irregular sets for that period, bad scenario. It would be nice for the script to follow the original story a little closer - enough tension and good material in Beovulf to provide a lot of good material and a better story than scriptwriters could think of. /> And why introduce a weird new weapon like a crossbow that fires explosive screws? I see that this film was shot in "just" 21 days. This shows a lack of quality. I begin to think that this is a general (bad) attitude of the Sci-Fi channel (and others) when it comes to making movies from classic stories in the past few years. <br /> <br /> What a waste!
