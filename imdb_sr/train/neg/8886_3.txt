He's not very impressed. It's hard to offer any kind of spoof this movie, because there's almost no development on the store. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes, and from there it looks as if it looks dry. The play also seems very bad and reminds me of the old black and white films from the Maoist era that were occasionally shown on Chinese television. Although this is difficult to say with a female role, as if the story seems like she only needs a tour as a wooden doll. It reminds me of the faded star Gong Li who somehow got the reputation of a good actress in the West, which was constantly frowning on his face. Tian Zhuangzhuang's "Blue Dragon" movie was a far better film. But do not be fooled by the fact that the spring in a small town was set in the late 1940s. Unlike Blue Dragon, the fact that this movie is set at the time of the overthrow is irrelevant to the plot itself, the ruins of the city are nothing more than a picturesque scenery. I wonder if Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to capitalize on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and attract audiences from abroad who can not distinguish the difference between a film that is 'beautiful' 'deep' or 'hypnotic' and which is simply boring and irrelevant. If any film fits in the description of 'overvalued', that's it. I do not see a reason to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.
