You would not expect such a film to be good, and it is not. It's no budget, an ultra-violent zombie movie shot with a hand-held camera ... and it's funny. The actors have obviously never acted before and shows this in their terrible cheerful readings. There is no complication to see. It seems that the small plot I found looked like a government experiment escaped, and it looks like a group of zombies are terrorizing several families. The effects above are in fact some of the worst I've ever seen. The effects appear to have burnt into the butcher for all parts of the body, and many scenes include zombies that combine people and eat their organs. It's a funny and disgusting movie, and it's as bad as you can get in terms of any movie. My Rating: BOMB / ****. 90 min.
