This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Events in it are completely random and have little or no sense. The fact that there is a continuation is so nasty that they can get the case of fever in the cabin (I'm so sorry). I describe it as a mistake in the newspaper because it seems that different parts of things seem to be mixed up. for example. Kevin, a karate kid who loves pancakes, is just strangely strange, then there's a policeman who is a little strange and distorted, and then a drug addict, then the fact is that they are attacking some random type that obviously needs help. then suddenly the main character of sex with a friend of a friend just because she says something stupid about the fall of the plane. then, in the end, some good old family racism followed by a rabbit who worked on Kevin's karate kid. In fact, it is quite reasonable that racism can be used as a joke in this film. There is no reason for anyone to enjoy this film if you do not like Elijah Roth, even that did not make me like this movie. Hatred is a strong word, but given that it is the only word that I am allowed to use, I will have to do it. BOICOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
