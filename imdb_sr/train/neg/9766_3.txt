Roger Corman is undoubtedly one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He was individually responsible for some of my favorite horror films ever (such as Edgar Allen Poe's adaptations of "Red Death Mask" and "Pit and Pendulum"), as well as some unbearable cheap and sticky high-speed trash (like "Creature"). from "Haunted Sea" and "She Gods of the Shark Reef"). Corman made several films that are simply unclassified and ?? simply put ?? it is almost impossible to evaluate correctly. "Travel," for example, as this imaginatively called "Gas-s-s-s" can be somewhat labeled as psychedelic exploitation. In other words, they are incredibly strange films under the influence of the hippie culture. Half the time you do not have the slightest idea of ​​what's happening, who are those characters walking back and forth through the screen and where this thing is going on. The plot is simple and yet very effective: weird, but lethal nerve gas is accidentally released and immediately destroys the entire world population aged 25 years. post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi landmark, but writers George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to turn it into a "trippy" comedy along the way. No figure attempts to prevent their inevitable coming death; They just have fun in the streets and find small unions for minor crimes. "Gas-s-s" is disappointingly boring and trying too hard to be bizarre. It seems that the entire script is improvised on the spot and not funny at all. It's definitely not my cup of tea, but the film has a loyal fan base and many fans, so who am I to say that it's not worth your time or money?
