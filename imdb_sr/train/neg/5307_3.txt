What happened? "Suspicion" had so much potential to be a brilliant film - but instead it stumbled upon pulling out a simplified line of complications that made me stop watching. The only thing for the film was the brightness of Meril Streep, which none of DOUBT earned for an Oscar nomination. Although it was not one of her best performances, she still gave us a solid and true character that flourished through the screen. However, even the brilliance of the legend on the screen could not save this movie in the hill. From a boring start, which did not have the strength or impact - to a less convincing ending, the film was really disappointing - especially because it provided so much potential through its promotion and trailers. It was obvious that the director had problems with the simplicity of complicity and ended up with a boring film that took place too long, with too much conversation and insufficient action. Moreover, other nominations for the Oscars were less than convincing. Although Philip Seimour Hoffman gave a decent performance, this was by no means worth the Oscars. (Especially because they have completely omitted performances such as Vill Smith, in Seven Pounds). Amy Adams did not earn a nomination. Watching Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box - as it was one-sided and simple. It would make more sense for her to nominate for Razzie, because I'm sure she would win. Viola Davis gave a short but true performance, but the length of her performance questioned her whether the Academy should really give her a nomination. It was a mess of the movie with so much potential, and I do not recommend it. The only glittering light in the movie is Meril Streep, which, although giving amazing, solid performance - does not even do enough to save this film. *** / 10.
