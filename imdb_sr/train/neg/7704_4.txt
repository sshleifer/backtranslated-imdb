Well, there is no real complication to talk about, it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and free sex (which can sometimes be fun, but not in this case). What else can I say about this ...? The action, when it happens, is inventive and there's a cool scene in which two characters fall from the skyscraper (one that must be a few miles high), but there is not much to recommend "Kite". Watch if you want, but you do not miss a lot if you skip this ...
