The special effects of this film, especially for their time, are ridiculous and used in such a way that you can not deny their terrible existence. The act redefines the term "terribly exaggerated" in the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where Julie Nevman and Andrew Divoff only redefined "bad". *** spoilers *** Charm in this movie can be found in two things: First is the excellent casting of Carel "Lurch" Struicken as a mysterious Psychopath Gaunt, who can to feel where and when people will die and is always there. Other original finds, the combination of SF-West is obviously genuine, if it's terrible, but other findings are more original, such as the Zack Stone gunner able to sense the pain of the people shooting (although his acting behavior here). > <br /> Over ... do not watch this movie, unless you love that brutal Career Strucken, as every Dutch self-esteem should take.
