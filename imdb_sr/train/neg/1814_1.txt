All these reviewers are on site. I've seen many bad films over the years, believe me, and this is much better! This is not just "as bad as it is good" time explorer, but rather real, hilarious, video affiliates. CHECK the thing with a white furry monster! <br /> <BR> ENJOY TO DEATH in Thom Christopher's "weaving spell" that works! GAPE IN SHEER A ** E-CLENCHING DISBELIEF! on worn sets! This is one of those "European co-productions". No wonder we have so many wars. I swear, some of the people who participate in the 'Wizards of the Lost Kingdom' are not really aware of the appearance of the movie! FACTORY! I originally watched this movie on HTV Vales one night while I was suffering from a brainwashing and sleep deprivation. I had to find a copy a couple of weeks later to make sure it was really so horrible. It is. Even worse than Lee Majors in The Norseman, more ridiculous than all of John Derek's films, this is, in fact, Citizen Kane Trash.
