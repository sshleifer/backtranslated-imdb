I have to admit that I am very disappointed. This version can not in any way compete with the 1995 version. The reason I looked at it was that I was not completely satisfied with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Ventvorth thought that Rupert Penri-Jones looks much more like Captain I imagined when I read the book. And he was too much. Unfortunately, this is the only quality of the film that is redeemable. The rest is as much as possible not as Austen. Miss Elliot would never run like this on the streets of Bath. It was not in her character and it was not done by just one lady from that time. Anne Eliot from the book was a lady and had her dignity. There are other painful anachronisms, but this was the worst. Although there are three important quotes from the book, they are in totally inappropriate moments, warning those who know the book that another important part of the book either will disappear or will change completely. Although this version is not much shorter than the other, it looks like everything is hurrying. Very little attention is dedicated to introducing characters, showing their dispositions and motives. Important scenes are omitted. How is it possible that in this way they killed the final scenes? Catastrophe! And it's not far so beautifully photographed as the other. No, no, no. If you love Austen, then it does not waste time with this.
