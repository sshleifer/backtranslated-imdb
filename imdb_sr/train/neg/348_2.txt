This film is shy and unforgettable Sean Conneri. Performances are mostly crazy especially by Capshav, Fishburne and usually solid Ed Harris. Conneri seems wrong as Harvard Academician. The movie worsens worse. It is a third-rate mystery that becomes extremely fictitious until the time of the gloom. The film scatter excellent support. George Plimpton also appeared in a minor role to add some gravity to the Connerie while discussing the death penalty. Violence and the atmosphere are the third stage of a mystery / thriller that is largely manipulated. Script and direction are extremely bad. Connery's charisma and the presence of the screen are the only virtue of the film. Manipulative, violent and funny. 2/10 Avoid it.
