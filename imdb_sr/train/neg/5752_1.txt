I do not usually comment, but there are things to say. Where to start ... The acting, on the side of Jeremy London, was terrible! I did not think he could be so bad. The action could have been good, that it was well targeted, along with the good performance of the main actor. Unfortunately, this is one of those films you are reading about and you think it has a great potential for entertainment, but disappoint it from the very beginning. Well, at least I smiled a bit. I would not be wasting my time if I were you.
