The emission is average. That does not make me particularly funny. However, I think Courtnei really does it. It does not look natural. She has these three ways to talk, all the robotics. She speaks quietly (without intonation), she normally talks (without intonation), or it works where she starts to speak normally, and begins to shout gradually. However, her shouting is like "let's pretend to shout, because I should not be louder on the set." She is constantly aware that this sweet actress is doing this strange thing. Nervira. You can not really get her personality, because she does not produce emotions and does not get excited. She has her husband, who does all these stupid things, and there is no reaction from her. Very dry and simple.
