This is a depressingly shallow, naive and largely awkward look at the incredibly incredible relationship between Brooks's psychotic film editor and Harold, his crazy girlfriend. The two of them have ZERO chemistry together - primarily because Harold is not able to do anything except that she looks pretty at this stage of her career; but also because Brooks's character is neither interesting nor sympathetic. Initially he has 15 static, painful minutes, when Brooks, just breaking up with Harold, fell into his apartment in a depressing, drugged country - unbearable. You are so beautiful, "there simply is not enough material for the feature film. Almost nothing happens on the periphery of their relationship to give the impression that these people exist in the real world. I'm sure Brooks's intention was to oversee the white luminous brightness of the affair and, in a way, deconstruct it; but if you do, writing and acting must be far better than what is here.
