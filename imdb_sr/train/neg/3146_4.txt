the author of the book, with the same title, should not allow her name to be used for this film. if you read the book, this film takes on such a liberal interpretation of current events in the book and its spirit that film and books have little in common with the title and some superficial details. The film does not add anything, in terms of artistic merit, its own literary achievement. For those who have not read the book: and you will be disappointed. Not only does the action move at an incredibly slow pace, it does not offer anything more as it moves slowly (like developing a character, for example). some viewers may entertain some of the graphic lesbian scenes later on in the movie, but you can also watch a special show for the things that are featured in the film and Isabelle - that's pretty smart and not imaginative at all.
