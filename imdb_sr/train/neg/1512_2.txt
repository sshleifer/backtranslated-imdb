A bad week attempt, complete with a sub-second acting actor, terrible work on the camera, half-story and strong aftertaste of lame propaganda. Yes, they are "sex offenders," they live in the neighborhood and you will be really raped. There are no surprises from women's deputy, it acts as always - equally convincing as a piece of wood. Richard Gere continues to go down and down - and here he is almost like Steven Seagal. Female singer with crazy eyes is best when she is dead in bed; and even the wolf was a sub-pair (although it was the most successful in the movie) - maybe it was fed before the shooting, or something like that. Unlike the "Seven", which had (made) but an interesting story, to which it may relate more or less regardless of the country, it appears that this film focuses on an obsession only in the United States -u. If she does not care much about "sex offenders" - and statistics are that lack of exercise and poor diet cause more pain, suffering and death - there is no reason to see it or to be afraid. There are some fetishes with some part of the body and some bumblebee, but the upper is less than the central one, and it does not work even as an artistic device (because it's meaningless) and as above, because it is not cruel enough. Do not waste time on this.
