Some illegal so called Asylum comes to Stuttgart and believes that the Germans are "racist". This is just another forgotten rice on a long list of anti-German propaganda films after World War II, which aims to make Germans feel "bad" because they do not accept all the degenerate in their country so they can hunting German blondes and selling drugs to German teenagers. If you are looking for good German films in general, see "Der Tunnel", "Der Untergang", "Europa Europa", and "Lola rennt." But not this. Also, "Das Experiment," with the same actor from "Lola rennt".
