Someone should tell Goldie Havn that her career as a teenage gamine was completed thirty years ago. This is one of the worst movies released for years, an unequivocal disaster in which two leaders surrender to the frenetic exposure of their trademarks in an attempt to compensate for bad scripts and bad directing. This thing should have been suppressed at birth. I hope John Cleese is paid a lot for being his name related to this disaster. He is the only artist who has gone through this stinking mess more or less unharmed, and his only guilt was the failure to realize that the rest of the actors will sink the picture.
