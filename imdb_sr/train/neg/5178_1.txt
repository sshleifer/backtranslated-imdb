I feel that my duty as horror movie fans is to warm up other people about this terrible and very bad "horror" movie. Do not waste time and money on this movie, the acting is bad, the story is just one of the worst I've ever encountered and the script was horrible. Nothing about this was good, in the end, you thought about why I'm watching this shit. The plot had so many holes in it and eventually never cleared up, it was so bad, I do not know how to make such a horrible movie. As I said before I loved horror movies and I was so down, there were 18, but you see a little blood and no fear or jumps. And what aroused me was that the nonsense took place in a movie that did not make sense at all for the action such as kissing brother and sister, why? is all I can say. Just do not bother, there are many more horror movies, just do not waste your time on life is too short.
