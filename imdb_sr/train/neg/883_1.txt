Problems with this film are numerous, but I will try to mention the most expressive and the most unpleasant. First of all, although the theme suggests numerous vignettes about life in Manhattan, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and television, was something of a bizarre, usually sexual nature. The stories were slim or nonexistent, and practically every scene, camera image, dialogue line and expressive emotions were absolutely and completely fake. He finally got to the point after an hour of such a stinking rubbish that I left (something that was not unusual for me in the last few years). , but I believe that (at one point, the pre-Amelie, talented) director Mira Nair took part in this disgusting tragedy, and perhaps the director's talent in America massively descended into a septic tank.
