First, this film begins on a very stupid note: a ten-year-old girl playing in a moving vehicle decides it would be ridiculous to conceal her mom's eyes with her hands, and then cause a terrible accident that kills mom ... the ghost ... . I'm sorry, there are no positive 10-year-olds who are stupid. The rest of the movie does not get much better. After the death of the mother by the obviously dumbest 10-year-old on the planet, Dad moved his family to Genoa, Italy, where he will teach at a local university, but here he is: he does not speak Italian! Then the girl has the "visions" of the mother (which she killed), and often the night horrors always, always ending by the father who holds it and the lace. Then we are forced to look at how this family is constantly losing, then find it, then hug, then we cry and lose, and then we find (followed, of course, more embrace and crying) to the extent that I actually wanted a kind Natural disasters just wipe out all these silly, ignorant from the planet. Do not misunderstand me because I love indie, but indie about stupid people (and I mean really stupid) is simply funny and meaningless. It is a real shame that this film is based on such insider characters that are valid in such retarded scenarios because the site is interesting.
