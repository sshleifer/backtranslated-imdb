The thing that really links me to this movie (i.e., about this movie that makes me physically sick) is that someone actually paid to make it. There is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this film. It's not scary, it does not provoke thoughts, it's not fun, it's not good. It's a cyanide sleeping tablet. The DVD case is compared to Blair Vitch, Evil Dead and several other decent films, which makes the film's despair obvious. It's nothing like any other movie ever made; It's far, far worse. Claims of "extremely shocking ending you will never forget" are the equivalent of one ton of stinking horses. Please do not waste your time watching this piece of garbage because it can make you sterile. The man who wrote this film should be deleted from the list of Vriter's Guild members, and never allowed him to record something again. Because if he thought this movie was worth making, he probably does not have much to offer in the future. Zero stars. Let Grod pity your soul enough unhappy to see this. I'm going to go back now.
