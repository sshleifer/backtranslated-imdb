What is the purpose of watching a movie like this one? It's painful and embarrassingly bad, even in a way that makes you laugh. Films like "The Little Man" depress me. They represent a movie in the fullest. This film was made for a bunch of boys aged 18-24 who hoped to leave and see him at dinner before it was bad, so the movie could quickly recover. Hundreds of other filmmakers with great ideas were probably unable to make their movies because the resources went to making this vomit of vomit. Grade: F
