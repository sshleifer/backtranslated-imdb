Genie (Zoe Trilling) arrives in Egypt to visit his hypocritical, biblical archaeologist (Villiama Finleia) and attracts the attention of a group of cultures led by the descendant of Markuis de Sade (Robert Englund). Englund also plays de Sade in flashbacks, tapping into the cell. The ghost is seduced by Mohammed (Juliano Merr), riding around the horse and Sabine (Alona Kamhi), a bisexual who is familiar with opium smoking, which leads to wild hallucinations with toples harem dancers, a woman who simulates oral sex on a snake , an orgy and her father who preaches in the background! In the meantime, members of the cult of black hoods cut their heads, pull out the eyeballs and cross the throat. When Genie inserted drugs into his tea, he imagines de Sade hanging on a cross, a golden-colored woman in a leafy cord, and bloody bloody on a bed covered with snakes. It's all because she is the reincarnation of de Sade's lost love. This typical late Harry Alan Tovers production is superfluous, stupid and rather pointless, but sets, costumes, cinemas and work at the site are great and at least something happens.
