"Envy" is bad for many reasons. Yes, there are unusual characters. It is not a problem. It's that they are unsuitable and that we do not care at all. "The Var of the Roses" featured unobtrusive characters, but due to proper representation they became at least interested in their fate, while the "Envi" introduction is slim, characters are never convincing, and the plot only worsens things <br /> < > Ben Stiller is simply disgusting in his role and I adore his work for most of the time. Stiller led a campaign to post this straight to the video and now I see why. The film suggests that he is "the best friend" with Jack Black, but from the first five minutes we get the snapshots that seem to point to Stiller hating Black. I thought it would evolve into a kind of unilateral relationship (a la "The Cable Gui"), but it never does, instead of Stiller insisting that he was his "best friend" and I felt confused as it seemed Treats Black as Well "Poo." The film's action is ridiculous, but that does not matter, because it should be an exaggerated story of morality. Unfortunately, the message is lost in disarray. Valken gives a good performance, but Black is off-kei and boring (and I usually find it very funny). No, it's not a horrible movie, but I still can not believe that Barry Levinson ("Rain Man", "Sleepers") is responsible for this - it's not one of the worst movies of all time, but it could certainly be much better. . I wish Va-Poo-Rize existed - so that this film might disappear forever.
