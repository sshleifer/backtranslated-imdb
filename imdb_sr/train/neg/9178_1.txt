What is called the "House of the Dead," the worst film of all time is that it really is not. There are bad bad movies. I watch a lot of ninja movies in Hong Kong, which are basically the result of an unfinished Japanese police drama that eventually created a ninja to create something that could technically be called a "movie". The dead is still one of the worst movies I've ever seen in theaters. Walking half way, I actually felt I was a little stupid enough to spend 45 minutes of this garbage.
