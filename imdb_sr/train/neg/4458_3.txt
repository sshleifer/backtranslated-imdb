Most of the French films I saw - and enjoyed - were more stories than action, but that's fine. I found them interesting, well-photographed and intriguing actors. (However, at one point I wonder if Gerald Depardieu was in every French movie ever made! It looked like this.) This film has the same interesting picture and had a good opening. But then it became an interview, a conversation and more conversations ... which is good for drama, but not for the mystery of murder. After a while, I almost fell asleep watching this. In fact, the movie was more like a game with almost all of the scenes that were played in one room. So, if you like the shows, you should like this ... but I want a little more for the story of the murder.
