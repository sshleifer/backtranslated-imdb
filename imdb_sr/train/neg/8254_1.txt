I've seen better productivity on iouTube! I am sorry the actors, because the writing was terrible, and the direction was shocking, he was not sure how to get the rows - I really doubt that any actor would be able to save this film no matter how good they were. The characters were not developed at all, and there was no real cohesion in a conspiracy that looked as if it was not going anywhere. It is a shame that the premise for the film was good and with a better quality of production, directing and scripting could be a decent movie. It certainly was not a comedy, unless you laugh at the dubbing - what was amateur, even English actors sounded weird.
