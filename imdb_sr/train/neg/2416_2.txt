2 stars, and I'm generous. Look, this is a low-budget zombie movie set up in the Oakland gangland. How the plot goes, the scientist wants to return his dead brother to life after he was killed in a ride. The main problem with this movie: which zombies?! All the "zombies" work on the rearing (which does not sound even frightening) and drops the fake red blood from their mouths! No scary eyes, no rotten meat, only a bunch of people who pathetically cut and run around like idiots. Lid also misleads. There are only about 6 zombies in the whole movie, so it's not like the whole "hood" is burdened with zombies or anything else, that's just a few, and at no time does it exist. Actually, it's so bad that it's hilarious. Nobody can act in this movie (except perhaps one of the gang members) and it really seems that a group of friends has gathered, decided to cast their family and make a movie one weekend. Final note: Since when doctors wear sweatshirts?! Skip this, please!
