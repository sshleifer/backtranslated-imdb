This film was a blow to me. I suppose that little girls should strive to be nothing more than a swimwear model, housewife or mistress, as it seems to be anything that will ever be shown as usual. It is truly sad to see the work and life of artists who are so wrongly interpreted wrongly. Undoubtedly (or to be expected), Artemisian's whole character and everything for which he stands up, are reduced to a standard Hollywood, female character; poor, physically impeccable, helpless little creature, which did not show any of the characteristic lines that actually gave it a place in the history that was disfigured here. Sadder now was to see that a large part of the audience was too poorly educated in the area to understand the incredible gap between the message being transmitted in film and reality. To show the artist as someone in love with her real rapist, someone she actually accused of raping her even when she was under torture, she just pisses me off. If the director had nothing more important to say that he should have been refrained to base his story on the right person.
