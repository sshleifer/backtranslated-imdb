I should have believed my instincts better: without expectation - without disappointment. Instead, I expected to experience a similar masterpiece such as Koiaaniskatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed. Povakkatsi, in my humble opinion, is nothing but a cheap attempt to redeem the cult success of its predecessor, and - artistic - collapses. It seems that some producer collected the rest of the material from Koiaaniskatsija, rushed him together, put everything in a slow motion, and got a pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to hurriedly blend some banal music that is continually repeating. Where Koiaaniskatsi entertains the viewer with rapid and slow changes, Povakkatsi is one long series of everyday pictures in a slow motion (if you watch them on your VCR in a quick overview, you will see what I think). What disappointed me most was Philip Glass's soundtrack. I could not - and still can not - believe that these commercially sound Nev Age types of trunks, which could easily be assembled one afternoon by any 14-year-old Casio calculator, were from the same composer who brilliantly composed an emotional and perfectly synchronized music for Koiaaniskatsi. All in all, a great waste of time! My advice: Forget about commercialism! Watch Koiaaniskatsi again instead!
