Amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosopher's novel "Celestial Prophecy," which follows the spiritual awakening of teachers who are unemployed in a mysterious village in Peru. Domestic video actors are so-called characters that throw out an overloaded exposure and a metaphysical hockey, while the film launches the extremely difficult direction of Armand Mastroianni. Although there are visible attempts to measure and interest fans of a greater pleasure in the futile ABC's Lost or Dan Brovn's Da Vinci Code, filmmakers are barely up to the task. This film is responding to poorly designed spiritual mass propaganda propaganda, and the results are so scary that they can go through this mess in order to spot the right point.
