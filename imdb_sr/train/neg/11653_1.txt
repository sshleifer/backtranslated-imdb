The first one was different and funny. This attempt never left the studio. This movie does not make you smile. It's a bad attempt at rude humor. The film shows current and old movies to get rid of them. This time, jokes are used and exaggerated. The audience I saw just reappeared on the scene of Hannibal's dinner and she was otherwise asleep.
