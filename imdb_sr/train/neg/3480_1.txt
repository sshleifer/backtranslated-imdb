This movie is horrible. TERRIBLE. One of the worst movies ever. I can not even imagine Gigli being worse than this. The looks forced us to say "NO", but then we searched for something in the middle of the shit right now, we decided to continue and give him a chance. STUPID US. > Affleck is not an actor. He is a picture and can look good with explosions, but not even the one Bruce Villis got in "Die Hard". If he took off his shirt and ran around the bad guys, it would be a comedy. The best part was Catherine O'Hara - she's always good. Gandolfini collapsed again (if there was no The Sopranos, he would be washed) as he did in the "Mexican". He has any motivation for his actions. REMOVE THIS FILM ON ALL COSTS.
