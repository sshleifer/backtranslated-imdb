Although in many ways I agree with the comments of other reviewers. I think the plot and ideas are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The fatal problem with this film is Ellen Pompeo. I'm sure I've never seen a less talented "actor". How this person has ever been in a movie or on television, I can not imagine. In my opinion, she would be better at Val-Mart. To see a person with such a low level of talent involved in paying a role, asks the question ... "Who does she know"? I'd like to make this movie again with some talent. I do not blame the writer because this movie was not worth the time to look at it.
