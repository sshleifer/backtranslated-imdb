I managed to keep only the first twenty minutes of this low-budget film. The brightest absurdity was that all American inmates in the North Korean prison camp were allegedly suffering from severe deprivation of food and medicine, without bathing, trembling in poor and dirty parks and sleeping on bare floors, and - we do not forget permanent torture - they always manage to They fight for perfect hair. With the exception of Harry Morgan, which is appropriately modest, as a military major, casting and acting are simply terrible. It seems Ronald Regan does not hold a portrait of one character and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam from past roles. It can be forgiven mainly by the Caucasian actor who portrays the North Korean camp officers, but when it is assumed that the Russian officers were Koreans' advisors, they were wrapped in wearing Nazi uniforms along with jodhpuri and boots (apparently the recycling department was recycled from the World War II phase) and speaking with accents such as General Burkhalter from Hogan's Hero, it's just six kinds of nonsense. Do not waste your time on this.
