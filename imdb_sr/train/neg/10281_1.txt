Carli Pope plays JJ, a recently promoted food critic, whose sparkling, persistent mother moves to her. JJ, appalled by this turn of events, then blackmails the restaurant owner, Alek, to entertain his mother in exchange for "perhaps" viewing his dying restaurant. Alek predictably falls on his daughter while he is warming up for his mother. With this film there are numerous problems, the characters are universally two-dimensional. JJ is self-serving, hateful character, mother is superficial and shallow. JJ's colleagues in the magazine are silly and opportunist. The basic message of a woman over 50 years old who is not able to do it alone, without male help is bad, bad, bad. The play is equally boring, the script is not inspired. A film that only saves grace is the setting in New York. I would not recommend this movie.
