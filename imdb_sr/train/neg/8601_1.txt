Okay, where to start with this little jeweler? Mutant worms begin to take over the small town of New Englanda? Only one man can stop them ... and this man ... is Mike Brady! Now, if it's not funny enough, stay with us. Slug videos are what is known as a stock clip. Regardless of who the sluggers are or wherever they are, the same shot of a bunch of snares that are bouncing everywhere is shown. Keep in mind that this single occupies at least half the film. The act in the movie is demolished, pulled, stolen from the wallet, hit your girlfriend, killed a dog, BAD. I'm sure it's worse, but it's hard to find you. The only jewel is ... you guess ... MIKE BRADI! He must have spent several nights in the IMCA because he was the best in the group. What about horror? This film should not be taken seriously. No horror! They are slugs for loud crying. The entire lift action could have been avoided with the help of shaker for one or two. Just watch this movie in the MST3K type, otherwise I see some bigger damage to the brain.
