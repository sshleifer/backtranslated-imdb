A serial killer dies in a snowstorm and mutates into the evil twin of Frost Snovman. Then go to the murder. Interesting plot. Sounds terrifying. And it's terrifying. If you have five years. Otherwise, it's kind of cheesy. I saw him on the cable and I'm glad that I did not pay the money to see him. He has all the charm and style of a low-budget film that can become a cult film. I'm sure there's a loyal fan base somewhere. I'm just not in it. Although I did not like the movie as a whole, there were some fun scenes. Such as the scenes when the scene after an explosion with Picasso's reference. It was also pleasing to watch many of the ways heroes are trying to kill Jack and he just does not want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good low-budget B-film comedy, but a bad budget B-movie horror.
