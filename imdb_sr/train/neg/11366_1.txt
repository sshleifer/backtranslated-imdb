The first (and only) time I saw "Shades" was during Sneakpreviev. It was not even premiered. I remember there was one of the directors there, I do not even remember who. It was a Belgian film, we never heard, so we were pretty neutral, not knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and he stands miles ahead of everyone else. He plays the actor who has long ceased to rise. Helps in the realization of the film in Belgium under the name "Shades". As soon as the film began, we noticed how curses are. Nothing against occasional cursing. However, it was much more than annoying. Whenever Rourke uses F *** to say something, she comes naturally. However, when someone from the acting group, a non-English speaker uses F **** or S *** word, becomes arrogant and aggressive. they used F and S words. Everyone was happy to leave the theater. And we had to vote, but it was difficult for us, because it was only 10 to 10, and we were looking for it.
