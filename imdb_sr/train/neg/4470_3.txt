This should be a comedy, but mostly a bad taste, and nothing that causes a smile on the film. The film talks about a couple who are trying for a child, and those in real life who are in such a situation will hug on the pictures shown. For example, scenes in the fertility clinic are not at all funny and quite unpleasant. The male leader who plays the construction worker and who is in his drop comes in with a bad excuse for refusing from the village. The women's leadership is trying to look 20 years younger than her. Both potentials are unattractive, unattractive, and completely unconvincing. In the film, there are various funny and completely modest free scenes, for example, with a budget airline that is devoid of any humor. The only reason I give this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is one mark for Shirlei Maclaine, which is class above everything in the pic, and one mark for half decent (though old) music.
