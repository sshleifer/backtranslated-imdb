Lately they have been trying to record this movie late in the evening on cable television advertisements. Do not believe hyper-u. I was one of the unfortunate people who watched this stink in cinemas. This is, in my opinion, the third worst film of all time, just behind Mac & Me (# 1 Vorst), and Jack Frost (# 2 Vorst), but I must admit, they are all close and they are all TERRIBLE! Really, none of this movie is funny, or disturbing, or anything that claims to be so that you do not lose your money. The only thing that's good is giving the worst enemy. I'm not lying about it. Someone who would like to kill or torture would be the main candidate for this film. It's so horrible. If you do not believe me then you deserve to suffer for misery by looking at this, which I doubt you can end up with. Two Thumbs Enthusiasticalli Dovn.
