Despite the 2001 film, the direction is the style of an art-house from the 1990s, which was considered "old" and obsolete a few years ago. Crude cuts and effects were painful to watch. The scenario is decent enough, and a few scenes made me feel (like when a taxi driver drives them to the bridge). But the story with a detective whose sister was killed and how he was obsessed with suicide was simply horrible. The performance of an actor who plays married boy Selma Blair seriously upset me. I've been sitting through the whole thing, which is rare for random, what kind of movie you just find on TV and decide to watch.
