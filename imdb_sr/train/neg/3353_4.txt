A pretty bad movie does not offer anything new. Common screams and thugs try to make up for a mess, but a tiny story. The act is barely above the pathetic. Why Liam Neeson signed for this was any assumption. Owen Wilson really turns into one of the worst performances in the history of horror. Catherine Zeta Jones is fun to watch, not much, although Lili Taior worked above average. The special effects were quite unforgettable and the house itself took its breath and it was beautiful. However, they can not make up for a poor acting and a story that seems to have been thrown out at the last minute. Do not bother.
