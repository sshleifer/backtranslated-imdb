If your real and predictable trileri are for rape and revenge, then you are a rare treat ... I do not like it, so I could not find any thing to buy this strange story. It seems to be something that came out of the '80s, a different age when it would happen directly on the video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dier are working fine with a bad script and fatigue scenario. But what does Gillian Anderson do in a movie like this after a great performance like Ladi Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year? It was said that the director was influenced by the testimony of almost rape and his work on documentary films, but even that is not an excuse for the bizarre scene in which the hellish village dogs broke Diera. I do not think I was the only person in the movie who laughed. What I do not understand is the involvement of companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some of the biggest independent British films in recent years. Verve distributes Bullet Boi, Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads do not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFur and Verve take into account: is this really the best you can? What will independent British filmmakers do about your artistic court? It's a big stain on both of your reputations. Listen carefully: do you hear thousands of fans of independent British films crying in despair?
