It's my opinion that when you decide to re-create a very good movie, you should try to do better than the original; or at least give a new look. Now in 1963, Robert Vise, who spoke of Shirley Jackson's extraordinary novel The Haunting of Hill House, is still valid today. Now it's too fast forward to 1999 and re-made. I remained shaking my head and asked, why? The play is wooden, the story is unrecognizable, and it seems that all this is the replacement of the subtle horror of the original as many computers with special effects that they can create. I heard this update was bad; but he could not believe it was so bad, given the original material. I was wrong. After watching this, she told my wife how terrible it was, she said; "Well, they got your money!" She's right, do not let them take yours. If there is no profit in making bad rewrites, they may stop making them or reaching a higher standard that does not offend their audience.
