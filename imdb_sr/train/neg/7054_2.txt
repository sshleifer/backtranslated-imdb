This film was absolutely pathetic. The sad scenario and the lack of any story just left me looking at three losers who are afraid of bikini babies. Sometimes I felt like watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I could not even sit through the whole movie. Emran Hashmi disappoints; Hrshitta Bhatt is clearly not impressed at all. Celina Jaitlei was not bad. The only valuable part of the film is Anu Malik's whisper and his obsession with Shariari. It was pretty hilarious. The songs "Sini Ne" and her remix version were really good. You can always count on EMF lock and mouth synchronization. All in all, Emran does not appear to have a good scenario from Bhatts to support him this time.
