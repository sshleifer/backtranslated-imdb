The film was a great disappointment. Especially since he directed Priiadarshan, it was sad to see so bad standards. Poor script (almost nonexistent) and sequences of songs with bad songs every minute and in the most unusual way killed what the movie could offer. some of the scenes were funny, but that was probably only 5 minutes of the entire duration. The installation was pathetic. Dismal! All in all, the film was disappointed because the lack of a story was too obvious. In fact, only a few people have left to watch the other half of the film after an interval. If you do not watch a movie, you would not miss it. It's not worth spending the precious ticket to this movie. Wait until it appears on TV ...
