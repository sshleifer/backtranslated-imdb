Last night I decided to look over the bitch or say the so-called bitch to Carlit's road - "Carlisle's Way: Rise to Pover (2005)" which went straight to DVD ... no wonder ... it's completely .and I mean completely S% & KS !!! the waist of time watching him, and I think it would be a clear time of writing about it .... I do not understand how De Palma agreed to produce this sh # t-fest of the film ... except just Jai Hernandez, who plays Young Brigante. .. reminded me that De Niro went into Brands shoes to show young Don Corleone in Kum II ... but De Niro's difference was incredible and even won an Oscar for it !!! Jai Hernandez and he has the courage to be a young Pacino .... a pity for him I do not think he will play in the movie anymore and along the way after watching this film with the. and watched the original Carlitos way to get bad taste from bad mouths.
