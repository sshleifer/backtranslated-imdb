Allow me to say that I consider myself one of the more (most!) Open movie viewers ... Films are my passion, and I am a great order in the local cult film. ... I also feel the need to add that they often ask ME about the film advice whenever I get there and it seems to me that I can never leave this place without a detailed conversation or exchange of ideas about what is happening in the cult film field. .. I love renting strange things, and this is precisely why this film was recommended by one of the guys on the cult movie-video site. He told me that he thought I had to see this, and as the front page said that it was a movie with the atmosphere of Jodorovsky (one of my favorites!), I rented it. The vote I gave here is not fair, because I did not think it was terrible, I just did not know how to evaluate it. The questionnaire would be more convenient ... This is the first and only film that tortured me literally in my stomach: I actually felt physically ill! Am I the only one whose stomach literally turned around? However, I did not want to exclude it, or maybe I just could not because I was fascinated by the nasty way ... I never want to see this movie anymore. It's not terrible, 1 as I said. Not my tea (or vodka for it) ...
