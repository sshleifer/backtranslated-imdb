This was the first continuation I saw (except for the Return of the Jafar) and I honestly thought that I would watch it near the original. I was terribly disappointed. The story was, basically, the first script with several extra characters and the situation turned. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody, who is not happy with life on land. He wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her - and when Melody finds her upset and angry. Then he decides to escape, and she becomes a mermaid. She is so happy to swim around, and Ariel moves to find her - like a mermaid. The story does not sound badly written, but the clich√©s and repetition of the situation from the first movie are just too obvious. Adding to the fact that Melody, in general, is very boring, and the film becomes almost unbearable. There are also a number of other new characters - Tip and Dash are two of them. They are not as bad as the characters in themselves - just try not to think of Timon or Pumbai! The songs also leave much desire to wish, they simply do not have the same magical energy as the songs from the original. The animation obviously did not have a whole range of tasks invested in it - in some parts it is nervous, and little imagination is used to move characters. Another tip - try to forget Ariel's original character while watching this movie. A beautiful, rebellious, curious teenager has 'grown up' into a boring, boring woman and mother, and her red hair is tied up. It's much better to see if you've never seen the original - you will not have anything to compare it. However, overall, it could have been worse - not as bad as surely other sequels, such as Cinderella II. But it's not in the same league as the original. But for your collection, if nothing else, but if Disney continues like this, it will lose all its older fans.
