This "fuzzy comedy" seems very forced. Indeed, the actors are struggling to make an essentially infertile scenario. And, as a result, it does not go anywhere. The idea that a woman found out she was pregnant after she got a quick divorce is not that funny. And then, when Cooper splits up with the baby, because he does not want it to be set for adoption, it seems terribly immortal and it's really difficult to turn this into a comedy. It's really a pity, because the actors were more capable than the scripts, and I found myself confused my whole confusion. Since Cooper has made so many good comedies, I recommend that you see them.
