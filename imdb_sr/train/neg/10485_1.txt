The dark comic serendipity of the cosmetics retailer, with unusual connections with Elvis Presley, running into the sea of ​​Elvis's imitators while speaking at conventions in Nevada ... and accidentally killing each one of them with little guilt. Kim Basinger, still an attractive actor with significant merit, loves to choose movies, but this horrible scenario (Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) does not have any goodwill. Stereotypes and low balls should not be a classic comedy, but even at a disgraceful level, the picture is rough and messy. If you look, see if you can calculate how many foreign bullets Basinger has behind the wheel of her pink Cadillac, the hands are always in the same position and an unbridled expression on her face. I hope she and Elvis are well paid. NO STARS from ****
