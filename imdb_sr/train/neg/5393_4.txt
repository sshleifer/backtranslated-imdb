I'm a Shakespeare fan and I can appreciate what Ken Branagh did to bring Shakespeare back to a new generation of viewers. However, this film is unable to convey the overall intentions of the performance with funny music sequences. Add that Alicia Silverstone is clinging to the dialogue (reminiscent of Keanu Reeves in much of anything) and other bad roles, all equally tormenting the endurance of watching.
