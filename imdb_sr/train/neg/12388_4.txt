** WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER ** If you can choose from an extremely embarrassing theme, this film offers a huge help to the unseen campistic melodrama. Surprisingly, this film was copied and ripped-off several times over the years, although it's hard to realize that any movie creator was inspired by this trash drama. None of Hemingway's women can work here (although Mariel has improved over the years), Anne Bancroft offers just a touch of class as a prosecutor, and Chris Sarandon is pathetic and unintentionally hilarious as well as an escape Veterinary director Lamont Johnson can not make a silky purse from the ear of this sower of the script, which is filled to fill up with a very bad dialogue and unusual situations. For example, the last sequence, where Margauk catches his shotgun and shoots Sarandon after his last shocking act, should be exciting, but instead causes heartbreaking gossip. Add the notoriously loud and vibrant musical score of Michel Polnareff and you have the pleasure, although you will probably feel dirty and you need a warm shower after you look at it. Do not say that you were not warned.
