This film is boring and pretentious. There is only one good moment when the sailor wipes the g. Barney (think purple eyebrows). Music is relentlessly silly - it's sad that Bjork, someone with so much inner beauty, is down on a pretentious lie in his art. The highlight of the tea service makes the wonderful ritual meaningless. Mythology and culture are not respected in this film that has been abolished. Not only from Japanese culture, but also from other filmmakers ... (stay in progress) At the perfect moment, "art imitates life" - the crew of the ship finds a gigantic piece of sh * t. That's what the audience found in the theater. There are some sets that are very complicated and arts without heart - then? Prepare for spoilers, I'm talking to MR BARNEY. The car has no clothes! Mr. Barney, you are expelled! I saw Jodorovsky's mountain. And your thin, fake veil of the BS has been erected. You stole the images of your style and your TOTAL CATALOG OF ART from this man. Now that HOLI MOUNTAIN has been released, WE LOOKLY hope that the forces that are in the Art Councils of the world will cease to finance! Poor Jodorovsky - lost in a financial fight with the Beatles lawyer when Lennon / McCartney is in film creation. And while YODOR's Beatle-IOU A THE MONKEES! Cheap thin, soulless riffs just liked lightweight freshmen. And BTV I'm a director. If you are interested in making a film about reality - I will legally fight you in the ring that defends Jodorovo-you, defending an open theft.
