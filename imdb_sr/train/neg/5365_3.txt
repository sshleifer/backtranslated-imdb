"Private practice" is separated from a rather successful and well-written "Grey's Anatomy". The actors are brilliant. The premise can even work. But writing is terrible. Pre-pilot disguised in Grey's Anatomy episode should have been my first warning. The action was just blah. I thought it was a coincidence. I set up a DVR to record a pilot and all the other episodes. As I watched the pilot, I was just wondering if a shov with such actors could compose a boring pilot. The pilot should vacuum people and return them for more. There should be excitement, flash, brilliant writing, an intriguing story with clippers to be answered during the rest of the season. Unbelievable, but this show did not have any of that. Thinking that this is a coincidence, I just watched another episode in the hope of being the best. And although it's a little better, it can not get closer to what should be interesting. I can not miss the TV. I just cleaned this show from the watch list. It's not worth the effort of IMO, and I would be very surprised if this show breaks even in the middle of the season. Leave this to people.
