Devil's experiment: 1/10: Hardcore porn movies fall into two categories: those with a complication of plot (Gee who is a happy pizza boi) and those without (Anal Amateri 36). Devil's Experiment is firmly falling into the second category. It is naturally a horror version of hardcore pornography. Almost fully-scheduled waiting for 43 minutes for a shot of money. Filmed on the video in 1985, it consists of three relatively incomprehensible Japanese boys who are torturing a rather unattractive Japanese girl. Tortures range from banal (slapping 50 times, hitting hundreds), nonsense (binding to office chair and spinning), fear factor (bath of worms and sheep holes) and at the end of a shot. (Well done piercing for the eyeballs). It's this, there's no complication, no motives, just shootings and torture by Blair Vitch. The girl looks bored and with the exception of chirping, "no one is expecting a Spanish inquisition" during the office chair scene I was bored. I stared on the screen, waiting for a shot of money. Like hardcore porn.
