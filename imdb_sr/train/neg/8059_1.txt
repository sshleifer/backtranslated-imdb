This film refers to a very young girl, Cassie, (Melissa Sagemiller) who leaves her family and goes to become a college freshman. One night, Cassie and her friends decide to go to wild parties with lots of drinks and dancing, and Cassie rides with her boyfriend she likes, but never told him he loves him. While Cassie was driving, the car was stopped in the middle of the road and she could not avoid an accident and as a result, there was a bloody loss of life along with her boyfriend. Cassie becomes very emotional upset and has a nightmare that has hallucinations to get her boyfriend back to life and meet men who are trying to kill her and she is struggling to find out who her true friends are, who wants her dead and whether she will survive this whole terrible temptation. Cassie dreams of returning to her boyfriend after she died and found another guy in her bed and told him to ask him to make love. This is the way out of the movie and it's not very good.
