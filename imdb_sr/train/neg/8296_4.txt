In essence, the team of men and women of dentistry and their 3 daughters are engaged in unbelief. The premise is interesting, the acting is good, and the music, although sometimes sharp and without direction, is pretty cool. The problem is the plot. A husband dentist releases his wife behind the scene in the opera before the performance (she plays a small role), and then returns to give her something, but sees her with another man. The rest of the film deals with his disgust for this episode, his visual hallucination and the macho alter ego (Denis Leary, his former patient) and his fears of confronting his wife that he would not have to "do something on that issue." I will not tell you the ending , but let me tell you that the film is not going anywhere, and the ending is like sprinkling. Lack of motivation of characters: Why cheat him? He's a dentist, decent, good father. The film does not speak. Who does it work with? Do not expect answers to that. Why does he want marriage to remain in spite of all this? Who knows. What purpose are all children who are vomiting? Where's this movie? The good performances of Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denise Leary as a comic relief) are completely futile because of this crappy stupidity that does not know if she wants to be an American beauty or family film. The root channel is more interesting. Avoid this.
