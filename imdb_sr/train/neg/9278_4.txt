The fact that I was watching this movie is telling something about it ... or me. It's not a good movie. Actually, it's terrible. But terribly in a way that kept my attention in that perverse manner that is similar to watching the tragedy and the inability to repudiate the view. Make an excellent MST3K object! Most of the things that make horrible movie pleasures here are: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, fictional set designs, funny pseudo-science. You will get excited when you kill the death sequences, the poor victims with their mouths, and take time to think about their upcoming fate, facing the incredibly fictional savior of their death. Your heart will be warmed up from the old action scenes as when two women fight for a gun and he fires, but who shot? They both look at themselves, then the other, and then themselves, then (apparently 15 minutes later), it finally descends. You will sing together (in Latin, of course) with street singers who turn into a horrible death chorus that for a moment has threatened to turn the film into a distorted musical. So, if I believe how to do it while movies worsen are getting better, then this can be a decent choice for you. It's not as funny as my current favorite for sci-fi, "They Live" with Rovdi Roddie Piper, but it's more fun to watch than hot movies like Omen II or III. I give you 4 out of 10.
