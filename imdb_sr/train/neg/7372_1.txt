I'm so confused. I was a big fan Sealed for 25 years. I saw all his films, and many of them dozens of times. This movie can only be described as "bizarre". Steven Seagal shares the writing script and produces credits in this movie, but I have a really difficult situation to believe that he will choose to change his voice over so many of his lines, with a lean, lean impostor voice no less. What I do not understand is that if they had to bury some of his lines, why does his voice appear on others? I expect Seagal to be as old as the rest of us. But Seagal in this film barely distinguishes between the same bragging, self-confidence, courage, charm and sexual attraction that has so easily shown us in all of our previous films. What I missed most was his self-confident attitude and his ugly ridicule, which is so easily transferred to that wonderful smile. Where is that attitude in your face and the charm that made it so huge a star? I hope this film is not an indicator of what Seagal left to offer us - if so, his fans will have to admit that Seagal, whom we all know and who we love, is gone.
