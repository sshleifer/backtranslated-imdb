Whale hunters choose wrong whales. The group of exploiters of Yahoo's whales catches a female and they are for the tail. The whale's husband sees the whole thing, including the moment when a woman's unborn baby jumps and falls on deck. "Captain Nolan" (Richard Harris) could say that a great man is really crazy when he watched him say, "Get out of town before the big tide." This revenge story has Harris' presence and Boo's beauty, but not much more than that. This was Bo's first 'released' film, although her first acting career was four years before in 'I Once Upon a Love' released in 1981 as 'Fantasy' (directed by John Derek). P.S. Today is the date of this review (November 20th) is the birthday of Bo Derek. I hope Bo has a kit for a good time ... ... to get it? ..... kit? ..... hee-hee.
