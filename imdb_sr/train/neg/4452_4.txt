Let's say I had to lower the incredulity less to Spiderman than to the Huligans. That is, to say, a minor problem because I believe that Tobi McGuire can hold the building than Elijah Vood is throwing with the veins in Manchester. I will not enter specificity, because I do not want to write a spoiler, but the idea of ​​an adult, a professional, British man who gets closer to the death of every weekend is, so ... funny. And this film is not. Fighting, the idea of ​​the fight, too seriously understood. The weight of pugilism, the respect to which the subject is treated becomes irritating, because it does not establish or resolve the conflict. It seems that the plot, with holes that are large enough to drive a Guinness truck, are cluttered together with the fictitious theme of "fish out of water," so that viewers can look at Voods's teary eyes as he teaches how to become a man, . hitting other young men of opposing soccer flavors with blunt objects, and then escaping as quickly as possible. Characters are drawn, especially Americans at Harvard. The development of characters and stories is telegraphed to the viewer through the whole picture. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film does not reach its height until the end, which will spend almost two hours of its life and you will never return. Pick up the "Football Factory" or "Club of Fighters" instead of this banal and disappointing nonsense. It does not waste time with an empty melodrama, a tired old "Jenki in the court of King Aurthur", or payable, parables of age. There are only pure, dark and smart parties; the way in which violence should be.
