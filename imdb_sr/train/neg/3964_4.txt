For all about this film, I remained open in terms of what I would eventually think. And, although sometimes it's a bit slow, the first 90% of the movie is pretty good, with more than a few "old times" scaring that make one nervous and nervous. In fact, I thought cinema was great in terms of many of these scenes. Where the gloomy remains fail, it is at its peak. The ending of the film and the unfolding are what looks like the MILES APART from his body. The story completely falls on the face with an illogical conclusion, and the answer I asked most - what really happened to Emma? - not clarified! The reason for the negative energy was at best absurd, and in the end I felt very deceived. What could have been a wonderful horror film in the end pursued a terrible end.
