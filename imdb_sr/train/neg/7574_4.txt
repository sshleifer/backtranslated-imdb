But there are some good actions and complications that are somewhat interesting. Nevsky behaves as a body builder and is not so attractive, in fact, IMO, he is an ugly one. (his acting ability is lacking in everything!) Sasha plays very well Joanna Pacula, but she needed more lines than she was given, her character was to develop. In this story there are too many men, there is nothing romantic, too much action and too stupid end. It's very violent. Still I loved the landscape, this movie takes you all over the world, and that's a bonus. I also liked that there were some things about the mafia, not too much or too little, but enough to attract my attention. The actors had to be more handsome ... The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was too normal, not sexy enough. I think that for most guys, Sasha will be hot enough, but for us ladies who are fans of the action, Nevsky does not just break it. All in all, this film was good, I did not like it, nor did I hate it, I just realized it was another normal action.
