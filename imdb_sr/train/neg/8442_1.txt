GUERNSEI (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / Netherlands 2005). Maria Kraakman plays Anu, a thirty-year-old woman who finds her husband (Fedja van Huet) cheating, but she does not dare dare to face him. She painfully avoids any conflict with human beings, parents and nurse, so we have the main character in a feature film that does not do much at all. We hardly know something about her background or her motives. Only a woman who looks stuck in a blind alley, not just during this difficult episode of her life. She obviously suffers from something, but why do we have to suffer in the audience too? I almost quit the cinema after I saw this unusual mess. They were very dull and painful for 90 minutes. I usually try to avoid wasting energy on bad film making. I will take a beat and throw myself with blows, but in this case there is a just warning. How is, for good reason, Nanouk Leopold received funds (largely from public funds) for this party? Obviously, there was no script to speak. It can be compensated by a genius filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or an acting team with just a little more attraction. Nothing, just a vaguely defined concept, "I want to do something from a woman's point of view". The result is an insult, not a tribute to a woman's view of life. To make things worse, there is no interesting footage that can be found throughout the movie. I can not imagine an actor who could spice up this, but Johanna and Steege is (small) light in the dark, if possible with this terrible lack of material. I am trying to imagine how Leopold tried to direct Maria Kraakman: "Mary, look at the horizon, we'll take those three minutes, just express sorrow." Perfect medication for insomnia. Get a copy and watch this late at night, guaranteed for sleep. Camera Obscura --- 1/10
