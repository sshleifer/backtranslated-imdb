An older man touches a flower in the greenhouse of his wife who seems to have gotten out. He pierces him or bites him. They get sick fast, and some sort of big white larva spit in the hospital. Later attempts to revive it with paddles lead to spraying of blood. The policeman is in the hospital because his partner is seriously injured in the shooting. Somehow a cop fuses with one of the doctors, as well as entomoloses that are brought in. There are several young kids roaming around the hospital, which I suppose we should find wonderful, but who are very unfriendly brats. It happens that they wander into the room where the sample is kept, and by accident they throw the growth hormone on it. The logic of horror films would say they deserve to die for this, but they are never in any danger. The witch grows and begins to reproduce. People escape from him, and sometimes towards him for some reason. The hospital is surrounded by an army that is ready to destroy everything if necessary. In the film there are no really striking characters, and most of the time it seems that people are looking around for the monster. It was pretty boring. Obviously, he owes something to Alien movies, with a monster that is born in a human being and has several stages of its growth. There is also a character named Bishop, and the main actress has hair Sigournei Veaver.
