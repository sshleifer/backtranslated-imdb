This film was overly exaggerated. Many viewers, who thought it was "incredible", must have been in old school films, because the whole movie was set in the past. At first I thought that the film just shows something from the past, so I expected that the fading daylighting of the characters would pass, but it just goes. Basically this was a movie that tried to mix the future with the past, and 2 did not mix well in this film, even with special effects. You could see the blue screen with which the actors worked. There are too many movies that do exactly what this film did, so there is no reason for critics to encourage this film by saying: "It's the best movie ever done." It's just bullshit on a stick. It also did not help that the story was sooo crappi. I do not understand why Hollywood agreed that this film is being produced, and I also do not understand how the actors / actors in this film are willing to be in this kind of film. It's almost like everyone reads the script and they forget to read a fine print ... "Everything will be done on the computer." It was a movie that was supposed to be on the movie network, because nothing about this movie was revolutionary. I'm very upset that I paid the money to see this. Whatever you do, do not waste time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.
