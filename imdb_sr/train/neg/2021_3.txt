Ronald Colman won the Oscars for the best actor for a spectacular performance as a popular theater actor who completely lost his roles, especially as Shakespeare's Othello. George Cukor's critically acclaimed film has marvelous pedigrees, written by the evaluating team Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, a witty joke comes in this way self-conscious, and the work behind the scenes is ignored. Miklos Rozsa also won the Oscars for his score, and Shellei Vinters has a few nice moments of heavy duty waitress (when the theater Colman bravely recalls to her, he asks: "What are you, some kind of walnut?"). Otherwise, this scenario is obviously obvious, surprisingly dear, and not very funny. * 1/2 of ****
