This movie is really terrible, the candy game that Ben can only compensate for everything else that's wrong with this movie. Writer / director / producer / main actor, etc. The idea is to create a film dealing with important issues of homosexual marriages, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crimes, and almost every other issue related to a gay man of these times, but an attempt to turn every problem into such a poorly conceived movie a little Justice for any of these causes. The scenario is bad, casting is very plain, but dialogue and acting are just poor. Homo-hateful brother plays the loudest actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two main actors (I think I've seen more passion in the advertisement for cornflakes). The act was stiff, and the dialogue was forced (the scene in which the brother feeds the detective of his line was the peak). I'm just glad to see that the creator of this wreck of the train has not pushed any other waste into distribution, and if he thinks it does, I have some tips - just do not do it.
