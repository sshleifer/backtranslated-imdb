This movie was o.k. but it could have been much better. There are some nasty moments, but there are not enough to ever want to look at this movie again. There are some scenes that you can quickly rewind and do not miss anything. The biggest disadvantage is that it is so predictable, and that is why I rated it so low. It can be watched, but do not expect anything big.
