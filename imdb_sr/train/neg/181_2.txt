Ah, Kanal 5 of the local Mexican so-called. Every day, at 2:00, they broadcast Horror films from the 1970s to the early 2000s. It was a movie "Back to the cabin by the lake" which was broadcast yesterday. I'm sorry to watch him. The original "Cabin Bi The Lake" was a regularly popular hunting-budgeter and was well received. The problem is that this sequel is terrible, even unexpectedly funny and trying to mimic the original. Ugh. The action is really stupid in every sense of the word. The film at some points looks like a soap opera because of absurd dialogue, cinema and direction. > My advice is: to avoid this at any cost. It's a movie that nobody needs to watch. Not for central movie lovers. You are warned.
