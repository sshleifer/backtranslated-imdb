I'm a big fan of a series of comics, but this movie has fallen below my expectations. I expected that Heavi Metal 2000 would feel ... slow to move, bad dialogue, a lot of blood ... but this was worse than anything I could imagine. The plot line is almost the same as the strip, but the good points stop there. The characters do not have the energy or spirit that attracted my attention in the comic. The film covers only a small part of the comic book, and the part that is used is slower and boring than the later parts. The focus in the film is on insignificant events rather than on the more interesting comic story of the comic. Unfortunately, it was not so, so now there is another horrible movie that few will see, and even less will love it. My copy will certainly collect dust for years until I finally throw it out.
