Have you ever heard the saying that people "telegraph their intentions?" Well, in this movie, action actions make up more of the telegraphic plans for the future - they appear in your home drunken and catch you behind your head. It could be forgiven if the environment is better used, or if the characters are charismatic or shy. Character Embeth Davidtz is not mysterious, only woody, and Kenneth Branagh fails to convey the daring charm that his character probably wrote. Bottom line: an apparent plot, performances in one place of inconspicuous characters and grotesque "southern" accents that were used by British actors.
