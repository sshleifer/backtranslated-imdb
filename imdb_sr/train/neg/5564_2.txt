Probably the worst Dolph movie ever. There is nothing here that you would want or expect. Do not waste your time. Dolph plays an unhappy cop with no interest in life. His brother was killed and Dolph was trying to figure things out. The character is simply stupid and stumbling impassively. Nonsense.
