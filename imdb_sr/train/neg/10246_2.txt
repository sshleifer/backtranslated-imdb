The end of the world is a film without distractions, which is strange, because it should be about total destruction of the Earth. The main character is some sort of scientist, I'm not sure about cocoa. There are two jobs in the government (?) Institution guarded by four security guards. His first job is to monitor the transfer to and from the universe (although this looks more like a hobby he does when he does not work at work # 2). Work # 2 requires him to wear a protective suit and go to the dark room ... at least it's the best I can figure out. Apparently the "plant" is not exactly a secret, because the scientist brings his wife there. She hangs out (they are on the way to dinner) while revealing a message from the universe: A great disorder on Earth, repeated over and over again. He says something about being the first message from the universe he has ever managed to decipher; his wife tells him he'll be late for dinner. So they leave and go to a party (!?!). A few moments later, he learned that China suffered a major earthquake. From there, the movie goes ... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is in this, but that really does not help much. In addition, Lee gives a glittering performance by modeling his appearance at Hovling II. This film is boring, but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to live once if you like Christopher Lee or Z-sci-fi. Plus, there are many shots of the land that has been destroyed.
