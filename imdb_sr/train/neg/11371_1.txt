"Documentary", and we use that expression seemingly, sums up that Muslims are trying to forcefully take over the world. Then it is said that every Muslim who does not recognize it or does not know about his religion or lies on your face! Also, every person interviewed in the film has found the market for its absurd reality by selling a bench to conservatives who are willing to allow others to think about them. What the West needs to know is that this is nothing but propaganda directed to mental dwarfs. If you are looking for an actual documentary on Islam and the current state of the Middle East, I would look elsewhere. Try something that provides more points of view than qualified sources.
