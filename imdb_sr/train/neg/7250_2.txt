After reading other reviews for this film, I consider that high marks were probably paid for studio lackeys because the film I was watching was absolutely awesome, with wooden acting, inexhaustible scripting and an inexplicable predictable directing, one of a few plus points must be a stunning sight because this movie contains some stunning wallpapers with great open views and dramatic sky and wide open prayers, unfortunately when the most striking thing in the movie is the part behind the actors, it must be a sign up maturing in terms of quality of the film, all in all, a completely non-violent addition to the Western genre that even at a very reasonable price can get on DVD is best avoided.
