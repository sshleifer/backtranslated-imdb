A comparison may be unfair but inevitable. Those attracted to the intimacy and depth of the Umbrellas will be a little horrified when they discover a musical cutting and stitching in the American style - an unpleasant, stiff dialogue with unexplained numbers of songs and dancing. The French accent of Gene Kelly was obviously so bad that the terrible dubbing work was replaced (as you will remember, dubbing is almost perfectly pulled up in the umbrellas). The translation of the French (for subtitled versions) also leaves something that is desirable, although this can not be attributed to Demi. The film also has a few self-conscious moments that come from a little worrying, such as references to LeGrand's poems. And costumes - well, narrow trousers / a combination of white boots, and strange unnatural colors, are reminiscent of a film about Austin Povers. . But Demi rewards the viewer with allusions at Umbrellas; note, for example, a suitcase worn by Makence in his departure from Rochefort - it's the same suit that Gui wore during his departure from Cherbourg. Also, keep in mind "A handsome brunette of the resolution" - Madeleine in the umbrellas, and Josette in Young Girls. In general, those who expect the natural feeling of the Umbrella (save the floating bicycle scene), or look for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings like in the umbrella script, you probably should pass this b. Those who are looking for a French version of a thin American musical from the 60s will be completely satisfied.
