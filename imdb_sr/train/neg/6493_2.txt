Oh dear ... like an Englishman, and a small part of the Welshman, the fan of Anthony Hopkins in the industry ... so far, I'm really disappointed. You see, I'm no one who hopes better. So, my comments are like 'straw in the wind'. But that's not the point at all? - I do not have any ax on the commercial value of the work. Yes, a full member of the great unwashed, I'm going to see a movie that needs to be transferred to another place. Yes, stop believing for a short time. But do not enter the state of complete disbelief. If it was an unknown author and director, I guess that "production" would be distorted in oblivion. Unfortunately, it was not, and I remained wide open and confused. Seeing some of the enthusiastic comments about this work, I'm a little worried ... Perhaps what I'm trying to, without prejudice, is to watch every movie at my own merits. Regardless of the author, director, studio or even the famous content. My advice, like many before me: Do not write and direct the same production. That's a lot of danger. Movies should be moderated to maintain the credibility of credibility. As they say in school reports "Can and can better ..."
