Too many secondary lines of the plot without a primary. Too hot buttons are pushed for no reason, they managed to impose this boring film, which does not say anything, with every drama element out there: death, divorce, money problems, parents' problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse, adoption , rejected love, traveling problems, sex, generations misunderstandings, robbery, legal issues, weapons, medical ethics, "deep love" ?? You would think it would be interesting for the movie, but hell not? all of these events are secondary to something primarily that is not there. Boring. Not to mention that "super-deep" (and super-long) lecture to the child at the end of the film is total stupidity. A pity. Oh, I forgot to mention: actors, they are all pretty good. That prevented me from turning it off. In order for their talents to be bad, the film is well recorded: light, movement, etc. Every episode - that's all in place. That's just what's missing.
