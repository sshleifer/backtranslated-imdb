The documentary, like any other film maker, has to convey a convincing story. Vill Pascoe fails in this endeavor, collecting uninspired clips of Chomsky's wisdom from a visit to the McMaster University in Hamilton. The video was recorded amateur and video. Pasko's sole effort in linking fragments as a whole is the periodic throwing of an obscure title on the screen: "9-11," "Activism," "Truth". Lame. Compare this with documentaries such as "Corporation" or "Magle War" that create narrative drawing material from interviews, recordings and recorded footage. In the end, each delivers a sharp and insightful message intelligently and intelligently. The only rescue grace of the film is Chomsky's incalculable deliveries of historical dogma, and the fact that it only takes 74 minutes. One of the most interesting passages was Chomsky's presentation of his experience with National Public Radio. He describes the conservative media as more adapted to the opposing attitudes, while the liberal dogmatic grieves his respondents and dramatically limits his allowed messages. Another medium that will be skeptical. This documentary is only for Noam Chomsky.
