I was happy with this ride, and I was terribly disappointed. Very easy to have fun in riding on a slide and amusement park. - It took about 30 seconds to drive for 90 seconds. It was visually boring and poorly derived. Desperately trying to be like a blend of far superior Indiana Jones and Space Mountain rides and Disneyland, and failed in every way. It was not exciting or exciting. at least.
