There were so many movies based on the same theme. one cute girl needs a handsome boy to impress the former, pay him and then (guess what?) she falls in love with him, there is a little bit of mumble followed by a series before everyone is invented before the happy end ... many times. The thing is, I knew it before I started to watch. But, despite this, I still rejoiced at that. In the right hands, with good gypsum and brilliant script, it can still be a pleasant way to pass a few hours. This is none of this. This was terrible. Female leadership that did not have charm or wit, which failed to infiltrate even the slightest spark in me. It really did not matter to me whether she "got her man" or she was left alone and unhappy. Men's track that after several of its endless words of wisdom, wanted to kill. Just to get rid of that complacent look. I had no idea that the life of a male whore is the way to the all-encompassing omniscient enlightenment. Totally unrealistic film filled with unreal characters. none of them had a job; they all had more money than a sense, a groom who continues to go with his wedding after finding out that his bride was sleeping with her best friend .... plus "I would miss it even if we had never met "!!!!! I could continue, but I just realized that I spend even more time on this slug ... I could only speak about introducing a character just to have a very cheap laughter in the name of "woody", but the truth is that it's just far ridiculous what happened in the movie.
