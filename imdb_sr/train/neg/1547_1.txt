I could name many funny movies. There are comics that were funny, and they are. Some movies, such as Gimkata, try to be serious, but they end up funny. Ladies are a movie that desperately tries to be ridiculous, but it can not be less ridiculous if it's a type that got a lot of chickens in the midst of a nuclear holocaust wreck. It's anti-funny. I do not think I laughed harder than whispering anything in this movie. It's simply not important. It's bored, stupid, senseless, boring, incredibly bad, but not funny. I do not care specifically for Tim Meadows, or for this guy from the SNL, but I was expecting better than this. Film completely does not have logic or common sense. It's as if the scriptwriter had a bag over his head while he knocked and could not see which keys he hit. They are talking about the "origin" of the Ladies Man, but they do not include the motivation for his bizarre fascination with behavior as if he was still seventies. The film attempts to get humor from a man who finds pleasure in pornography, shortly after trying to hang himself. This is a comedy? I like to think that I have a pretty sharp sense of humor (it takes a lot of time to write comedy as I do), but maybe I'm not clear enough for this movie. Lee Evans, so ridiculous as Tucker in There Something About Mari, is unheard of here. I begged him in the head to shut up. In the end, I pounded on the chair, muttering under the breath, and if the film went on, I would probably attempt suicide. This movie may not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it's the first movie I've ever seen that approached. <br /> <br />
