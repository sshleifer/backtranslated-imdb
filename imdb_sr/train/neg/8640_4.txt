I watched 3/4 of this movie and wondered why he got such a terrible critique. It was pretty easy to watch (at 3 o'clock in the morning). He had a good casting - the role of Kevin Dillon in the serial killer of sociopaths was very convincing - he was both haramatic and cold. And the other main characters were not so bad. This is your typical film for stalker / uncertainty. The couple can not get pregnant and go to the fertility clinic. The sociopathic "genetic material" of the donor fixes on the recipients and, in the typical form of the stalker, enters their lives. more and more obsessed with raising a baby and creating a perfect family with her mother. Of course, things do not suit him as he planned. It's not a bad plot. But the last 15 minutes was terrible. I am pretty tolerant with the movies (especially at 3 am in the morning!) .. but, I was just stunned as far as the bad ended. I was actually mocking! All in all, not the worst movie I've seen, but I could not sit back through it (unless I skip the end). The only redeaming quality here was the role of Kevin Dillon - - one of the best serial killers ever. Try to look at other channels before watching this. try .. =)
