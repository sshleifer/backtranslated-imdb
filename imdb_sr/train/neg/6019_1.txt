This film is one of the reasons why IMDB should allow the vote 0/10. The acting is terrible, even what some have praised here, the Carpathian character! The script looks like it's written in a hurry. In one scene, the black preacher who remained behind him, when Buck asked him what the "day7" in computer graphics meant, "Daniel 7, * CHAPTER 24" He probably thought of VERSION 24, but filmmakers missed this mistake. Perhaps the worst thing is that the eschatological position of the film is biblically unfounded. While many Christians supported the interpretation of films about events from the end of time, such an interpretation, in my opinion, is wrong. To understand these defects, read "Christians will go through trouble" by Jim McKeever and "Blessed Hope, Bible Study on the Second Coming and Resurrection" by George E.
