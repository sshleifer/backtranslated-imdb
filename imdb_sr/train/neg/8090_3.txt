I'm partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say "partly" because most of his films are divided into two categories: brilliant and boring. Unfortunately, this film belongs to a later category. This film suffers from the same basic problems as Miiazaki's recent film "Hovl's Moving Castle". An intriguing premise is set, but it immediately comes down to a bit more than the background for some incomprehensible events that only serve to confuse the plot, but not to explain it. The first third of the film reveals post -Apocaliptic world story is set up, and actually looks like a very interesting story. Since then things have gone downhill. The middle part of the film is mostly composed of thinly-concealed eco-propaganda, and the ending is highly jeopardized by reliance on a kind of impenetrable spiritualism that destroys a large number of Japanese animated films. All in all, the film feels like someone cut out every other page from the script before sending it to the animators. What's left is something that is visually stunning (although unfortunately the version I saw was N's generation of copies, with poor color - which leads to a common myth that Nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying), but which makes no sense in the end I was confused.
