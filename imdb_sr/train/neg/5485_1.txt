Without repeating what was said above about this film, I would like to add that I was looking forward to watching this film ... cast / location and work of great director Michael Winterbottom, etc. 'Do not look now' about the story from the beginning. Staying in different environments (again in Italy) to stink heart failure ... or maybe I saw it so? So I sat there and waited for the story to be revealed and turned around about what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign European country .... and I sat there and sat there .... and guess what? Nothing really happens! and I do not mean anything !! You do not even get the chance to get into characters like they are so two-dimensional and empty .. You are led to believe from the tempo of the movie that something will happen to turn the whole movie on his head ... The eldest daughters flocked with the local vespa boys , had a large room for filming in the other direction, the youngest daughters of her dead mother's vision ended with a futile and senseless exercise, the father's attempts to mislead one of his students, I felt funny considering his age. It seemed as if the script made the last memory of the place where at the last moment they decided to eradicate every courage for the story and set off to minimize it without any effect. When loans began to roll (unexpectedly), you can not help but feel lured by your time spent sitting watching this pile of trash.
