First seen on May 17, 2002. - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Evald Andre Dupont): A rather lame description Titanic Disaster is the first recorded version of this much-awaited event. Replication of the catastrophe is not bad, but the drama around it is stupid at times, it behaves badly and resembles a soap opera. The story is very similar to the Oscars, except for showing us how the crew tried to hide the real catastrophe that was going on almost too late. It's good just for nostalgia and to feel what James Cameron competed against (barely?) In his recreation.
