Since I did not read the novel, I can not say how true this film is. The story is a typical mysterious material: the killer of the goal of the bride; an investigator falls in love with a partner and diagnoses a fatal illness. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera, and that's exactly the way it's playing. The first 2/3 are boring, except for murders, and the last 1/3 partly returns, as it accelerates to its curved conclusion. \ T blame the actors themselves: the scenario is terrible. During the last 1/3 you stop to notice, because the movie becomes interesting, but it is only the last 1/3. Director Russell Mulcahi is very much in his element, but there is only so much he can do with the TV budget and network censors on his back. He is rather limited to quick cutting and distorted lenses, although he managed to squeeze recordings during the killings in the club "under the floor". Unfortunately, as this is done for television, cool composition details that use so well with a wider image can not be found anywhere. Note to Manufacturers: Give this guy a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you hire him. If you're in the mood for this kind of movie, I have great suggestions: take a copy of "Deep Red" Dario Argento (my highest recommendation, top movie), "Opera", or even "Tenebre". They are stronger in each category.
