Yes, it's summarized. This film was terrifying. For two minutes, I wanted to get my eyes out. This is praised as an "innovative LDS comedy," but this is not good for members of this church! I do not think that any human being should be so sacrificed to watch a movie of this bad quality. First of all, you can say that absolutely no effort has been invested in this movie. It looks as though they are a terribly gray, stupid, dashing trumpet thrown together with two crazy lashes that are somehow spilled over with a gift for coherent (at least half-coherent) thought. Then, there is the acting, which is sad of all * involved. Even the cats do not manage to live anything. And let's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a shallow jerk that we would like to believe can be changed, but this path is full of an unpleasantly bad dialogue, horrible disgusting "gags," and many Mormon "jokes" which everyone in their common sense, LDS or not, should consider pure * stupid *! This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!
