... but I regret that I saw him. Since IMDb ratings are relatively high (and they must also be relatively high on Netflick), I guess I put it in line because it was advertised as a gentle comedy from the UK, a category that produced many immensely films. "Saving Grace", on the other hand, belongs to the category of laughing comedies that are usually populated by Hollywood films that are produced and directed by talented. Brenda Blethin is a capable actress, and I liked her in other films. The concept - a gardener that breeds marijuana to overcome an orphan it faces after the death of its husband - does not hurt me. Despite the strenuous efforts of the actors to produce humor, the film falls on the face (falling on the donkey could have been more fun) as far as I and my wife are concerned. Be careful, dear readers, not all unusual British comedy have succeeded. This is nonsense.
