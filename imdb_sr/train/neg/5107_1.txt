There is a UK edition in this show that is less extravagant than the American version. The interested person will get a new kitchen or perhaps a bedroom and a bathroom and is greatly appreciated for what they have. The American version of this show is all that the reality TV should not be. Instead of making some improvements in the house that tenants could not afford or do for themselves, the whole house is being rebuilt. I do not know if this show is trying to show what a bad social protection system in the United States is, or if you are trying hard enough to get it. A fairly vulgar product placement that takes place, especially in Sears, is also unavailable. Rsther than turning one family into a poor area into potential millionaires, it would be much better to help the community as a whole, where instead of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a home, we build something for the whole community ... perhaps the place where DII and power tools can be borrowed back together with construction material, so that everyone can benefit if he so wishes. Giving all to one man can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still lives in the same houses.
