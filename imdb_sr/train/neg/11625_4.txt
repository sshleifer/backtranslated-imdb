Except Brady Variety Hour, this was one of the hockey TVs I've been watching for a while. The quality of video production was not bad, but the overall look and feel were unmistakable in the early 80's. And Marie Osmond looks like she was fighting Avon Lada .. and she lost a lot of time. It was far too embarrassing to see veterans Danny Kaie and Eric Severeid taking part in this. It was even more interesting to see Alek Haley talk about the African Pavilion in a world exhibition that will open in 'about a year.' All in all, however, for all the shortcomings, this is still an interesting visual part of Disney's history.
