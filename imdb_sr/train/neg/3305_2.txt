I absolutely do not see what's ridiculous about this movie. Humor seems to be destined for corpses. It's slow. The story is too simple to be true. The characters do not tolerate much sympathy, and several unimportant characters are aside. Nothing surprising happens. What did the writers of this script think? "Oooo funny! Let's make some old lady on the pot! Let's ... we're giggling! Let's ... we act like little children! This film has irritated me most of all the movies I've seen in the last five years.
