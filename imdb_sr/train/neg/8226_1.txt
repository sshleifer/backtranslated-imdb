Given that many horror films are based on the assumption that one or more central characters are doing something stupid at some stage during the proceedings, the girls in this film would collect gold, silver and bronze at the Olympic ceremony at the Darwin Awards. A mentally disturbed piano would make a better choice than it was, and would scream much less while doing it. If you like movies with a grain picture, a deliberately amateur camera (my 92 years old - an old grandmother holds a camcorder with better results), extremely bad sound and without noticeable plot / narration, then this is your ideal movie. Also keep in mind that you should enjoy the following: women screaming for no reason, women waving for no reason. In fact, reason and logic do not appear much in this movie. For example: "we need to find Stephanie" "that I can not believe I talked to her, like, last night" "she called you last night?" "Yes, she wanted to talk about a date that she asked for one." "WHAT? How did she not tell me?" As is the case, our friend was persecuted by a serial killer with a shotgun and a series of frightful weapons, but I have a problem with the fact that she did not tell me she is going to a meeting. Okay, so the budget is low. That does not mean that you have to look like it costs half the budget. The 'result' is interesting because everyone - except one - wrote and performed the writers / directors of the film itself. In fact, it seems that the entire budget is on the sample of the song The Duskfall, a death metal band from Sweden. The most worry of everything in the whole movie is the end that leaves us with the possibility of continuing.
