This is a horrible little movie - and, unfortunately, the company that made this short film made a few more. Abbreviation is essentially a joke of ideas that was not funny and maybe insulting you. I was certainly embarrassed to see very young children (most of them appearing about 2 years old) who are sent and pretend to be adults - in this case, dancer and patrons in the bar room. It's a kind of humor that you can force to laugh at your children if they pretend to be grown up, but I do not see anyone wanting to see it - especially when the very young Shirlei Temple is dressed in pretty cautious equipment and acts as a vamp ! And then other children act as adults in some pretty adult situations. At that time, I'm sure they did not try to like pedophiles, but when they look at it today, it immediately comes to mind! That's why I'm crazy about this boring movie and I hope I will never see it again !! Pretty weird and pretty awful.
