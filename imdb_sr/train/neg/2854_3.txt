Dreifuss plays a mafia boss who has lost his mind, but is now "fixed". Lane is his girlfriend with his number one (Goldblum), who should have something with Lane's sister (Barkin). Reinolds, Gabriel Birne, Kyle MacLachlan, and even the appearance of Richard Prior) can not help this complication, as Dreifuss proves that he is not "fixed" and tries to kill almost everything in sight. , you did not know what was coming. The first ten minutes were nothing but the guys who were trying to tell Goldblum what was being done when Dreifuss came out, but I will save you all the trouble: skip this movie. this film is because I was recently hit by Diane Lane and I'm trying to see all of her movies. The real downfall for me was not only a horrible plot, but also the fact that it does not appear until the last fifteen minutes of the film (although we read about it through the film). Even if I'm a fan of more than half the actors, I can not enjoy this movie. The parts on which uncertainty was supposed to make me laugh at what actually happened. 3 of 10 stars.
