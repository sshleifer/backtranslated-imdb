Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What else can I say? Kate Jackson must have been desperate to manage. Perhaps she should return to acting ... to another thought that she was a bad actress. Whoever invested money in the production of something so bad. I love movies against Christ and I usually smile and I'm scared, but this is Bad Bad Bad. The star of the stars was worse than what you find on a soap opera. Special effects, if you can call them that way, where's funny. I would not be surprised if you played in the slowed down scenario and you would see the tubes from which the blood is coming out. We had to disconnect the disc after only 30 minutes. This so-called film original fingerprint should be destroyed, all discs and tapes being destroyed, and all people involved in filming must return money to people who rent a movie. Then these people should never be allowed to act, direct or record anything but their home movies.
