From criticism, I expected more from this film than Tamara Jenkins. The story just went through and it did not look like it was. And it's hard for me to believe that a 14 year old girl (mature for her age or not) would be so crazy to lose her virginity. Maybe I'm too young to be involved (I was four years old in 1976), but I did not have any problems to connect with stories about Shakespeare in love or life, and I was not alive for any of these settings. The actors are very good, but unfortunately for them the script did not allow them to attract audiences. All in all, the slums had their moments, but if you do not want to remember the mess and socks, I'd say skip this one.
