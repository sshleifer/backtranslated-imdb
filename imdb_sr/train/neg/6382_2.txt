It's hard to know what went through Perristensen and Morten Lindberg's heads when they wrote "Gainiggers from Outer Space" - the film was written as a comedy, but there are no real jokes in the face of rude faces (captain B. Dick, Sgt. Shaved Balls). The rest of the film is (probably) an inadvertently funny affair with a ridiculously unsynchronized voice (with actors who essentially read their lines without hinting of feelings), 'futuristic' computer images filled with spelling mistakes, and a plot that almost does not make sense. Although 65% of viewers gave this film a perfect 10 out of 10, this is totally the opposite of what a good movie is. Perhaps it's fun to watch some friends, but this movie deserves only '2' out of ten ... just a bit higher than the lowest possible rating just because of the clear fact that the writers somehow managed to bring some blacks to this film.
