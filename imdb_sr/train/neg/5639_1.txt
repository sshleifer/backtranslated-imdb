I saw this film today at the Haifi Film Festival in Israel after I heard some excited reviews, but I guess the critics just sucked for Villema Defoe and his wife (directors) who were present at the festival. It's definitely the slowest movie I've ever seen with a number of ridiculous, funny, long scenes of nothing. Apart from Defoe, who was decent, both actresses and other people in the film, including Defoe's wife Giada, were ridiculously horrible (as they threw a baker in the bakery outside of me). This film is much less complicated with the lame attempt to be abstract and out of the wall. The only scene that caused any reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere, just as if it only adds some kind of shock value to the drowsiness of this movie. I'm sorry to be so rough, but this movie is a valuable waste of time and money. I appreciate the good indie cinema, but this film is not worth the time of viewers.
