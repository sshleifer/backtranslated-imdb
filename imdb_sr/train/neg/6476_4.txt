I had such great hopes for this film because I loved the original so much. It seems that Disney, however, is trying to perfect the art of stupid sequences straight to DVD. They deserve a break. Few, in fact. I thought the idea was good, but the music was absolutely terrible and the story was not much better. What happened to the great music Disney had in his films. Mari Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, the Lion King ... even Hercules and the humpbackess Notre Dame. They have made so many great movies over the years that it's really sad that they sank to the point of making sequences that are not good enough to put them in the cinema. I hope this film does not point out the things that will come to the Valt Disnei Corporation.
