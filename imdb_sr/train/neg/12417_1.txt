Any film that starts with cow and female calves can not promise much. As for the stereotype of the kibbut as it was 50 years ago, I was there and it was just not like that. Okay, every kibbut had only a small part of something shown in the movie (like the young men floated in the kitchen at night), but you can not show the whole kibbut as full of all - so to speak - naughty traits. Each kibuc had its own problems, but almost no kibbus had everything. The views of Israel were great. I still remember my youth in that Eden Garden named Emek (valley). Yes, and the acting was also good, so you see that it was not all black - just the wrong view - probably and deliberately.
