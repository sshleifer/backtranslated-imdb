Omen IV (1991) was badly made for T.V. Movie. Since the end of the 1980s, I guess the leaders experimented with a target (the drug of choice in the 1990s), because there is no other reason to explain this travesty. Why did they try to do this? А т..в. Movie? What were they thinking about when he appeared on the design committee? Did they even think for a moment that this movie would be understood as. Maybe they thought it could be a series? We will never find out. But I know one thing. This film was the main reason why I never bought trilogy Omen. It should have dropped a few dollars, instead of putting this "extra" disk. Instead of a sleepwalker, we get a spooky girl who is a complete brat to all around. If the family had stronger parental skills, then none of the demonic events that had happened in the past films would ever have happened. These parents have to lower their legs and do the right discipline! It is not recommended, it is best to avoid at all costs!
