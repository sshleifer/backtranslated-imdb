Where can I even start? Terrible acting? A nonsense plot? Effects of a cheap basement? Totally disgusting characters? Changing editing? Casio result that causes headache ??? Unpleasant racist remarks ("Look out, Charlie!", "Refuse, Jackie Chan!" However, this is a badly made piece of garbage. I think I was more painful than the characters dying in it! Soft core porn and I think lines like " I'll find that b **** and staple her c *** shut !! ", I feel the need to wash my eyes with a stove cleaner to prevent me from ever again seeing this movie!
