This overview may contain some spoilers. Remake of the classic movie about the search for cars from 1974. Gone in 60 Seconds begins well. In fact, it behaves well and the shop goes pretty well. But even the big Hollywood budget does not change the fact that the original shop was more convincing. For those who do not know, the original plot had thieves who worked as inspectors of insurance. If I suspected them. But even with the change of almost every aspect of H.B. Halicki's original remake is a very good movie, until we get to the final chase scene, part of the version 74 that made it great. In this version it is diluted, only 10 minutes, and culminates with a monstrous special effect that takes all the loyalty of the chase. Where the original potion was very convincing, the star was a stuntman who did all her stacks, and the remake fell in the last 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch a classic movie about a car, fine-tape the original into a garbage bin in your local lease and stay away from the new remake.
