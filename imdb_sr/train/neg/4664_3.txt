I voted 3 for this movie because it looks great as all Greenavais results. However, it was his usual combination of "art" of sex and pretentious shit. I know a lot of people who love this movie, but I'm tired of it VERY quickly. It's definitely not for everyone. The omnipresent McGregor obviously took a role in favor of credibility, but he really did not have to waste time. I hate to refer someone to a pseudo corner, but please ..... !!! The plus side is visually very attractive and I enjoyed it in music, but I could not see it all the way and I can not say it for many movies. I'm usually looking at the whole thing, but this is unbearable !!
