Vov, this movie was just terrible. Bad facts that although I did not pay to see him, I still wanted my money back. Film is nothing intelligible. It's a mish-mash of sci-fi clichés that have been better done by much more skilled filmmakers. The performances, especially the traces, were at the top of the less valuable Ed Vood. Speaking of Ed Vood, he would be proud of the character dialogue. It's too quiet, without any irony or sense of humor. Above all, it makes no sense, not a complication, or a lack. Visual effects are fine, but not enough to go "oh wow, it's cool" and they just seem to be thrown into "to be cool" and not to be a good device for action . Soundtrack was another mix of things that really never set up any mood. Again, it seemed that the director only threw songs in the film in an attempt to be "cool". What brings me to my last point. Perhaps, if the director took more care of the complication, the story, and the dialogue, instead of trying to be "cool," he would not have made such a little short film cliché. <br /> <br />
