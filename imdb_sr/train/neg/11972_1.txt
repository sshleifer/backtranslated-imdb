The first ten minutes of "Just Watching" really dictate the direction most of this film has. Lianne (Ryan Merriman) is a 14-year-old boy who lives in New York in the fifties. He has a burning desire to see two people who have sex. Who are the best people he has in mind? Well, his mom and stepfather of course! How nice. Unfortunately, for Lenny, he was caught before he sees anything and is sent in the summer to stay with his uncle and uncle's wife. \ T However, the woman is quite pregnant and currently do not sleep together. Then Lenny makes a new friend. He and his friend spend most of their free time around a few girls. They have a small club in which they sit and talk about sex. The problem is ... it was not done in an innocent, charming manner from the 1950s. In no way, I do not think, but I find it quite disturbing to hear how these kids talk about masturbation, smoking and anal sex. This kind of rudeness can work in a movie such as "Kids" (1995), but in this film it just seems to be devastated. Lenin's bodily desires. Jason Alexander should stay as far from the director's chair. "For Better or Worse" (1996) was terrible and now this. What a waste. 1/10
