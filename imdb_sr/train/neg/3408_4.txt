I was in the second grade, 12 years ago. I remember clearly. We learned about space. All the little kids want to go into space, do not they? Well, after I saw it, I was so scared that I would "accidentally" throw myself into a universe by a psychotic robot with a mind of one rack. I had no idea this was a movie. I thought it was some news program or something. I suppose that was my version when people were scared by the radio program 'War of the Worlds'. I recently watched this movie again, realizing that my favorite actor was Joakuin Phoenik in it (then known as Leaf Phoenik). I can tell you, I laughed at dramatic parts and laughed even harder in acting. I mean, when Andy's in space, she's moving slowly, have you ever noticed? I think that staying in space does not tell you to slow down or think it's slow. The best part is when Andi is de-energized from the oxygen tank and begins to float backwards until the security door closes. . Mali Mak is trying to pull her in. Suddenly, we will appear on Mak's face while yelling (slowly) "Vhaaaaatttt'ss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?" I had no idea.
