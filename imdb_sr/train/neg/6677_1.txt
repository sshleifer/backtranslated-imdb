After reading the first 5 reviews on the IMDb, I was very enthusiastic about this film. But it's really a horrible movie, the total time you see is an alien about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is a cheap uncertainty), the acting is at the top of the story, oh, boy, who's talking? It seems that the story does not go in the direction, first capture the alien (after 7 years, finally they succeed), then they do not know what to do with it (after 7 years?) and even want to release it (why damn it, you got it?). Then the girl, who behaves the most at the top, wants to leave this madness, and then suddenly she does not do it, then again, she does it and then she does not. Then they came to the conclusion that the killing of an alien would kill the entire human race (and remember, in all those years no other man has seen these permanently inhabited aliens) and what are they doing? He is tortured and shooting a bunch of aliens on pieces. This is my first review on the IMDb, I am a very lazy person who does not write very quickly, so listen to my warning: this move is not worth your time, do not watch this movie.
