Anyone who gives this film a good review must obviously have something to do with his creation. This film is a painful suckfest. The acting is stubborn, the generic soundtrack is ridiculous, the direction is bland and strangest of all, the teacher is not really so attractive (which obviously makes the student more and more uncomfortable). Creative minds behind this garbage should be dissolved and dispersed to prevent the further emergence of such concentrated courage. I am certain that some hungry children in Africa could use the money spent on this project. Damn, the funds would also see a more enlightened purpose that would encourage the cracked addict; At least someone will get some fun. Just because it did not give me the ultimate disease, I will give this film two.
