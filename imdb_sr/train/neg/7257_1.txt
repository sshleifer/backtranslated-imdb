I was expecting a B-Movie French musical. Ultimately, Dheri, Blanche, DeFunes were superstars of low-budget French films of that time. And it's in color! But I have hallucinations in this incredible 30 hours of pure mediocrity. Music numbers are terrible, and comedy is absolutely boring and stupid. A song? Vhat songs? This is just a series of bad numbers, one by one. The only very rare thing about this is a naked woman. At that time, it was not known. In fact, some numbers are there to show us women in Toples. It adds to the core! And I try to find a young Michelle Serrault, a future great actor of French cinema, in a small part as a musician, in his first film. Good luck!
