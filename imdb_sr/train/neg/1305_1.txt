"Demons III: Ogre" are not related to "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 are a cool hip-hop classic in 1980" The Demons III: Ogre (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are a bad quality writer and stupid bored by Villiam Shakespeare's ghost or demonic egg from the Spider's Network or what I bought a special DVD box called "Demons" in 3 different films called "Demons III: Ogre", "Second Hell" and "Black Demons" have no titles and subtitles Why Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are a bad quality writer dumb movie almost like "Halloween III" do not have the monster of Michael Miera, but people wear Halloween Night. I am very confused, I really like "Demons" and "Demons 2 are better boring stupid" D emons III: Ogre is not a part of "Demon" Demons 2 "are the same demons. Thank you, Juan Antonio De La Torre
