When you look at a little man, you will spend his time trying to discover his numerous cavities. And this is not a good sign because this film should be a comedy! You should laugh at it !! But will you? Probably not. The main problem for a little man is his concept - his too much hilariousness to accept (even as a caricature comedy), so when loudly, strenuously and over the top of the joke, they make the thing look ten times dumber than it is already. "But it's a comedy," some of you might scream. That's true, but it's not an excuse for such a stupid plan. I mean, come on, think about seeing a baby with A GROVN MANS FACE, would not you be the least suspicious? And if Kalvin wanted so much to hide the diamond, why did not he put him in a nearby shelf instead of an accidental woman's bag? And how can a qualified doctor NOT recognize that Calvin is a grown man? I mean seriously ... what? "It's not about complication, it's about laughter" maybe screaming. Well, here's the thing you see, hardly a laugh in a little man, and it just makes the stupid array plan even more. If you really want to watch the comedy of the Vaians brothers with the belief that the shop stops, hold the white chickens, because at least it had a few decent laughs.
