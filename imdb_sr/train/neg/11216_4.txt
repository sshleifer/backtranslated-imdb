It's okay to see a film about a twin woman, and her sister's disturbing visions are in danger at home. Then she returns home to find everything that is not good and she will have to find out what happened to her sister and why. It is a kind of thing that almost works but not totally. I really can not say why this did not work, but it was good enough that I wanted it to be better, or that I did some things straight away-like girls playing twins in flashbacks. be closer in size. I think that maybe what's wrong with it has a lot of small things that are just wrong.
