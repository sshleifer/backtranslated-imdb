Perfectly a little bitterness ... I doubt that one shot lasted more than the MTV-MP 4.4 seconds. Saddle-throwing, worse than in the version of Kusminsky (reminder: he succeeded in inventing Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes). But the rich got what they deserved. The Dark and Dark Heckliff is reduced to the angel's status of the golden key, the fragile and angelic Catherine portrayed as the chubby, chest, gentle, and weak Linton is screaming, and the innocent Isabel becomes the character of Sarah Michelle-Gellar of the Cruel Intentions. Fifteen-year-old Eddie Bauer and Abercrombie and Fitch donors - take into account. This thing is made for you. It's an hour and a long musical spot where everything is given to you; You are saved from the unpleasant need not to even try to understand the complexity of the characters, even from the initial shock in their actions. The actors tried, but, as I have already said, they are misrepresented. A decent photo, but the installation is at the level of TV production in high school. Please all: read a book, or even cliffs; look at previous versions, even Kusminsky; but stay away from a number of future reactions, during which you will not get a premiere without commercials.
