I always thought people were too cynical about these old movies, Andy Hardy. A few of them were not bad. Modern film critics are not the ones who usually prefer the more disgusting, so good movies like they rarely boast. Still, I can not even defend this film. You can still have an outdated dialogue, but you still laugh and cry about the story. Looking at this, just blink your head and ask yourself: "How stupid can you get?" This is cornier than corni, if you know what I mean. It's so rough that I can not figure out too many people sitting for an hour and a half. The story is basically "Andy" (Mickey Rooney) trying to get out of jam because he invents a story about a New Yorker debutante as if it were the ultimate. People were much more social in the old days. You would hear the term "social climber" as if the knowledge of rich or wonderful people is the greatest achievement you can make to life. Of course, all this is completely meaningless, and today it looks even more. However, this is about innocence and pure story and series (there were half a dozen of these films about Andi Hardi) as you could have found. Also, if you like to hear Judy Garland singing, then this is your card, because here she sings several songs and she pervades her way to Andy's heart. Oh, man, I almost vomited and wrote about this!
