As the director of Altman's experience can expect us to spend time with, or to take care of what is happening, the main character who is a neurotic, slumber, jerk with no redeeming qualities - it's a central puzzle about this deeply confused part of the job. A monstrous piece of garbage. In addition to this mockery, the line of complication requires a serious concentration. The setting in which Branagh's character enters is so obvious from the beginning that we are inclined to wonder if the writer and director have completely lost their respect to their audience. This second question is at the heart of the film: it represents a director's complacency with a profound disdain for the taste, values ​​and intelligence of the observer. Very unusual for g. Altman.
