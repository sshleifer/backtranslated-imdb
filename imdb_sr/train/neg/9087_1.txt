Canadians are too polite, but the audience at the Toronto Film Festival left the theater blaming that this film will rate 0 or 1 on their voting lists. The assumption is that the modern director interprets a 17th-century story about the love of shepherds and pastors set in the distant past when the Druids were spiritual leaders. Working in three epochs presents many opportunities for introducing anachronisms, including funny and impractical clothing and unusual spiritual rituals that involve really bad poetry. The lovers are divided by jealousy and by their strict adherence to the idiotic codes of conduct from which they develop cross-training and various pharaonic situations. The film could be hilarious as a piece of Monty Python, which is too similar, but Rohmer's effort is very flat. The audience was laughing with humorous looks, but otherwise mourned the slow pace. The end comes in a hurry and it's really terrible. This is a trivial movie and a waste of time in your movie.
