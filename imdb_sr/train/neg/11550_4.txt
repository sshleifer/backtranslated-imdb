I knew that I would watch a low-budget movie, but I was expecting much more from the film Alec Coka. The acting of the two leading people was terrible, especially white. The girl was supposed to win the Oscars compared to the two. This film was filled with what I assumed would be inside a joke for people from the film industry and a few other jokes that I actually understood and made to laugh out loud, which is rare. Without those funny-loud moments I would give this movie 2/10. What happened to Alec Coco who made all the classics from the '80s? SPOILER: There were a few questions after the film was finished. Why did a Mexican guy go to the house of another guy at first? What did his daughter say that 100 people were fired from the last job? Why did she break her things when she was angry at him? I guess I should go to K & A after the movie, but I did not want to get up at 10:00.
