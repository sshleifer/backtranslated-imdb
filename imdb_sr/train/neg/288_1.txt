There was nothing valuable in the original movie, this was even a lamer. The fact that I even found that it was rent was absolutely incredible. Anyone who is connected to this movie must be high on something! What was the story? What about the girl? Whether the viewer should get a story in the first four minutes of the film. Unfortunately, I tried several times to watch this. I even lent a child from someone to get feedback. Kid said he was stupid, and he had four years. I think that perhaps some loan could go to the director of the recording, because it is possible that some recordings made a movie more than B film. That could push him. I loved a song. The good thing is that it was just a dollar, it was worth it. I suppose you could enjoy the movie if you were as high as the actors and team. Is the pot legal in France?
