I found a DVD "I Dream Of Jeanie" at $ 1.00 in Val-Mart. When I saw that it was a "story about Stephen Foster," as a musician and music pedagogue, I had to see it. I had no idea what year was made because it did not feature on the front page, but it was a remake of "Sevanee River" from 1939. The image of composer Bill Shirley is sometimes painful, sometimes ridiculous. Man does not have testosterone and he's a damn weak! It's hard for me to believe that Steven Foster thought that music publishers are making him a service by publishing his songs ... without paying for them! In addition to this funny performance, there is also an almost 20-minute segment of Raio Middleton and his "Christy Minstrels" from the black face who perform the songs of Stephen Foster that were difficult to watch, at least. I can hardly believe that someone would consider this film to be suitable for revival in our present time. It's embarrassing and should be forgotten. Fortunately, the songs of Stephen Foster NEVER be forgotten .... also, Eileen Christi's picture Jeanie was certainly the highest point in this lowest point of Hollywood history.
