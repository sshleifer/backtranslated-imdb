You can not go far when the initial story is not that big. The assumption that cyborg needs blood is only small. The scenario is blas. Actors do not have much to do. The sets are set in the desert to reduce costs. It's a trademark that if the background is a desert, then the movie has no budget. The lack of budget is fine, if there is a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood of Champions" are examples of decent work from $ $. but this movie looks like they had to collect a change just to buy a camper sandwich. Again, sorry if the story itself was not just bullshit. Finally, this movie makes the biggest crime: it does not end! It simply ends up as if it's a commercial pause from the rest of the film. But the rest never comes. It's just weird. Just bad.
