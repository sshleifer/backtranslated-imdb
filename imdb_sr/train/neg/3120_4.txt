I did not expect much from the "Night Listener" and I actually never heard of him until I saw the cover on the video. However, the film is very efficient when it comes to building suspensions and tensions. Sometimes it pulls a little, but it actually helps to ask yourself what will happen and what is more important: when. As the movie progresses, the figure of Robin Williams pulls into some kind of "cat and mouse" to the extent that he becomes obsessed with discovering the truth and existence of a 14-year-old child molester who has never been personally personally. A night listener is an interesting story, which is great in building uncertainty throughout the movie and you are pretty much holding in the dark who is lying and what is real. However, in the end it somehow disappoints and does not fulfill the potential that it could have. In fact, this does not give you a detailed or credible explanation of another main character, which would be useful and interesting.
