I registered for IMDb just to comment on this movie. I just finished sitting through this movie, and the only thing that impressed me was that I somehow had the will to not stop it. I saw a pretty decent number of action movies and what not, but the Princess Blade has some of the worst fighting I've ever seen in a movie. Most of the sword fighting involves meaningless swinging of swords and squares and hoping that the opponent does not do the same. I've seen a lot of student films with better actions and more intense complications. Now we have a "futuristic" action movie with a bad action and practically no signs of the future. Much of the film has no action and shows the development of a relationship with the princess and farmer / terrorist and his sister who is upset. The film has multiple plots, and none of them really pays off. Part of the problem may have been that I watched the dub, which was pretty bad. The entire head muttered all their lines, so it was difficult to follow what was happening. But I have a general idea. (Knowing exactly what was said would not save a movie in my eyes) If you've heard it's a futuristic action / ninja, then you've heard it wrong. That's what I thought when I heard about it, and now I've lost 90 minutes of my life. Do not let this happen to you. Manage well.
