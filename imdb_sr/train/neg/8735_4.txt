This film has failed me. It looked like a movie by Javs when Hopper told the mayor to close the parks when Roi Shider told the mayor to close the beach. They both said there was no summer! But the box says Hopper must enter the mind of the killer and think as one. But he does not really do anything too interesting or exciting. I'm not even sure that he and his partner have experience in police work when they are in the office wondering how they will handle this case. They just say we're doing police jobs and we will solve it. And what about all the elders with pools. I did not even start to believe that they are mafia bosses. And then the guy who doubted the guy whom the mob had chosen to find the killer. With his 100-dollar hairdresser and thinks his Di @ k is the size of a school bus. Come to what's raw. I thought he would hit him with a baseball bat as in other films. I used this movie and I would not buy it. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh, and it was funny to watch the microphone over the scene where the nutrient comes out to take a cup of coffee.
