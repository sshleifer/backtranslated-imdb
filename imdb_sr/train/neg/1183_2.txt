Both, and immoral stories, both of them left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borovczik is horrified by sex, and these two films are warning about what will happen if you have sex. As a movie, this is not well done - some of the actors are really epic bad (such as "American" woman with French accent). The sudden flip-flop of a young woman of concern over marriage to interest (when it seems that this should have been the other way around), and the sudden realization of the aunt from the secret of a young man makes no sense - it was not explained at all. I also did not like the relationship of a daughter with a blacksmith as a sign of perversion or the propensity of her family towards bestiality. The central idea, the idea that there is a "sexy beast", if you want, living in the forest, could be the basis for a perverse, but fun story, but instead is only used as the basis for a nasty, sexual relationship. negative, morality.
