Unfortunately, this film has no merit to the original. Nicholas Cage, pretty woody as far as actors go, pierce the screen with a series of skills, not going over the top. Support is no better. The plot remains the same as the original in terms of progression of the scene, but it is far worse. There is not enough detail for the audience to know what is being sold. It turned out that it was only a poor goods bill. Discipline can not be suspended, nor can there be any doubt. The only aspect of saving this film is that it is very visual, as the media requires, and whoever scouts the site should boast. the end. Disappointed! Wait for the original to be on television, pour the whiskey and enjoy.
