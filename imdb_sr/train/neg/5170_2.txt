Wow, it could have been such a good movie, Beginning with Brittany Daniels tied up, Im thinking cool, we'll get the flash back, but nothing, the movie starts again with the recording kid. This film would probably be better if there was no acting. I think the acting was mostly horrible .. Although with the lines with which the poor actors had to face, I guess they did the best they could. They still really ruin my film .. The twins were the only ones who seemed to have some acting skills .. The film is pulling for the presumptuous shocking conclusion. Overall, I saw poorer films with a low budget, but since it was a hyper with the 8 films that died, I was very disappointed. Did some reviewers say that they are worse and worse. Did I see the same movie .. Well, this is 4 out of eight, and by now only one was good.
