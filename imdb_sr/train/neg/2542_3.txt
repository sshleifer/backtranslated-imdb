... not that all Disney films are trash. In any case, I first saw the "Legend of Boggi Creek" and absolutely loved the movie. When I heard that he had 2 sequels, I was very happy. I finally found a copy of this and I watched her one night. I do not see how I can make a sequel to a horror movie in the G-rating. Original is a film / documentary about Fauke Monster, and can scare anyone. "Return" is for children and should not be followed by someone. I do not remember very well, because it's been a long time since I watched it and I will not look at it again, but ... These are the hunters that come to town and want to kill Bigfoot. Three small children get out of the house to stop them. The big monsoon is passing. Hunters are injured, children are saved. Then they all hide in a boat with a large piece of tarpaulin on top and try to wait for the storm. Then suddenly, Bigfoot comes in and does something really sick. I do not want to ruin the end for any of you, but it's not terrible. Okay....
