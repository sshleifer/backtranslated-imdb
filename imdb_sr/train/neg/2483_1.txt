An inexplicably disembodied party, a mix of anti-Nazi musical (!!), pre-war Americana and Agatha Christie, who came under one big, big problem: it's a deadly lullaby. In addition to one-digit I.K. complication and dialogue, the most unlikely aspect of "Ladi ..." is madness. Gene Willard (star and co-writer) is struggling in everything: he plays romantically (with his appearance !! and his years! He and Vudi Alen should set up a club for uninvited comedies without mirrors), and he is trying to be mobile and fun, Powerful and smart, and try to sing and dance, and succeed in NONE !! Poor shooting from his good old days with Mel Bruce. For some time, I thought I had a myopia, because everyone in the movie keeps saying that Cherri Jones is a pretty hot fish, and that Michael Cumpsti is this incredibly handsome hedge! The guy who plays the male secretary Claire Bloom is a thin, stupid actor who is sexy as a chair and is a passion for the two leading ladies !! Mike Starr, who is the most cheerful and most accustomed policeman you've ever seen, deserves to be among the 10 hottest performances in recent film history. It is most urgent to see the wonderful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukov who are completely wrong and attacked. At least I hope that both stars paid their bills home (and later fired their agents) with this flop. No wonder the actor Sukhoi returned to Germany after seeing what Hollivood offered her! If you want to see how you will achieve a really bad movie from a really bad scenario with a merciless throwing director, study this - otherwise keep it away! - 1/10
