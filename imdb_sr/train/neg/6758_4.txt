Probably the most beautiful woman in the show business, and the sexiest, Debbie here gives another fine performance. Although her work in the American nightmare was far superior, she is still worth watching in this film. . In addition to Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress I had ever seen in a similar Delta Delta Die. The action takes place around a group of Californian arrogants who initiate the poor naive Debbie Rochon in their call. They tell her they have a club for murder, and they have to kill someone to accept him. Debbie does not want anything more than being accepted by these cool people, so she quickly kills a person, and now the group has to decide what will happen to her after she fell to their joke. VIOLENCE: $$$$$ (Plentiful! Debbie Rochon occasionally has a blood sprayed on her and all murder scenes are performed in your face. Upper hunters will certainly enjoy it!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > FORWARD: $$$$$ Debbie Rochon has a few bare scenes as well as many actresses and actors without a name. Fun in the pool seems to be the only excuse that all naked, both men and women alike. the figure disappeared after the first five minutes). STORY: $$ (He could get a bigger voice because the plot was very interesting and unique, but the store serves as a filling between naked scenes. B-Rate movies often use nudity, but this is boundary too) . ACTIVE: $ (the acting is at least substandard. Rochon is always on the reat, easily the best B-Rate actress in the business today, but her character in the American nightmare was superior. work as Debbie's object of lust, but other actors had nothing to write about).
