Absolutely one of the worst movies of all time. Low production value, a terrible story about the idea, bad script, stupid acting ... and I can not even come up with an adjective that is appropriately described for how poor Joan River is. I know that in Hell there is a special place for the people who financed this film; Far below the level reserved for genocidal maniacs raping children. This film is impoverished. <br /> (Horrible) k (infinity) = Rabbit test. Avoid this at all costs. It's so bad, it's not even funny how bad it is.
