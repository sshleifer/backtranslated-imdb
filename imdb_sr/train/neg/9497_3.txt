You have a strong stomach. Holden actually had 55 years on the shot, but he looked close to 70 and he only lived for another 8 years. At one point, Holden said, "I'm twice as old as you." Ok, try a triple grandfather! "Old enough to be your father," the theme they were recording failed. Allowed pensioners sometimes end up with legal teens. More power for them, but that does not mean I want to watch. It's not about judging, but about the digestive tract. I like my food where it belongs. Lenz is fun to watch, and cars in the 70s, clothes, furniture, etc. Make it worthwhile if you find yourself on the cable late at night and want to watch something that will calm down for the bed. It would be nice to see the blue friend Lenz, the one who guessed her guitar, get more scenes. Nice spacious ... When was that fish? I'll try to find out.
