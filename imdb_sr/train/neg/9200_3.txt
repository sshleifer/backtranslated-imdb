You wonder how the script is written. Vain and other artists are doing a good job, but as it is neither comedy, nor a romantic thriller nor anything else, it's pretty disappointing. We feel like one of the threads has been persecuted, it could have been worth something. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see a real party of a story made just before the United States was directly involved in the war. I wonder if the surrounding politics had anything to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes, but to end up with something that does not love anyone. However, it has a historical value.
