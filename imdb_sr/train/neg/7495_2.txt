Fox's "True Story of Jesse James" (1957) is an incredibly bad remake of their prestigious classical 1941 Tirona Pover / Henry Fonda "Jesse James". I'm not sure where the blame is, but in this version, the two central characters, the uneven direction of Nicholas Raio and the script with fists, must surely have something to do with it. In the late 1930s, Tirona Pover was Fok's leading leading man, but in the 1950s his star began to decline, and the head of the studio, Darril Zanuck, began to dress up Robert Wagner's newcomer to take his place. This was a big mistake on Zanuck's work, as Vagner proved to be less than the proper replacement. With the possible exceptions of "Broken Lance" (1954) and "Betveen Heaven & Hell" (1956) it's hard to imagine that Wagner is different in anything! Also, Jeffrey Hunter was nothing more than a Fok contract player before being assigned to Frank James Wagner's Jessie in "The True Story of Jesse James". Borne from previous year's studies, this actor's mark was his excellent and revealing performance in John Ford's "The Searchers" class. But his game, along with Wagner as the second half of James Brothers, is nothing but boring. No player has any personality or color in their roles. They completely miss the sign, they lack the charisma and attractiveness so vividly portrayed by the Trust and the Fund in the original. The film is also endangered by too many memories and with all scenarios, Vagner, like Robin Hood in the US West, encounters a charming introvert movement that does not feel any empathy. Support is hardly valuable, but the damage is to see such a great actress as Agnes Moorhead barely noticed Ma James. The best aspect of this non-exclusive so western is the wonderful Cinemascope / color cinema of the great Joe McDonald and the great music party of the underrated and little-known composer Leigh Harline!
