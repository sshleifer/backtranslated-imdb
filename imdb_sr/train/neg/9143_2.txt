As an actor, I really like independent films, but this is at best amateurish. The boys go to Vermont for public service, but when the plane lands across the palm - were the directors aware that the palm trees are not in Vermont? Fighting - palms no. The same is true for the wedding service - again a beautiful forest of palm trees. When the guys left VT, they obviously could not get a ticket for any larger airline because the plane was taken by Federal Express. Have they been delivered overnight in a chest? Come on guys, little details like this separate the indie movie from a total amateur. The Christian brother is far smoother than Arthur with his bleached hair and tribal tattoos. The two of them should replace the roles. Smaller characters are funny and outrageous in something horrible. Apply for directors for making a gay movie, but pay attention to the locations and the next time
