80 minutes, and I felt twice as long! The short passage is not short enough. Indeed, the first 50 minutes almost entirely consisted of a dialogue (more monologues, indeed) of a woman who is approaching the Middle Ages, a boring dronation of "men," disappointment, sex, aging, and her recent breakup, to the French teenager she met in ship cafeteria. The fatigue monologue continues as they go to the duty-free shop, and to the bar, where finally her self-inflicted anger is thrown out. "The story", of course, can not end there, so it urges him to listen to her drunken voice while bringing him to his cabin. What a small romance, sex, or in that case anything that this film has in addition to bitter ranking is not enough to justify the cost of rent, unless you are one of those who love drama in which nothing interesting happens. Yes, the ending is very nicely made, but it's a lesser reward to be subjected to what makes your living room convert to a virtual therapeutic session with a narcissistic lottery. Of course, some people like that. Maybe I'm wrong.
