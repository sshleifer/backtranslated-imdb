What a crime ... You forgot to wash your teeth ... to make a 30-minute show about it and make a couple of kids make some noise, then let their dad give up everything, because it's Ali, do not forget that Uncle Joey has to make some strange sounds and cooked faces, then Uncle Jesse must appear with her black leather jacket and some jeans and look nice minutes for everyone to talk about how the mother would do things if she were nearby. Yes, full of little adventures about the whole bunch of nothing and the whole long story about it. Full House will not only carry you to tears, but will speed you up twenty times as usual.
