Eitan Fox, while largely relying on the apologetic side of Israeli politics, has made several very interesting films in the past, such as "Valk on Water" and simply a wonderful movie "Iossi & Jagger". In "Bubble", however, he took this illogical and unjust approach to the extreme. Far from giving this film a standing ovation, the people on the screening I attended quietly got up and went. I also went quietly, angry with anger at such a ridiculous one-sided film that self-preservation translates as racist violence, and racist violence (and terrorism) as a turning out of justified anger; which implies that the Arabs are so evil Israelis to evil, to react angrily to the constant flow of unilateral Israeli aggression against them, and that therefore they should not be responsible for their actions. This film was not worth the money I paid for the ticket (I really thought I was looking for money back), and was essentially an Israeli actor of the Palestinian film "Paradise Nov". If you want to be anti-Israel, then be sure to watch this movie, because it really justifies this kind of belief system. The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director and, worse, a talented Israeli director, is a shy disgrace. Indeed, as the Israelites can surprise when viewed as a country of oppressors when the Israelites themselves make such an anti-Israeli propaganda, the beggar believes. What a shitty, horrible little movie!
