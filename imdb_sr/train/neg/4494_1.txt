*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continuing ... From here in the whole movie crashes on itself. First, we will meet a tramp with an indication that we will get ghosts and vampires and insects and the like. We got a guy with a retarded accent that says endless waste, two "spirits" that do not serve the right purpose and have no character whatever the crowd of supporters. Someone told me that they are vampires (straight from Blade 2), but they are so undefined that I did not understand. Funny accent with funny name suffers the same problem as Oracle. , just for far longer and far far worse. He has a simple point about the cause and effect, he seems, then he continues to be real and realistic until he becomes intricate and stupid. His last line before departure is comparable to Storm's "Do You Know What's Happening to a Frog ..." line in X-Men in levels of total fatigue. Chocolate cake is so lazy, pathetic clich√©, and Monica Bellucci as a woman does nothing else to what we expect at the moment we see her. And then we will get another kung fu fight !!! WHY? Neo is, allegedly, One. He can do everything. He has ultimate power and for what he uses. Kung damn all the time. And while he can stop 1,000 bullets, he still cuts him off with a sword and still makes a meal of five incomprehensible supporters (vampire?). I wanted to see the power of the spirit. I wanted to see him do the craziest, craziest, craziest people, because he can do everything. The same as before, without 'vov'. Fable auto chase. It can not be bad. Well ... no, it's not. It's just not what we were talking about. All the cool clips from this scene are in the trailer. Everybody. So everything is possible Vov is taken away from us, so everything we get now is a good sequence of hunting with, guess what, the kung-fu fight !!! OK, it's not Neo, but you thought you'd explain to your closest friends about the reality of the Matrix. At least he taught them something. It's not difficult. "Hey, Morpheuse, do not worry about what's happening in the matrix. That's not real. As long as you know that nothing is real, nothing can really hurt you." Eto. Simply. OK, so the chase is not bad. It's never bored and it does not look like 16 minutes. It's so embarrassing. And yet, it worsens. The final highlight of the film is probably the worst imaginable. They have a complete plan that includes three crews. Then they only sporadically showed up between Morpheus's long, foremost monologue. To make matters worse, they never clearly defined what this plan should have for a team. You know basically but you do not know who does what, when, so when one crew goes down you just do not care and you do not know how it will affect what's going on. I will add it all the same, it happens that Trinity can return to the Matrix to determine the end. That's the only reason. What is the question why 6 people were supposed to send? Trinity enters in five minutes alone! Neo's journey to the center of Matrix (so to speak) is equally lazy. Ooohhh !!! He hit another 100 Smiths agents !!! Voooooo !!! That must have been a lot of thought. Only now are they in the hallway, so the fight has no scale and ends in a moment. Man, what a great final! And then the architect! Remember everything I said was bad for Oracle and for an alien? Add them together and duplicate, so it's really a terrific architect. The only reasonable potential for him is to set the peak of cliffs. And then hit it! Let's look at the options given by Neo. Choose one door and all human beings die (except 27 !!!). Choose another and all human beings die! Considering the choice is something that this film is trying to explore, but it does not actually give the hero. If he had the choice to save mankind and the lady dies or rescue the lady and kill mankind, there is a potion for internal pain and tension. Also, when Trinity is in the middle of autumn, the potential of a real piston that would make viewing a third more important. But not. He saved nobody and saved the lady. Now the worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo dying, and then returning to life right at the end. The year when it came out everyone was so upset that Jar Jar was stupid that they did not notice that Matrick himself forced him to look at Steven Havking. "Oracle told me that I will fall in love with One, and that I love you ... .... Come !!! How could the whole world miss how horrible it was? So, what is Vachovski doing below? Well, make the ending of the original looks better. How? Well, working almost exactly the same thing (just replacing the characters) just so much worse I think my fa and r keys would be worn out if I wrote well before I got worse. Cliffhanger is simply not really a cliffhanger. It's a reminder. In fact, this movie is just bad. I really did not want to be bad, but it did. Bad in so many ways. And to make things worse, this is not a film with an insufficient budget. It's not a short film. It's not a movie that hurried. It's not a movie where too much influence came from outside. That's exactly the one Vachovski made with Varner's wealth behind them. And that's what makes this so terrible. At least Rancid Aluminum can say that it did not have enough time or money. Matrix Reloaded. The worst movie ever made? Maybe not quite. The most disappointing and defalting movie ever made. Irresponsible. <br /> <br />
