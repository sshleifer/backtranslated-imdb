This film is a pure failure. I am Steve Martin's fan, but even he can not save a tired idea and a Swiss cheese script. You mean "Police Academy 7" and apply it to military parody. Iuck. I do not feel that the comments of other users reflect the bad rating that this film received (and deserved!). That's grossly wrong. I often watched this movie at $ 3.00 in the store and now I know why. When I could just get 90 minutes back ...
