This movie is just poor. Totally wasting time and money. Jokes are predictable, the characters are so clickable and the way RPG players are talking about is also not ridiculous. The problem is that the writers do not seem to know how to play RPG and, most importantly, how they joke about this game. Of course, there's also a bunch of losers who play RPGs like retards and total losers. But for me this is not the most fun way to joke about this game. The story does not make any sense. Who cares how long the game is played? The biggest problem in this movie is that writers and actors did not even try to know what the RPG will complain about. I was embarrassed to watch this lame movie.
