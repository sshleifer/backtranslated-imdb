I warn you here: I decided to trust those who said that this is not an action movie in the usual sense, but a psychological drama, so on that basis you should appreciate and you will be fine. I'm here to tell you that they were wrong. Totally wrong. Well, no, not completely; It is very disappointing if you are looking for an action, they were right. But it is also very unsatisfactory at all other levels. Tom Beringer was not bad, I guess, nothing worse than usual; but what has it taken to throw Billy Zane into this? Was it some sort of manufacturer's desire to die? The way to make their film a guaranteed flop? In that case, it worked. If they were really trying to succeed, then why not throw somebody who can work? Oh, and maybe it would be good for a scriptwriter who knows how to write. Ah, yes, and a director who knows how to direct. As someone who was going through this mess, actually believing that he would soon buy back, I assure you that he never has. Too bad, it could have been a good movie.
