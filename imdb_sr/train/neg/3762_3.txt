I got this movie from Blockbusters in one of those racks where you can get 5 movies for $ 20. I must say that my money is worth this. I was expecting a horrible dialogue, shitty monsters and clumsy cameras. Well, as Meatloaf said, two out of three are not bad. The acting is bad, but not as bad as some of the movies I've seen. Or maybe I recently watched so many low-budget films that I lost perspective. There are some bits that the acting is really terrible, but for the most part, it's at least a high school level. CG for Saskuatch in this film is probably the second worst part. The first thing I thought when I saw her (and I noticed that the other reviewer agreed with me) is that a man in a monkey suit would be better. Clunkie stop-motion animation would look better. So, you may be wondering why I call CG as the second worst part. This is because the worst part of the movie is sound effects. They are loud, boring and constant. I camped, I know what insects sound like in the woods at night, and while they can be loud, they do not slam like cacophony in this movie. Usually when "background" sounds affect the dialogue of a movie, it's a bad thing, but from what I caught in the dialogue of this movie, I did not miss much. The action was rare and boring. There was no tension, as well as any feeling of empathy towards the characters. Speaking of the characters, they all were cakes and bland. The only mildly attractive game was between ... in fact, I can not think of anything. There were one or two lines that made me smash a smile, but that was for that. However, he still had this "home movie" that you get with movies made for pocket change and prayer. If you are like me and you get hit from tiny budget genres, and see this in a dollar bin, think about catching it. Otherwise, avoid any price.
