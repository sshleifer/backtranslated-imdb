Chinese Ghost Story III is a completely redundant sequel to two great fantastic movies. The movie brings special effects to make spelling that can be expected, but not painfully on all other fronts. All actors play an extremely stupid caricature. You need to be still in diapers to find that their humorous humor is even fun. The action is predictable, and development is sometimes irregular and often slow. In the end, the film begins to reminisce of the old Godzille films, including dashing special effects greater than life and (good, yet another) ghost with Godzilla's head. Maybe I would have thought that I was expecting a camp. It's astounding to see what garbage fans have to endure - in this case, because someone thought I could get a little more money from a successful formula. He will not be able again: the cash is now dead as a dodo.
