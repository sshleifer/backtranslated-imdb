This is a film about filming a movie. Such films can be fun, but they need some substance. It did not happen here, I'm afraid. Mr. Coppola did not inherit his father's skills, unfortunately (neither his sister could make films to watch). I wonder how this film came to get such criticism. Let's see: the main male actor, allegedly the director, is equally expressive as frozen squid and his voice has the same point as he says, the leading female actress has an expression on the face that never changes, the action is completely segmented in bits with perhaps one single connecting element, the film within the film's idea must be more stale than the paleolithic walls ... Would that be enough? I watched this movie. Walking with a dog is far better fun in this incredible chrome movie. It's as if director Francois Truffaut was directed by Dick Chenei ... Brazil, some other classic SF movies? You must be kidding me ...
