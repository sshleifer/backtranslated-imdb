"Hey, everybody! I have an idea, we found this thing in the shape of an egg from the universe, so why not dissolve it and open it?" "Yes, I know it would be the dumbest thing a scientist could do and could be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses unknown to the country and could potentially destroy the human race, but hey, I want to know what's in it." "And nobody says NASA, it'll take it away." "Wow, this thing gives you vibrations!" "Yes, it's really strong in touch so do not touch it, but it's ok to open it." "Hello, nice, look at me nips". (Later that day); "DO NOT OPEN" !!!!! Uh oh, we have to run all the way to the lab and tell them they do not open it because we do not have phones or radio devices or intercoms, although we have other equipment worth tens of dollars. "I've never seen such organic technology!" "Yes, take this stick and stab it." "I'm leaving here, I do not care if I kill the other 6 billion people on Earth, no one kills me!" "Look! These are friendly aliens from the" Bezdana "! They want us to go with them." THE END
