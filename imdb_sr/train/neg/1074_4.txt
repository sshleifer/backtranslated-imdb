I never should have started this movie, and I stopped watching after 3/4. I missed a really bad ending. This film was a disappointment because it could have been much better. She had a pleasant atmosphere, a superior role and a director, a good location. But baaaaad story, bad script. I paid attention to Kenneth Branagh's southern accent - he was better than the script. The plot was stupid - guided by characters that worked in unreal and incredible ways. Nobody behaves this way out of Hollywood scenarios.
