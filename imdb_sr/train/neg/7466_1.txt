Vov. Some movies leave me without text. That was one of those films. When I left the theater, no word came to my mouth. I had the incredible need to bang my head against the theater wall to help me forget the last hour and a half. Unfortunately, it did not work. Frankly, this film has nothing to recommend. Humor was at the level of the first grade, at best, the acting was too stupid, and the plot was astronomically strained. I hear that I will never appear another movie starring Chris Kattan or any other member of the SNL.
