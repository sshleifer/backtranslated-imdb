Revenge is one of my favorite themes in the movie. Moreso, the "futility of revenge" is one of my favorite themes in the film. Seeing Irreversible Gaspar Noe (2002), I expected an even more relevant expression of this topic. Instead, this film is a poor attempt to show nothing but a film lack of conviction and focus. * SPOILERS * The ultimate scene, unnecessary male rape / torture, encountered nothing less than a female fantasy of revenge rape. However, the film does not even follow. Instead, the drawn scene (which FAR exceeds the brutality of the original rape, both in the degree in which the graphics were and to which it was ritualized) was crowned by the shooting of Davson's face in the expression of regret or "This does not correct anything", while the rape of the rapist is heard how it continues in the background. My problem with the scene was not one of the shock, but one of the confusion about what such a graphic scene was trying to get across the audience. I mean, do we feel bad about the rapist? Do we look forward to Davson's vengeance? Do we get the brutality of all this? Do we feel Davson's moment of sad clarity? In addition to this failure, the film was somehow incoherently strident with more style than a substance. The characters are thin, the dialogue is monotone, etc. Usually I try to record movies under their own conditions, but Descent did not look like knowing what it is. Thumbs up.
