A story about a man who has unnatural feelings for pig. It begins with an introductory scene, which is an excellent example of absurd comedy. The formal audience of the orchestra turned into a mad, violent mafia by the crazy singing of its singers. Unfortunately, it remains absurd for an entire time without any general narrative that ultimately makes it too much. Even those of that age should be excluded. A mysterious dialogue would make Shakespeare lighter for the third grade. At the technical level, this is better than you could think of with the good cinema of the future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Salli Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.
