This could have been a good episode, but I just had to turn it off. It was terrible to watch the British national team. Have the producers ever made a trip to Britain before shooting? At least get in England ?? I do not think any British person had such an accent except the comedy sketch of the Royal Family! Also with two English boys ... so I do not think any English boy has behaved, spoken or dressed as any English kid in the history of the British nation since Prince William and Harry preceded public appearances. American filmmakers ... There are more than one country in the UK. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland ... which means more than 1 culture! I can handle some stereotypes, but this was so bad that I could not watch it. Fire still looked cool!
