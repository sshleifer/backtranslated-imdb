As a graduate of film studies, I would like to think that I have seen various movies, some good and some bad, but I have to say that 'Summer Rain' is by far the worst movie I've ever seen! I chose the film in the hope that it would be a great British classic like Secrets and Lies or Lockstock, but it was so bad that my tenants and I finally laughed and danced with funny acting and siren script (reminded me of a bad theater in school production). The main characters Michelle and Garry started to get upset from the very beginning. 'Michelle', the main character who lives with his two friends, has a type of face that would never get tired of slapping, and Garry was so wet (he was constantly mocking in tears every 5 minutes) that until the end of the movie he really did not care about one of the them. I only thought I paid 3 pounds for this pile. Never before did I write a review, but after I looked at this film, I was inspired to warn people of this disastrous production. Therefore, we ask you to avoid at all costs. Thank you for reading.
