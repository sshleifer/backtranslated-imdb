Considering the risk of showing same-sex relationships before the end of the 1980s, Personal Best could better play the same-sex relationship between Hemingway's (Chris Cahill) and Donnellie (Tori Skinner) as more than the experimental phase of Cahill's life. Br /> It seems to me that the creators of this film have thrown into the same-sex relationship between two pretty attractive women in order to attract viewers. Take into account 90 seconds of the discovery of the crotch of several women who jump backwards through the stairs to jump up. This random scene had GREAT LITERACY relevance for the film and it seemed that it was done only so that the audience was interested in this bland movie. I suppose the producers were trying to resist the boring complication and even boring setting of the film (Oregon competition in 1980). This review may look rough, but that's true. The exploitation of the body of the young Muriel Hemingway and the same-sex relationship destroyed every loan I would give to this film. Pepper Thompson
