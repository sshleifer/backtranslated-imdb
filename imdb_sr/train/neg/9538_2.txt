When I saw a commercial for this, I was about to see her. Forgive me, but it's been a long time since I did not see that I did not remember how it went. Just enough to say, the film I saw was not similar to the "movie" they sold me. I was bored, upset and incredibly disappointed with this film. And if it was not bad enough, they had to sink it further with that terrible reggae music. It's not really music to adjust mood for horror movie, eh mon? I guess if you've never seen a commercial (or a trailer, I suppose), you might think this is something hot. For my money, the commercial was much better.
