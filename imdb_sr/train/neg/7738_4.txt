The film was "OK". Not bad, it's not good, just OK. If there was anything else in the cinema, it would have jumped far. Unfortunately, Fast and Furious 2 also clogged, but I'd rather see this than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk, this will be a "sweet" movie for you. Personally, I would wait for HBO or Blockbuster.
