Hammerhead is a combination of crazy scientists and genres of a killer shark movie. In a little casting, Jeffrey Combs plays the aforementioned crazy scientist who develops a human being / creature for sharks. Bizarre, this is actually his son, whom he turned into this monster to prevent him from dying. Or something. The group of associates is invited to a private island of scientists. In the end they are used as a bait for a shark or for sharks. For some unknown reason, the IT chief was brought in as part of this team. Who knows why? Fortunately, it turned out to be resourceful, although a bit too heavy, Ramboeskue hero. I'm working on the assumption that he learned how to handle the assault rifle as part of his daily work, which worked in the first line. The normal day for this IT man probably involves repairing one's network connection followed by a call to bring down the criminals. Or maybe a call should be scheduled to repair someone's PC between physical conflicts with human shark hybrids on land? In any case, it's incredible and saves the day. He's even a girl. The man with sharks is a bit silly, but OK, I guess, judging by the effects in this movie. The film is moving at a decent pace. Of course, it's a complete hockey, but if you buy a movie called Hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts that a man has faced into a landmine killer, then you really do not have anyone to blame for yourself. As it is, there are pistols, up, girls, and maybe even an exploding helicopter. It's garbage, but not as bad as some might say.
