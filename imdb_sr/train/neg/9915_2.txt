I just finished "Dark Chamber" aka "Under Surveillance" and I'm stunned. Stunned, not a movie, but some of the re-reviews I read, which affected my viewing. The story was so devastated in the cavities and the majority of acting actors were so straightforward that it was categorized as a comedy. Seriously, I found myself shaking my head and laughing in confusion as I stood this film. warnings that Dad is not good. When a young woman was found murdered, Justin becomes suspicious of tenants living in neighboring apartments. With the help of a couple of friends, he installs hidden cameras to track down these people. As the truth begins to reveal, Justin reveals an unexpected secret. One positive thing is that Felissa Rose is HOT! I would generously shake another one or two stars, to make a little cock, but no luck. It would be the potential rescue grace of the film. Erik Conley played Justin very skillfully, I thought, and I would not be surprised to see him again in the future. The general premise of the film, though heavily burdened with clich√©s, may have been able to function without the funny performance of key actors, particularly Alexandra Eitel (Kaila) and David H. Rigg (Justin's father). Horor! (forgive the game). I have nothing against low budget movies. Indeed, I believe that an independent film is our only hope for a decent movie recording in the coming days. Low-budget movies will be shortened when it comes to special effects, lighting, even music results and overall image quality. I do not approve, however, for the actor's figure and the script of a Swiss cheese fan. There is a huge number of competent low budget films. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I can not help but doubt that at least a few reviewers who praised the "Dark Chamber" here are somehow related to its production.
