The "Franklin Curse" is faithfully following Mary Shelley's story for a single title, which would not be so bad that the changes were good. The tragedy of the creatures that destroys Frankenstein's family has been completely eliminated and replaced ... nothing. The heart and moral center of the story disappeared. It does not help that this Frankenstein is a broken killer; he deserves all he gets. The plot is basically a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clich√©s. Even with their own conditions, it's a garbage: a mild movie consisting of a creature like shit with pudding. Since it is the first of Hammer's horror films, directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, his place in the history of horror is sure. But it's bullshit.
