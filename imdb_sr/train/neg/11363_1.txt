This film is featured on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every number. So, when we went to the Kinnepolis multiplex, our expectations were very high. But oh, boy, how sad this movie is! It's a Hollywood-style movie about a movie in the movie. Shades show so clearly that we are not ready for the production of 'big Hollywood movies'. I'm not a film critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the scenario is the nightmare. As my theme says, it's nothing, and then loops. You could just watch the TV without seeing anything. It was a feeling when we saw Shades. Shades is a bad production !!!
