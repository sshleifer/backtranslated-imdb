Most students get lost in the academic community's bubble, cut off from communities where they learn and live. Their talks are held with fellow students and faculty faculty. Steven Greenstreet's documentary is an excellent example of a disappointed student who judges the entire community on the basis of limited contact with a small number of members. which represent large groups of the population. As usual, people who scream most get the most media attention. Apart from misrepresenting the community in which the film is set, the documentary is well recorded. My only dispute is that the feelings and anxieties shown in the film are attributed to the whole community, and not a few individuals who have expressed them. the difference between political attitudes, but it is ridiculous to implicate the whole community of people in the action of several radicals.
