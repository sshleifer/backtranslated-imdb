I watched a lot of cartoons or animated films because I have a girl who likes to watch TV. I started watching this movie to see if my little girl was watching ... and no. At first, I thought it was such a sweet movie as Bambi's film, but it all seemed like I insinuated that the duck was a homosexual. The information stated that they were mocking him because he was not good at sports, but that was not the case. It looks like a movie is made for children to learn to be gay. It was very sad, as far as the daddy's father and all that was concerned. I do not know, I guess you would like it if you're gay, but I do not think I'll look at it again with my little one.
