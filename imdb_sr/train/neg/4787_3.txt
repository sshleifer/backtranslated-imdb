This entry is certainly interesting for fans of the series (like me), but it is still largely incomprehensible. The action is confusing, as well as the continuity of the sequel. Some striking effects, to be sure, but we never discover what all this really means. Try to see the "NC-17" working version containing the above cuts to be re-evaluated. "R".
