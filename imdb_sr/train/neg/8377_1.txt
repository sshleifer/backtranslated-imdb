That is why many people are left without a roof over their heads. . . because stupid producers are paying their money to make such films instead of donating if they can bother! This film is worse than white chickens! A little man has a poor excuse to put a dwarf like a baby. The story is terrible given that six people wrote it. The idea would not be bad if it were original but not fraudulent. there are funny moments, but some of them are exaggerated, and some are just stupid. The acting was very, very bad. As well as directing. Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed. It's racist and very offensive to dwarves. I mean, instead of showing them sympathy, the filmmakers laugh at them! I'm really angry about how they do it. They see that they are dwarfs just like babies. And for a character who is a dwarf, pretending to be a deserted baby just to give a diamond from a certain family. It's her chrome excuse to show something like that. It was not worth it. Do not watch this movie. It's a huge waste of time and money.
