As someone who read the novel and watched the movie, I have a different opinion of why the film was such a flop. First, all comparisons between novels and movies are purely superficial. These are two different animals. Roman is probably conceived as a satire, but comes as a cross between tragedy and controversy. All the comic elements, such as those that later formed the stylistic basis of the film version, are just random in relation to the author's even cynical stronghold. And the omnipresent white suit of the author does not fool you to think that this is another Mark Twain, think again. A more suitable literary precedent would be the spectacle of Ambrose Bierce in the top hat and tails. Tom Wolfe is the same clown and hack, more famous than the author, always searching for a new spoon for his mill. Therefore, it is no wonder that the excellent production skills and the direction that was involved in filming the film was condemned to failure from the very beginning. Unlike true satire, which is very well translated into a movie, polemics are not based on universally accessible observations on some form or other type of human behavior, but in a unique attack on certain people - whether they are real or fictional men of straw - who have somehow He earned the wrath of a writer. Any attempt to make a successful recorded story or story from such a beginning must have a clean start, free from the influence or interference of the writer. By saying this, I also agree with casting. Not only incompetent like Bruce Villis and Melanie Griffith fail to cope, but are real talents like Tom Hanks, F. Murrai Abraham and Morgan Freeman or totally wasted or given roles that are just cartoons. There is enough current material here for really great movie satiricals, but it does not even get near.
