Man, man! What a piece of skinny film! But this is my childhood pleasure, although I hate to admit it. All this time, this movie was shown on my basic cable system. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (at the very border with Cupertino), we had this thing called the G channel on our cable system. And they basically showed the same movie over and over again and again. Vanda Nevada was one of those movies. I loved and loved the young Brooke Shields and I loved her stupid adventures in Grand Canion in the 1940s. The scenario almost does not make sense, the direction is weak, a few are pointed out that Henry Fonda appears, a lot of dialogue that is so bad that the good and beautiful song Carole King was played at the end of the loan. You may have to be stoned to truly enjoy this movie. And everyone knows there's no gold in Grand Canion!
