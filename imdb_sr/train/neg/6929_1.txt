I read reviews of this film and I decided to give it. After all, I'm an open guy and I gave good reviews to some pretty bad moves. As the credits on this ended, I asked for meaning and something nice to say. Here: "This film was graciously short." That's all I have. Good, good. The sets and images were well done and the music helped to provide the mood of asylum, but the film was ill to watch, and the endless dialogue took away the good parts. I considered this film, but the way you laugh at your best friend who was just embarrassed in front of a large audience. I just decided to push the film and let the bodies fall. I do not know what could have saved this film. The act was not bad and it looked as if it had a budget, but there was simply no way to make it visible; not even the presence of beautiful naked breasts. Perhaps I should have started the doobie or I had a lot of beer to get a full movie experience. In any case, I will not watch this movie again unless I'm really depressed. Then I can tell myself: "I was not at all at the moment," Dr. Tarrova Torture Dungeon. "I'm better than those."
