WARNING SPOILER ***** A really stupid film about a group of young excursors in Italy who find the armor of a mythical warrior with demonic souls. One of them wears it and becomes obsessed with the spirit of the demon. It's a time of killing and a few of his friends die under his blade to revive a demonic corpse. Losing time for viewers, as a fine young lady in the film leaves her clothes, the upside is at best ridiculous, and acting is a terrible, perfect match for such a bad script. <br /> <br />
