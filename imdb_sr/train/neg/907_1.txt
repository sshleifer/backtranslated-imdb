I wrote a review of this film even further after I bought it on a DVD and was very disappointed. Since I'm a film student and I am like similar movies (i.e. No budget, recorded on digi cam), I stand behind my original comments. This is a non-budget student project (and not particularly good), posted on video / dvd to make it look like a rewarding movie (if you read the cover). So to deceive the public to think that it is something that is not. I want the money returned to me in accordance with trading rules! Complete Rubbish!
