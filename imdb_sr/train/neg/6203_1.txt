I saw it at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was awful! Every clich√©, violent, rich fantasy of the boy was exposed, you only knew how it would end up with all the recordings of the chef and raping the first girlfriend. The worst part was Questions and Answers with the director / writer and writer / producer who tried to find themselves as intellectuals, but you could say that they are types that exclude violence. I bet more and more brothels and drugs. Do not waste your time. I had to stop my boy from coming out of it.
