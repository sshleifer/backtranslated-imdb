I'm looking for this film for years, because it can rarely be found because it was one of the video nasties. I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year, it's a film with a very low budget. Laura Cravford is a model that was kidnapped by a band of bandits while working in South America. She's taken to the jungle. Laura is guarded by a funny cousin who calls himself "Devil", but she has to go through all the unpleasant things until she is happy. Girls are merged. The devil shows the consumption of meat in a terrible way. Peter Weston is a devil hunter, who goes to the jungle to try to save him,
