one of the worst movies I've ever seen. A pathetic action scene and really bad behavior also does not help. The only good thing is the parts of Garry Busei, but that does not raise the film. lives up to his B-ranking film and passes the test with flying colors. Losing my money even though I discovered it was fun to start with my boring after a few hours. I do not recommend this movie if you do not watch it for free or its gift. (you can ask for a gift for acceptance and send it back for full refund). Truly BAd. 1/10.
