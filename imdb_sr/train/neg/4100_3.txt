A little disappointing film, I would say: the acting was somehow stiff. In many cases, I could not feel that the facial expressions corresponded to the spoken words or intentions of the scene. An angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) character should make the viewer believe that he is angry (or sad, happy, frustrated). It does not happen here. Comment on the writers who assume you already know that the characters were appropriate. They do things and say things that come from nowhere: the character Andrev accuses his parents of sending signals to each other for dinner; then explodes and exits, saying to his father: "Do not touch me, you!" Perhaps, if we had seen the previous one, we understood where all this came from, but there is no overflowing, so we are a bit on the water with regard to the reason! One weird, strange thing Andrew does is go to an old quarry, sitting on the edge over the "calm water" below; and then he gets into the pocket of the jeans and pulls out a cigarette box and turns on one. He did the same three times during the film; I suppose we should see this as some tortured act to be alone and angry? Maybe once, but three times? Maybe it was even four times, I lost the number. To be honest, there is a fact that he recently learned that he was adopted; It happens very early in the film, so there is no point in the dramatic changes that could pass through this discovery. It is not clear whether this is the reason why he is so embittered or if it is something else. I assume there is some Linchian feeling towards the movie, but would a director who first attempts to enlarge such a movie. Mountain so early in his career?
