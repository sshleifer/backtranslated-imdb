Deep SH .. is more like it! Eels are just cartooned in the movie. Think "The Incredible Mr. Limpet" meets "Leviathan". Very sticky. No development of character or relationship. The so-called "romantic" scenes are very banal and predictable. An interesting idea, but a badly written script and LOUSI special effects make this definitely mandatory!
