Tom Wolfe's spacious, brilliantly perceived satirical novel of life among the snobbery New York gets a brilliant look, but he is not well-served. The movie is not only suffering from the abuse of every man of Tom Hanks as an incompetent Iuppie, Kevpie-doll Melanie Griffith as a manipulative southern belle and Bruce Villis (?!) As a favorite of New York writers. The most serious abuse was in the director's chair. Robert Altman may have breathed life into these unusual characters and made them interesting, but Brian De Palma, for all his visual sophistication, never had an eye for the nuances of human experience. The resulting film looks good, but it seems blah when it comes to its subject of dehumanization in favor of status. Honestly, if satire does not make the spectator angry, what is the purpose?
