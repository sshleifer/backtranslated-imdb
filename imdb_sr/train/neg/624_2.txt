The director declares in Behind-the-Scenes that he loves horror films. He loves them so much that the film is dedicated to Dariu Argent, as well as to other distinguished directors such as George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. In essence, the dedication of this film to these great directors is like giving a mother a piece for Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was casting. PEOPLE WHO CAN DO. Also, do not throw a person who is 40 years old for the role of an incomplete, 18-year-old hermit. That's right, she's in high school for 22 years. Fun reactions are when people see their boys pulling their hearts. Or as a part when a guy stabs in his ear with corn (haha takes it), and his girlfriend just says, "Oh .. I .. God?" The scarecrow itself is pretty character. To discard cars and invite people to lose. The film has one factor of redemption ... Wait, no no. movie, but just watch Rock and Roll trailer on DVD. It covers everything and has a very tangible song.
