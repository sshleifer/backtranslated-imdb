An interesting idea for the movie, which shows the last dragon on earth and shows the struggle he and somebody have together. When he was younger, Ainon was stabbed to the heart, and Boven (Dennis Kuaid) took him to the dark master who gave him half his heart. Now Einon (David Thevlis) grew up now a selfish and evil king. In the meantime, Boven uses a new friend Draco Dragon (who expressed Sir Sean Conneri) to get prizes for killing dragons. But since Einon has half of Drake's hearing, both feel that the pain in one of them is hurt or killed. Also starring Pete Postlethvaite as Gilbert of Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Kueen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. Worth watching!
