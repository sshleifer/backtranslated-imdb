This was a horrible movie! Not for the item, but for delivery. At that time, I went with my girlfriend (when the film came out), expecting to see a film about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression. What we saw was 2 hours of brutal police repression, without a rise in the end. Surveys and commercials did NOT mention this! In addition, for all that played vhoopi goldberg, I remember being arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, reviews do not say anything about this! (without expecting it, but that's just more than a problem). If I knew this film would be depressing, I would never see it. Or I would be at least ready for it. This was the bait and the change of the advertising campaign, and I will never see this movie again!
