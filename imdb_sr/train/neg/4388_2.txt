Oh, man, I know what you think: "With such a title, I can not make a mistake!" Uh yes you can. And I loved the title, but the man I hated the stupid kid who played "Satan's little helper" I hated my mother, my sister, my boyfriend, and I hated all these people! Man, sometimes this agony was watching! ONLY ONE REASON FOR WHICH WE DO NOT GET 1/10 is because it is the cause of a bad budget, they are OK. But, man, do I hate those actors, so stupid! I knew it would be bad, I guess they saved a lot of money just to use the halloween masks for the killer, and Jesus' costume was very stupid in the end. About agony, do not look!
