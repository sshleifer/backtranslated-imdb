When many people say it's "the worst movie I've ever seen," they tend to say it about any movie they do not like. However, from almost 700 movies I remember that I've ever seen this, it's one of the two films that I've drifted away from feeling that I am personally insulted and angry. This is my first film review, by the way, and I registered with the IMDb just to enjoy the bad condition of this movie. I went to see him when he was in the cinema (I and my two friends were 3 out of 5 people), and after 15 years I can not remember a lot of specifics, but my attitude to leaving the theater is still crystal clear. --- Warning about the spoiler --- Oh, where to start. A fat loser left on the altar, goes to a skiing weekend, meets a blue bomb that interests him, leads him home to meet his family, they are all cannibals and he is the main dish, a pathetic attempt of dramatic escape, hitting all of them and running with his brother's girlfriend, living happily until the end of life. Puke. First, the gags are so bad that it took me some time to realize that they are trying to be FUNNY, and that it is COMEDY. The special effects, the few that it has, seem to have been done 15 years earlier. The big dramatic ending was so hockey and badly behaved that it was almost unbearable to watch (he throws out a whole family of cannibal rakes lying in the lawn that stand with Tom and Jerry style when they stand on them). I'm sure there are many, much more, but I do not intend to see him again as a refresher.
