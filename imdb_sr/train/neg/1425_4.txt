I'm not sure what the HK movies of other spectators were watching, but Enter the Eagles is not even near the top of the pile in the HK action. Michael "Fitz" Vong should be happy to be able to get acting in HK because he could not get out of a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and fantastic is a fighter (even better than a leg's legs than her father), but her acting skills are also sub-pair. In fact, all English dialogue (90% of the film - even more than in the Gen-I Cops) is so bad that I switched to Mandarin audio just to save myself from the misery of poor dialogue and redundancy of English subs. Of course, there are some decent fighting (but nothing that we have not seen before) and good cinema, but sirens visual effects really ruin the action. It's, however, worth the price for a reception watch Shannon and Benni "The Jet" Urquidez go to it. Spectacular, and it's almost worth watching the rest of the movie for. Finally, you may notice some scenes that appear to you to be "familiar", especially shooting on the open market (I think Matrix) and Fitz diving from a helicopter carrying black uniforms (I mean MI: 2). I suppose somebody thought that at least a few things in this movie are worth rubbing.
