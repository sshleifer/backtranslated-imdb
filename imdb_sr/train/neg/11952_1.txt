His first film after the long-term death of John Belushi, Aikroid shows a lot of tiredness trying to pull the character that would be for Belushia. a strange, violent macro to defend a rival known only as a mom. It's bad enough, but he also has teaching lessons, a school dinner for the host, four lady of the night for protection, and a Pimp's dinner (or something like that) to attend. No wonder Aikroi's most astonished time. Why would the viewer be alone? On this film, Aikroid met his future wife Donna Dikon. At least some good came from this chaotic riot. One and a half stars. You want a good Aikroid, see "Blues Brothers". You want a bad one, see Doctor Detroit.
