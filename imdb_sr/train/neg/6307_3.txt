I'll give him 3 because he showed the history we need to know, to prevent this from happening again. I agree with the comments of a gentleman from the United Kingdom. The film was pretty horrible. All cliches, there is no real complication. There are many historical and technical inaccuracies. See technical specifications at DE 529, or any Everts Class Destroier Escort, and you'll see what I mean. Now I have my black month of history in the United States, and I will be called racism just because I say it, but the history of this ship is not so great. They did some escort work, drove off a "submarine" that turned out to be a hulk that they fell off. I'm sorry, but the blacks did much more in World War II, and then this stupid movie gives them credit for it. This movie makes them look like vichers. Let her name begin, I can handle it.
