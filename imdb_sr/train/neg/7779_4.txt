The "True" story of a late monster that appears when an American industrial plant begins to pollute the water. Funny, though not very good, a monster movie has many people trying to get to the monsters and discovering what's going on, but not completely. Give him a point for giving a huge monster that is obviously built for some scenes, but it takes it away so it looks like a harmful puppy. A fun movie about exploitation that's pretty stupid in the right spirit. (My only remark is that the printing used on the Elvira issue is so bad it looks like a well-stored copy of the video tape that passed 20 years ago.)
