I had to give this one, would not give me a zero. Will you know how bad this movie is? my mom calls me from all over the city and tells me "son, I just watched the dumbest movie ever.

I sat through the rest of this film just because I wrote a column for horor films reviews, money or even a brain the cells in this absurd piece of shit, run away, if you see it on a shelf in a Hollywood video clip or even in a local video store, turn it and walk ... I want two hours to get back
