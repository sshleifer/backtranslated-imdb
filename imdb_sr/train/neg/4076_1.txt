This topic deserves a much better scenario, and the final result than this film serves. The scenario is full of holes because it was never conceived as a story, but as a series of nightmare that are loosely knit together. There are numerous gaps and loose ends in the story. The scene in which victims of abductions were told that her parents were not dead and that she was looking for her since she was taken away, she is just bizarre. It was written as a moment for cathartic therapy with the head of a refugee shelter that gave it a "missing poster" since its eighth year. In the real world, if the chief of fugitive shelter found out that, under his roof, he solved the abduction, what would follow would be an immediate call to the police. It's a matter of law enforcement rather than a 12-minute segment for Oprah. Everything that follows follows so briefly that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes were for purely unnecessary exploitation. Funny, that's what this movie should condemn. In the end, he seems to be joining.
