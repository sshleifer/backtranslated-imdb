I'm very tolerant of really bad sci / fi and horror films - I've been watching them since my 4 or 5 years, so I've seen some really bad things, but I'm doing it. I've even watched a lot of movies from the SciFi Channel so I know I do not expect much - usually a promising movie that has no end. I suppose that hope comes from the eternal - or triumph of hope of experience, as they say. Unfortunately, this is a dog from the very beginning and I knew it, but as a flaming moth, I was constantly thinking about something, anything, interesting. It's not. All actors give decent performance - given the script, I do not know how everyone was holding straight faces. It has something to do with collagen-starving red parasitic creatures that slowly take on a human race, one body at the same time. There is an evil plastic surgeon who works with the enemy by giving them the outer appearance of people ... do not worry, he gets what comes to him. The people from the snails themselves do not know where they came from, they think they might have run over a meteor that landed on the ground, but ... they know about the members of the tribe who are among them - the princess of the snails has managed to reproduce with a human being who knows is the queen of worms and that she loves herself ... oh, must I continue? Please, please, do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this ... everything would be better ... think of the worst, least pleasant way you can spend two hours ... it would be better than this.
