Our teacher showed us this first class film. Since then, I have not seen him. I was just looking at the trailer. Does this look like a movie of the first grade? I do not think so. I was so horrified by this film, I was barely watching it. It was basically a scene with Shirley McClain, who cut that girl in half, and then she was a ketchup boy! I was terrified by this film. Today, when I was 20 years old, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children should not see this movie, although it is a PG. Be aware of possible outcomes for your children. I do not even remember what it was, once it was enough!
