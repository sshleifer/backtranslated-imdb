I do not want to comb through the obvious defects of the TLPS. Instead, I will look at the positive aspects of this exaggerated celluloid pigmeat of the film. 1. Peter Bogdanovich managed to make a movie that can be submitted as a whole. This fact itself sets the film up and up to the top of its chrome filmography. 2. Bogdanovich showed how generous some happy guys are, sharing with their male audience (and then-gal) the great body and chest Cibill Shepherd, not only at one time but also in two times. Door lock! The unquestionable climax of this film fest is part of Siesta. 3. TLPS hardly has a scene without stereo-shaped countri music that draws in the background. (Peter tried to make an obvious point that the film was set up in the American Deep South (as if that was not obvious) and he recorded it and continued ...) How is this an advantage, maybe I ask? Well, when the film finally finishes and the monotone countri music finally stops massaging your tired drums, it starts to experience a strange excitement: "The movie is finally over!" It's pure joy. 4. The film gives all the women who look like Cloris Leachman. I hope that one day they will kidnap a much younger and perhaps even handsome boyfriend. 5. The biography of Cloris Leachman (which I know technically is not part of the TLPS) gives hope to all the women who look so that they could one day be able to win the beauty pageant Miss Chicago. (Provided they have enough money to pay the jury.) (You think I'm joking that Cloris won the beauty contest, huh? Well, check out her biology and then we'll see who laughs at the last one .. .) 6. The film was shot in black and white, which spared us the scene of Cloris Leachman's face in his original, natural non-glory.
