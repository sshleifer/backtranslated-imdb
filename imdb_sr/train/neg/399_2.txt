This painting started with good intentions, Bacon was a scientist who tried the theory of invisibility, and Shue is as sweet as usual in his role. Everything falls apart after that, it's your typical Hollywood thriller, shot on a sound scene with special effects, without any humor, wit, or wit. In other words, do not waste your time watching this. Get an audio tape with John DeLancie as an Invisible Man, also playing Leonardo Nimoio. That was good, and HG Vells was well-served, unlike this mess.
