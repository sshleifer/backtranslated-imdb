In the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we find out that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic sleeping without underwear, the imagination of killing his roommate, trying to steal a magazine from the stand, and lust for a young man who is met by a railway station. And he is the hero of this senseless movie that is all dressed (except for Krabbe in at least one scene too), but there's nowhere to go. The basic action is very simple, but it pulls almost two hours before a meaningless conclusion comes to an end. Verhoeven has a beautiful visual talent, but he uses scenes of wild hallucinations, open symbolism, and a worthless mountain when his idea runs out.
