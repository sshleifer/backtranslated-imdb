I doubt it will ever be a cult film. I liked Gram Parsons to be sure and I did not expect much from this film and I got even less. What could have been clever and moving was a stone. She was deprived of the music made by Gram and had more stuff than cheap food for dogs. There was no background for the Gram or the vivid people of that era. The characters shown were not even known to me as Gram's fans and all the versions of his "adventure after life" that I heard. Rock and Roll is full of stories, and good ones, but they should be taken with grain of salt. They can be great stories, though they are exaggerated. However, this film took a good story and turned into trips. Theft of the dead body and the consequences that followed should never be a boring story, but they somehow made it boring. I'm tempted to steal any copy of Grand Theft Parsons, go to the desert and burn them all.
