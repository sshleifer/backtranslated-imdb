Whether anyone else noticed whenever it is in the car every time a camera takes a new angle, they change the roads. As in one scene, it is a single-sided walkway, then on a highway with a barrier, next to the village road with two strips with double yellow strips. I can understand a small budget, but it was just a messy movie work. I read other reviews and I do not agree that it was a bad movie. I think if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy then you can enjoy this movie. However, if you feel that his work is not ridiculous, I would recommend that you stay away from this.
