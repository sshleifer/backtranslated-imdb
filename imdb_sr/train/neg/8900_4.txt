I liked the first movie, but this is an example of a textbook of a sequel that would be better than the left on the drawing board. The general idea in the first film was, if not great, at least very interesting. This sequel seeks to upgrade the idea and characters from the first film, and although Christopher Walken continues to be as good as Gabriel, the whole idea suddenly becomes a little ridiculous. If you have not seen any of these movies, then take the first movie and forget the sequels, they can take away all the joy from the original.
