What was that? I saw Matrix and I was stunned. It was the most spectacular film ever made. What ever Vachovski's brothers had to do this movie is beyond me. There is no plot, you can not discuss it. Basically, this movie was a bunch of conversations, and do not misunderstand me, I do not have problems with the movies, but everyone who talks in Matrix Reloaded were meaningless burdens. Then a combat sequence that lasted too long, then more senseless, then another battle scene that lasts too long and everything builds up to the greatest anti-climax ever. A little bearded guy who says 20 years of unexplained bull. Also, Keanu Reeves still gives the worst performance. I knew he was not a good actor, but that was outside the joke. If you watch his films in the order in which he was, it seems that he gradually became worse when they went together. God knows what his performance is in Nothing you have to give! Keanu Rivs: The only wooden board ever to become an actor. After the first film's brightness, this has come as a huge disappointment. If you have not already seen the first movie, I suggest you watch it, but do not waste time with this bunch of shit. <br /> <br />
