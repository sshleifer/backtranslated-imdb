This time the hero from the first film has become a human being and this time uses combinations of fists and feet against super-universal soldiers and a computer that went upside down and is ready to take over the world. I am pretty sure that it was Double Team, who convinced everything that Jean-Claude Van Damme was no longer credible in securing actions that could be tracked. However, it was forever hampered by his credibility. While a universal soldier: The return is not as boring as Double Team or The Kuest, it's still pretty scary, without any style and sense of the original and no stellar pairing. This sequel is made only for children who enjoy professional wrestling. As I look back, even the action sequences were not so exciting and this is why this movie is worthless. In other words, another blow to Van Damme's assembly line. <br /> * 4 (bad)
