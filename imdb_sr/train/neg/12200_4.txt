Usually, every movie with Silvester Stallone will usually suck a donkey. Rambo: The first part of the blood II was no exception. The only films in which Silvester Stallone was good were Rockie and First Blood. This film is extremely unreal and boring. It has an action, but not a good action. I did not enjoy watching him, and I would never watch this again. No wonder she got the Razzie Award for the worst picture. I would give this 3/10, the only reason he got 3 is because he had some good action, but he is not good enough.
