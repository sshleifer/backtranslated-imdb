This film was so bad that he was ridiculous. I could not resist watching him. The action is standard, the acting is rather terrible (auxiliary actors, such as a nutty neighbor and friend of a lawyer, were better actors). It's fun if you have time to lose and you like to see the conclusion of a dramatic plot. was the result of a bad operation or simply a bad behavior (I decided it was both). This leaves the script to comment, which was pretty scary. Pat remarks, idiotic decisions and reckless stupidity on the side of every character in the film. Perhaps this is what has so much riveted; I do not know. I was just looking at him to see how bad he was. (In fact, the dialogue does not even qualify to be called "clich√©s" - but it's almost totally meaningless.) All in all, a very bad, cheap movie. Kits, the same scene (house, building) are shown over and over again without art or real attachment for action; more like props that are randomly thrown into action in a bad game. The pursuit scene could have been killed by any minors in the warehouse or in the old school: bad shot, cheap props, minimal action .... and I still wanted to see the end. Imagine.
