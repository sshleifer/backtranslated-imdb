Last night I watched this movie on DVD, and I decided to look at the reviews this morning. It seems that "I, the robot" polarized the critical community of viewing here on the IMDb (and gave a lot of insults and titles). It seems to me a bit surprising, the film is not great (or even good), but it's not terrible (or even really bad). What this film is ... is depressing. Depressing the fact that the American film film population is so ready to blame the soulless, clich√© re-warming and recognize them as spectacular new works. This film as "updated" was written over it, from the line of complications (an uncomfortable mix of Asimov and modern Uber) to Smith's character (clever cynic with the spine of titanium), to special effects (which I borrowed from Matrix and several others). "I, Robot" is, unfortunately, quite the perfect action movie for today's audience: a superficial plot, a heartless dialogue, a lot of adrenaline. Smith is central, but we already knew that (it seems Hollivood's latest failed attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has many holes, all sizes, but I think most people attracted to this film are not critical enough to notice this. Maybe a blockbuster according to today's standards, but a very B-movie compared to real winners.
