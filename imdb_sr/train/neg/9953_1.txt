I really need to watch a good movie soon, because it seems to me that every other attachment is something I despise. No matter how my history speaks, I can not lie. Bobbi Deerfield and everything about it is the shit of big green bananas. I never thought I would look at the film as thunderous as this one. Al Pacino does not play in this movie: he poses. There are many, many scenes of his character, the racing car driver, who just stares at the camera. It's perfectly horrible. Marthe Keller is equally bad. These two should be in a love affair and there is simply no chemistry. Sidney Pollack directed this movie? There is no trace of genius behind Tootsie. Is that the same man I cheered for in the Shirok prison? I can not believe. Save yourself a terrible film experience. Run, do not walk away from Bobbi Deerfield.
