I do not like to waste the time needed to write 10 rows of this crime. Hiung-Rae Shim is happy that poor film making is not the main crime or will be executed twice for writing and directing this disaster. I am surprised that this film had a budget of $ 75 million, but he was actually pleased that it was such a big flop, that Shim, hopefully, will never turn into another movie of the rest of his life and, therefore, not lose any movie more time for movies. I think that the actors would gather and lynch. With the help of the resources available to them, you could make a big movie with this budget. As usual, failure was to be spotted at the outset with an awful script and story. "Transformers" is another visual feast with a bad script, but that makes it look like "Citizen Kane".
