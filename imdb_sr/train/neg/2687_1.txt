Eleven "great" filmmakers, eleven pieces of garbage. All eleven minutes of pure boredom, sophism, submissiveness, self-indulgence. It treats people of all nations. Iussef Chahine from Egypt gives "a hip hour!" for terrorism in his amateur segment. Through the green line, we have Israel Amos Gitai, using eleven minutes to show the terrorist act and focus on a nasty journalist. Mexican Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu concentrated on twin towers, but seemed to have forgotten to turn on the camera. Sean Penn, not knowing that there were no buildings in the shadow of the Trade Center on September 9 and 11. Shohei Imamura from Japan ignores the whole thing. Claude Lelush focuses on a trivial and clich√© love affair. Ken Loach from the UK focuses on Chile. Etc.
