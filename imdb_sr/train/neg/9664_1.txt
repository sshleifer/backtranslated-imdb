This film about the book is really terrible and a great disappointment. We've been waiting for this move for more than a month. Many film critics hoped. Also in the newspapers and on television, it was of great significance. When April 29 comes, many people regret that the film is really terrible. Why? The first story was so monotonous. There were many vague scenes, sometimes it's hard to figure out what's going on. The actors from Hulio Avsar were not in line with their roles, especially with Vildan Atasever. She's better in comedy movies. In this film, some kind of drama, she could not give up her previous roles. And finally, the movie is too short, only 66 minutes.
