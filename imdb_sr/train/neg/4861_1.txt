In the glorious days of the nineties you can include a large comedy central at any time of the day and see the greatest comedy show of all time on Saturday live. It was a great performance that was, was it an original toy that was not ready for Primetime or another golden age of the SNL with the giants - Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade ... and then everything went to hell . First I was exposed to MadTV a year and a half ago and I think I was out of shock. How could such a terrible play prevail for so long? There are so many terrible faults. I guess I'll start writing. Writing is in most cases terrible. This is nothing but a humor for the bathroom in the kindergarten. Actors are mostly talented. There are several sketches I've enjoyed, such as some of Miss Svan and Stuart, and there are several talents in the show, such as the magnificent Alek Borstein. Phil LaMarr is a talented actor, but not as a comedian. Although there are a few scarce ha ha moments, they are not enough to redeem this endless line of horrible beasts inhabited by whispering idiots. Skip this.
