Okay, so I went to this film, not expecting much, I thought the action movie was similar to The Fast and the Furious. Some nice cars, some nice girls, a little decent conspiracy. Unfortunately, I should say that this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen this year. Do not misunderstand me that the cars were good, and the girls were fine, but the way they put together the movie was simply shit. This story has never made you worry about the actors and the movie seemed to be composed. So, this movie was not the worst thing ever, but if you're looking for a movie for this weekend, I'd transfer this one for now.
