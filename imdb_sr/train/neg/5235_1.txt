I can only understand why some people want to emphasize the connection of this film with the '80s, but I really would not say that this is an accurate view of the lives of most people in that era - even on the poorest estates in Bradford. However, this is typical of the blunt Agitprop's nonsense that was at that time run by the dear old theater Roial Court. A lot of 'real' crafts for a small, small audience, but a well-connected backslapping to ensure future fees for turgid plairights. The simple fact is that if you want to think about a more true shared experience, you will find millions of people who confirm that they want to agree to love and live as described in 'Grgur's Girl'. I would be tempted to call it a dish of "kitchen sink", but that would be a great bad service for the plumbing industry. However, as far as the decent script is concerned, this film is really washed out. For some reason there has been unusual monitoring among Guardian Guardian guards - they can only assume that they get a visual hairstyle from pretending to be slum. Delete my friends. It's a bad movie with a poor scenario that likes to think it breaks the borders adding funny insights into the dark life on the estate. It's not ... but it's dreary. Instead, wash.
