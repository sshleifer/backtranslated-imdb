I tremble when I think of what people thought about ecologists after they looked at this horrible Chinese film. Retaining with enough Indian foster and space brother who is engaged in the acquisition of a new store, Starlight makes everyone who looks after the planet looks like a feather-adoring idiot. Actions? Alien Rae Dawn Chong arrives to lead a flute playing the underwear model in a mystical quest to avoid the upcoming Earth collapse. But first they must defeat an evil alien who does not look as much as a refugee from the Bar Street. Fortunately, they have the mystical grandfather of Villie Nelson to help (which seems a little embarrassing for the procedure, as well as should be) along with cheap F / K's buckets and a bunch of meaninglessly swollen music. Of course, an awkward script helps to conceal a fairy tale about a movie and a staggering tempo, but it's just the tip of this melting iceberg. Anyone who is interested in this film should be denied union cards until they complete a true course in environmental science.
