"Triumph of Love" is proof that it is not worth looking at every author of Comedie-Francaise who uses a cross-crossing affair like Shakespeare. Or maybe something is lost in the translation of this adaptation of Marivauk, the comedy Dell Arte-inspired drama writer Brittany says: "His tinted sense and smart word play have become known as marivaudage." While Mira Sorvino entertained, having fun with three mixed romances, her role in trousers was not even up to Cherubin in "Figaro marriage." it is uncomfortable and only indicates that for every long speech it took a lot of taking. Best was Fiona Shav like a cheated star, as well as costumes. The views of the audience we see and the closing curtain call for a wink that this all the skills do not help. <br /> <br /> (originally written on February 29, 2002)
