Jesus Christ, I can not believe I lost my time watching this movie. I looked only because I had such a sympathy for Jordan Ladd. But watching this movie almost got me off her. This is absolutely terrible! I could watch the Survivor Series 93 for this. I wish that the great Mystery Misawa Tiger drove his ass through a glass window. I was furious every time he spoke "lake" and "cabin". I'd break it. Jordan Ladd, on the other hand, was absolutely gorgeous. A real angel. But she could not even save this final joke about the movie. Unfortunately, she could not even act as if she was from her leg when she took that truth. It looked hilarious. I also loved the part where Jordan accidentally spilled yogurt. It reminded me of a time ... no doubt. Anaivais, watch this movie because of its horror.
