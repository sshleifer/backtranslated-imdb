After reading the book, I loved the story. Looking at the film, I was disappointed that many changes were made. It is understandable that books and movies differ, but these were two different stories, only names and some books of the book. Read the book and you will understand the film better. The book gives you a better development of characters. These characters are extremely interesting and make you a caring for them. Locations were really in line with the description of the book. Some characters are not included. Television is a microwave excited by so many great books and stories, which is a perfect example of it. The input from the author does not always provide a good movie, but sometimes it can help.
