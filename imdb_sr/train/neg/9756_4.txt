In spite of the (English) title, this seems to have little to do with the Devils and much more about the hungry ruler who seeks the Philosophical Stone and wants gold from lead (and virgin blood). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little trouble killing people when he thinks they threaten his position or when they need virgins for their blood. He basically bite his lady of love and alchemist that he is busy and that's more greed and madness that seems to be his problem than demonic possession (unfortunately). There are some parts that are at least exciting, such as tournaments and adult men trying to crash with big sticks, and the movie has at least a good look at it, but otherwise there's little to be recommended. A little on the way up and nothing to fear at all, and most unusual, for Molina / Naschi movie, and not any kind of unintentional humor. So, 4 out of 10.
