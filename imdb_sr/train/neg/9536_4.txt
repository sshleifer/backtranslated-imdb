The best of the best 4, it's better than 3, but barely. Basically, I say this because part 4 does not contradict parts 1/2 (such as 3), (ie, it does not apply to Tommy Lee who has brothers and sisters). draws the line of the story, and especially Sven Ole-Thorsen is a piece of Boris. In addition, several scenes of the fight, the film is nothing special. The limited budget is also very noticeable (especially on the plane's plane in the plane). Also, part 4 does not have much morale or does not say anything like part 3, there are a few more famous actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in the fourth part, but unfortunately nothing similar to the beginning of the series (even these characters have very small roles). Rhee shows, and to be honest, she can not carry a movie. Video on tape, Rating: 4
