A very low-budget police procedural film about murder detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body appeared in a stolen car in Central Park, the only trace of the tattoo on her hand. Although released by RKO, this has the appearance of an independent production that the studio purchased for distribution. Actors and the team, with a few exceptions - including young and unrecognized Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman Villiam Steiner - consist of complete unknowns, and it shows. The performances are universally subversive and could not pass in a high school film, the direction is stag and aroused and, as mentioned earlier, there is no chemistry among the leading actors. However, despite many shortcomings of the film, there are several good things. The shooting location in New York, and the ultra-low budget of the film, give it a truth similar to that far superior "Goof City", gunshots in the dark basement are decently processed, and some investigative procedures are smart. Otherwise, there is not much to write home. It is worth a look, however, to look at the tiniest parts of New York in the early 1950s, and old car enthusiasts will be thrilled to see the legions of the cars of the '30s and '40s on the streets. > <br />.
