Come on, let's get real. The knights of Christ, Ordo Templi, or the templar knights, as they are commonly called, did not exist until the beginning of the 12th century. The story is so funny it's pathetic. Dolph Lundgren just looked positively bored. In addition, if you want to have a templar in real life, why not use only Christ's knights, which still exist in Portugal. At least they should consider history. The only quality I could find in this movie was that the artefacts seemed authentic enough to pass through medieval or gothic parts. The acting was bad, the story was desperate, the action horrible, and the props were fine.
