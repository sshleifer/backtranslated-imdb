The first half of this version was the best I've ever seen (and I think I've seen every version of Jane Eire ever made). The development of Jane's childhood and character was remarkable. Then it was like someone said "Uh oh, this is too long," and the rest of the story was cut to pieces. The main scenes, when they are involved at all, go over, combine and put it out of order in such a way as to completely change the story. There was so little transition or even the development of the scene that it would be difficult for anyone to follow the story. The big disappointment was that the start opened so much hope, and then the end ended.
