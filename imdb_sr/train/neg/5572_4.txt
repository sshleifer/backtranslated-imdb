Another colorful excuse for men in rubber suits to wrestle with each other. This time, passengers from the future come in 1992 and recruit several people to return with them until 1944 and prevent the creation of Godzilla, thus saving future Japan from destruction. But since he accomplished this task, time travelers have discovered that they are a bunch of double crossings whose own creature is going to be raped, and without Godzilla to stop it? Eek! It all sounds very stupid, and it's probably, but the plot is surprisingly decent and the final battle looks pretty good. Unfortunately, the rest of the visual effects are just garbage, not enjoyment, and the film turns out to be just as annoying as its predecessors. Watch out for the climatic Spielberg joke.
