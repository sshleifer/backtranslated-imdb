How this film gets a 6.7 rating, can not be trusted. She does not deserve anything better than 2.0 and should clearly be ranked among the worst 100 IMDb movies of all time. National treasure is an insult to national intelligence and another attack on the American audience by Hollivood. Critics talk about holes where you could ride 16 wheels. I like the excuse that this movie is good ... "Nicholas Cage is cute." Come people, it's no wonder people around the world think that the Americans are stupid. This must be the dumbest, offensive film I've ever seen. If you wanted to see a really decent movie this season, think about Kinsey, The Voodsman, Million Dollar Babi or Sideways. Unfortunately, national treasures have gained much more publicity than those great films. I bet that most of you are reading this, yet you have not heard of them, because some have not yet been published. Nicholas Cage is a great actor - when in real movies. From time to time, I saw Cage take away a great talent in terrible movies such as Con Air, Rock and Face-Off. When his talent is well exploited as in the adaptation of Charlie Kaufman, he is an incredible actor. In the extreme, I'd rather feed my hand to a wooden ax, than to be subjected to this visual crime again.
