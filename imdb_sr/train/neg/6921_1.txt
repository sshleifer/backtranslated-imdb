I went to prescreening this film and I was shocked at how cheese was. It was a combination of every horror / thriller clich√©, trying to comment on many things, including pedophilia, worshiping Satan, cops, secret jobs, jobs, religion ... and that was a mess. the acting was pretty brilliant; the kid and Jesus' type were fine, but apart from them ... Anyway. I admire the effort (though somewhat unsuccessful) to try to portray the Christian people in a different way ... even though they did, the way the gospel was portrayed was a little whistle. But again, it might be because he talked to a little kid ... no. Actually, I decided it was all bad. music ... oh my God ... terrible ... too dramatic. Okay. I felt bad about the people who made this film at the premiere; It looked like a bad student project. I will stop talking about this now and say the end result, go watch this movie if you want to spend an hour and fifty minutes of your life on shit. There it is.
