Bad performances by Sinatra, Martina and Hiera. Sharply undeveloped auxiliary characters. Annoying conversation without real complication. The ending leaves you to flatter from pancakes, with more loose ends than you could tie in four sequences (that is, if you care about these wooden characters). MacLaine is the only thing. This last sequence in which the "Chicago Cap" searches for the Sinatra character is ridiculous. And the music in that line is bad. And on the final scene, when Martin's character removed the hat for a woman he called "pig", he almost forced me to get out and find a stone that I would throw over the television screen.
