Can I do it until I get a glass? at the very least proves that everyone can make a movie. Talent is not a consideration. People who have freed this miserable bunch of vomiting in the world, have no illusion of talent, taste or intelligence. The target audience must consist of recently labs and babies playing with their feces. Anyone else would be too smart to get out of this movie. It consists of a series of sophmoric skitches in which the punchline does not extend even to the obvious. It ends in absurd. The jokes that are told are the types of jokes children in elementary school say (usually insignificant or sexually connected) where they do not know the meaning of all the terms they use. You know, like the one about Dad's car and my mom's garage. Applying any tougher method of criticism would be meaningless, since creative "minds" never heard of the usual standards of acting, writing, routing, and the like. behind this mess. Not to be condemned, but anyone who enjoyed this movie should seriously think about their purpose on this earth. <br /> <br />
