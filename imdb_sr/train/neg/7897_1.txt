This film was made for people who thought Gremlins was too serious and Critters to hardcore. Like many of the films about the creatures / trolls / gremlins of the 80's, this film is bad. The sad part is that there is no comment on this comment. It's just bad and it's not funny. The problem with this miniature monster movie is that he actually tries to be ridiculous and ends up being successful in the fact that Hovie Mandell was in Valk Like A Man. What turned other horror movies into the 80's into classics was that they were genuinely trying to be terrifying, but they were hilarious because they did so. Someone certainly said Bettina Hirsch (to Bettina Hirsch) that she had a sense of comedy before she started directing this film. Unfortunately, they were wrong. Surely it's fun to see the weirdly little mutated crossing between the scalp and tumor in the brown robe and throwing the balls to the pool in the exile from the Lost Boys, but it's not enough to save the movie. The far the most unfortunate part of the film is the figure of Paula. His Paul Reiser vannabe schtick is enough to start a quick rewind from the time of his first scene until the final credits stop just once to see the scene where Munchie throws balls for a pool near a guy ... not if I did it. So, the ultimate result is running, do not walk, to the nearest Blockbusters and handle the manager and thank him for not having the grapes to get this bunch of garbage on the shelves.
