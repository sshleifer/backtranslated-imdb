Look, I'm sorry if half the world is insulted, but life is confusing enough. I do not have to look that way. I'm digging Anthony Hopkins, a great time. I even looked at Fracture, and I knew it would be a bunch of Kuentin. But this thing was not well recorded, and did not dare - even if it was artistic. Well-produced films have reasons for cuts and quick changes, not this "oh, but it's a real interpretation" excuse. This thing will hurt your head. It's the fastest moving picture that does not lead you anywhere. I still love AH, and I'll always give him one more chance, but if you're not in time to look at bad ideas on the screen, skip this.
