Another Die Hard straight on the video rip off from the cardboard criminals ?? How many of these terrible cheap (and bad) discouraged from popular action films in the late 1980s and early 1990s, are you still lurking there? For the record (you will not care) this is another obvious piece of the combination Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed ​​2 with complete clichés and predictability. The criminals who have not been described are the usual selection of cartons of cut-out pistols that distribute bandits sent with various means while the film is progressing, it is natural that the hero is a former policeman or something that has family and attitudes problems, and of course to guide the party only to the usual emotional luggage, as well as the appropriate piece of sweets and his boring son. The presumed luxury cruise ship that runs between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between ship and ferry boat. ?? Does this go in some way to explain how it seems to be sending around on an abandoned ferryboat? in New Zealand! The act is wooden as well as the deck, the scenario is poor, the one that is predictable, the villains are completely incompetent and the plot has holes in which you can sail by boat. It seems that there is never the ending of this tide of this kind to tip straight to the video trash that pollutes the late night slots of television and DVDs with cheap bunches of supermarkets everywhere (although even this movie is so bad it has not seen it yet edition of DVD, but it gave time!) Is there any chance at least that half decent decent, semi-persuasive and most important ORIGINAL?!? No, I thought not?
