Christmas story is a classic break and my favorite movie. So natural, I was thrilled when this film came out in 1994. I saw him opening day and I was ready to enjoy myself. I Cole Avai Revolted and Digested. The Anticipation that is true in the Christmas story has strangely disappeared from this mess. Red Rider BB gun is better than a Chinese cannon. And it's not so funny. Charles Grodin is good, but Buck stops there. Bottom Line: 1 Star. Do not even torture yourself.
