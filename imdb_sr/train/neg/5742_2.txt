When I borrowed this film from a friend (fortunately I did not buy it) on the package (which really looked bad and ugly), "The ultimate vampire horror" was printed. After watching, I thought that the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the film itself. "The story" begins when a teenager (surprise!) Loves some vampire / zombie creatures. Lighting, sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a video for a break at ten. if not worse. I gave a movie of 2 out of 10 and just because the promo-shirts looked somehow cool. I do not want to breathe student films or movies at all, but I've seen Braindead and I've seen a $ 20 movie that gave the students a budget that's ten times better than this shit.
