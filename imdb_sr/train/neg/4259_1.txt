I did not know anything about this film before I was convinced to see him from a friend who heard that it was a "non-stop epic scene from the beginning to the end." It could not have been further from the truth. This was one of the boring, poorly written, amateur-directed, terribly acting films that I had an accident to look at. I would rank it there with a movie that I think is the worst movie of all time ... Battlefield Earth. In fact, there is no story, it's hard to believe that the creators of this film thought this soap shit would be taken seriously as a real historical fact. There are also some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard ... like this little gem ... Gui tells the girl "You stink like a month." The girl answers: "What's the smell of the moon?" OMG! You must be joking! The scene in which the guy was drawn and the quadruple got a good laugh from the audience, because it looked so funny and the sound of a FKS-type tear-stricken from me reminded me that someone sounded freaking with his mouth. If this is playing in a theater near you, avoid it at all costs. This movie is so bad that I made the decision about 45 minutes so I would have to make up for the dream ... and I did. Terrible.
