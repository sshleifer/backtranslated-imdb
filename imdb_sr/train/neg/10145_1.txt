It seems that Steven Seagal walked in his sleep through a horrible film shot almost entirely to conceal a complete lack of budget and resources. Selecting technical deficiencies - the silver F / A-18 and F-14 taken from the carrier for an air strike, and wonderfully becoming a camouflage F-16 for a real strike - would give this film more credibility than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the film is credit-based titles that disappear and then disappear in a flashy swipe, which is probably available to all Final Cut Pro users. Putting all his creativity in his favor, Michael Keusch is in the same category as Marcel Mandu.
