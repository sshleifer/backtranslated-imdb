Many deaths occur in the wild. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out! But should this be the focus of a documentary film about nature? What about this fascination with terrible death? Do we really need to see an adult elephant torn into pieces of hungry lions? Or, the cheetah catches the throat gland in a slow motion, no less! I thought this would be a film about nature that is friendly to the family! And why do not you have the courage to point out the ghastly violence in movies? Were the filmmakers afraid they would lose money? Then in a typical, comic relief mode, we see the magnificent Birds-of-Raja that perform rituals of mating to the most admirable and the deepest narrations that are humanly possible. It was surreal! It's as if the authors believed they were only addressing one first and second grade student on a school trip! Wow! From middle to moronic in heart! If there are some future documentary film authors about nature who are waiting to read this movie review, why not focus on: Animals that are actually being copied; giving birth; laying eggs; bathing; sleep; mutual cleansing; socializing; playing; emotional displays except fear and anger; unusual behaviors, such as the imagination of the mouth; migration; problem solving skills; culture (yes, many animal species have what people call a culture); Communication skills; parenting, healing ability, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or tricky beauty, and why you would not be much better rounded up - focus on joy and inspiration?
