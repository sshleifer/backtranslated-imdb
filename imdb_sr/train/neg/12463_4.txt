All right, Hollivood is not liberal. Obviously I lied because it is. I am conservative, but the politics I will leave behind my opinion of the film. This film was anti-bush, anti-Middle East, anti-big oil propaganda, but that's not why it's bad. I saw this movie premier because I accidentally love such films and I'm a collage politician. The cinema was great and the acting was as good as I could say. However, the complication was impossible for decoding. I have been tested and I have 138 IK, but no matter how hard I tried, there was no way to compose a story about a movie and which characters do what. The story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organized. Unless this is one of those films that should be watched many times to get the full depth of the story, which can be very good, I have no Idea exactly what was going on. What makes sense is because if you want to make a political argument and do not receive criticism, then do not criticize your argument! If you can not brush them brilliantly, then confuse them with Bola S.
