Hello. I am Paul Raddick, a.k.a. Panic Attack of VTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this terrible film that started the film career of Adam Sandler, but after a short time it was digitized. and it does not work ... or I thought so. Sandler meets with kids who love History of the World 1 and Rebound. The babies were supposed to be engaged, but, in fact, they were executed by Savtooth, the worst cannibal that the world has ever known. Adam Sandler went badly in Going Overboard, but he went better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and Jen Leone's favorite, 50 First Dates. Man, Drew Barrimore was one hot fish. Spanglish is red hot, Going Overboard is not a Dooley squad! Place the file.
