Of course, this is not really a hit, nor is it such a position. "Dieter" is the first name of a very popular German musician, who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting, and that's exactly what this film is about. It is based on the autobiography written by Dieter Bohlen several years ago, but it should not be accurate. The movie is filled with some sexual offensive content (at least for an American standard) that is either fun (of course not for other "actors") or stupid - it depends on your kind of humor or whether you are "Bohlen" -Fan or not. Technically speaking, there is not much to be criticized. Talking about me, this movie is OK movie.
