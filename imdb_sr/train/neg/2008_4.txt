It was not mentioned whether Ann Rivers Siddons adapted material for "The House Nekt Door" from a 1970s novel by the same title, or someone else did it. This lifelike film was directed by Canadian director Jeff Voolnough. Having read the book for a long time, we decided to use the chance when the film is shown on the cable version of what is apparently a film made for television. You know that when the critical moments precede the advertisements, which, of course, you can not find in this version, we watched them. The star of the movie is Lara Flinn Boile, who deals with the new look that threw this view of the curve due to the cosmetic transformation through which this actress has passed. From new eyebrows to other parts of her body, Ms. Boile is hardly recognizable as Col. Kennedy, a figure at the heart of the mystery. This was not one of the actresses of a better moment in front of the camera. This is also true for the rest of the mostly Canadian actors who earned better. The film has a sense of crossing between "Desperate Housewives" with "The Stepford Vives" and other better known features, combined with a mild dose of creepiness. The best thing in the movie was the house that serves as an item.
