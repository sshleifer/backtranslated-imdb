The "Washington Square" is a straight, abridged adaptation of the short novel by Henry James. Indeed, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James's masterpiece. Moreover, his simple story seems to be inappropriate to turn into a movie (although Villiam Viler, with his "Heir," gave a beautiful version of the novel in 1949). In any case, the film is entirely given the spirit of this work by the great American writer. In her novel, Catherine's heroine is shy, not very attractive and somewhat clumsy, yet she is a healthy, intelligent young woman and is not naive as it seems. Her attachment to her father is dignified and respectful, without the morbid sides in her. In three quarters of the film, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) just looks mentally retarded, poor. In the last quarter, she suddenly (and unbelievably) became intelligent, aware of her dignity as a woman, and all that. First, when a nervous child Catherine has, therefore, trouble with her own spit. The second scene, when we see a kind of open-air brothel on the background, with prostitutes that lead their clients behind the tent, and so on. Nothing can be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideas of Henry James. It is known that the writer was extremely decent and humble even according to Victorian standards. I forbid anyone to find any roughness on thousands of pages of James's huge literary production. I was really angry at these two scenes. Yes, I know that the director needs reasonable freedom in the film adaptation of the novel. But if the director completely ignores or misinterprets the art of the author (here Henry James), I do not see the purpose of using his work to make a bad movie. The acting is adequate to the film: bad and straight, despite the talents of Alberto Finneia and Maggie Smith. "Washington Squares" is definitely a movie that is not recommended.
