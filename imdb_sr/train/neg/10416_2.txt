Before I look at this movie, I would say that I love everything Kathi Bates has done. Now everything is - minus one. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character, acting. Someone should have told him that "the poor" is not synonymous with dirty, or ignorant, or clich√©. The same goes for the stereotypes of Randy Quaid. The only redeemable feature is Henri Thomas, who is not a strong actor to carry this sort of mess. If you enjoy the country, you will enjoy the landscape. That's the best I can give you. I am a serious fan of both independent and strange movies, but this is simply terrible.
