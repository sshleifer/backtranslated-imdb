This boring, boring movie about the casino in Las Vegas is almost impossible to watch and get in the way. That's something you "watch" if you have nothing else to do. The only two decent things in this movie are connected with the beautiful Stella Stevens and one runs the whole program hoping to come out of one of those scanty tops she wears. Many great shots in the mid-1970s Las Vegas (when there was still a cool place to visit) and fashion day are good for giggling. Otherwise, one big call. The Rhino DVD has a very good transfer on a wide screen, but even for less than $ 10, it's still not valid in my humble opinion.
