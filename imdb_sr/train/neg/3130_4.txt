I came to this film really wanting to put it. I thought the space had a lot of potential and was mature for an interesting movie. Do not misunderstand me, I did not expect Citizen Kane, I took this for the B film that is. However, it still did not meet expectations. The historical aspect of the story is glossy, and the ending has left me with a bit of cold. The acting in the film was very wooden. All in all, I gave 4 for a great idea, but the film could achieve much more with a little more attention on the basics of the film. Is It Worth Watching? I did not want to go back for two hours, but I do not know that I would recommend it to others.
