After the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime", a group of directors decided to gather and make a similar anthological film based in New York. Unlike the original movie, the stories in this movie sometimes come and go too fast - the moment you think you entered the story, it ended in too many cases. And they often start and stop, and then they start again - the stories are together woven. As a result, there is no title that would indicate that the story is complete and that it is less formal in the structure. Unfortunately, while "Paris, Is T'Aime" hit or failed (mostly hit), most "New York, I Love Iou" was miss. The stories were usually more of a sexual nature, but also far less sweet - and often quite terrible. It was a staggeringly boring and uninteresting movie with only a few extraordinary stories - and maybe often depressed music made it seem more. Now I understand, it was good music, but its gloomy tone really, really made me feel like I cut my wrists! Among the best there was a story about a young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to a dinner party. It's all so sad because I loved the first movie - and I really wanted to love this movie. I respected what they tried, but I did not really like that. By the way, and this is NOT a real appeal, but I was amazed how many people smoked in the movie. For a recent movie, which was unusual in our anti-smoking culture. Also, if you get a DVD, there are two segments included as add-ons that were not included in the movie. One is made up of Kevin Bacon (who holds a cool fedora) who eats hotdog ... and absolutely nothing more than ten minutes. On the other hand, there is a teenager who makes the film by filming the world - including a very unfortunate couple.
