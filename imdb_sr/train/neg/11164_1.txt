What a disappointment! It seemed that this film was trying to copy a "superb" comedy, but the direction and the scenario were messy, sick and sentimental in the worst film tradition. The acting / role of Jack Black was self-indulgent and self-confident ... and the other characters were equally uncovered and uninteresting. Soundtrack was tired. We are (BLOG) fans of Black, but none of us did more than a forced titer for the duration. Why did he feel necessary to make this mistake? We will not watch another of his films without carefully reading reviews. Was he drunk when he read the script before registering for this game?
