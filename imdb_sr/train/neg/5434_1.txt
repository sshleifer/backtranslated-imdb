Vov. What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. Here are just a few grips. The screenwriter eliminated two main characters from the book. - The land is grotesquely changed. - The voices sound as if they were drawn directly from written passages (which can be read well, but not the same when they are pronounced, especially with Chabon's style of writing). - The act is wooden logs. (Esp. Bechstein) - This was supposed to be set in 1983 ??? I feel more like 2003 ... To be honest, I could not bring myself to finish watching this movie, so it's possible to buy it ... (sarkazam). I sincerely hope that nobody paid to see this, or at least anyone who read the book in hopes of something decent (a la Vonder Bois). I like Chabon as a writer, but it should be a disgrace to this adaptation. No star.
