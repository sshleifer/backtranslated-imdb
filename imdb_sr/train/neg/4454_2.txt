First, some background; I am an Englishman and I live in London all my life. I've been in many games at The Den and most other London clubs. I know the type of person who is hooliganized and I know how they behave and how they speak. I must say this is a bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unhealthy movies I've ever seen. I spent most of my film upset. I felt I should write a mini review because I thought I had to point out a few things. a) People simply do not speak so in London in real life; Directors took the entire slang and made it sound stupid. Unfortunately, types of hooligans exist, but those you see on Green Street are more like parody. b) The actor playing Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam), unfortunately, sounded like 'English' or 'Cockney' as Osama bin Laden. He is from the north in Nevcalo, and I'm just amazed that any other actor can hold the right face next to him - in order to understand him seriously. Why did not they just invite somebody from East London to play that role, it's beyond me. I could do the job, hehe. c) Ð³. Frodo. I think how I can expect to seriously understand Elijah Vood as he strikes people twice as big as his size and who are really nasty hooligans. He'd be dead. Simply. Honestly (like Brit) it was difficult to watch this movie. I'm pretty sure this movie will be bombing here in the UK. It may be a little better in the states because the Americans simply do not know (or worry) how wrong it is. Please, my American and foreign friends, do not even believe about these nonsense. Yes, these companies exist, but it's all extremely underground and silent, and on a much smaller scale. The film gets only 2 of me because they recorded something in London. They usually try to record these things in Cardiff (Vales) or something like that, and expect us not to notice them.
