Yes, I know a cheap video, but this film is an excellent example of how a collection of 'depths' (political unrest, love / lust) can be combined with a chance with a critical critical acknowledgment (see also 'American beauty'). Kaufman's film flourishes along with free sex scenes with the often painful dialysis sequences (in one scene I counted three different "generic European" accent hit by actors), and the country's displays could be frenzied, but they do not link them to the coherent meditation of kundera offer. in his long three hours, he almost completely thawed Franz, missing the fourth piece in the love triangle that lies at the heart of the action, and in this way sacrificed the central mechanism of the novel to present the spectrum of emotions and the relationship of power that they receive in love affairs. also fails to include the time for the screen for Tomasz's son, used in the novel to illustrate some of the political points that Kundera made in the novel. in combination with an over-sounding background, these shortcomings make the film's three hours unbearably heavy in tone, but with light content.
