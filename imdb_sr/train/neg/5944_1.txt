It's not exactly my genre, this street fight right on DVD is the only one I met just because my friend put me up while we had a few beers. I am a relatively open mind, and quite a fan of Eamonn Valker, so I'm back ready to enjoy. Blood and Bone is a story about Isiah Bone, a former prisoner who becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons that ultimately take place as the movie progresses. Blah blah blah. What a boring movie. I understand that such films do not rely heavily on the plot, but do they have to be such a stupid, predictable and completely stupid story? Maybe it does not matter, but it's annoyed by boredom. It is better that there is no complication and clean action of the klich-jahanog fleabag mongrel narrative. Inundated with a totally unfounded and unsettled sentimental disturbance, it is a film equivalent of a thin turkey filled with rotten innards. At this point, I should probably mention what is, of course, the point of drawing a film: fighting. Even by itself, the fighting is pretty bad. Bone manages to extract well-established street fighters in simple battles (large or two film modes attempt to correct this inconsistency); fighters who never conclude that the attack is one by one stupid venture. Even this is repetitive and stupid, hands broken and faces fired with constant force that we can see again and again. Running a mill, a movie by the number of movies that fully deserves its straight to DVD status, working absolutely nothing new and everything we've seen repeatedly. And even not particularly good.
