Julia Roberts apparently made an effort to scrap her cotton person with this forgery, but it's hard to imagine that she will eventually put the performance as powerful and convincing (Oscar won) as she did in Erin Brokovich based on the background of this stupidity. And do not make the bones about it, it's nothing more than Julia Roberts's car, but unfortunately, its performance is not the most impressive of it. The parcel has all late night labels - for the cable, and do not be under the impression that it will provide you with any insight into the dark world of domestic violence, because non-characters are sketched enough to really care about you . At the end, disappointing and unsatisfactory, without Roberts's name above the title, I'm sure it would totally collapse, deserved.
