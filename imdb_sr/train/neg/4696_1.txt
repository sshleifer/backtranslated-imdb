I know people and I did some animation and graphic design, and the show is terrible! They are rich little children who do not have the talent, and probably only asked Nick to accept them! Alek played drums for one year, I played for 4 1/2! The film is terrible, and the show! This is the craziest comedy that's even fun, I've ever seen. It's so stupid that it makes me baff! It's so crazy that Nickelodeon has ever embraced something so stupid! They are sooo stupid and weird! I hate them and their performance, and I think that when Nick understands how stupid they are, they will hope to take it off!
