The philanthropic gesture in the real life of actress Ruth Roman to help entertain the hulls that are coming and go to the Korean War in an air base near San Francisco started this starlike greeting Varner Bros.. patriotism and songs. Many celebrities are visiting while love-hatred develops between a young starlet and a painfully green and thin aviator (Ron Hagerthi, who seems to be delivering a newspaper from a bicycle). It seems that the Corporal has deceived the actress to think that he will fight when it is actually part of a crew of a freighter who flies to and from Honolulu (you think she would be happy she was left out of harm, but instead she acts just like most children in movies from 1950s). Doris Dai is here about the first thirty minutes, and her expressive numbers of laughter and brave songs are the most comfortable. Roman is also here, looks glamorous, while James Kagney is having fun on his personality on the screen, and Gordon MacRae sings in his handsome baritone. Jane Weiman also sings in a bed hospital next to Doris Dai's bed, causing someone to wonder: "Have the sets been gone?" For undemanding viewers, an interesting flashback at another time and place. However, the production of low rents and adequate technical aspects make "Starlift" a strictly second account. * 1/2 of ****
