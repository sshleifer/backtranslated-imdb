I remember seeing a BSG pilot. I can accurately describe that night. I remember where I sat in the chair. This performance was magical. It came alive. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I even enjoyed the parts of the third year, and I watched every episode of the fourth year, completely faithful to the great hopes that it would somehow turn. Well, it's not. I watched the Caprice pilot and was delighted. There was hope for something good. Then I started to watch regular episodes, and they got more boring. Too obvious, too predictable. It reminds me of the political correctness of his last failed performance, Virtualites. Much of his line-up on the DS9 was good. When it was focused on the BSG in an organized way, it was good. This is especially true early when more or less followed the pattern of the episodes set by the first BSG series. When they departed from it, after meeting with Admiral Cain and Pegasus, everything went on the way. It was as if he had written the rest of the show without knowing where he was going. It may be improved. Maybe it was just a few bad initial episodes. But I'm very, very nervous.
