The Animal Farm (1954) was very well-read about the dangers of totalitarianism. How good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who do not know or rule the iron fist and empty head. Unfortunately, this film does not display any of these. What is shown to us is a propaganda piece with many fingers waving and showing. The animation and direction were good with regard to the budget and time period, but the very essence of the novel George Orwell was largely lacking. a novel or are just interested in seeing the adaptation of this brilliant novelty, so be sure to watch. I just found that this is somewhat central. However, only one man thinks. Remake is slightly lower, but not much.
