This movie is exactly what you get when you really exceed your skills, it's like someone who just passed the driving test, then transferred them to Formula 1 Grand Prix (I can not add, the Grand Prix of the United States as everyone would they could pull out because of the abusive tires and maybe just beat), so this film is so far falling. Do not misunderstand this, I love B-Movies, around half of my collection is made from B-Movies, but I do not think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this movie is. The first story (for B-Movie) is not that bad, it has the potential to make the brand B-Movie, did not talk about the potential for Friday 13th, but still that potential. But what really allows this film to fall is an act, even in one second I do not believe anything, it's like watching the KVC, except that KVC teachers have a tendency to have a harder time. To say I saw the movies above, but I can not.
