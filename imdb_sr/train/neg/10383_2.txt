This can be one of the most interesting movies ever if you do not take it seriously. It's a bit out of date and the effects are crapy, but it's so pleasant. There are giant crabs that attack the girl. Oh, and the crabs sing Japanese. It's incredibly bad. And the ending, which is telegraphed throughout the film, is terribly awesome. Predictably, watching the last fight will leave you in place. Do not even give this movie a chance and you'll love it. Susan George is fun to watch, and she seems to be naked. Her daughter is not very worthy of restraint, but she is attacked by huge crabs. They are the size of big cats. This is 2, but I like it. As a movie, God, but for the party, I give him 7. Did I mention that there are giant crabs?
