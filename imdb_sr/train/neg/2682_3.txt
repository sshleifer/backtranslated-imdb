I was glad to watch this movie for a long time after I saw "Back in Paradise", which I found to be big. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing about this was an unpredictable ending that I think was partially stolen from "Return to Heaven". Perhaps I had too much anticipated. On the positive side, Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Although I did not like Dan's character, I was the first and very boring. I could not see anything real about the movie. It could have been much better, for example, there could be more emphasis on prison conditions and on pure horror. He was too cheerful to be realistic. There can be more action and tension The best thing about this movie is the "tragic" end. I could not have predicted that. But until that moment I really did not care what happened to them. 3/10
