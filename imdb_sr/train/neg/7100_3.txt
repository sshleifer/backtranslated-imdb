This film promises to start, then becomes confused and confused. Kamal Hasan has made a lot of effort to achieve the appearance of the period, the damage that he did not spend more time on the plot. Most of the small characters in the movie appear for no special reason. All in all, very disappointing, I recommend that you avoid this film.
