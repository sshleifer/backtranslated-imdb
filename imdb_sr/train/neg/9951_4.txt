Johnny and Jeremy are some kind of vampires. Minus ankle, of course. They are dark, bitter creatures that have nothing better than spreading their misery. Through their charms (namely, the sharp tongue and the thick wallet), the desperate souls are seduced, who continue to torture and victimize. It's more or less the basis of this black comedy, as far as I understand it. It's not a blend of black humor to which I can easily subscribe, partly because I do not mind imagining a crowd-fighting crowd, the main character. I enjoyed, however, the sound and melody of quick (and supposedly very witty) remarks. I was very impressed with the powerful acting actors, especially David Thelis; only Jeremy's character seemed too two-dimensional. Photography and music, dramatic and dark, work very well together. What really rejects me about Naked (and the main reason why I would never recommend it to anyone) is the way he appears more often than a misogyny as a proper way to get excited. In other words, in a world that is so bad, what's the difference if it brings pain to women, right? To suggest (as some have on this site) that Johnny is not so unkind because he is not so rude towards girls as Jeremi, it seems absolutely absurd for me. Both are terrible, nasty people. And they are particularly interested in hurting women every time they get a chance. It might be said that Johnny eventually gets what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly turned and bite him in his ass. But his and Jeremy's sadistic behavior is treated to a certain extent as a ridiculous thing. I could be wrong, but I suppose that most people who absolutely love this movie also consider this aspect of the film to be darkly comical.
