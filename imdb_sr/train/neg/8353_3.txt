Beaudrai Demerille (Bad Petar Fonda, who also directed), a gambler who is old, wins young Vanda "Nevada" (beautiful, but not talented Brooke Shields) in poker. Together, an incredible couple (of course) is moving in search of Indian gold in the Grand Canyon. It's a story and there really is no need to seek deeper meaning in it. There simply is not. The acting is also very weak, which was a surprise given that Peter Fonda was at the helm. If you are looking for something interesting in this movie, look at the beautiful landscape. and some good looks of the young Brooke Shields. However, her character is so irritating (especially at the beginning) and stupid, that she is never quite sexy or attractive. It's a pity, but, considering the story, I doubt that something else could be done from this. I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and acted in this film. He must have even said that his father (Henri Fonda) was in a useless sting in this ridiculous confusion. Unfortunately, this was their only movie together. Could Henry not be at EASI RIDER, for example? 3/10
