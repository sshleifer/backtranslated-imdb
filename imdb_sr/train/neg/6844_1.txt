I have a copy of this on VHS, I think it would (television networks) play every year for the next twenty years. So let's not forget what's happened and let's not forget to repeat the same mistakes. It's like putting some people in a director's chair, where they do not belong. This film Rappin is like a vaudevillian musical, for those who do not know how to sing or act. This movie is funny how to try to teach the 'blind' to drive a city bus. John Hood, (Peebles) just got out of jail and moves back to the old quarter. Serving time for an all-for-evil crime of necessity, of course. John returns to the old street and is greeted by old girls and his peers as they dance and sing on the road. I would recommend this if I am sentimental, or if the truth is someone smoked a medical container prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma. In any case, it's poorly directed, scripted, acting, and even produced (I never thought I sat there) of the satire of life in the ghetto with 'Hood'. Although, I think that the redeeming part of the story, through the sequences of wells and dance numbers, his friends care about their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from demolition and cleansing. Forget the Sonny spoon, Mario could have won Oscars for this Rap. Oh well, if you want to laugh, and three quarters are embarrassed, watch first. And please, look responsibly. (No star, more luck next time!)
