I saw this movie, and I was shocked! Robert Carlile is not Hitler, he is a man who unfortunately tries to be Hitler. The film lies, it does not reflect the truth. On the scene, Hitler hit the guy with his pistol. Hitler never hit anyone, he did not hit fists, but fist soldiers. Understand ?? Another thing is: It is too obvious that Hitler was so evil that he was smarter than he is shown in this movie. No German would accept him as a leader, for he can see that he is evil. So, true Hitler did not show his evil side to people. Is any of you Yankee watching the movie "Der Untergang" or "The Davnfall"? This is a great movie, with incredible actors. And it's a German movie. I think that this topic of Nazi Germany should not be realized as a film of people who know nothing about Germany. People! Watch "Der Untergang": http: //vvv.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ It's a great movie about a very sad time period for human beings around the world .
