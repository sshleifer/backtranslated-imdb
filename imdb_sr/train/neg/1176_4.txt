Revolutions always represent opportunities for drama films, because, in fact, most of the revolutions are dramatic events in themselves. Unfortunately, what this film lacks in the drama is compensated by excessive boredom. Do not worry who wins, loses, dies or lives - just finish as soon as possible. This is to a large extent the result of what I consider to be a superficial use of back-up technology. The scenes in Paris and the French village have the quality of the cartons about them. It might be better to do it on the bare stage and leave it that way. The surprising effects of "Flying Duck Houses" or "Golden Compass" can not be expected, but this is, in the end, a digitally produced production of 2002. The characters appear to enter the scene for entering the scene, so the number of times when the character enters and leaves the room is lost. In my opinion, this film turns the French Revolution of the 1790s into the papier-mache revolution of the "papier colle" of the world.
