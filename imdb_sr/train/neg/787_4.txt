As an inspiring director, this film was exciting to watch with criticism in mind. Shot with a digital low-resolution camera, probably with a 35mm adapter for DOF. Editing is good behavior, sound effects are not too much at the top. I would give her 7 for an indie movie, but the story is not that interesting. It's more on the drama side, character development than horror flick. Frankly, this movie would be good if we were still in the 50s. This film is about a family that has a dry field, and that's exactly it.
