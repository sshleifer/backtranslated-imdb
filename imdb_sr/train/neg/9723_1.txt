Jeuk d'enfants or how the movie was wrongly translated into English Love me if Iou Dare is a film made of stupid people and stupid people. I simply do not know how I could expect something worthwhile to look from a film with such a complication. They are "cool dudes". I know that I have exaggerated some aspects, but that's what the entire film is about. They become older ... and instead of realizing that only a couple of alienated freaks continue to perform their crazy things, thinking they are excellent people. or France? It's even more insulting to watch a movie from a country that was created by Amelie a few years ago, which, of course, is trying to look at the film, but it's far, far from it. Avoid. Avoid.
