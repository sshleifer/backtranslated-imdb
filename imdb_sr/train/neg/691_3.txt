This probably does not fit into the bottom of the pins of the central Slasher movies, but it's certainly a damn bad movie. The vacation space made it interesting, but after the first scene, the film shows that there is a poor production value and a stupid complication. I mean, the sub-genre at this time was all about an invisible maniac who shook the teenagers without obvious reasons, but this one has gone too far. There is no absolute coherence in events or anything else to add. The cliches are more than boring, the blood is minimal, as is the mystery. It's a pretty central compartment that should not be overstated, even if it has a video tag tag. I'm sincerely disappointed with this overrated piece of garbage.
