this movie is really bad ....... I do not really think really bad. Toni Scott is a terrific director. of all the films he made only as an enemy of the state, in addition to being one of the worst directors of all time. What was most embarrassed by me was Richard Kelli (director of Donnie Darko) who made the scenario for this. now Richard Kelli is a genius in my eyes, but to be involved in this makes him hope he learned his lesson. story and look. do not misunderstand me, I still love Mickey Rourke, but he has made several cases in his time and this is one of them. I do not know what to say about Keira knight, I think it's a bit overrated. I can not feel it in movies. All in all, this movie is bad. That's it ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
