On the way to a small town located far from the trail (though it looks suspiciously close to the highway), a female reporter encounters a strange runner who agrees to help her lead to her destination. A strange man then tells a couple of horrible stories about the area: in the first story, an adulterous couple plans to kill a husband's wife, but in the end, the fate itself suffers far worse fate when attacked by zombies; in another story, a group of campers breaks off their vacation when the dead exiles demand that his grave be entered. Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garretta Clancy and director Bred Sikes. to make zombie themed anthology as a good idea, but with only two stories, it is quite short. And that's not the only way this low-budget movie fails to perform: the acting is bad (with Joe Haggerti, as story-teller Ebenezer Jackson, it gives one of the weirdest performances I've ever seen); locations are not inspired; the scenario is gloomy; there is a scene of sex with a naked nudity; and the end .... well, it's a beggar's belief. To be honest, some of Sikes's creative camera work is effective (although the technique used as characters passes through the woods little Joe Castro is thrilled: the ear is bitten, the eyeballs are removed, the face is removed , the brains are crushed, and there is a messy cut off of the head. These positive results make the film bearable, but warned, the Zombie Chronicles are not a walk in the park, even for experienced z-class garbage viewers. 2/10, but generously raise my rating to 3 because I did not manage to watch the movie in orist 3D (although I have a suspicious suspicion that an additional dimension would not make such a big difference).
