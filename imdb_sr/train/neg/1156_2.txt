Looking at the tenants was an interesting experience for me. It's the first film I've ever seen where I was moving at the speed of parts of the (non) action - and I can normally watch anything from sharp action movies to Serbian-Croatian Indians and find them fascinating. The tenants are frustratingly sluggish and too orchestrated. One of the main problems of the scenario is a little realistic character dialogue, except for the sets in which characters "collide" in a highly structured environment (this work would be needed to make the film more conceptual, which is not). This leads to a lack of real character development; everything looks two-dimensional. What's worse, this is Bill Spear, known as Snoop Dogg. His characterization was very uncomfortable and very unpredictable. At one point I even stopped the film because I so aggravated the aggressive, violent and monotonous delivery of the character, the lack of any other layer of personality other than that of the reactionary "he" switch (which is really predictable after a while) and I so desperately wanted to He has some redeeming qualities. However, one of the reasons for this jar could be the foggy frame of the film (apparently 70s, he feels and looks like earlier nousies). If he was safer in the seventies, his figure might have become more understandable. The lighting of the film was also inconvenient. The whole way, the soundtrack is trying to provide a certain atmosphere filled with jazz and which simply did not drop out, mostly because the set was too well lit. Stanari, for me, is an incredible movie. It does not portray real people or suggests any interesting ways of thinking about the race, identity or life of a writer, whether they are white or black. Strange, I came with the feeling that this project is needed by David Linch; his creepy, clastrofobic and obscure look and feeling would raise both the actors and the scenario to something quite unusual.
