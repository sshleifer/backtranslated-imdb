OK, if you are looking for another Bastketball log, this is a completely wrong movie. I turn around for two brothers. Mak, younger, has great cocaine addiction. Adam, the eldest, is a doctor. This film should show that reality is reduced to extreme falls that drugs make possible. However, it is not. This shows that cocaine can be fun regardless of the situation. Most of the film's focus is on Mak and its growth. In the end, Adam can no longer stand the stress out of his job and begins to use it (prescription drugs). This film almost no climax. It does not go down to what cocaine really does to you, it has boring and low-budget scenes, and acting by Adama's oldest brother is terrible. I have no idea how this movie managed to get through and receive awards, it's not a heart-venerable. If you want a clear and true movie about the extreme world of drugs - rent, if you do not buy 'Basketball Logs'. And notice the difference. Try to avoid this movie, but if you think you will enjoy it. Try and see for yourself ...
