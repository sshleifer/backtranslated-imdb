This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. However, little slaves, Alice and Jared Harris, imitate Christopher Valken is what makes this movie entertaining. Smoking, drinking and an unusual way to appear when her name is called is strange and interesting. I have to applaud Jared for his imitation of Christopher Valken, and Christopher Valken who allowed it to be in the movie.
