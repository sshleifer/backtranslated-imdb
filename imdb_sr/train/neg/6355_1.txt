I was barely waiting to see this movie. Halfway through the movie, I could not wait to finish it. All (white) actors were delivering their lines as Voody Allen just said, "Say it this way ..." Then they said that their lines on the screen seem to be trying to imitate Vudi Allen. It was so boring. We all know how Vill Ferrell really speaks, and he does not stumble over his words like Mr. Allen. The comedy of this film was as boring as the tragedy and definitely never fun or even fun. I must admit that I was never a great fan of Voody Allen, and this film definitely did not turn me around. I think his writing was as bad as his direction. This film will fall as one of the worst 10 films I've ever seen.
