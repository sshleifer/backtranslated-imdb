The naked body of Ursula Andress is one of those things that you believe in God. The other two women (especially the one who plays the maid) have large bodies. Why is it then a higher grade that can give a film with such a quality and amount of nudity only 3 out of 10? Because, in order to reach Ursula's incredible body, we have to sit through a movie that is otherwise inconvenient and boring (keep in mind that I watched the entire 101 minute version, not the 78-minute American version that probably cut many foreign material). In the typical Italian-comedy tradition, most characters are exaggerated cartoons (military freak, "Latin lover", constant drunk, naive maid) which is not funny, simply exaggerated. The last word: watch this, but keep your finger on the button for fast rewinding in advance, you will need it. (*)
