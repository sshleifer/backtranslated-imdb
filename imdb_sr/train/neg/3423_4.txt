This is typical soft sex sex of the 70s in the genre of Russ Meier, although perhaps less strange than some of Meier's works. This film has more 'production values' than many of its contemporaries, suggesting a larger budget. However, it is a complication, writing, and acting. Lately, this film has become the mainstay of B film channels (such as "Drive In Classics") in 500 channels of the universe. If the soft core is what you are in for, this is "good" as everything else in the B range. Do not expect Polanski, although Sarno is just Sarno. Nothing more. Performance Jennifer Velles as "mother" is perhaps the best actor. None of the actors in the film went to a greater glory, which is not surprising. The confession of a young American housewife is far from the worst example of this kind. You can watch if this is your type of movie. 30 years ago this would be avant-garde and riski film. You can see more or less the same kind of stuff on Shovtime / HBO series these days, in a striking time.
