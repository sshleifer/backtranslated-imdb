Well, I love up in this movie - it's really disturbing. Anyone who was at the dentist will know why. The story is not so bad, Corbin Bersen's character's motivation makes a lot more sense than in most horror films. This is still a bad horor movie. So it comes down to whether you enjoy such things or not. I tried to watch the sequel, but that's exactly the same as this movie. Just keep in mind if you enjoy torturing a dentist, then this is a movie for you!
