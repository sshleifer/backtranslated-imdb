I do not like to process excessively, nor to steal modern jargon "retellings," but this film really got me mad. The original Prom Night, although it was not my humble estimate, masterpiece, still understood what it was ... horror. There are some simple things to remember when shooting a horror movie. The commitment is essential to maintaining the interest of the audience. Sorry people, but the film with a white wrist was not! Fears were cheap and terribly hinted. (A good example of the intimidation that has now been done to level out the clichés, whether the cat jumped out of the closet, soon followed after, but now the unexpected appearance of the film's bad guy). so that I could expect to fulfill any other horror film convention. It should be a nice hero or heroin. This film does not exist. The person with whom I was the most identifiable was the main detective. His calm attitude, but the approach he led to the killer's exit was what should have more films of this type. General access to events that occur. (If you run from Ak who has a psycho, you turn and run in the opposite direction. Do not run while you look back for three seconds, you watch the progress of the killer, just to cross over every branch and non-living object on your path.) If a friend disappears, You're not going to ask for yourself. And if you suspect that you have broken someone, tell someone, and do not explore yourself. These clichés are tired and exaggerated. In a terrible genre in general, and especially in this film.
