What the viewers will remember most is the bad headache that the film gave them due to the overly colorful, trembling work on the camera and the fast, confusing cutting. I am not against such stylistic devices if they have been done as Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh evidence in most of their films, but in this case it was too much. It seems that the jumps and flashes that followed every year over Mexico and all the important scenes were there to discourage you from realizing that the story was pretty thin and that the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily understand how the whole thing will end. For a film that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt, it is inexcusable that the story is told so many times and with much more depth and character development. This is another disappointing aspect of the film. If I want to watch a film about top action, I do not need any excuses, but this film has tried to justify the murder of Denzel Washington and has missed a bad performance in any kind of convincing performances. In the first half an hour, nothing is happening except for the dumb archetypes and clich√©s, and when the action machine starts rolling so fast that it does not know what's really going on. So, the film does not work at the level of convincing drama / trilera, nor as a pure action movie. Of course, the film is not as bad as some of the totally freaking hits of recent years, but absolutely I can not understand why so many people claim that this movie is fresh and so cool. For a video clip it's too long and there's too little substance for the movie.
