This is almost certainly the worst western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common for westerns and martial arts movies - the hero finds out that the family / friends are killed, so the hero is keen to retaliate, upset the ineffective lawyer, save the kidnapped girl and kill the expert archbishop in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful - otherwise it would not be a formula - but Gunfighter is the most promising performance you'll ever see. The script is terribly simple and insulting; It sounds like a high school student wrote a dialogue because he lacked depth, maturity and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes looks like a name. Cinema is chromatic, and sets are sometimes only facades. The act is poor; Certainly, some of the performers could blame the script, but others can not use that excuse. I hope that I will never see Chris Libbert again in the speech role; every time he says a line that should be angry or evil, he does nothing more than lower his tone of voice, and he just sounds like a kid trying to act like a cat. Speaking of Chris Libbert, who plays Hopalong, look at his stupid ones (if you dare to watch this movie): He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roia Rogers than a busy cowboy. . If you enjoy a movie that only serves to worship the imaginative magnificence of Hopalong Cassidy, then take this, but if you have more than two neurons, look something else.
