Who? What? Where? When? Why? The acting was terrible. Very robotic, exercised. I've seen all the actors in this movie in better roles. The scenario was very elementary. By the end of this film, the story was tied. And Jeane Claude LaMarre should be tied. So he never tries to write / direct a second movie.
