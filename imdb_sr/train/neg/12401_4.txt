I am here in a very unfavorable position. I did not see the first two films in this series, although I saw many Larry Cohen films. Series fans believe this is a good movie. Judging by his own opinion, it was pretty boring. You will never look good on the face of a maniac cop (Robert Z'Dar), but what I saw was pretty gloomy. The scenes of death seem to have been designed to rip most of the movies, without delighting. Perhaps, if I saw the NC-17 Director's Cut, I was impressed. The end of car trips with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulani and Robert Davy was quite intense. the best part of the movie.
