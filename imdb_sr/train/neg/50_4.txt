Three "horror" movies with some guy in the house at home, advocating the viewer not to go "there" and (unfortunately) giving us three stories to prove why. The first story involves a young couple in a car accident that encounters two psychopaths. This leads to two completely foreseeable twists. However, it is fast (about 15 minutes), violent, well behaved and well done. Predictable or favorable. The second involves a man on the run after stealing large amounts of money. His car broke down, he was attacked by a dog and ran into a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, poorly done and extremely slow. Even in 30 minutes, this is too long. Good acting. The third is hardly a story of horrors. This includes a beautiful, lonely woman who is looking for Mr. Right. She has beautiful scenery, a beautiful erotic feeling and a beautiful sexual scene. But (again) predictable and not even scary. It ends very stupid. All in all, the first is worth watching, but that's it. Turn on it and turn it off.
