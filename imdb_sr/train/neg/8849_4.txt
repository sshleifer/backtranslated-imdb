This is a pretty bad movie. But it's not as bad as it suggests reputation. Production values ​​are not bad and there is an odd, effective scene. And there's a cheezoid veneer from the 80's, which means it's always fun. Beware of Jimmy Nail's short-sightedness - his American accent is so amazingly funny that it's fantastic. Sibil Danning's chests are fantastic - they appear briefly in the film, but the scene repeats countless times at the end of the loan in what can only be described as a 12-inch chest of drawers Sibil Danning. As a horror movie it's not scary, the effects are silly and Christopher Lee turns into a moonlight through his performance, I suppose he bought a new house and that he needed money for the deposit. Women - were so negligible that I almost forgot about all of them, and I watched this movie tonight, the insects are noticeably less impressive than in the original movie, actually bizarre, sometimes more like badly burnt monkeys. The European environment is quite good and the music provided by the new wave Babel, although quite terrible, at least gives the film a bit of added cheese. <br /> </ br>> All in all? Are you seriou sly you expect it to be? And, at the very least, you always have Sibil's blows.
