There is a word for this type of film, and this word is "meaningless." It was nasty when it was a VHS hire, and now it's been restarted on the satellite. It could cheat you because it has 2 moderately well-known names in Kistofferson and Henriksen, reasonable music with sound, and a beautiful landscape Monument Vallei. It also has some curly hair that is struggling a lot. If that's all you want from a movie, maybe this will keep you happy. Still, it's still lingering.
