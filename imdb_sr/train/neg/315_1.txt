Watching this stinker is a cruel and elusive punishment in Sandler's hands. A really slow and painful death. <br /> 'I bought a DVD at $ 5.88 in Val Mart. But the thought that reverberated in my head is: "How can I get my money back?" The most unbelievable thing in the movie is that the ship just does not heat! br /> Best constructive suggestion: Misteri Comedi Theater. You know that show on the SciFi channel where some guy and his muppet machines are undermining the most unusual horror film (Misteri Science Theater). NOW, separate the comedy program and turn on this movie. Without the good humor of this wreck of the train, I am afraid that the spectators may begin to follow Sandler with ice poles and motor testers. <br /> <br />
