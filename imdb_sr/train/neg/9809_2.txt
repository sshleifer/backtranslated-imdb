Some wonder why there were no longer any films of Mrs. Murphy after this. Will it be because this movie is totally blowing. Disney was not the real studio for launching this movie. MOST is Touchstone (well, they are owned by Disnei, but that would be more adults). The film is too small, because the series of books is not. Casting is wrong for characters. The characters do not even behave like in books. And why did Tucker change into a guy? He's a girl in damn books! Is it done to make the movie attract boys? Sheesh. And where is Pevter, gray cat? One of the funniest characters in the book is absent from this dirt. Rita Mae Brovn is a good writer, but she allowed Disnei to hit her work. An animated feature film, perhaps in the news of Don Blunt's artwork, would fit into the better film of Mrs. Murphy. All in all, I give this 2, because at least Disnei made a movie from underrated book series. But I wish it was better. In any case, I still have my books to entertain me.
