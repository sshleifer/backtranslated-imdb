He clearly discovers Hiju Nakata Ringu (Ring, 1998) and Hongurai Mizu no Soko Kara (Dark Water, 2002), with the notes of Ju-On (The Grudge, 2000), but terribly worse (green corpse with red eyes!?) a bad topic (I find it very difficult to find an image message). There were two moments in this film that shook me, both of which included an unexpected hand, and after Oodishon (another Miike Takashi, 1999), I watched him for hours, while all the films stole it. Of these, it was really scary, I can not watch this movie as anything but the sale of the Western popularity of large Japanese horror films. Two out of ten.
