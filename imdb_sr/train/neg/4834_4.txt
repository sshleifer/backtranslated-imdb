I enjoyed the film Kathryn Bigelow with great expectations after the endless hippie and 6 Oscars to which he was assigned. Unfortunately, this is not a good movie. The situation was certainly accurate and persuasive in all points, but in addition, the story simply came as incomplete and the direction of the film seemed uncertain and accidental. The actors have made a good effort, but for me I did not really get what the film was trying to be. It's not as atmospheric and appealing as Full Metal Jacket, not as epic as the Band of Brothers, not as an action packed up as ... well, anything. Certainly I can not understand why he is so nominated, nor why people "raise him" to these epic proportions. Keep in mind, given the caliber of movies in the last few years, I guess there is not a lot of choices.
