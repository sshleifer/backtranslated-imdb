Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett are the most incredible couple on the screen by John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. The direction Larry Peerce goes uncontrollably between the black farce and the Roman tragedy. Robert Klein certainly thinks it's the former, and his loneliness in a smaller role emphasizes the complete lack of balance and chemistry between players in the film. Normally, I do not like to allow myself to be so cautious, but The Bell Jar is one of my favorite books of all time, and to watch what they have done with it literally curses me.
