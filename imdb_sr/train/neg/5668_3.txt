First - there is absolutely no flirting in this movie - with Anthony or anyone else. These people do not flirt - they just do it. Your first endurance test is breaking through more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion. This would not be that bad - hell, I love violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer, but without the context to put it, it's repulsive. So you can go through torture and crime. Then we meet with Donna and the film turns into something in a different way - not better - just different: a picture of a road without a heart. There are loud comedy attempts thanks to cameos - widely written and wide gigs such as Judy Tenut and Mink Stole (and a few whores and drag kueens). Everyone deserves better. The photo is deliberately disoriented, so if you get a disease (or indeed any illness), this blow is not for you. Thinking about it, I'm not sure who this film is, except perhaps the gay and bisexual fans who love bad scenarios, badly recorded indi movies about themselves.
