The precondition for making such a film is the complete ignorance of Nietzche's work and personalities, psychoanalytic techniques and Viennese history. Take a well-known genius that you have not read, describe him as crazy, involve a crazy doctor to cure him, a couple of pretty women, play the role of an actor with huge mustaches, each character talks with the strongest accent, show funny dreams, include another prestigious personality which has nothing to do with the first one (Freud), mention a few words used in genius works, exaggerate with everything you can, especially music, and you're done. Audience, please stay away.
