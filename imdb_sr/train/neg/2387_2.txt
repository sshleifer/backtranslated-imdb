I could not believe how foolish and meaningless it was. Basically there is nothing to laugh in the movie, there are barely any scenes that would interest you for the rest of the movie. This film is drawn into some huge stars, but they are all lost in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves had several lessons for acting a few years after this film before he stared at Matrick. Uma Thurman looked very simple and modest. Fortunately, I got this film at a very low price, because it's certainly not a memory film for good reasons. I will not write anything about the story of the movie, but as you should know she should have been the most famous autostoper across America for her huge thumb. I would give this film 2/10. Before I watched this movie, I wondered why this film has only 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. Very disappointing movie. Do not buy it even if you see it in less than $ 5.
