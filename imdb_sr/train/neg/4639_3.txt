The Eyes of the Werewolf (1999) is a really bad movie. The premise was good, but the general execution was horrible. I wanted filmmakers to take their time with this project, rather than accelerating it to production. Some blind type gets new eyes, it's bad that they belong to the evil old inferno. Bad things start to happen to the guy as he turns into a creature that looks like a cheese. Can he find the medicine before his hot girl finds out? Who is this weird little troll who helps him and what about that cop? If you really want to find out, look at Eies of the Verevolf! It's not a bad idea for a movie. I wanted the filmmakers to spend a lot of time in pre-production before they decided to make a movie.
