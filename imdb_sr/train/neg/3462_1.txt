Slash flicks came a little later, so when I heard about Cut I had great hopes and heard good things about it. These good things I heard were wrong. This movie is bad and I think bad. It's just stupid. All about it. Especially the killer's origin and how it remains alive and how it is eventually handled. There is nothing original and extraordinary in this movie. Just another slasher who deals with the "Hip", "I'm Aware". Symbols of "film savvy". I'm sick of this shit. Somebody does something else, because the slash genre needs a new blood, literally.
