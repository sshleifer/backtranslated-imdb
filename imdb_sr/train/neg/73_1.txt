This must be the worst piece of rubbish I've seen for a while. Heath Ledger is a heartbeat? He seemed deformed. I wish I knew that he and Naomi Watts were in real life because I spent the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. Orlando Bloom is heartbreaker? With a sharp beard and a look at the deer in the head, I can not say that I agree. Rachel Griffiths was a common story, but Geoffrey Rush looked like you can not wait to get out of the set. Should I be sorry for bankruptcy and murderers? This is far from Butch Cassidy, which was actually a fun movie. This was banal, clich√© and boring. We remained only because we were convinced that it would be better. It's not. The last 10-15 minutes was unintentionally funny. Heath and his gang are at the frontier hotel, and women and children are dying for their presence. It's not funny. But it was ridiculous when they left the hotel with armor because everything we could imagine was the Black Knight of Monta Pithon and the Holy Grail. I was constantly waiting to say "I'll bite your leg!" We were screwing with laughter, as did several other distorted members of the audience. When we left, almost everyone talked about how much time is wasting this movie. Maybe I did not pay cash to see this disaster (ham), but it certainly was not free. It cost me 2 hours to never return.
