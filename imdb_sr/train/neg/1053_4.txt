Take a bizarre story of Cinderella. Terribly bad script, but Kathleen Turner turns into a pretty decent evil step-mother performance. Visually stunning in some parts, but that's all. The costumes for the period come from the Elizabeth era until the nineties. Fast forward until you see something interesting and save the full 90 minutes of the game. If you are really in the mood for the Cinderella story - I suggest "Once again: The Cinderella Story" or "Glass Slipper".
