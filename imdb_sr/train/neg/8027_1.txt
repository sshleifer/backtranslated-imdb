I watched this movie. To the end. And it really was not easy. It's so boring, badly played and in almost every detail stolen from "BLAIR VITCH PROJECT" you can not believe that manufacturers take this seriously. It's even harder to believe how this "product" made on VHS and DVD. So if you want to see a horror movie, just watch "Scream," but if you want to laugh out loud and fun, watching some children go through the woods screaming at each other and showing their incompetence, watching the dark area.
