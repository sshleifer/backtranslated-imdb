This is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eira I've seen. It is not certain that the script writer has ever read the Brontean book. George C Scott is ridiculous and messy like Rochester - when he's not just an ordinary old actor angry. Susannah York has the oldest hairstyle in the 1970s I've ever seen in a Victorian film. The characters barely speak to each other, so the rich joke that she enjoyed in the book disappears and is the basis of their deep intellectual and lasting love. The place is ridiculous. Please, download the Timothy Dalton version. It's so true to the book, as if the novel reads you aloud. Dalton is beautiful as Rochester. G. C. Scott is ridiculous.
