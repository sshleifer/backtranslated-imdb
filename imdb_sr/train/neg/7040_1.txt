I just bought VHS on this movie for two dollars, Did I spend my money! Hey, digging Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Giligan's Island" Louise, but hello! This third production rate is a repetition of a dozen other biker films; crazy bunch of biker psychos are driving into the city, breaking everything and everything, and then they are defeated in a man by the heroes. Adam West looks like a hero, but he lacks a cloak and his Batman's uniform. Sorry, it's not the same. Тина Л. It looks really nervous and scared the whole show, but at least we know what happened to "Ginger" once it was saved from the island ... LOL! Bikers are a diverse group, and the famous ones have always been repeated or at least not needed. Hell Riders is hell for watching!
