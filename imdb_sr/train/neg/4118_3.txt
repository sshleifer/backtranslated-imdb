While surfing the channel, we found this film with its promising synopsis. We were amazed by the acting and formal story. We found fun scenes of car explosion, incredible shots and kits that collapse with the weight of triple and cardboard. What was even more hilarious was the sight of all recycled scenes from the Dante's top, where the front of the church descends to the school bus, the front of the shops are separated from the main street, the overpass collapses, and the red truck speeds down the street while the bricks fall to him. It was a good laugh, though unintentional, and left the viewer to wonder if it was originally conceived as a low-budget subversion of disaster films.
