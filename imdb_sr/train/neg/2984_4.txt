I admit that most of this film was uninspired, but I was still having fun. It has a wonderful feeling of frenetic energy, above average music, and women in the film are fiercely defended, there is no prissi. I can imagine dozens of other films that were much worse, at least this had an intriguing drawing line along with some social comments. Also, how dangerous is the law of war, because democracy ceases to exist. It seemed that Fulci was trying to combine his earlier works (zombie, further, the gate of hell) in an effort to improve in some way. He failed, but definitely not poor, as if a certain number of people wanted to think. for zombie movies, so I admit I'm a little biased when it comes to their review. All I say is that this movie is good for a while, if there was not so much rape in the making of this movie. (fulci kuit and bruno (I can hack with the best of them) Mattei took over) could be much better and more focused. It will remain in my collection as a fulci zombie swan song. It is a surprising note that there is a scene in zombie 3 that the grave man really broke, I could not believe it myself, check it and you will be surprised.
