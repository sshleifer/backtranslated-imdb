"A young woman suffers from the misconception that the inferno, based on the family legend of the accusation, is accused and murdered because it was allegedly one. Because of her past behavior by men, she travels in the village by seducing and killing the men she encounters Falling in love with a good man, her life seems to turn for better when she was raped, and her lover killed a group of bandits who regained these last events, the woman returns to violent ways and seeks revenge on the perpetrators, "according to the synopsis of the DVD sleeve. "La Mancha" La Rue Di Silvestre begins with a full frontal, cramping, groaning dancing blonde Anne Borel, who (as Daniella Neseri) mistakenly believes she is a wasp. The hottest part is when the camera catches the background fire between her legs. Opening the "flashback" reveals that her hairy ancestor (probably) was a lycanthropic creature. Mrs. Borel, unfortunately, is not a waswolf; She's just a very crazy fool. As a film, "Wolverine's Wife" (in English) would be better if Borel's character really was a female inferno; with her sexual victimization great characterization. But as far as the 1970s skin and blood movements are concerned, this is hard to beat. Bounlie Borel is either naked or sexually dressed in the entire film, which contains a fair amount of free bleeds. Dagmar Lassander (like Elena) and Howard Ros (as Luca) are good players.
