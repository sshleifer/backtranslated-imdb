Do I make a mistake, or is the 2007 version of the rip-off only? I have to ask because the DVD I just bought one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... bad acting, bad editing, and so on. the money that buys this shit. It's nothing more than a light pornographic movie ... there's no real blood, no scary pictures, just a cheap piece of garbage. If someone wants to see a great movie without actors with a name, a little servile up and a decent story ... bring Babi Blood ... also to a cheap budget, but well made ... and a real story! losing money, but I'll keep it just for laughter .... it's pathetic! New comment .... Sept 3 ..... I will save this movie forever just because SOOOOO is bad is almost good .... in a really bad way .... the worst action ever ... a real classic movie!
