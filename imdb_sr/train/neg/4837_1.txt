I went to see this movie just to see what it was about, and I was disappointed and surprised that today I received 6 (?) Oscars and 7.9 IMDb ratings. Kathryn Bigelow should be the happiest director who has ever won the best picture and best director Oscar for this kind of really bad movie and wondering why? Was the totally unrealistic 'cowboy' story of bomb disposal meant something to someone I did not see? Why I was constantly receiving a mental picture that this film was a remake of an old, bad western cowboy film that earned the "brave acts" infected with the "evil" red Indians in the wild westwest; but only that this time was set in a different background? Did he receive the Oscars because the director was former James Cameron, and made it a nice story for losers on daily TV shows? Or it was some imperial clothing syndrome - where most people realized it was garbage, but that simply could not be said, because others did not say it out loud? And finally, what was that sniper scene that showed the shell of the shell descends into super-high-resolution, as if it was transmitting a 'deep message' or something like that? Something in the ranks of 'EOD guys suddenly become good snipers and will always get dirty terrorists'? Did I just feel like there were plenty of pieces and pieces in a movie that was compressed for no reason? And for that you can get sketches for editing and directing. If you have not seen it yet, do not spend money on the cards. Wait till they show him on TV for several years. You will not miss much.
