I think I watched this movie, but I'm not quoted, because I may have fallen asleep while watching because it's not really "caught my excitement and imagination." At least I know that I watched a lot of things to know that I will not be watching him again soon. Or ever. God, talk about the poor ... Really chrome. Totally lame. I would not like a six-year-old. Basically, he did not have any dramatic influence. Zilch. Hope. Only Shlock turned into a duck. Comedy? That should have been a comedy? Can I cheat-ee-ee ...! Now, if aliens were insuperable carnivores like in the movie "Critters", we could have human characters do something a little deeper. but to be too complacent ... like shouting and screaming and running for your lives so they would not be eaten, so the story could be something more exciting than looking at dry colors. Do not try to watch this. It's not worth the effort. You can find something more interesting. Like looking dry. Or fall asleep.
