I was interested in seeing this move thinking that this may be a rough diamond, but the only thing I found was bad writing, horrible directing (the sequences of recording do not run) although the director could say that this is going to, looks very uninspired and immature) editing could be done by anyone with 2 VCRs, and the inventory was low budget. I would say that it was nothing as simple as a mini digital video. There are some simple ways to arrange a movie with what the director has, such as editing, etc. But it's obvious he does not care. There is so much effort invested in this movie as sandwich with ham. It might be better, but that would mean an extra job.
