After being pleasantly surprised by the performance of Sandra Bullock in Miss Congeniality, I decided to put the number-killer in. While they are decent in stupid, self-supporting roles, Mrs. Bullock's performance in "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed ​​2, 28 Dais) leaves much to be desired. At the same time, her character is omniscient, confused and sexually unapproved (the sub-store of Sandrine's past comes as an unnecessary filler that makes little to develop his already shallow character). Two teenagers had decent performances, although their forensic expertise and attitude to "catch me-if-can" disrupted the stupid mistakes that scream "We did it!" Chris Penn, who is quite obvious to the suspect, is lost here as well as the symbol of Ben Chaplin's partner and love interest. *** Spoilers Ahead *** Medium acting aside, the biggest flaws can be in the traces of TV-of-the week you've never completely bought the motive of killing, and as mentioned, nonsense (vomiting a rare food on the scene of murder, too convenient and framing) of the school janitor, two boys who come out in public together, a suitable interest in friction, etc. etc. cause the view to shift from intrigue to boredom and disappointed killers. The ending was strictly "Bi the Numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the film. Using the current tactics of almost showing the climatic scene at the beginning of the film, and then filling the audience in the way we arrived at that moment, the final scene is not surprising to anyone and they do not have one so-called. to come to his conclusion. Somewhat promising concept, but poorly executed and weak in almost every way. * from the ****.
