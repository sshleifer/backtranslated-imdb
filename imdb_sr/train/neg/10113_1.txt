I discovered that this movie is rented on the basis of packaging. Zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary. then you get to the film and these are women with raccoon masks. zero special effects ... and even scenes of the fight you can see how they miss 2-legged shots. It is interesting that Lommel plays briefly in the movie and is worse than other actors in the film. the only thing I can think of is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad movie that people call him "cult classic" ... however, I can not imagine anyone thinking that this is just one of the worst films made. The real horror in this movie is how bad it is. It's a shame I hired him and promised that I will never see another Lommel movie anymore!
