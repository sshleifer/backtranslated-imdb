I remember when THE GOLDEN CHILD came out in 1986, critics pushed him all the time, and I say so badly that I ended my career with Eddie Murphy, so I guess this movie has something to do with it. /> It started bad when Buddhist monks kneel before a child with empty expression on the face. Bad guys enter the temple Child sits with empty expression Bad boys shake monkeys Child sits with empty expression Bad boys pulling out a huge bird cage and stabbing a kid in there now sitting with ... Go to the shot? The impression is that even if he was taken to sleep at Michael Jackson's ranch with wonders, he would still give the same blank expression, this film would be better called WIND CHILD The title sequence starts as a film from the 1980s and a pop soundtrack feature is strong. Obviously this could have been cool and funky at the time, but now it seems very old in 2004. And not only that, it is completely crunching with something bloody opening. In fact, this is the main problem (and the boy is serious) with this movie - It seems that the whole mood changes so much from scene to scene that sometimes it looks like watching scenes from completely different films merged together. I personally blame the director, but it should be pointed out that the screenwriter and producer should share the same guilt. Did anyone know before the recording began, what kind of film would it be? It's part of fantasy, part of martial arts, part of buddy movie, part of the comedy and it's all shit
