The Thinner's action is extremely thin. And gross. An obese lawyer drives over a gypsy woman, and a gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose ... to the bone. Okay, the gypsy curse should be fun, but weight loss has failed? Nope. Except Stephen King thinks so. And Michael McDovell, the other author of the horror and screenwriter of this boundless movie, works so. The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible, but also fat, haha! Tania is like an immature piece of shit for a person who's wailing that she has never seen anything so disgusting with thickness. Hey, I can only say: Well, look in the mirror.
