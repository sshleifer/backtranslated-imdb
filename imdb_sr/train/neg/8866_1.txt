Theoretically, 'The commentary of the director' was supposed to work. Talented Rob Briden is starring Peter DeLane, a former television director who has reassured his experiences behind the camera. Among the programs allegedly worked on "Bonanza", "Flambards", "Duchess of Duke Street" and "The Bounder". His comments are not at all informative, due to his habit of wandering around the points. But in practice, it's gone. It's a show with a single scarf, and the joke is not particularly funny. Scenarios are completely lacking in mind, and Briden fails to convince himself as an old man. Whenever he gets stuck for anything fun to say, which is like every five seconds, he provokes a laughing laugh. Instead of being entertained by DeLane, you want to shoot him. If your old seniors look hilarious, then it's for you. . To make the joke work, they should be really terrible, such as Charlie's Angels, OTT, Telli Addicts, Neighbors, and New Faces. time, so, fortunately, we are spared the horror of future releases. Would not it be tastefully ironic if the 'Commentary of the Director' would have been the subject of a hoax?
