My girlfriend and I went to watch this movie as the "Premiere Surprise" we bought at the film review ticket before it opened in Denmark. We sat in an hour or two and then we left! The meaning of the film was simply showing the era (and club 54), but this was done at the expense of character development, which was not there, and the complication in which there was little. <br /> <br> I rarely have been so indifferent to the characters in the movie! Still, music was good. So if you want to hear some good music and fix this mood of the 70s, I guess it's okay. But do not expect to get a plot of convincing characters. <br /> <br />
