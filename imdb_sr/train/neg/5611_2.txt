Personally, I thought this film was horrible, first it was not objective and it provided one side of the debate. The only people who were portrayed as a party saying that he existed was a crowd of people who came from Billy Graham Revival. Secondly, this significantly deviated from its supposed theme whether Jesus (Yeshua) existed, that he was talking about how violent Christianity was and showing scenes from Mela Gibson's "Passion." In the end, the director translated his former director of the Conservative Private School into an interview, and tried to catch him in the trap of teaching children the faith. Oh, and also Techno Music just made the movie harder to watch.
