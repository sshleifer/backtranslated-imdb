The film was written for 10 years and the other director planned it with SRK and Aamiram in the lead roles. The film was finally made right now when Vipul Shah directed it, and Ajai and Salman acted together after decades HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM (1999) <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> However, the film is short due to the handling of the 90's and the worst is that it is a loophole Film tries to pack too many commercial ingredients, and we also Everything is predictable, filmy and too clich√©. There are loopholes in the law that Ajai is running from the London airport and makes himself a place without whom? Even the way his band starts out is not convincing The other half is getting better with a craft in the story of Ajai that destroys Salman, but unfortunately the climax of the fall and the film ends on a bad note. The Vipula Shah Directorate is common to the below-average. Music is the worst thing, most songs are central. Among the actors Ajai gives his best shot, although he is not convincing as a rock singer, but he behaves well as a negative role Salman irritates himself with his punches and talking nonsense he just impresses when drugged and on him Asin is nothing special only shov the piece Rawvii should keep MTV Om Puri is alright
