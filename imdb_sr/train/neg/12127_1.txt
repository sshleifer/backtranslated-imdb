I'm sorry Fulci fans, but I could not go through this one. The soundtrack was so boring as they came, the acting was childish, the story was done and done, and the direction did not exist. The Masakr was sincerely looking like a project for a children's movie. But I've seen some of them, and they actually look better than this! Apparently they were so insufficiently financed that they could not afford ... nothing! Not a CSR, nor a director, no one even knew what the acting is. It was a very bad cinematic experience; One of my worst. This was the worst shit I've seen, besides Terror Toons, which is the second of the Killer Clowns from the Universe. I have nothing else to say about it. It evaluates 0.1 / 10 of ... Fiend :.
