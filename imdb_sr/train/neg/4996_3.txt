I really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie, but, wow, whether it has become rough, or to say, "simply stupid". This is just another example of outdated humor. Maybe it was funny in 1940, but not now .... not even close. Dick Povell is always interesting to watch. I especially liked it when it began to change from its boyish appearance and high voice from the musical of Busby Berkeley, to the place where it sounded and sounded. Only actors were acting from the actors, worst was the boss (Raimond Valburn) from Makford House Coffee Compani, who was screaming all of the time. He was brutal to hear and was very harmful to the movie.
