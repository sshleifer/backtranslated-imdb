The female leadership was a horrible actress who made the whole film central. She smiled too much when she first went in front of the camera to talk about her daughter. It was supposed to indicate to the police that it was a suspicion. I'd be impatient in the same situation. She looked calm for her mother who could not find her daughter. Like he does not want to be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would play a better role. And it would make a lot more money for such a controversial, important topic. Everyone else was excellent. I do not know where the main actress is, but I hope she got some lessons.
