If you do this through introductory credits, this can be your type of film. From the picture in the first picture of a woman holding her hands to a person with white sheets bleating in the background, she recalls pretentional advertisements for perfumes. It's all down the road. The main actress is basically a block of wood that uses its computer to penetrate into the past and reconstructed memories of photos, in order to speak of the genius that has crossed history, Adi, who imagined the First Computer Language in 1800s. Low-budget graphics would be forgiven if they were interesting, or even somewhat integral in the script. Poor Tilda Swinton is lost.
