This film lasted for two and a quarter hours. Somebody tell me what the point is? I mean, I understand the historical environment. It should be a Confederate Confederation Group (Terrorists?) On the Missouri-Kansas border, refreshing against all Northern sympathizers and abolitionists during the Civil War in the United States. But in addition to free violence, there was not much sense in this movie. Maybe it was a political statement? This war is actually no more than free violence? If that's true, then it's done pretty well, but I do not think that was the point. I think the producers really thought they were making a valuable movie here, but as far as I was concerned, there was a complete lack of any conspiracy. It looked like I was looking at a novel from soft covers, with figures that look like what you see on the covers of such novels. This film should burn together with some cities of this gang. torched!
