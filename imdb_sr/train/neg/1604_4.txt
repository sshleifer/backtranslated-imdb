Do you remember the movie that you enjoyed in the past that does not meet these same feelings as an adult? It came to my mind when I returned to school. The film has a perfect chance to laugh but surprisingly wanders wildly as we see a bizarre collection of characters like a woman who sold her soul to a devil and can fire a flame of fire from her mouth, a man who looks like a vampire, and a crazy killer dressed up as a woman and wearing sacks over the head. You have a class president who believes that the best thing about cutting bread (but as we see in the movie, he's a coward and a joke), a pair of smokers who do not even know that they are in their class, and a man named Gary whom he knows someone He even knew that he exists (and no one can remember his name .. this is a joke I enjoyed). There is a full-time pervert that likes to seize women in inappropriate places, the deaf and blind woman screaming when she calls her dog and chef (you know her from "goonies" and "Throv Mama from the Train") who loves to put food on the plate of people! The film is essentially a lunatic who (or at least tried) to revenge his colleagues for having withdrawn him (they agreed to sleep with his twin sister!). The film follows the characters as they search for the dark, drawn corridors of the old high school. He was told about his killer by his psychologist who seems a bit strange. The film has several good working edges (pretty early), but the film slowly deteriorates every minute. The real problem of the movie is that it really does not know where to go. The film is largely a presumption for a joke, because it has a smooth direction ... if it really has any direction. The actors are sufficiently enthusiastic, but the material to be made is ridiculously lacking in quality that could hold any interest. It's a curiosity for lovers of comedies from the early 80's that are forgotten (rightfully).
