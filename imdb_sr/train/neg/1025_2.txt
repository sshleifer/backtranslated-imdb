That's the only question I have left. Why did this film so long come out when it had such a great role? Why was writing so bad, left the audience totally unconnected with the characters? Why it did not make any sense at all? Why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and "Hollivood", to the devil, when everything was supposed to be good, a smart talk story? Why? I never understand why movies that start turning well into a bunch of crap until the moment they are released. I hope for Freeman and Spacey, who is Oscar VINNERS, that it will never be published on large screens in America. quite funny. I just ... I think the script had the potential, but the execution turned it into clich√©s, and that was terrible. Only. Not.
