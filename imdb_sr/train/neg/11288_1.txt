Lately I have been subjected to this film and "King Arthur" on DVDs that others chose for the evening "fun" and together they have achieved nothing more than to express the growing idea that the modern audience watching the film has no discrimination whatsoever and is pleased as long as they get the "action". Both films were total nonsense. What happened to the development of the character? What happened to meaningful dialogue? What happened to ACTING? And, when looking at something that vaguely claims to be "historical", whatever happens with an attempt to record some measure of precision, let a realistic idea of ​​the "political map" of that time, even some mild taste of that era, especially in his social attitudes. Why should everyone present a set of values ​​for America in the 21st century? I read on the notice boards that it was "little known" about the dark ages. Not like that. Significant amounts are known, with many learned scholarships about the era, but these jokers simply did not find it difficult to do any homework. Just want to be able to vote 0/10
