Jean Claude Van Damme is trying to save his career by continuing the continuation of the Universal Soldier. But did that film save him? I think he goes to hell, after he dies. In the first minute we see the interior of the building, where you can see the bad man of the movie. Terrible, huh? But not as scary as the act (details are next). Then, we see Van Damme with a black girl (I do not remember the name ... and it does not matter anyway), trying to escape from some men. Of course they are the new universal soldiers. More muscle, less brain (just like a movie). After a while, Van Damme is fighting Goldberg, but then the "mission" is interrupted. It was just a test (Is this film a test for our nerves?). It turned out that Van Damme is working for the government on a new Universal Soldier's project (Who saw the first movie might think it's the most na√Øve thing Van Dammes could do). But this is a continuation. And the "story" must appear. Ah, I forgot. He has a daughter. It is very important for the "story". Well, after about 20 minutes, a super computer is hearing a talk about closing and abandoning the project. Of course, the cube angers and activates all the soldiers to kill everything. Van Damme escapes from the facility OR the computer sends some soldiers to love him (Wants Van Damme as a soldier - because he is the best (really?)). And guess what, Goldberg is one of the hunters, who was always a silly sentence for the audience before he became adored. Funny? Yes, like the rest of the movie. After some "story", Van Damme is trying to save his daughter (his wife - reporter in the first movie). There is a final show where Van Damme fights against Bad Guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie (see for yourself. It's too funny to say). We will see that this film is a waste of time. So do not watch it. But if you do, keep six packages with you!
