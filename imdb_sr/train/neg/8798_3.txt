I love a movie that has at least the rest of the story. This does not happen in this movie. It's a series of vignettes without cohesion. There are scenes of a person who collects cans of pineapple. A woman with a blue wig never removes her sunglasses. This woman shoots other people at the beginning of the movie and we never find out why. It disappears after 30 minutes. There is another flamboyant woman who endlessly cleanses a man's apartment. There are endless scenes in the fast food community where Mamas & Papas 'California Dreaming' is greatly converting (I loved a song). The dialogue mainly deals with food (pineapple, salad of chefs and ordering drinks?). I suppose that most actors gained weight during this film because they consumed much faster food. In this film there is no passion because there is no story. This is supposedly a romantic - it's not such a thing. I'm just wondering why I did not hit Fast-Forward. I waited for something significant to happen? it's not. Perhaps this is the sole consolation for this movie - the scenes are so fast that they deceived you to assume that there will be a discovery for all this nonsense.
