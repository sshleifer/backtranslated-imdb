Basically, I found that Eden's curve was very poorly constructed, making it difficult to watch. However, there is something I must say about how the director caught something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of space and clothing. The philosophy of "returning to Earth" and the interest in sexual research and drugs that were not dramatically decadent, as shown in many later versions of the 70s, was true, as was "do not ask do not say" pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity composed from intellectuals from the east coast, except that I thought it was more likely than a school in New England, and not one in Virginia, where I think the "good boy" mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one. Another thing I appreciated and could relate to is that this is the time when homosexuality was not so closely related to tunic or drag coins and I appreciated some homosexual roles that are not associated with these terribly exaggerated images. I felt it was very unfortunate that "gay culture" took on certain standard forms of the 80s from Castro and Christopher Streets, which defined the movement and left out a huge number of gay men who were more muffled in their lifestyle. I appreciate the film mainly as a way to remember the natural way in which we have dealt with our sexuality and personal relationships without the "scene".
