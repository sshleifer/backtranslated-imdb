I sat through this movie tonight, forcing myself to hold on to it even though I did not care for either the character or what happened to them, because the two leading names, Gerard Philippe and Michele Morgan, were the main movie stars of their era and I wanted to see them in "something else," which was definitely there. They both gave good performances, but disgusting characters. Indeed, the whole film is about a tiny little town in Mexico inhabited almost equally distasteful characters (the doctor is, of course, the main exception). What Michele Morgan ever sees in Philippe to fall in love with him has never been explained. This is allegedly based on the work of Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could imagine is that, if Sartre's work is similar to this film, it must be the central attempt to imitate Camus's masterpiece, Kuga, who was pestilent in North Africa. A good acting or uninteresting movie.
