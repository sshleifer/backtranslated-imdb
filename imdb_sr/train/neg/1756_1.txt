At the back of the flames for years (so it was reported), this television gathering of the two favorite characters from the history of the sitcom began badly - and from there it went straight downhill. Marie Tyler Moore and her best friend, Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper), meet in New York after a long stumble and sidetrable life of others. What a new concept! But, sadly, nothing of a worthwhile conversation (let alone a film) has happened to none of them in the meantime. Instead, the script creates itself by throwing out an old clock of the device in a row (most of it has to do with older ties in the workplace), while completely missing the humorous and charming charm and sophistication that made it the original winner. Support is immediately forgotten, humor does not exist, and the chemistry that Moore and Harper once had together disappeared. Moore has allegedly stopped this project for years, awaiting the "real scenario" before he committed himself. If it was the one she considered "right", what, for God's sake, she refused? It's not the age of the characters (because the time inevitably goes), but the almost complete lack of imagination in combination with the obvious disrespect of the elements that made the series function. Sometimes it was intended as a pilot, but, apparently, failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors. Or, in that case, among the potential audience. Quick and mercifully forgotten, the film is a travesty and an insult to the classics.
