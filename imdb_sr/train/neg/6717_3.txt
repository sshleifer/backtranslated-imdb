This was terrible. The story was everywhere and I was often confused about the terrible editing. I did not feel sympathy for anyone because their characters were not sufficiently developed. They were extremely superficial people without dimensions. Sirens, bullshit stereotypes with subgroups that did not go anywhere. The stripper was just a distraction, even if she was decent. I do not know what that was trying to be, but how shocked I was when they showed this garbage on Sundance? I almost canceled my subscription. I would think that a channel similarly would display better films. There are many, much better films about gay and lesbian topics. "The Celluloid Closet" is a great documentary. I enjoyed the "Vigstock: The Movie". I'm sure there are others who have thrown my mind at this point, but what I'm trying to say is that it just was not worth it. If you catch him on TV, okay, otherwise do not bother. There were perhaps three or four shots that looked very nice (they could sadly count them on one side), otherwise the recording was pretty fuckin 'good. Lighting was in many places. I think that some of the effects were used to try to add something that was practically nothing to do with it. I can not deny that Johnny Rebel is pretty hot (no blue hair of course). Too bad his behavior did nothing for me. Hold on to real pornography, buddy. 3/10.
