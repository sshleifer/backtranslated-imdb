It seems that the United States is leading the British police that is all around armed to the tooth and did you know that policemen are turned into a uniform when they stop working and go to the pub! This must be one of the most unhealthy films with the worst depiction of the "real" British police that has ever been exposed to a suspicious audience. I see that Mr. Snipes may have to pay money back his tax return, but what a good actor, such as Charles Dance Radio, is in this is a mystery. B "movie from the 50's. An hour and a half of suicides and times that I will never return. Avoid it as a real plague.
