I had great hopes for this film, because there are Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But these hopes collapsed to the ground in the first 20 minutes. Palance was ridiculous. Even Heston's acting or beauty Annabel Schofield (or short nudity) could not preserve this film. Some of the space effects were pretty good, but others were cheesy. The action was ridiculous. Even sci-fi fans should skip this one. Grade F
