Bo is Jane Parker, whose long lost anthropologist father (Richard Harris, in the worst case of a very inconsistent career) in Africa studied something or other. Follow him (how?) And tells her stories of the natives of the giant monster whose nightwatch can be heard in the jungle. It turned out that he himself is the Monkey Master (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the best film dialogue), who saves from bad guys and falls in love with it, leaving them enough time in this tedious two-hour clock to strip naked while an angry monkey watching and calling. I'm usually very open to different opinions about any movie, but this is the only exception. This is the worst movie ever made. If you do not agree, you have not seen him. (Notes: Nevsdai called it "unbearable", which is the best summary of a word I can imagine. The Maltin Movie Guide comments that they almost had to think of a rating lower than the BOMB.)
