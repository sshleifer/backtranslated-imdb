She gave "2" instead of "1" (scary), because it can not be denied that many visual images were stunning, many talents went into special effects and artwork. But that was not enough to save him. Sepia toned, washed paint somehow done many times before in other films. Nothing new. I see there were some tips for other old, classic movies. OK. No problem with that. But the movie must be fun and interesting, not something that will lead you to sleep. The story and scenario of this movie was horrible, characters are two-dimensional. It's moving slowly. Some of the scenes looked pretty nice, but in the end, as a whole, it was pretty boring, I could not recommend it.
