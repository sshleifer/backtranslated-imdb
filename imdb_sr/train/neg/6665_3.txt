All right, the story - a simple crazy lunatic gets into the life of a boring young man and her little brother and destroys their lives - it's mildly interesting. In any case, the ideas are nothing (everyone has some ...) - execution is all. This is what disturbed me with this shift. And that made me very upset. The rhythm (directing, editing) was slow, the pace was uneven and the peak was expected. We saw those frigging highways five, six, seven times - why? Problems with Norton's character are considered a children's play, not deep enough to understand his / her / his / her problems / problems and to fight for or against him. Is it a coward, a manipulator, or just crazy? References to "Taki Driver" were ridiculous and unnecessary and certainly not in favor of this film (or EA for that matter). AND IMHO, in the end it is cowardly performed. Cheap emotional tricks for teen lovers somewhere in Central America. This guy was supposed to kill a child, blame his father, create a real havoc. Or the kid should kill his father at the end, etc. But, no, we got a messy ending in which the children miss the crazy, the father is confused by his life and relationship with them, and the lunatic, of course, dies. Happy dysfunctional family remains unharmed, safe and happy again bored so we can enjoy our pop-corns, smoothly. It's long and hard to find something dumber than that! You do not record such a scene with a hidden camera and a hidden crew. The creators of this film probably thought it was a good idea, but that's more than boring. Again, if you are a 16-year-old girl somewhere in Kansas anywhere or anything else - where you dream about sex with a crazy man twice as much, OK, then you can enjoy this movie and its "message".
