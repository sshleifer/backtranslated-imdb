This film was terrible. All right, my favorite movie is 'The Vicker Man' (1973), so I was always prone to bias. The plot walks together, throwing out enough key elements of the original to make the term "remake" very suspicious. (He is not a virgin, but he is allergic to bees. VOV!) There are so many things that make no sense and that they are unexplained, which I fear that Mr. LaBute does not make a horror movie. (How do the two people we've clearly seen blown up in the car at the beginning of the living and good at the end of the movie?) Cage looks exhausted and confused, and his character is inclined to call "Rovan!" at the smallest noise. 'Climatic' originals are irritating because they appear as sticky, not as intelligent homage. For example, certain incidents portray the original (a girl who dropped out of the closet pretending to be dead when Voodward / Cage searches the island) and several rows of dialogues were dug out directly from the original script of Anthony Schaffers and included in it. I'm sure that others will provide a better and more detailed analysis of this, I really can not make any effort to write more about this film. He does not have any substance. Throw it on a bunch of rubbish with all the other treatments that condemned the good names of the movies on which they were "based" (in this case, very loose).
