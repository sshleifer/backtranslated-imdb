Kim Basinger starring Dell, an desperate housewife with a somewhat insulting wife who is in trouble while in the local shopping mall, doing some last minute Christmas shopping. After putting on a piece of paper a speed of soaked hatred and sticking paper into the windshield of a car that occupied two parking spaces, she learned that the owners of the Rainbow Coilition Corps are criminals who are white, Mexican, Chinese and black. They face it around the banknote, the helmet helmet cap, and the chase is on. During the movie, Della will go hunting a hunter while she opens her inner Bronson. I discovered that this is a little tense thriller. The acting was good enough (except for several scenes, "Why is God why" was a little decent in what is bad?) There was a resignation because of the fact that Della villains are caught up with / after stupid stupid minds. If they did not have the intellect of any "domestic" villain, their possible defeat might have been something they could enjoy instead of the reaction. The incredible factor that I am willing to overlook, as well as the director and one of the producers, took part in bringing "Shoot em up" to the screen (a film that, at the same time, casting credibility out of the window, was extremely funny). This film, which never reached the height of this film, was good in its rights.
