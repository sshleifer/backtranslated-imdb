I got a copy of this film thinking it was a 1964 movie with 'Zombie Bloodbath' as ​​one of the alternative titles. Perverted, this film actually has a better rating on this site than the title; which can mean that the other is really bad! And this film is pretty bad; Obviously you can not enter a movie that calls yourself 'Zombie Bloodbath' and expect you to see a masterpiece, and honestly, it fills the title with the amount of the above shown ... but everything feels very old and tired, which does not help the fierce acting and stupid line of complications. It's just an average outburst of nuclear material that causes people to turn into zombies, etc. The film starts with a sequence that looks at people melting and tells you pretty much about what's going on; zombie waste of low quality. The film has a lot worse, and that's a really good job, otherwise the movie would be really boring. Zombie Bloodbath looks too cheap, and it was made out by inexperienced filmmakers! It seemed that the main influence was Romer's superior Day of the Dead, although this could indeed be all that has zombies and upstairs. It all comes down to a typically predictable and pointless ending and I can not say I was impressed with it!
