A group of extremely unfriendly A-holes torments the bad-faced puppets that some senior night watchman kept in the movie archive for twenty years without any reason. Many people know this film only on the MST3K's spot-on film debut. But I've seen a real movie and I can say with certainty that it's bad, really, really bad. From one of the most terrible "fighting" scenes I've ever seen that plush toys are 'aliens' suffering from lack of movement (I had a Mi Pet Monster that was terrible) all the way to a terrible acting (I had a My Pet Monster that was charismatic) However, what the "Vice Academics" Rick Sloan said are somehow, and believe me, I do not have earthly ideas, much worse. This does not mean that this film is nothing but shit, because it is not. Just throw it there. Eie Candi: No nudity in the film, but there are two pairs of sucking in DVD Introduction to the film My Rating: D- Retromedia DVD Ektras: Introduction Jim Vinorski; Stills galleries; and Trailer for this movie
