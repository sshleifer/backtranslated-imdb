Polyester was the first John Water movie I saw, and I have to say that it was the "worst" movie I've ever seen before. for which I'm sure he worked for food, and were ready to say how Waters wrote. Every thing about the movie is terrible, acting, camera, editing, and the story of a woman who played a 300-pound divine divine was absolutely absurd. Very funny, and you will not believe the shit that happens to poor Francine. Her son catches the solvent and treads the female legs that do not suspect the shop. Her daughter is the worst slut in town. Her husband is a cocoon of pornography that does everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate the poor Francine. Francine's only friend is Edith Massey, perhaps the worst actress ever. Edith looks and sounds like reading lines from the card and she never saw the scenario before shooting. Despite all of Francine's troubles, Vaters cooks a fantastic Hollywood end and everyone (who survives) lives happily ever after.
