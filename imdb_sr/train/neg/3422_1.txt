Oh, dear. I started watching this without knowing what to expect. I could not believe what I saw. There were times when I thought it was a comedy. I liked the government's plan to capture a terrorist leader to drop an unarmed man, and he expects him to capture him and escape with the missile package. If only it was really so easy. I finally found a movie worse than Plan 9 from the Universe.
