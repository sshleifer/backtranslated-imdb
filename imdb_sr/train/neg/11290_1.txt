By far the worst film of all time. Even Iaphet Kotto could not save this party. I heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled "Treasure", but it was changed to "Sharks" Treasure to use the excitement created by "Javs". I think the sharks were in one scene of this film; The fact that they were involved in this "thriller" was to sell tickets. Failed. Whenever something "good" happens in the film, the crew of the ship tasters one another with a certain brand of beer that was just introduced at the time of the filming. Do you think a beer could be a sponsor? Could they be more obvious? The only time someone should get out of beer is to get through this thing. That's enough to celebrate.
