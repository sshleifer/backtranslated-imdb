It's just not enough here. There are some funny places, but not quite enough. I was very disappointed because I love dumb movies. I expected it to be a hidden jewel. IT WAS NOT. It was a hidden crowd. All the while I watched it, I thought, "God, I could better than that and I'm a jerk". I do not believe in a few good reviews. They were pulled in. At no time did I laugh loudly. Maybe it was funny or top-notch in 1987, but the man has fallen today. This film has promised, it simply failed. Maybe if you re-write it a few more times. I can not blame the actors. They were not the best, but they simply did not have much work to do. This film was not successful because of the writing out. SORELI disappointed.
