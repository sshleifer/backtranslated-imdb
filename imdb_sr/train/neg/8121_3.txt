Time is precious. This film is not. I have to learn to ignore critics who talk about small films like Fargo and this total loss of time. What a piece of shit! The hook of this film is a raised mobile black daughter who searches for and finds her white family of garbage. Play? The acting is great. Production (lighting, sets, assembling, sound) is about 2 steps above the story of 60 minutes. The characters are shallow and non-intelligent. I was convinced by the fact that these people could not understand each other which is obvious to the audience; the audience murmured on the screen what the characters should say next. I used to have a lot of fun doing the laundry.
