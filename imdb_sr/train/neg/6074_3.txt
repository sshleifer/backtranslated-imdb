What a bad movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro, and even Snipes, will be connected to something similar. If you want to make a movie that includes baseball and display baseball scenes, at least make the action a bit realistic. Why was the audience constantly standing up for no special reason during the games? *** POSSIBLE SPOILER *** And the last scene in the movie ... what was that? We somehow suggested that we believe that DeNiro found his way on the field in the judge's uniform, and that the game even played in a lush splash .... one of the worst ever in a sports movie. 3 stars from 10.
