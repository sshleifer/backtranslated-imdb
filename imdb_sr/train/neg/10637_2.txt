I'm sorry I bought this series. I expected more action, more objective images and more consistency. This is just a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm, or romance, it's all alone. I think the actors are pretty weak too. O'Donnell may seem charming like Robin (with Batman), but this picture lacks charm. Probably as long as he ages, he loses his childhood charm, but he does not get any charm grown up. It is not surprising that it has not been shown in many countries and is sold in the UK by 40% of the recommended price, and even in the Netherlands.
