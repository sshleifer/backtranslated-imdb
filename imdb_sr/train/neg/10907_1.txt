I expected a movie similar to Deuce Bigalov, which I enjoyed. However, this failure seemed to take forever. It is one of those movements that enjoy the sad placement of PG-13, and it is not suitable for the child. Jokes are not only low or jokes, they are rude, rude, and many works cross the borders not only of bad taste, but also beyond legal and moral jurisdiction. It seems that many scenes are chopped to get a PG-13 rating ... damage ... maybe it made a bigger showdown as an R-rated movie if it's funny. I do not recommend this movie. It's a total waste of time ... and I'm a movie lover and I'm ready to give anything. In 45 minutes, the movie looked like it should have dropped ... and the boy was ready for it. The ending is weird, but it does not save the rest of this swamp / tourist trap for rent. 1/2 star (I'm glad to see that as a freebie ... it would be painful to pay a hard-earned cash for this trips)
