I looked at it in the hope that I would find out something that I did not know about the most notorious man of modern history, and I could not think that history was rewritten in HITLER: HEARING THE DEATH. Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have one of his devotees. Hitler appeared with a pistol in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohma. Excuse me, I ask, but the writers did not confuse Adolf Hitler with Tony Montana from SCARFACE? That's bad enough, but what really offended me was that in this mini-series I missed the whole pieces of the historical context. Germany lost World War I and Allied forces made Germany pay a great price for it. It was this economic environment that led to the German people having somebody - anyone - to restore their pride and turned to Nazism. The German humiliation of the twentieth century caused by the allied forces appears to be completely lacking, so there is no way for HITLER: THE ESTABLISHMENT of the evil can be seriously understood as a historical document, and I did not even mention that Himmler and Gering were prone to their absence. > There's one positive point about the mini-series and it's Robert Carlile in the title role. Okay, some of his manners are wrong and his voice is a bit louder (archival recordings show that Hitler had a slight seductive voice), but Carlile is a charismatic actor and manages to pass on Hitler's charisma on the screen. Comments in the British press that Carlile looks more like Sparks's synthesizer than Adolf Hitler are unfounded and he gives one of the better interpretations of Hitler. I played Robert Carlyle's performance, but I hated everything else about this mini-series and wondered why it was made at all. He does not recommend anything to serious fans of history
