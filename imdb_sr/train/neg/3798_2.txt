And that's the only reason I own this DVD. Now I did not see the first Nemesis movie, but I checked the information from him and here I said: What? Why? Because in the first movie, Alek was male. But again, the first one is set in the future, so maybe this Alek is brand new and the scientist just made this time Alek a female. Who knows, at least he did not even mention in the film. Here's a brief summary of the actions: Alec, then another baby (or whatever you want, as it was, in the future) ran away with your mom using a special time container and ended up in Africa in the '80s. There, Mom was killed and Alec (Sue Price) grew up in the African tribe. Then the tribe gets slaughtered cyborg from the future, and then Alek runs and hides and finally kiborg kills. So that. It sounds familiar, is not it? Terminator is not the only film that has been torn up here, the Predator gets its share and I think the first Fli movie, Vincent Price one, becomes special. a nomination that gives a solid basis for building a cyborg head. Let's see what else? Okay, the movie was a pretty standard small budget, but it had bad special effects for a movie from the mid-1990s. It would look fine for the sound of the 80s. The biggest problem is the plot. Things are just happening and the viewer is barely interested. Nemesis 2 is not the happiest piece of the movie I had the pleasure (?) To watch, but it really comes close. I will not say anything about acting, for let's be honest here: Did anyone expect an Oscar worth performing here? Well, well ... at least I found Sue Price hot on this Amazonian warrior road. "True" Film Rating: 2/10 There are not many professionals in relation to all the quality. And despite the very basic scenario, the film makes little sense. Rating of the film about the camp: 4/10 I occasionally laughed from the pure malfunction of the film, so it has a little credit in it.
