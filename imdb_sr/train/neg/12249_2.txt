You, you know, I can take blood and sex, but that bikini bullet got me pretty upset. Someone brought that little girl a little paste before it's too late! And you know, it's just not a good idea is that the film about the shlock starts to remember a much better movie that is being discarded. I gave this grade 2, just because it is marginally better than Tobe Hooper's CROCODILE.
