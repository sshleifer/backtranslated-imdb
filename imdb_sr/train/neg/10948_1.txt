What did they think of "Canoe"? One of the most devastating films of all time. Every detail of this film, no matter how ridiculous it was. If I had to watch her put on those boots once again, I think I'd yell. If the purpose of this film is to show how life was Rosetta pathetic, then it was covered in the first fifteen minutes of the film, and then the loans were supposed to start. But no, we had to over and over again see countless superfluous scenes. The whole thing was filled with non-sympathetic characters. They deserved the misery that was Rosetta. And to think I missed "Tumbleveeds" to see this hyper-film of boredom. It was as if I were watching the grass growing, it was just more exciting.
