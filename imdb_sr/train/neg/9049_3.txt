Allegedly a "social comment" on racism and prison conditions in the rural South of the seventies, "The Nightmare" is full of bad Southern stereotypes, along with false accents. Not only would it be offensive to the sensitivity of most American southerners, but this clumsy work is just a thinly-concealed "baby in prison" movie - especially in its original version. However, acting is generally above average, and the late Chuck Connors, in particular, works well to watch viewers hate him - although it seems somewhat embarrassing in several scenes. The role of the late Robert Reid, who appears as a disgruntled warden, is also a change, and Tina Luiz (formerly Ginger of "Gilligan's Island") made a rather convincing Sadistic prison guard. My rating: D. <br /> <br />
