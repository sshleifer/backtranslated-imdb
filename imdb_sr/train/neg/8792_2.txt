This film is another example of the curse of East Asian film: two or more separate stories in one movie. Other reviewers have obviously picked up because there are several references to the "first part" and "the other part". How can you have any kind of character development or a deep complication when characters and stories are displayed so briefly? I enjoyed the first part until it stopped abruptly (not "finished", but stopped in what looked like the middle of a story) to replace it with a meaningless and completely incredible second part that seems to be focusing on the girl reorganizing and cleansing guys apartment (wow!) I'm looking forward to the day when Vong Kar Vai will get a decent scenario for work!
