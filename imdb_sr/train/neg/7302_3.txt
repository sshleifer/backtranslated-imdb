The first five minutes of this film showed the potential. After that, he went right out of something that might be decent in some kind of illegitimate comedy. The best part is that I could not stop thinking about Supertrooper thanks to Joey Kern. I recommend you watch this movie for the pure fact that you learn how to avoid filming. There are so many scenes in this movie that make us just stop and ask ourselves if the entire team and the team just stopped worrying at some point. What is most impressive to me in this movie is that I earned $ 22 million in cash and cost only $ 1.5 million. Congratulations to the Lion Gate for pulling it.
