Demer Daves is a wonderful director when it comes to Western and "broken arrows" in everyone's mind. As for melodramas, he should leave this to know people like Vincent Minelli, George Cukor or the fantastic Douglas Sirk. The scenario is so predictable that you will not be surprised when you look at such a lukeful, beautiful person. Natalie Vood is inspired by Fannie Hurst's "imitation of life" (see Stahl and Sirk), but who could believe that black Susan Kohner was more credible in "the imitation of life"), while Sinatra and Curtis gave stereotypical parts that they can not nothing to do with them: poor officer and rich handsome - and badges - sergeant. in which will Natalie fall in love? France is shown as a country of tolerance where interracial unions are warmly welcomed. At that time (around 1944) it was suspicious, it is still for narrow people that you can find here and everywhere.
