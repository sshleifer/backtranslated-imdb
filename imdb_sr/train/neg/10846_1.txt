Not from Kaligula, I thought to turn off the movie halfway ... but then with this, I only had 15 minutes when I considered it. Unfortunately, I managed to get through. Make sure you do not. It's not that Cradle of Fear is shocking or bloody or intimidating or scary or sexual. It's that it's not one of those things, but she desperately wants to be all of them. Instead, it's bored, cracked, usually, foreseeable and unusually badly performed (recorded on video, special effects of secondary schools, it does not make sense even for basic visual narrative, the dialogue is barely audible ... but it is not worth it to hear it). /> This film is proof of the argument that even direct distributors have to pull the line into the sand somewhere.
