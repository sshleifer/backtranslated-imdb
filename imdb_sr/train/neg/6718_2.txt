I wanted to watch a movie because of an article in the film magazine. The critic did not recommend it. The story is different and I'm sure it was a good movie that he was in the right hands. Directing and acting were horrible !! I had the feeling that I was watching a movie made from a bunch of amateurs. Although the film started promising, it got worse and worse. I think this is an unoriginal movie with clumsy characters. I still think it's worth watching because I have not seen movies showing gay porn. Do not keep high expectations, but you will be very disappointed. * from the *****
