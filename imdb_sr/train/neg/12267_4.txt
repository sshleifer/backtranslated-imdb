Speaking solely as a movie, I did not really like it. not because there was no FKS or because we had one cabin as a script for the entire movie, it was actually what prevented me from watching it. I did not like it because the acting was suspicious, its "friends" are all happy and then they are crazy, but you have no idea why; then they take on different roles, one is a believer, the other is an antagonist, but they never make a point! Also, the lighting was terrible and I only mentioned technical problems. In a few words, the movie could only have "okay, I'm leaving from here!" of some characters. as well as a lady who does not want to hear his version of the Bible. About the story itself, everyone is free to write about what they want, and the story is proof of some good writing and imagination. . I admit that the author of the book for this is, therefore, my 4/10. So, in the end, I hear the story of a man to believe or not, just do not spend all the time behaving like you believe and shocked by what he says, while at the same time moving around and real jokes as if you do not trust him. Coherence. Thanks for reading;)
