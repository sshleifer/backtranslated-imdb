This film did not earn the next few minutes I will spend criticizing it, but I know that many people, like me, rely on IMDb.com to help decide filming. Just for that, I'm writing this. Live Feed is an Asian version of The Incredible Torture Shov from 1976. .com / title / tt0077247 /. Torture, decay, murder, cannibalism ... surely, everything is here with the third class, the pathetic acting and the perverted failure of black comedy attempts. The film takes place in China, but everyone speaks English. There are many girls in the movie who are horrified by dog ​​worship in the market but are sexually excited about entering the porn salon. A girl who is repugnant to dirt in the restroom for a few moments later is still there with her boyfriend and her friends (as he even came there might be the only interesting thing in this whole movie.) The movie is absolutely horrible, even for B -Movie. Even if you download it for free, it would be an insult to your hard drive.
