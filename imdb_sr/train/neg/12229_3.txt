This film started well, I felt like watching an adult version of Seinfeld. I quickly started to examine the situations and actions of the main characters and did not find the answers to the question of why they are doing what they are doing. All the acting was great, but only a few scenes had short moments in which they were actually ridiculous. Dan Cortese was incredible. I loved him in this role. His agent should show the film agents. Watch the first few scenes, then find something better, otherwise you will be completely lost in this mess. I found this in the container in the videotape. It cost me two dollars and because of the rarity of this film I feel it was a good price.
