Anyone with a fairly good knowledge of German cinema will surely say that in the past, a number of films about a young girl with problems with their mother, as well as her friend, have been made. If such a movie is shown to people again, it would surely be an option if there is something new, fresh and amazing for today's challenging audience. This also applies to German film director Silke Enders as the main protagonist of her movie Kroko, who is harassed by her all around her, including mother and boyfriend. She is sufficiently embarrassed to face any punishment because she has tried all sorts of criminal activities, including Kroko was initially filmed on a DV to transfer it to a format of 35 mm later. His technical virtuosity does not interfere with our joy when we find out that Crook wanted to become a policeman because he thinks he is not an idea to become a hit. If someone brought a positive aspect of Silke Enders, maybe it was Crook's engagement with handicapped people as a result of the punishment. With Krok we learned that the punkers are too human with their own unique. joy and sorrow.
