I rarely moved to make such comments, but after spending most of the ranks I feel like I've really earned the right to say what I think about it! I did not really manage to get to the end, and it became one of half a dozen or more exit exits (about 1/3 of the audience) after a messy complication, sad dialogue and offensive characterization became too big. this film is all posing and there is no art. all style and without content. she is burdened with a terrible acting, a truly horrible script, indifferent cinema, and production values ​​at the student level. how it was funded, started and ended up for me a mystery. I bet a million pounds never go to the general public. True critics would tear him apart. really bad movie. shockingli bad. really a really poor effort And it's even without mentioning the free time of the fryer for the newborn-kitten. completely meaningless, quite lightly, poorly assembled; this film is a terrible disgrace to the British film.
