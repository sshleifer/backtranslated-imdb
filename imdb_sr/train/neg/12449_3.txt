Sondra Locke stinks in this film, but she was still a horrible actress. Unfortunately, she pulls everyone else (including Clint Eastwood's real-time boyfriend with him, but what Clint Eastwood meant when he agreed to act in this? It's an extremely poor story, basically no story or plot, add a bored, bad piece, Even from the normally good Eastwood, this movie is at the top of a bunch of natural sleep enhancers. Wow! Can the movie be even boring? I think looking at the color on dry or grass can be more fun.
