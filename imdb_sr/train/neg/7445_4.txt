An extremely boring drama in which acted very young Roddy McDowall, who trains a wild horse, Flikku titles, and is the only reason for watching the movie. Sprinkled with lush, stunning music and loaded with diamonds, this is one of those infinite films that bore you to the head. The subtitle 'Thunderhead, Son of Flicke', in which McDovall trains the next generation of nudes, is a bit better than the original, but the pace remains slow and the result continues to blur, although there are at least one or two scenes that do not cause anyone.
