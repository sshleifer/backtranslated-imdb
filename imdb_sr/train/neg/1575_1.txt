This movie is so bad it hurts. A car that drives 30 km / h when it needs to go 100 ... a lever that is jammed (in the Park!), A nurse who runs almost 2 hours with a mobile phone on her shoulder ... no moron can take this goddamn phone ? There is nothing credible about this shit. It would be a shame to see me in this kind of movie!
