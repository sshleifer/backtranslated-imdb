As a long-time superman fan of comics, through the series of the 1950s, the first two films by Chris Reeves and Lois & Clark, and finally Smallville, I really * did hope for something smart with "Superman Returns". Instead, Lek Luthor made another attempt to convert real estate, another triggered by the Superman-do-bear-kryptonite sequence, and internal inconsistencies: he could not stop falling in when he stuck with the 6 "kryptonite, but when Lois broke 3 ", left the rest in it, * can he lift the continent to space? Really, the only hero in the story was Lois's partner - I can not remember his name. He did all kinds of saving, heroic things with courage and skill - without superpower, without inviolability ... just a normal man. Why not Superman could fight Brainiacs or fight to save the universe from General Zoda instead of Lek's small schemes. Oh, I forgot ... they do it in Smallville. Yes ... I think I will stick to Smallville ... Probably should, too ...
