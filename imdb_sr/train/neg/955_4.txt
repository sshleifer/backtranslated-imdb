I do not think that any player in Hollywood history did not last as long as David Niven gave most of the bad films he had to carry with his incredible charm. He could have acted, he got an Oscar for it, but most of the materials he did was light as one layer of two layers of paper paper. It's a musical and most of all you will remember Vera-Ellen's dance. You will remember that they are in Scots costume while the movie was set up in Edinburgh during their festival. But if you can remember one song from it, you must have photographic memory. The operation is bright. Vera-Ellen is an American musical leader who apparently leaves the city of Edinburgh. It starts in the chorus and is late one day. She gets a ride from the driver of the King of Millionaire Greeting Cards. Everyone now assumes that it is the main grip of millionaires. Doors open as they have never been opened before. The millionaire is David Niven and he goes along with him and the various situations that have arisen by mistake. Cesar Romero has some good moments as a crazy producer of this musical. In the end, Happi Go Lovely is a light and harmless hair that David Niven has done so much and so tired.
