This film is AVESOME. I watched him the other day with my cousin Jai-Jai. He said it was OK, but I think it's RULEZZZ! I mean, it's so cool. Ted V. Mikel is so brave and smart. He shot the film exactly like those horrible Hollywood films, such as Matrix and STOP, or my mom will shoot. It could have been better. I love ninjas and pirates. And I love that big talon that a ridiculous man carries. I think he's the happiest guy from that pizza domino. Not only does this movie look really cool, like those movies that are out of focus my dad made since my birthday when I was 6 years old. at the end. It's genius that this network is wired to meet everything. I wish that Ted V. Mikels makes a sequel. But more foreigners are needed. And a pirate.
