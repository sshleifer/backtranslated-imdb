Is it a coincidence that Orca was created two years after Javas? Orka is not exactly "the jaw of the jaw", but it is obvious that she tried to profit from Javs's success. First, Orca is a bad movie in my opinion, it's not terrible, but definitely not good, at best average. killed by fishermen seeking revenge. I could not watch this movie anymore. The direction of this film is bad, and it looks like a director, a producer and a writer almost without talent compared to the jaws. are not at all cute. The effects were fine for his time, and the kits of killer whales looked pretty good. Violence is confusing, bloody and not recommended for more sensitive people. Music is exaggerated and very loud, dampening sound effects and sometimes irritating. I hated the way in which the whale killer intelligence was exaggerated (killer kits do not merge with only one partner as described in Orca). above reasons. Some people may even appreciate this film because of the concept of vengeance among animals and humans, so I will not hit this movie and I can understand why some people like it. My Rating: 3.5 / 10 (but for your concept maybe 5/10)
