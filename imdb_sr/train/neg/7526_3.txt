This is sweet from the B film of kung fu flicks. Bruce "vannabe" Lee plays Bruce Lee ... I think. Of course, let's show Bruce's quick footage and do his big plans, and if you find the right angle during a certain time of day during the winter solstice, it looks like Bruce. You are amazed at how filming is not very good, but some funny, deleted scenes from Enter the Dragon are thrown into a mix. According to the film, Bruce Lee was shot by an arrow while hanging from a helicopter. Of course, they think that Bruce Lee can pronounce it for an attempt to be Bruce, although his character should be Brus's brother (who for some reason still mimics Bruce's gestures and style of struggle - very poor). You see Bruce goes one at a time with a cowardly lion. The props department was stopped at Kai-Bee, you see. Bruce also finds nothing wrong with the savage man being beaten savagely. In the end, the director decided to "throw a flashback" on the scene that was just displayed 3 minutes ago! They must have thought that only single-celled organisms with attention deficit disorders could fully understand this film. <br /> <br />
