Deciding to buy movies of Billy Bob Tornton some time ago (based on a class of films like "Sling Blade", "Simple Plan" and "The Man Who Was not There"), it was inevitable that there would be a strange Turkish. What, however, I did not realize, it was that I could be one OVO bad. I'll give you an idea of ​​how incredibly bad this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: "Knock knock", "Who is there?" "A big stinking man - is YOU!". That people, it's really so bad. Billy Bob is only about two minutes in it (I suppose he needed a career in his career at the time), and the rest of the movie is sick. However, for some reason, although it is undeniably terrible, I do not hate it. This is probably because I have kept my anger for any high budget, garbage with special effects such as "Fast and Furious," not a "non-budget" movie like this one. 2/10.
