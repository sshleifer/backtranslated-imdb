After a long period in space, in search of the remains of the planet Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth. He misses Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who has married and has a son with Richard Wyatt (James Marsden). In the meantime, Lek Luthor (Kevin Spacei) is plotting an evil plan, using crystals that he stole from the Fortress of Solitude, to create a new country and sink the United States. Unforgettable Christopher Reeve, or TV shows such as Lois and Clark (and Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville", created a great expectation for the return of Superman in Brian Singer's version. Unfortunately, the terrible story is too long and boring, with many unnecessary parts, a lack of emotion and an overwhelming IMDb. In addition, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is somewhat embarrassingly funny. Twenty-two-year-old actress Kate Bosworth is wrongly invented, playing the role of a mature reporter and an experienced mother of a five-year-old boy. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Waelling, who plays Clark Kent's teenager in "Smallville". The character Parker Posei, Kitti Kovalski, is actually a silly cartoon. Last but not least, and despite being great Lek Luthor, Kevin Spacei has forty-five years, that is, older and older than the rest of the acting team. Banan's conclusion looks like a soap opera and is terrible. My voice is four. Title (Brazil): "Return of Superman"
