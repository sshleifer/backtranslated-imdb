I have to admit, there are several books with the appropriate films I read before watching a movie adaptation. Nineteen and Eighty Four are one of the rare cases. The book was great. It was intriguing and interesting prophecy. But the film was simply sucked. It's easily the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I did not exclude him after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the movie was half the task for two classes. It was dark and grotesque, but it did nothing to get the right atmosphere. The act was nothing above the average, and given the fact that there was not much to do, it was very disappointing. For example, the book did not give me the impression that Winston could not spit more than one style at a time. Boring, disturbing, and visually irresistible, the film completely destroyed the book. Wait a minute ... Is not the Briton?
