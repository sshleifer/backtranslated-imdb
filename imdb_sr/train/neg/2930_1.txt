I like British humor, I believe it is one of the best in the world. I like almost every British sitcom (okay ... maybe not Monthi Pithon, some jokes were great, but I did not understand some of them.) But this League of Gentlemen is just something good to get you sick. This show was good in some way; It helped me lose weight, because watching this piece of garbage seems to me that I'm not hungry anymore. This is actually just a disgusting, sick, and even funny TV show, and I wonder who's really laughing at these things. I watched him for about 10 minutes and turned it off. It was so disgusting, watching men dressed in a woman with yellow teeth and wetting around the car ... I mean ... what's so funny about it? That makes me vomit. No humor, just disturbing images and cheap, toilet laughs ... I do not know ... if you like these things ... go ahead ... watch ... but to be honest, people watch and enjoy. This must have some emotional problems. Garbage.
