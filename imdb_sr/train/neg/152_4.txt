You can consider several facts in the discussion as spoilers. I'm sorry, but Spielberg did not deserve to win an Oscar for this piece, and I think the Academy was right to vote. (Second Oscars for nominations for the best actors and such ... which I do not know. But it would be hard to justify, given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product.) The way Spielberg directs this is so fictitious, so intrusive. While watching this film, the difference that was made during the course of the film as an art, which I recorded, screamed at me: "The sentiment is sincere and sincere emotion. Sentimentality is a sweet and unreal, misguided look at life." This is super-sentimentality. When in real life two people begin to read aloud in syncronicity, as Celie and Shug Avery work when they are sitting on the bed and crossing Netty's letters they found? There are examples of this type of fraudulent behavior during the film: all the men who are pushing around Miss Millie cars and then jump into harmony like a flock of birds that leave when they go away; Harpo fell through the roofs of various buildings on which he worked (a cheap slapstick gag); a whole company of singers moving from Jook Joint to the chapel massively, as if magically delighted by singing chorus ... on and on. Nothing sounds true. I even wondered if Harpo's name was chosen intentionally, because that's the real name of his wife, Sofia, "Oprah", backwards. Spielberg is not above such "sweetness". It is not that Spielberg is incapable of honest action and emotion. Schindler's list was incredible, deeply touching for me, and I am very much admired by Saving Private Rian for his realism, even if the story is a little fictional.
