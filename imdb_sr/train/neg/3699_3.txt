We expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role, which will be a funny movie. This is not the case here. I once laughed loudly throughout the whole film, and that was not even during the final comedy (which is also expected to be the most entertaining). This is the one you can watch when it comes to TV, do not spend any other money.
