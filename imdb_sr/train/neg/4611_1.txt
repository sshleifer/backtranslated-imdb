I suppose that Jack's great empathic ability makes him a powerful performer, but empathy comes at a price as everything - when surrounded by a core, instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with it. He's a joke like a mafia man (also because he does not fit in, he's so extroverted) and he just avoids avoiding making a fool of himself in it. so she is tall and blue, because her acting ability is limited to what she does with her eyes when she opens them wide that she is convinced that sooooo is fucking sexy, and Anjelica Huston is absolutely the same (assigned interestingly) in everything, just like Robert Loggia. The film is a lame draft (and this will be the only mention of the cloth they call the script) of a gangster movie, and the actor who was probably only interested in coming afterwards faster (they certainly gathered the party elite in this). What, were they filmed for one day, because that would be the only explanation.
