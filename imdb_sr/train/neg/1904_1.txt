=== Smaller spoilers === I am, like many others, a great fan of Jerry Bruckheimer. So, when I saw all the nice posters hanging forward, and the trailer in front of MI: 2, expectations were rising. Production by Jerry Bruckheimer. Big cars. Nic Cage and fresh from Oscar-Angelina Jolie. What could go wrong? Much. The scenario is not even funny (which really is trying to be), nor exciting. You bet a black person who constantly makes racist jokes about himself and Vooh-haa !! Do you have a comedy? I do not think so. Excitement is completely out of picture. First of all (which is probably many times said) there are no nice characters and who cares who will be killed? If you can imagine that the psycho will kill Nic's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, the next thing you know is that Kip (brother) is again walking with Nic on the street. Is that excitement? Do not think. Then comes the best piece - a romance between Nic and Angelina. She looks bored because she has to say all these nonsense to the line Nic. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' "Do you see someone?" 'What went wrong?' Then there is only one more spark of hope: car jury. It is disappointing at the very least, because the trailer made it appear to be full of them, and there is only one. Extremely long, caught in an irritably hurried motion of the camera. I really had a problem with the action. So, is this an action movie? thriller? romantic comedy? - You do not have to decide, you just avoid this horrible mess. I'll give 3 out of 10 stars, and I feel like I'm generous.
