Cowboys can leave you a little pain in the saddle. Definitely not one of John's best films. Do not misunderstand me, with any John Vaine movement always has good places. And this has a fair share. But, above all, the image takes place slowly and simply does not fulfill the desire that could have been. Bruce Dern is doing an extraordinary job as a bad guy again. Roscoe Lee Brovn is another great spot in the film. The children in the movie were average, but they could have been better. This would be a good movie for the viewers of films aged from eight to fifteen. This would be a good family move to watch with your children. Just be aware, there are several scenes that you could look at before letting the youth see it. But most of the children I know watched the movie. Perhaps because they see children in their age, they are working all the grown-ups.
