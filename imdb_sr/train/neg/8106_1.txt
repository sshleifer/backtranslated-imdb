Seriously, why do American and Frisian actors pretend that the Czechs must speak perfectly English with a false Russian accent? I'm a man, so I enjoyed a free nudity - but a soft porn movie would have more than that, and at least I would not pretend to be artistic. All political statements in which is painfully didactic- Did the director hear about subtlety? The acting was also wooden and melodramatic, and the comic relief was never ridiculous. The characters were very shallow, and I could not identify with them at all. A little where I was laughing was when they cut the actors into archival footage of the demonstration in Prague - and they were black and white, and then the sepia to match the footage - just funny. I read many Kundera short stories (not unbearable lightness of existence), and there are good things about his style of writing (his themes are a great male fantasy) - and I have to say, the film did not convey any goodness to Kunderas style.
