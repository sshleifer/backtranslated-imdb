This is terribly bad and terribly embarrassing for Canadian. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the best in the world. The National Ballet is among the five largest companies in the world. BUT WE ARE KRVAVLJENI FILMOVI! This is not particularly bad. Especially typical and typically bad, recorded in two hotels and public parks with a thin stream, acting school and "gee vhiz ... let's see what this button on the camera is doing"? photos. If Michael Moriariti was so deliberately working on Jack Nicholson's imitation, could not at least be a good imitation of Jack Nicholson? And if the film was filmed in Vancouver, it is indeed one of the most beautiful cities in the world and a yacht development center (part of the "plot"), why in God's name we allow this endemic Canadian complex of inferiority to dictate that it is disguised in Seattle ??? Not only is I angry about this film, but it's embarrassing and embarrassing. The Australians are some great things. We produce pretentious friends. Gavd !!!!!
