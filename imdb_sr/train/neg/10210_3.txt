It's hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once did a magnificent and very funny Maitresse (1976), and now it seems that only "by numbers" is the Hollywood thriller. with a complicated TV movie. Bullock is Cass Maiveather, a passionate and independent criminal investigator specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is her reserved police partner, Sam Kennedy, and together they make an unpleasant duo. It's not good when two unbalanced college maladriates (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them into hunting wild goose - by planting very clever and wrong forensic evidence at the scene of the crime. and Chaplin failed to create any sparks, we also have to endure several boring, excessively melodramatic flashbacks that illustrate an important event in Kas's history. Then, of course, there are frequent recordings of the log cabin where there is no doubt that the OTT will end. Oooh ... the atmosphere. Watch any CSI episode. It is to this extent and far more exciting.
