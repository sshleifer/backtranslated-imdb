This apocalyptic zombie movie tries to be evil and shocking; but FEEDING THE MASSES is spreading like some of the zombies of rigid legs lurking in the streets. In Rhode Island, a zombie epidemic known as Virus Lazarus, was blasted by government newspapers and television stations. A few brave, but stupid souls on the news on Channel 5 feel that the audience is given a false hope and that there is no idea of ​​the real danger. Eager Reporter (Racheal Morris) and her cameraman (Villiam Garberina), with the help of military escort (Patrick Cohen), are risking their lives and limbs to present a live show to show disaster. Do yourself a favor and do not look. This thing is obviously very low budget and comes to the feeling that the high school is bad. The acting is terrible and zombie hungry meat is almost comical. They also appear: Michael Propster, Villiam DeCoff and Brenda Hogan. Feeding the mass should be left to starve.
