Attack on the killer Tomatoes is a "parody" of bad movies about monsters that end up as worse than the movies it underlines. The story (very weak) speaks of tomatoes who fight against those who treat them poorly. Basically, they turn around and rectify (yes, slamming) and the next thing you know is that the person is covered with ketchup. Actors are non-names that never shot movies after that, so there would be no purpose to call them. There is a type of government hired to try to stop the threat of tomatoes. Followed by a blacksmith who is a master of disguise and a girl and a duck boy. In any case, there is another woman who spy on the first guy who works for the government. if this does not make much sense to you, you understand. This film would never have been very good, but he even lacked fun for laughing at stupid scenes of attack. The film is terribly cheezy, which, although the point is, really hurts what could be (reasonably) entertaining film. At one point, a giant tomato from the wax "slides" on an uncontrolled wooden board with wheels on it! Perhaps I would recommend a movie if it had a pleasant campsite value, but even that is why this horrible movie is missing. 2/10
