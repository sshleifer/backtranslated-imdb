This film deserves the work of the Mystery Science Theater. Although it has nothing to do with King Solomon, it is worth watching for it because it is unintentional rebellion. Really! It's up from "Destroy all monsters." Be sure to check the following: cheesy medallion (it looks like Shriners were here), apparently a polyester jacket from Norfolk to "Allan Kuatermain", David MaCallum did a bad stutter (which draws attention to his even more acting), incredibly bad process works at all "monsters", the monsters themselves - the hand of a doll that endangers a little girl, a giant snake that endangers Macallum while he sinks in oatmeal, red-eyeed motorized carcinogens, incredibly funny eyes of the ship (oh, brother!) that looks like it was made of plywood mounted on an old sandy excavator and looks like the rest of Jr.Sr. prom ("A journey to the future with the class of '71"), the Phoenician city - where they carry a Roman imperial shield, but which inexplicably possess Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions - (Phoenicians invented the alphabet - come!), and worst of all, Macallum and Ekland terrible wig) play-face-of-horror! The best part is that fearless researchers manage to lose the comedic French, and the African guy - Snuffleupagus or anything else - obviously decided to heroically die, not to be in more scenes.
