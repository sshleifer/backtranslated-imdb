Get off of this movie. Even with B-film standards, this film is terrible. She also bumped into her own subject. The main topic is that people who reject society and respect nothing, cool and worthy of admiration. People who treat others with respect are losers. Guncrazi is a film that speaks of being disenfranchised much better than this movie, see it. No normal child would do what Trent does. State troops do not work like in this movie, etc. Watching this movie makes you understand why writers use hook-to-heart clich√©s. Mia is a totally impure prostitute, who had a terrible life. However, she is such a terrible person that the audience can not identify with her. Usually there is one thing for which the film can be recommended, in this case there is no. It's such a funny movie that offends a person trying to identify with the main characters. The acting is adequate B-film standards and the direction does not represent anything new or interesting.
