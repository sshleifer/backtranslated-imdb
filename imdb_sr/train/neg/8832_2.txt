It was hard for me to go through this move. It was very slow and sometimes it was wondering if the film's plot really came to life. It seemed that this movie was running slowly and I continued to wonder when this would end. I'm usually a person who loves a good indie file, but that did not satisfy what I asked for. They seemed to have tried to extract much from this film. At one point it seemed to turn into a policy that I'm not a big fan of in movies. If you are looking for a movie that slowly moves with little or no complication, then this is a real movie for you. As far as I'm concerned, I felt that I lost 2 hours when I could do something else.
