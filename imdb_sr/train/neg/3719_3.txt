Imagine pulling the deadly killer mask and finding Barbar Cartland there ... that's what's happening to this movie. The opening promises, but soon it ceases to pretend to be a thriller (or even a fictitious love story) and the only reason they made this story becomes quite clear: fill the void in their female viewing market by creating more one re-heshes' misunderstood, thoughtful little boy '(Andrei) who encounters an innocent, vhimsical beauti' (Paula). Instead of wasting time in creating the original premise, the filmmakers went right to the shot: a bad boy was indifferent to the capricious beauty. From there follows a series of insincere and difficult clichy love scenes that are sprinkled with pseudo-philosophical / poetic splitting. The recognition of Andrew that the (eponimically) 'poet' was set up to round up the perceived traits that hero Bironic should have - but even when we were told in a heavy, underlined writing who and what is he, it is still difficult to believe - or worry . Yes, the birch hero / antihero works, the story needs subtlety, style and innovation - and everything is completely missing here. This is not a fashionable phantom from the Opera, that's exactly what happens when a weak and pretty foolish woman (with a loose elastic pajamas) comes out with a bad man who, after getting to know her, seems dangerous as well as a slippery slipper. Performances may have saved this film, whether they were good: female leadership is preoccupied with the look of sexy and "alien", no matter how forced or funny; and poor Dougrai Scott seems to be drugged as he breaks through his part. This is not his best work. Interesting facts were brought by Jurgen Prochnov as Vashon, and Andrew Lee Potts as a young photographer / brother. A better movie would take off his sister and keep his brother in his place.
