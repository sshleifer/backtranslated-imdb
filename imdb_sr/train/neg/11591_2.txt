This film is so incredibly bad that I almost felt it as if I were watching it. Until this point, the other rates had at least one good thing about it. The first part was tense and bloody. Part 2 was fun and fun. Part 3 was interesting with great effects. The fourth part had excellent music, good special effects and a new funny Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is more boring than anything I've ever seen. Alice, much more beautiful blonde, returned from her fourth day with her boyfriend Dan. In some parts, this alleged street Elm Street is becoming a daily soap opera. Newer characters look rude, and even this cute Alice has a chip on his shoulder. Looks like Freddie is out of this. It looks tired and it does not seem so creepy. His lines look unusual and different, and as in the fourth part they can be quite fun. The story of Leslie Bohem never disappears, and the direction of Stephen Hopkins is so bad that my grandmother looks good! The whole plot of this film is ridiculous and unrealistic. It's also confusing and pretty stupid. Avoid Part 5 at Any Price!
