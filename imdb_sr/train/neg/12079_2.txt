Poor Vill would have rolled over in his grave if he could have attracted German television to his classic performances. Obviously, very little money was spent on it. The stage, the runway and some randomly installed pillars pass as a set. The film was ineffectively translated into English, and English actors occasionally mumble their lines. The whole production had an incredibly dark and gloomy feeling. And where is Fonterbras in this movie? MST3K gave this sad production a treatment that he rightfully deserved. Be or not to be? I wish this film was never in the first place.
