This movie has several things to happen immediately. Having Dani Filth as the main actor will automatically make some people love this movie. Well, I love Cradle of Filth and I listened to the music from the movie before I watched it. Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and plays a great role. The independent movie shooting style is excellent for a creepy factor. There are some great actors in this movie. For a low budget, no special effects were bad either. The ways people died were very creative and nightmares. Now on the counter. There is very little conversation in the entire film, so the character development is very small. It's hard to fear for the lives of quiet, static characters. When there was little talk, the F bomb was abundant, it appeared in random places. Yes, I understand that people swear, but it seems that the boy who wrote about the boys wrote this and thought it was cool because he included the whole language. The story, what I could get out of it, was pretty good, although many parts were left to leave more and the lack of conversation a man who often wondered what was happening. porn for people who love sex and violence, but as a porn attempt to pull the story, it just does not work too well. Let him know if you are a morbid person who wants to settle your blood and the appetite of the flesh.
