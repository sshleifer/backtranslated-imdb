Spoilers Well, only one line says it all. Melville's "Le Samurai" is an original and there are elements of "Leona". And they are better - much better! In "Samurai" Alen Delon is a lonely warrior / professional killer who holds a bird in a cage and steals cars for his jobs (with so much uncertainty of the scene!). Even the end is the same: the samurai seeks dignity and kills him with an empty pistol in his hand. The world has changed, he realizes, and there is no room for samurai in it. Delon does not kill as many people as a ghost dog. But I guess Jarmush loved "Leon" or even "Desperado" Rodriguez. He added this. And to guess: the girl will become a professional like a dog of ghosts (such as Natalie Portman in "Leon")? What was Jarmus thinking then? Where is the unique, original thought in this movie? I do not see the point in making carbon (celluloid) copies. Ratings 4/10 by Macaulai Connor
