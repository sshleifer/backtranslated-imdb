This film is one of those that I'm sorry to have invested 90 minutes of my life and I will never return. The premise is really interesting - basically it's zombie mirroring from the perspective of the undead (let's not split the hair whether Unfortunately, they fail to deliver a convincing story within this framework, and the almost unbearable monotony of the lives of central characters can contribute to the realism of the film, but it squeezes all the fun values. If they tried harder for the viewer to hire, it would be much more likely to bring home a social commentary.
