This is an interesting topic treatment that is quite controversial (just read other comments on this movie). Apparently, either you love him or hate him, and it seems that most people make that difference based on whether they believe that the trouble and the end times will happen as shown in the movie. sequels - are made for about $ 1.30 each. The production values ​​are down here with Plan 9 from the Universe and the acting is at the same level as Glen or Glenda, (my apology to Ed Vood). Putting aside a religious message, the story is terrifying as they are. Add even the slightest thought that a story might actually be close to something that could happen in the future and becomes even more scary. This film and its sequels did not try to give reasons why the trouble happened when it was. "Left Behind" and "The Omega Code" tried to get into everything the "Thief" did and to explain all the politics and maneuvering in the Middle East. The net effect of "Thief" has done a much better job in the frightening part of the film, rather than being exaggerated, trying to explain what is happening in the Middle East at the same time. Forget about politics and watch this movie, as well as its sequels, for what they are - horrible stories. The fact that they can be horrible stories, indirectly told by God, makes them so scary. If she makes you think about the topic, she has done her job - even if you never believe.
