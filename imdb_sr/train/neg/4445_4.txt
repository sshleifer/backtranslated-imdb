The serum is a crazy doctor who finds a serum that needs to cure all illnesses through the power of the mind. Instead, he creates a kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brain. A crazy doctor creates some corpses of corpses and has some problems. There's a long-lasting advantage in all actions with many scenes that make you familiar with the characters. A crazy doctor's nephew enters a car accident, and a crazy doctor tries to use his new serum on a boy. The results are not good. This is a Class C film with a OK procedure, but some interruptions also indicate some continuity errors. In this case there are not many zombie actions, and the effects, although adequate, are nothing special. You can move quickly through slow parts and enjoy action scenes. Beware of nudity and bad language.
