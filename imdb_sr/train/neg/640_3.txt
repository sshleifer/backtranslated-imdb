Cold, alienating adaptation of Rebecca West's book about the captain of the army who returns from office in World War II with a weakened memory (now there is an original idea!). It looks like she remembered the old flame of Glenda Jackson, but not her current wife, Julie Christie, which should be enough to trigger some emotional sparks. This remarkably well-trodden soander gathers the leading man Alan Bates with director Alan Bridges and co-stars Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret and Ian Holm, but all the burners are low. There are several good scenes (especially whenever Jackson is on the screen), but the pacing on the bridges is incredibly sluggish and the color that is exhausted by the film is burdened. Long on the shelf, this "Soldier" is best left to be forgotten. * 1/2 of ****
