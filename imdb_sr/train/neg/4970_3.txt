Good people, I encountered this movie at night as I evaluated the papers. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature and I can say that no one has ever done the genre of honor he deserves. Icelandic "Beowulf and Grendel" is the least offensive I've seen, and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This Sci-Fi version is ranked with Christopher Lambert's version. Iuck. What did I not like? CGI for one. Amazingli bad. More important, fidelity is spoken, not to mention a persistent acting. I'm used to both of them with all the versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> I'm glad, Peter
