I started watching this film with my friend. And after 5 minutes I was alone. I managed to stay to the end. It was a painful experience. I loved that jean hugues angels, but I think he had to eat, like us, and so he accepted to play in this movie. It has only 5 characters, and the rest can be called "art" or something I could not express, but I did not understand it at all. The only worst movie I've ever seen was a fall, but I'm pretty sure that now I have enough experience to watch it again. Good luck! ; about)
