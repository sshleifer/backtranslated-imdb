R Balki is trying to tell you the story that Gopal Verma had said earlier in Nishabd in a sensual way. This time is mixed with mature humor. Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and has Indian cuisine in London. He is very dominant and arrogant and respects his job as any other job. According to him, Cooking is an art. It still can not do Hyderabadi Biriani right. Enter the Taboo that sends her the real Hyderabadi Birians from her and they soon begin to meet and finally fall in love with each other ?? Amitabh is 65, and Tabu 35? No problem! But one Hitch! Tabu's father Paresh Raval !! Couples decide to meet their father for the approval of their marriage. But Amitabh realizes that Tabu's father is much younger. And complications begin? The performance is wise for three actors. The film scenario is very compact and interesting. The film's dialogues are appealing. But somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled. Comedy is sometimes misunderstood. The film also tries to be long in some places. Music nothing about it should not sing other than the title bar. Working on the camera is good. Director R Balki could have given much better than this scenario. But in the other half I seem confused. The "Satiagrah" scene of the father looked irritating. But the lines spoken by Amitabh Bachchan during this scene were applauding. All in all, Cheeni Kum had to have more sugar!
