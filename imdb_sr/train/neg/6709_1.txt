I'm having fun. I enjoyed "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and their numerous sequels, even when most people considered them unbearable. I even managed to enjoy most of Pauli Shore's films. There's only one movie I've seen that I can say is bad ... and that's it. It's been a long time since I saw it, but I remember sitting in the theater thinking, "This is a stupid movie. Why did I see it?" Frankly, the only movie I can not recommend.
