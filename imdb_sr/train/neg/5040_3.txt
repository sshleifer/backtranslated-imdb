I read comments that this is the best Chinese movie ever. Perhaps if only the Chinese movies that you saw did not contain dialogue, long exhausted distant views and silences, and hack editing, then you are on the spot. Hard. Try minors and amateur. Excellent moods and memories? Hard. Try bored and loose. This was terrible. I could not wait to finish it. Especially when the best lines in the movie consist of "How are you? I'm fine. Are you sure?" Wow! What is the depth of character. I assume that the constant smoking of cigarettes should talk about them. As a great fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I was completely disappointed in that. Even Jang's sentimental skeptic "Travel Home" was better than this.
