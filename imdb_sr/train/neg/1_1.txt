Robert DeNiro plays the incredibly intelligent illiterate of all time. This film is so scattered talent, it's really disgusting. The scenario is incredible. The dialogue is incredible. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of herself, not funny. The film moves with the snail's rhythm, is photographed in a bad way, and the preaching is unbearable. He also gets involved in every clich√© in the book. Svoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supporting role, but then what? Equally embarrassing is this new IMDB rule that requires ten rows for each review. When a movie is worthless, it does not require ten lines of text to make other readers know it's a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
