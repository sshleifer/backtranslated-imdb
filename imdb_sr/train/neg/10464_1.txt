This film is not based on the Bible. He completely leaves Christ out of film. They do not show the ascension or other coming of Christ. Not to talk about it. We are not quoted from the Scriptures. Late times are called great distress. The film does not even show bad weather. Seven glasses, seven villas and seven trumpets of ships are reduced to 15 seconds of news of changing the structure of the sea. Anti-Christ was killed for 3 1/2 years in trouble and so the film was over. The only part that corrected was that there were two prophets. Of course, they did not use the names there, because it would be too close to the truth of the Scriptures. The worst part was that I really wanted to be a good movie. I wanted to take unprepared people. I feel the film is evil. It's a forgery like everything the devil is doing. I just hope that he will not take away the upcoming film based on left books. Another problem with the movie was bad. Poor acting, bad special effects, bad action and bad character development. I've seen better episodes of Miami's wedding.
