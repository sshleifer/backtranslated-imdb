The rose is another great film malfunction. I'm trying to figure out a good thing I could say about a movie, and I have a problem figuring out something. writing and script were not the worst I've ever encountered, but it could have been much better. The rose was very pleasant to watch. The sets were very bright and beautiful to watch. I felt like the character Anne Bancroft was the only possible character in the whole movie. It was sad to see Chris Sarandon wasting time on this movie.
