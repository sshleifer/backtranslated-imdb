a friend told me it was another classic like Debbie does Dallas. Not close anywhere. I think that my main remark about the most unpleasant major actress in the porn industry ever. Worse still, she's on the screen almost all the time. But I read somewhere that pornography at the time had to have some "artistic" value. I was not able to find him. Look at it only if you are interested in the history of pornography development in the mainstream, or you can appreciate art in porn movies. I know I did not. But the movie director seems to be a talented person. He even tried to let Simon & Garfunkel use his songs. Of course, they refused.
