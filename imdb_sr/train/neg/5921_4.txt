What exactly happened during the First World War in New Zealand when the American forces were there? This terrible story of 4 Nurse was really pathetic for watching. Can you imagine Joan Fontaine being the older sister Sandra Dee? Fontaine looked more like his mother. It's even funny that Fontaine gets pregnant in the movie. Piper Lauri and Paul Nevman, who showed such a great film chemistry in "Hustler" four years later, have no scenes in this film. Lauri plays another sister who goes to Wellington to get there, despite the fact she is married. It is difficult for her husband to return from war. Jean Simmons is a widow and finds romance with a much-loved Paul Nevman. There's even romance for the young Miss Dee. The picture has little or no sense. Are they trying to say that everything is fair in love and war? If they did, they were badly engaged in selling this. The conflict of interest with Nevman and Simmons is quickly removed. This was what was to be done quickly for this terribly disappointing 1957 film.
