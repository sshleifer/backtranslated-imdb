It's absolutely amazing for me that anyone could comment that this film is not boasting. It is not only oppressive, but also absurd, gradual, dramatically interrupted and painfully overcome. Looking at it, it feels like an 8-year-old child is punished by writing 100 times "I Will Not Become a Fascist" on the board 100 times. Now I realize that it was made during the peak of the Second World War, and it was intended to be a brave condemnation of Hitler and the terrible suffering he caused, (which would cordially be cried) and I am sure that this is accurately captured today's mood. But he is presented in such an immature, obvious, small way, unsuccessful as an artwork. The only good performances here are from Polka Lukas, who brings the sincerity and intensity of the role as a silent heroic antifascist; and Lucile Vatson as a fun-loving grandmother who slowly realizes that the world has become dangerous. Although they were subjected to all kinds of difficulties without root, the children are ridiculously portrayed as robotically well-processed small snips. They do not even resemble real human beings. And Bette Davis, a great actress, is so dimensional noble here that I tried every time she was on the screen. Every word of it, every gesture it needs to convey, how SUPPORTED and RESPONSIBLE is the one of the abilities that her husband has to make, as well as the great CAUSE she fights for, she must have suffered a stroke if she dares allow any indication suspicion or shadowing on the surface in your portrait. So, yes, this is a very important movie, just not really good.
