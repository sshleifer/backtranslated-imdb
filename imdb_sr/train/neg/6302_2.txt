The British heritage film industry is out of control. There is nothing wrong with recording classic novels, but why should all be filmed by volatile flutes? This film discovers the gut of Orwell's hard novel, turning it into a harmless, soft romantic comedy. The "Aspidistra" may not be the best Orwell's work, but no-one reading it can forget its wonderful view of poverty. Orvell emphasizes not only cold and hunger, but also the humiliation of poverty. In the novel, London is a dark, gray, cold, soulless city, and Comstock is praying for it to sack the squadron of bombers. But this film smoothes everything that could be in any way disturbing, and instead creates a cheerful nostalgic journey into the charming London of the 1930s, in which everything is lit with golden sunlight, and even the slopes of Lambeth are picturesque and filled with freshly purified . hedgehogs and happy prostitutes. Komstok's songs about the sharp wind that spread across the streets that are scattered with garbage seem completely incompatible in this world of chocolate boxes. The worst of all is the merciless humility of the script, ancient jokes and clumsy dialogue. It's so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the movie is full of great actors. But that's all for nothing. This movie made me so angry! British literary history is something that can be proud of because of its richness, complexity and power. And what about us? We use pale nobody to turn it into a soft-centered, anodized pap for people who want to feel 'get some kind of culture' while drinking their Horlicks and quiet dish.
