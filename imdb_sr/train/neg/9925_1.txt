This was on the DVD of the 30th anniversary of Blazing Saddles, which was brilliant, but not this one. I have never seen the name of Mel Brook and I can guess why, it makes a lot more sense not to be connected with this pilot. My good, if this would be ridiculous. There must be a problem with the collision, but for me it was not funny, because it just is not funny. It's as if the writers did not even try to be funny just to redeem themselves with the Blazing Saddles. Did they expect this show to last several seasons when they made this pilot? Correct, they did not care. It was a quick cow who did not pay the money to God. I suppose it is useful only for historical purposes, or just to show how stupid and uninteresting Hollywood writers can be.
