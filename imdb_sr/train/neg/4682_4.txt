Yes, a lot of shouting, screaming, cheering, quarreling, celebrating, winning fists, high fiving and fighting. You have a general idea of ​​why, but you can never be 100% sure. Marine knowledge would be an advantage for finer points, but then you would probably notice many disadvantages. No horrible movie, and Hackman & Washington are not usual brilliant, but the plot was the one that you could pretty soon start. I'm still waiting to see a submarine movie where people interact and do not argue, but then you probably would not have a movie. 4/10
