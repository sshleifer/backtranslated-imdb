"Kill me later" has an interesting initial premise: a suicidal woman (Selma Blair), who is on the verge of jumping from the top of the business building, protects the bank robber (Mak Beeslei) who promises to "kill her later". > Actual execution of this premise, however, falls on the surface, because almost every action serves as a mere device for moving complications to its predictable conclusion. The lack of depth of character especially diminishes the performance of Selma Blair, whose character Shavn kneels from hate to the acting "cool" and ultimately comes as a confused doll. This is unlucky, as in other circumstances, Mrs. Blair is an attractive and capable actress. <Br / > The compromising thing for the up is the insistence of Dana Lustig's director on the use of quick cuts, inconsistent special effects (for example, searching for an accidental hilarious infrared search for motorcycles in the end), and hip hop hoping to attract a short range of MTV audience attention. Certainly, Ms. Lustig proves she is capable of mastering the technical side of the course, but her skill does not in any way help overcome the inherent problems of the film, so the film is drawn to the end. It is clear that Lustig has a clear visual style; However, it may be better suited to music videos than film. Producers (Ram Bergman and Lustig) can boast of their ability to make this film: they managed to scare $ 1.5 million in financing a movie, provide a good movie and get domestic and foreign distribution. This is not a small feat for an independent movie. However, keeping in mind the quality of the product, the result is a mixture.
