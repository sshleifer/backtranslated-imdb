Time Corridors. A movie you can watch if you are looking for a sophisticated way of suicide. Some use weapons, ropes or gas, but you want to destroy the brain? Do not wait any longer! Time Corridors are probably one of the biggest possible mistakes: thinking Christian Clavier is able to act and entertain you. I do not miss 45 francs that cost me this poor: Sometimes, his system of estimation must be reset by looking at absolute zero. This movie deserves 2/10, but that's just because I like Jean Reno. Too bad for him, he also plays in Ronin. I do not think I will love him ...
