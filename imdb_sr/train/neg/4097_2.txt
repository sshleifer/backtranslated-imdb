The bad news is that it's still terrible. I gave it 2 because sometimes it seems that some of these kitchi slapstick parodies are really funny. Or I drank hard when I watched it and I was generous. Whatever, "2" is. Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it's almost pretty fast. She takes elements from most of the key themes and scenes of the Kill Bill I & II battle, hooting them, pushing them down, dashing the dialogue, and breaking the whole mess in an hour of really terrible amateur video. It's best to smoke a lot of something powerful if you want to enjoy this. And return this DVD to the video store on time! You will really hate if you have to pay a late fee.
