Is this a movie? Are they Indians trying to show it? I think this is yet another effort by a sick director to refuse Pakistani soldiers and, in fact, the country ... but what we Pakistan know we are always ahead of India in every part of our lives ... not just in Armed Countertops. Well ... this ... was badly recorded as a border in early 1997 ... and the director and writer just tried to overcome the shame of defeat in Kargil by the Pakistani armed forces, creating films like these .. < br /> One thing is very clear ... Whenever there is a meeting between Pakistan and India .... we will win .... !!! That's why Mr. Dutta is trying to make some good films instead of such films
