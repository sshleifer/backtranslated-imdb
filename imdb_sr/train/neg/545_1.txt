This is just the usual Indian garbage that turned out to be a film, because the Indians are proud to be proud of having the largest cinema industry, but also the worst. As other poor countries can have movie characters that challenge the views of their societies and we just keep pumping out garbage. Look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, look at the brilliant movies we have and get shit like Kisna! Get the right people, it's no wonder the international community generally laughs at the Indian cinema.
