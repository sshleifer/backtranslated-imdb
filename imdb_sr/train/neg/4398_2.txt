Tim Robbins and John Cusack are the two actors I appreciated during their career, and that was the only reason I chose to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is that I regretted it! These two great actors are humiliated by performing a series of irrelevant, unimaginative and kitch extreme (not that it's bad in itself) sketches that people should smile, but they do not. The only reason I think the director was their friend, and they decided to support his movie acting in him - I can not think of anything else because this film is so cheap! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack did not disappoint me ever since. I recommend that you avoid this film, unless you want your opinion on the two actors to be corrupted.
