With two days in the Valley, I think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Just one of the long lines of Tarantino rip-off that came out of Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere that the movie creates is fun for the first five minutes, but then the filmmakers make a genuine unforgivable mistake allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to raise the "hip" quotient. You better skip this one.
