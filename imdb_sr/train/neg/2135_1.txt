Just say the trash. I'm a big fan of Cusacks, that's the only reason I watched this movie, but the only reason I can see their presence was a reprise, completely and deeply less quality, their exact roles from Grosse Point Blanc. In addition, the role of films as political satire collapses, because it is too obvious, even for those most at risk to serve a purpose. And to charge this as satirical satire, it would be simply offensive even for chimps. Imitation is, apparently the highest form of flattery, but seeing as if it is nothing near the Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league as they meet (see if your ass is) Spartans in terms of political satire, allows us to leave enough of ourselves and let these disappearances in the darkness that absolutely deserves.
