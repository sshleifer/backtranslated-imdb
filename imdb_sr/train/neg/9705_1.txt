I saw a movie as a child when he was released into the theater and it was so bad that it became a matter of family joke. If the ranking had zero, this film would get it. Dinosaurs were terrible. The story was ridiculous. Acting can not really be called acting. The only reason I even remember the name of the movie is that my family still talks about how BAD really is.
