The film industry is a tricky job - because decisions need to be made and everyone involved is having a private life. This is a very original thesis about this weak attempt to make a "movie" about the movie. And indeed, there is no better evidence of the lack of competence of the industry than watching Anouk Aimey and Makimilyan Schella captured in this innocence. The insight is made up of heads that sound like stupid, such as "should I have a studio film that pays a lot or should I make an indie item and stay loyal to my artistic self?" "Do this, please." Or: "Our relationship is not only professional, but also private. It's a rather complex situation for handling, is not it?" "Yes, it is, my dear." Between foolish dialogues there are views of palm trees, a hotel lobby and American film posters (there are no signs of the presence of a non-American film on Croisette). Periodic sleep sessions are inevitable, so 100 minutes of film feel like years. Jenni Gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing in justifying her own presence in the frame.
