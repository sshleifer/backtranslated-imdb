This film is by far the worst movie ever made. If you have to make a movie that plays the role of a guy who plays Lars in heavyweight, then he does not make a damn movie. I must say that I could see Leprechaun in the universe 6 times before I could watch the trailer for this POS movie. Adam Sandler should be limited from any film after this shame. Watching this movie is like a mix of listening to Sher and gladly putting your dick in the blender. Every half-hearted brain will realize that this film is not worth ten cents. If I had an extra dollar and had to spend it, I would give it support to the Lorraine Bobbitt Foundation before I buy this movie.
