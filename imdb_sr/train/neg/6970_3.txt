Now, that would be some kind of clich√© if I started with the title of the title, so I'll wait for it. First, this movie made me wonder why children are doing nonsense like wandering in laboratories and breaking bottles. Then I realized, this is a film with a message, that message has won children and such things will not happen. Things like you ask? Things like a giant insect that grows up and cause disorder, before dying in a typical "kill monster indirectly" mode. Now, as promised ... Blue Monkey ... there is nothing in it or any Simian of any kind. Now it's just like I'm cheated or anything. The picture on the front page had a huge bug / cancer / idiot / thing on the front that ran for some screaming nurses. It somehow happened, but I wanted monkeys! After only a few days earlier I enjoyed the BEST PRIMATES (half drunk from the crunch of Caska and Creame), I was moody for more than a hundred monkey hijackings. Not that much. If you love monkeys on snow or blue things, this movie is not for you. If you like bugs and good reasons for hitting children, rent this.
