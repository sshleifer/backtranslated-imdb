This is a great story and it was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We're still working on it.) However, despite the fact that it's true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. I understand that independent films are hard to get good actors, but wow. The only one even central is great Ossie Davis. But even he could not compensate all the actors (including those who play it as a young man) absolutely horrible acting. However, the scenario was terribly clich√©, but even then you have to get some decent actors! I would not recommend it to anyone because it's so bad in every category. Read some books on the true story of American Mason because they give these people the respect they deserve.
