What a powerful start to the film when the character of Julia Roberts strikes her violent and anal wife, played by Patrick Bergin, and I felt ready to experience a powerful movie at the same level as Farrah Favcett Burning Bed. Well, as the summary says I was wrong. This film was nothing like The Burning Bed, who had the power, and Farrah played the role of a woman you truly felt, and felt her pain and her need to survive. Sleeping with the Enemy flashed after the first action in a cheap excitement because Roberts cheated on his death to escape from his husband and went to live in Iowa. Her husband initially believes she is dead, but she starts to suspect she is still alive and moving after her. The rest of the film is basically a game of cats and mice with Juliet who gets a house in this small town in Iova and changes his identity .... she does not mention of course how she got the money for this, but at this point in the film I did not care . She meets a guy (Mr. Nice vimpi) and falls on him, and her husband finally catches up, but not before she reorganizes the cans of cane and flattens the kitchen. I suppose this audience could provide cheap excitement. But I did not care much if she was mistreated by a husband because the film, as I said, cheated on the audience. That he stayed on the road that I might have felt for her and her situation. Of course, the husband was killed and everything is good for the little cousin Roberts. If only the real world was something like this .... See the Gretna bed and you realize that the film should be similar to the topic of domestic violence.
