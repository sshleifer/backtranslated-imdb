Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher, and the light fades quickly. If not she, then what other reason to look at this. five boys from college have applied to prepare the old home for the date of demolition. Problems are automatically made when a strange homeless man searches, and the group is short for a few people. Then the killer is at liberty. I honestly wanted to say that I would enjoy this. She had a fair, or maybe it was just Daphne Zuniga. The movie is too slow and almost silent as a library. Most of the acting is below the average, and moments of "point of view" are so old news. Recognized composer Christopher Ioung of such films as "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" achieved this, in a repetitive line that was better made for a TV movie. Still, it seems to be greater than a movie deserves. So, apart from Ioung and Zunige, he scratched the bottom of the barrel.
