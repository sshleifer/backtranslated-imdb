Do not waste time on this shit. As shown, the characters do not have redeeming values, and watching in interaction is pure torture. "Gothic" is at least a party, this is bullshit. If you like to watch pretentious and spoiled poets trying to outwit each other, this can be in your street. Lord Bayron is portrayed as a complete jerk and why would others choose to spend more than five minutes with him is really confusing. Mary Shelley seems to be the only character with any spine, but she even comes out of the whole temptation without an ounce of respect. What a waste of time. See Gothic instead. I also remember that I saw another top film based on the same theme, but I did not capture the title. I was hoping that this was it, but there was no luck. Not recommended.
