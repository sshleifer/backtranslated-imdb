I thought this film was pretty shy. If you are looking for cheese, you may like this. Me, I do not bother with a lot of cheese, but this was ridiculous. The film's progress bored me and the story was very weak. The only thing that entertained this movie was zombie day-glo, but it's not a good reason to see this movie.
