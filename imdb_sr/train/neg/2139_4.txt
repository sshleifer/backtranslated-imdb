I really wanted to like this, but in the end it's a badly made movie with too little laughter. . It just gives me a reason to laugh. The problem is that it looks like it's made in a real hurry (like for example a week). And it contains a stupid background about a bimbo singer, which seems to be completely out of the dark. Turikistan is obviously Iraq, or Afghanistan, or any other number of countries with which the United States has been since then 50s. Humor is a bit dark (Amputated dancers with prosthetic legs made by Tamerlane Corporation), but on the trail, especially when the corporation is being reconstructed ("democracy"!). Much satire criticizing the US, it seems terribly difficult with hands and effort. I suppose it is contrary to so much propaganda, so it has to deceive people over the head to make a point. Who knows. I prefer biting, winking - a bit of subtlety. But that's just me. Anyway, maybe I'll look again, maybe I missed something. Hope that the "V" is more on the trail.
