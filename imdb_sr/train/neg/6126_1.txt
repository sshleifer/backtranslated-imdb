In this case, one of the worst films ever made. The plot goes as follows. Run through a jungle that lasts 10 minutes. Let Bo go somewhere and get off. The style through the jungle a little more. Give Bo another excuse to get out. Back to the jungle. Oh Look! There's a guy from Tarzan! Comic, Bo-strip. Kill people from the safari. The guy who looks at Tarzan has a fight scene. Save Bo. Bo strips. Run credits. Run credits, run.
