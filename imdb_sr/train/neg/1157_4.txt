I ended up watching tenants with my close friends who rented a movie solely based on the look of Snoop Dogg (their passionate fetish) on the cover. Understandably, I did not expect much. I thought the film would include a typical set of Snoop Dogg behaviors and pictures that are often seen in clich√© rap videos. However, my generalization was mostly wrong. Unfortunately, this did not make the movie even better. Most would describe the movie as a dark, serious drama, while I would describe it as a darkly seriously exhausting drama. The film tells the story of two writers struggling (Dilan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create their own masterpieces. Their polar opposing lifestyles end with the formation of an incredible but very complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship is moving throughout the movie like a wild slide - most of which contribute to Snoop's character - it reminds of someone with a severe case of a separated personality disorder. And even though the film is a drama, the acting - which has a morbid and serious tone - from Snoop and the company was more comical than anything else. I would not recommend this film to those who are careful having a lot of dialogue and much more dialogue after that. There are some central conflicts, but even they are mostly bogged down with more dialogues. However, the end suddenly surprised me. It was a little twisted, somewhat unexpected and perfect way to finish the film that was supposed to end. As I watched the final credits, I could not even imagine the director thinking: "Oh God, how the hell I'm ending with the snoozer." By the way, the director exhibited carefully planted clues and subtlety that led to the climax - all of which are more visible than Vald in a crowded street of dwarfs that carry nothing but black sweaters.
