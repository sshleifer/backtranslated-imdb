I watched this movie because I noticed that Kari Vuhrer was in the acting team. For a long time I had a theory about her, that she is a talented actress, but she never seems to prove it, because she is always in this low-budget B film. She's still pretty, and she's still trying to behave because of the unhappy material I always see. This is nothing else. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but that does not make it good. George Vendt was playing against the guy, and it was so disturbing that he was recognized for his role. Another note about Ms. Vuhrer. It looks like her breasts have been significantly reduced since I last saw her. Perhaps the reduction in the operation, or (more likely) implant removal. This is not a bad thing. It still looks great. I'd like to see her in a better movie.
