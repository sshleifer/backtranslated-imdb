Les Visiteurs, the first film about travelers of the Middle Ages, was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected turns, ridiculous situations and, of course, absurdity, which would remind you a little about Louise de Funes. travel time. The action is changing a bit, because the characters now need to be experienced travelers of the time. So they jump up and down in history, not paying attention to the fact that it's getting more absurd as you advance into the movie. Duke, Jean Reno, strives to save it all along with his game, but his character is emptied, so he can not do much to save the movie. Now the ducal slave assistant, he really has all the attention. The film is just about him and his clumsy / boring / stupid or what he should be. Fact is; this character tries to produce laughter from the audience, but it fails. It's as if somebody told you a very bad joke, you know, but he insists he says this joke to the end, adding details to your suffering for a little longer. You liked Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth. If you do not like Les Visiteurs, you would never think of seeing a sequel. If you liked this sequel ... well, I guess you still need to see a lot of movies.
