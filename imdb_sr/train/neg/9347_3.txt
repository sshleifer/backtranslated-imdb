This film lapsed from the moment of complacency to the moment of self-indulgence, promising to develop into something for which it is worth. But not. It's flat, self-conscious, unimaginable and tired. The set of set pictures and wallpapers do not make a movie, they make a calendar. This kind of poor socialist pseudo-dramatic documentary ("It's really true") not only does not entertain, fails to convince, and even functions as a social history. Clich√©s mixed with bad acting make this movie very difficult to end, while the fun factor is quite fast. The characters are one-dimensional, they never develop to the extent they feel for them. The director's ego is the biggest character in this film.
