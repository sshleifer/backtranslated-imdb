big mystery, but the movie goes downhill. The beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter who were burnt alive before a policeman, Edward. He is traumatized for this and see the pills. A mysterious letter appears from an old girl looking for help finding a missing daughter. So Ed travels to the island commune mostly women. They do not like strangers. It's a lot of stuffing with Ed, who was watching the city for a girl. That's why the movie is too long. Finally, it comes a little better at the end when we learn about the crazy rituals that a woman performs and ultimately the evil plan that is being prepared for Edward. FINAL VERDICT: I would skip this.
