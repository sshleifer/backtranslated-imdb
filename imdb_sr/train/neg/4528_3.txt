This WorldWide was a cheap version of what the NVA under Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions made in the 1980s on localized Big 3 stations during Saturday morning / afternoon wrestling Craze. When Ted Turner got his hands on Crockett's failed NVA version, he turned it into the World Wrestling Championship and continued to dismiss all NVA references. NVA Vorld Vide and NVA Pro wrestling were re-tagged with the VCV logo and moved from Disney / MGM Studios to Orlando, Florida and eventually became nothing more than a recap for VCV's Nitro, Thunder and Saturdai Night. Worldwide, officially was the latest VCV program under Turner, which was broadcasting a weekend VCV purchase from Vince McMahon and VVF. Today, the entire NVA Vorld Vide / VCV video archiving tape along with the entire NVA / VCV Video Tape library was generally lying in VVE vaults in Stamford, Connecticut.
