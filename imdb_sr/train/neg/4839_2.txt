... And lowering more than ever before. I'm not here to point out any direct references or anything, but at least this film is pathetic. If you are dressed military, do not try to look at it. I put it on a DVD with 2 friends who wanted to watch a somewhat interesting action / war movie. Why did not I read the reviews first? Already on the first "bomb" scene, the movie has huge disruptions, and they continue to show up and become bigger and bigger. My two friends, who were not associated with the army, in any way noticed a few director's mistakes almost as fast as I did and asked me if there were some things that were happening real. Well, as you may have guessed, they are not at all. Avoid this film unless you are able to overlook these completely idiotic and repeated mistakes that are being made. 2/10 for the first capture of my interest.
