A fairly worthless film made for a television movie that mainly follows an insect killer script. The ants are mysteriously transformed into anthrax killers near the hotel. I think it's from the hotel's food because the sewage from the hotel's kitchen is taken directly to the anchor bed. In this film, there is uncertainty and is not scary. Watching the piles of ants that kill their victims is not very scary. He was told that the health inspector to the ants could not be a hero. It must be a mysterious virus. After the inspector says, the hero takes his bulldozer and destroys a huge colony of ants. It hampers millions of ants and traps people at the hotel. End spoilers All in all, this film is extremely chrome. I do not understand why she got a DVD release when there are not so many movie credits. My only presumption for a DVD release is that Suzanne Summers is featured in the movie. This is a film to be avoided.
