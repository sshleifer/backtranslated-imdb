A very good story for a movie that would, if done properly, be interesting, but where's the ending of the movie? In fact, what is the purpose of this? <br /> <The scenes pass so quickly that you felt that you were not an emotional part of the movie and the feeling that you are separate from understanding the story. The performance of actors is questionable, if not I missed the conclusion somewhere in the movie? I guess we have to wait for the sequel. <br /> <br />
