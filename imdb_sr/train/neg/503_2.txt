After the initial release of 4 very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION managed to scratch the bottom of the barrel with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS DANCE. In this film I did not find NO Bloodthirsty. The story is simple. The mysterious Count invites several actresses to his castle for a small break. After some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls are decapitated one by one. Who is the killer? Who knows? There are more red herrings in this than on a local fish market on Friday. Tempo is incredible. The story is stupid, and the scenes on the skin are not that great. Bring this gentleman.
