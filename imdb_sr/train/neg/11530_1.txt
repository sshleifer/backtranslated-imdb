In the last 10 years I have been working in three different indie professional wrestling organizations, managed many professional wrestlers (including 2 Backiard Vrestling stars), worked on 2 different Croatian television programs and made voices and comments for many Croatian DVDs. I NEVER been a witness to the level of amateur nonsense, the lack of talent and skills, and the poor quality of production in Splatter Rampage Vrestling. Even if this is listed as a wrestling video, ANYTHING is completely misused. Recorded with low-end camcorders, these are essentially home videos of children struggling in yards. Sound quality is poor, video quality is bad, and acting is terrible. "Rvaci" carry improvised costumes with hand-drawn t-shirts and ski masks and hit each other with different objects and imitate wrestling moves in half. Sometimes they are "matches" on the grass. Sometimes on a trampoline. All of them are behaving poorly and executed with the shameless lack of any wrestling skills. In short, do not bother with this stinker. Whether your interest in this DVD is fun or academic (as in my case), you will be very disappointed.
