I dated to see it when I saw a funny poster MEATBALLS and realized that it must be the best satire ever. What a great idea for satire - the genre is full. Unfortunately, the finished product (as I think everyone involved probably understands) is a catalog of missed opportunities, not just such performances and (fortunately!) Several extremely hilarious, inspired parts. Janeane Garrafolo, which is very striking, looks very bad here, probably because she is uncomfortably struggling to make her ridiculous role funny. David Hide Pierce is just sad to watch, trying to be hard to be funny and looks like a Castro nerdy. Molly Shannon is so funny that only you look at her are laughing, but her segment in some way fails to enter into something hysterical. Paul Rudd had great teen mods and was as sexy as hell, the other guys are also really funny (those who are neradier). I think the problem is that the director simply does not move things at the right pace. It begins very non-expressive, and it sets a monotony. But when he allows things to become really unheard of (the sequence of drugs is the second most entertaining moment I've had all year in movies, the first one also came in a ludicrous film: Andrea Martin in EVERY DAY complains about IN & OUT), it's easy funny. I wanted this film to work so badly, but it just was not. Clothes and styling for 1981 are 99.9% PERFECT, and very few used songs are also perfect. This ends up as a mean bad MAD TV episode, complete with frustrating long drawings.
