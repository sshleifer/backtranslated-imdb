This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. She is extremely boring with a lot of boring dialogue and has some very boring characters and funny creatures. The only reason I was watching this piece of garbage is because it was on that set with the 8 disks I got. The action is meaningless and totally stupid as the finale. There is no blood whatsoever, except for some bloody traces on the creature, and a few bloody wounds of firearms. The act is TERRIBLE !!. Richard Cardella was terrible like a sheriff and he was pretty funny, and his character is irritating. Glen Roberts is a comic relief and was not ridiculous at all! Mark Siegel is extremely boring and also NOT FORUM!. Bob Hymane is decent, but not much more than that. Richard Garrison was boring and did not have chemistry with Kacey Cobb what ever happened. Kacey Cobb did not have chemistry with Richard here. Total Avoid this piece of garbage at all costs! BOMB of 5.
