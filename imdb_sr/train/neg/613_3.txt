Wow, what can I say about this movie? It's a bad piece of shit. I'm surprised he's rated as high. What's wrong with this movie? Here's a better question: What's wrong with this movie. The story itself is just bullshit and clich√©. There's a lot about it here ... Some kind of foolish kid without a friend gets a gift, kills himself and returns like a scarecrow for revenge. "Everything" is packaged in 86 minutes worthless film. If you have not seen this movie, do not waste your time watching it. Also, the other is not much better, so do not be bothered ... Or I rated this film as three because I liked a scarf suit, not because it was something good in the movie. I think you got a picture.
