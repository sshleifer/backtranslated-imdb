Where to begin? This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Editing is the worst ever, sound effects were horrible, and sound editing was down. The bulk of the movie could be found here, and these are shattering effects of hitting, with a cramped story in the background. I had to turn on the volume only on what's going on ... and what exactly should I hear? Probably one of the worst scripts ever made. I can not believe that people really made a little green for this movie. I thought I could take shit in a box, send it to the producers, and then finance them for me. Dolph, it was usual, Dolph. There is nothing else to say. Zlikovci were bad, the protagonists were bad, and the film was a stink.
