Thanks to some famous home-based dealer who brought the so-called German independent series, Four For Venice is not just terrible, but really horrible. So terrible, that I left him in the store of used goods for extra money. Nick and Charlotte are married couples who reached a sex agreement just on Tuesday because of their terrible job placement. Eva and Luis are a couple of pairs who live hand-to-mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Luis, an artist. Nick indirectly causes Eva to lose her waitress job. Luis and Charlotte had an affair on the back of Eve and Nick. Luis deceived Eu by lying to travel to London to do something about his artwork, but the fact is that he flies to Venice with Charlotte for a holiday. Eve kidnapped Nicka and took two children to Venice for the clashes. The journey to Venice ends with Nick and Eve falling on each other. Presentation of travel from Germany to Venice between Nik and Eve marks the failure of comedy. It does not just look meaningless, but pulls too. In the film, Nick tries to seek help in several ways, but this ends without success. They are either strangers around him who act like morons, or are simply stupid. The comedy also tended to add unnecessary scenes to prolong the story. While some of the problems that can be solved by common sense, no one in the movie uses common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go through a big circle to solve the problem. It is not so bad that even beautiful landscapes in Venice can not pull the reputation of the film.
