Regardless of this, it is an amateur, exhibitionist film - or an effort in one - that is so interesting and bold as a book about the composition of a student of an abnormal high school full of death "poetry". Certainly, this will bother the viewers who are hellishly trying to be upset, but the success will be attributed to them, not to the director. To really grasp someone's skin, sensibility, discipline, technique and talent, as well as eye and ear are needed. The film contains one image image, displayed as calm (and also used for the video case), but without development leading to or from it. If the director had an eye, he would see it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie - that is, a movie.
