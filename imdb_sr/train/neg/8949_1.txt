A few weeks ago, I read George Orwell's classic novel, 1984. I was fascinated and I thought it was one of the best books I recently read. So when I rented a DVD, I was intrigued to see how this adaptation was measured. Unfortunately, the film has not even come close to creating an environment or developing characters that Orwell has so masterfully worked in his book. It seems that the director thinks that every reading of the film has read the book because it does not try to show WHY characters act and feel the way they do it. John Hurt, the main actor, goes all the way and can barely act to the end. We never found out what he was doing for life, or why his love affair is forbidden, or what the political climate is and why the main character wants a rebellion. This book can not be fair in film form without proper narrative and explanation of the political system that endangers characters, and the fact that they lack the biggest drawback of this film. In addition, John Hurt was a horrible choice, watching about 15 years older than 39-year-old Vinston he was supposed to show. However, in a more positive position, the rest of the actors are well chosen. It's a shame that they are in such a terribly adapted movie with the wrong main actor. -Brian O.
