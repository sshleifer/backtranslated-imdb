It's amazing that the script as a cliche and absolutely absurd could make any screen even small. The dialogue in this film makes Catwoman look like a classic of high culture. Billy Zane plays a bad accordion playing, Elvis as an imitator, gunslinging, a martial arts master who gambles on the life of a former former gambler addicted to the NBC's Nekt Action Star winner. His performance is cold as ice and not in a cool way. The "movie" is taking place in Vegas, and as people play poker, the authors considered it to be the perfect ambience for a movie about a guy trying to survive 24 hours against an ubiquitous, wealthy gambler who offered his goal of $ 2.4 million if he could pass through the day. And so follows the hunt. Hunting in unimaginable explosions, tuning construction sites, bad cinemas and one-way lines that contain the word "bet" or "gambling". The winner was also thrown into the mik, but for what reason I have no idea. Oh, but do not worry about "NAS" fans, losers also make their unforgettable casino. A sudden end will snap off your socks if you like predictability or plagiarism. Joel Silver should once again review his sales decision. I wish I could return those two hours of my life.
