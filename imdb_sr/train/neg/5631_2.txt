The photo on DVD is so dark that I thought the screen died. I think I missed to see half the movie. However, it was badly made and it was not interesting. I did not find a story about the title "Black Widow". I was hoping for a mystery or a thriller, but I did not get involved enough to take care of the first frames. I rented a movie especially for Villem Dafoe and I was sad that he lost his talent. I do not believe that Giada Colagrande has been studying films for a long time to develop the main film. It is attractive and can be developed into an actor, but has taken too many tasks in this movie. Although in real life they are married, they lack chemistry on the screen. Their relationships did not seem convincing. I do not understand why other characters have been included in the plot.
