This series is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. Terrible acting, terrible effects, horrible writing, you get my enthusiasm. The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood that it's incredible. It seems they just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract the audience. Maybe they were called New Adventures of Mr. Bland Acting. Someone before me commented that if you have a fantasy, you love this show. It's a horrible approach to the TV series. Such a visual medium should cause your imagination, you should not force your imagination into something that would make it good. It would be like in Simpson's episode in which they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda film, and he begins to talk about who killed someone or anything else. "If the movie is boring, I'm just making up my story." In conclusion: Absolute human waste.
