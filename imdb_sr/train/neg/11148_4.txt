This is the best example of a low budget, winning what is a good story. Let's return Samaire Armstrong (seeing how he works on the OC, I know he can do better), then find a better scenario and budget. Special effects were so bad, and mostly poorly generated by the computer, that I almost lost it when the first time a wolf was seen on the screen. And the transition of Samaire Armstrong (alert!) Into the insect was done by shrinking it first on the poor GCIF figure before it began to change (people from Final Fantasy, as well as the Pikars made these funny, thinking of a figure like a naked Barbie doll. The story was interesting, although the idea of ​​a bloodline in the wolf-bearers is nothing new, as it also entered the balance between evil, (perhaps) not so evil, and the possible end of the human species should be steamed two lines. The basis of the book of the "insects" that some time made some of the other characters in a way A similar spelling was effective, but it could have been extended in explaining what happened in the past. Bring a better scenario and direction, and I would be back again.
