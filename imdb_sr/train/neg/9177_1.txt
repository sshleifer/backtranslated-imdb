The dead house was the worst film I ever saw, between the pathetic 'matrix' 360 shooting of the camera angle and the bulky acting I fell asleep. I do not think the director and the set manager could decide whether it was raining or not, because there would be rain on one side of the boat, and not another. I would rate this film as one of 10, (10 is the best, 1 is the worst). Also, jumping the scenes from the movie into the game was really boring, it seems like you're wondering if they just made up for lost time. I beg everyone who reads this, not to see him. Not worth the time.
