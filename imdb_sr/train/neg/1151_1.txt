This film was extremely depressing. The characters were so cold. The mother, which is the main character, is all but a "mother". All right, she was dissatisfied with the marriage and always put her husband and children in the first place. Her husband is dying. Then he goes to visit his son and finds out the piece that sleeps with his daughter and ends with him. While this part, the movie is fine. It's not great, but it can be watched. The guy is charming and who can blame him? OK, it's not very motherly to sleep with your daughter's mistress, but let's blame the shock for losing a husband. She becomes completely obsessed with the type. I think that's part of where I started not to love the movie. She is always there, wanting to satisfy him in an "old-fashioned manner" with snacks while he is working at her son's house (I suppose it's the only thing she's learned to do), as if it was the only way she could get the attention . The guy is obviously not very interested (in fact, he seems to have thought about sleeping with her for charity) and instead of being offended, she still begs her to go to bed with her and be kind to her when she becomes very offensive. "I want to satisfy you," he says desperately, while he is very insulted. What has plagued me in this movie is the complete lack of self-esteem that a mother has for herself. Craig speaks something like "I'm just a formless lump" for the first time when they sleep together. This film is an insult to women. If it was me, I would buy myself a small object that would bring me the same pleasure and much less emotional pain ... :)
