With Knightley and O'Tool as the lead, this film had good options, and with McCallum as a bad guy after Knightley, there may have been some tension. But they dropped all that on a stupid evening flute, and later later with the Maudlin's remains of the war. It was, of course, a completely superficial, beautiful English land and sea or not. The first mistake was to throw the knights so early in the movie, when she could easily play someone a couple of years older, instead of choosing someone older than ten years to play a role. They missed every chance of having a big conflict among the actors, and instead they were foolishly pulled over to light and cheap elements of the heart.
