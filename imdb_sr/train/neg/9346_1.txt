This movie has been titling to the credit, it's bored to boredom and the acting is wooden and stiff! However, it was director Richard Jobson who directed the debut, but who on Earth green illuminated the scenario badly developed as this one? It looks like another money for a drainage government project (Scottish Screen is responsible for surprise, surprise). I almost fell asleep three times and my review will, unfortunately, have to be more restrained than this one. Please, please, Mr. Jobson, whatever you do before directing this sedative of the film, go back to him!
