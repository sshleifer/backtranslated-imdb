The break would be a scriptwriter, and his agent (Tom Vood and Arie Gross) would be forced to live in a warehouse run by an eccentric and frightening manager (Ron Perlman) who they believe is a serial killer who terrorizes the city, a "costume killer" because, after injecting his victims into Vindek, he dresses them in silly costumes). They assure him that his life story will make an excellent movie and gather a group of unsuitable filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristi Swanson) and discover that the art of making a movie can be a murder. It has more to do with this film, but unfortunately it is left on the mounting floor and it is displayed (rumor is that the studio wanted a "light" dark comedy). Our loss (and the actors, who all work well and deserve better) because this has an extraordinary black comedy, but only rises to the central sweet. If you're Ron Perlman worshiping this absolutely worth it just for his performance. His comedy is great and has the chance to make some really great impressions (he did not joke when he commented on Hellboi's comments that he needed intervention when interfering with the Jerry Levis regime). He's just fun to watch in this. David Dukes also shines in a two-stage (but crucial) role.
