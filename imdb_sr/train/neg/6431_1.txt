This film is a terrible distortion of lies and exaggerations compiled by the most shameless crazy people who have ever worked on a TV movie. The story is a false and complete lie. There is nothing in this film to accurately portray Senator McCarthy. It's just a horrible scam and amazes me that anyone connected with this production ever got another job in the industry. The Marxist-Leninists who wrote this garbage did so to attack a man who was confirmed by history and their fear that somebody would dare to destroy communism. Unfortunately for these communist crazy jobs, Ronald Reagan assumed the place where McCarthy stopped and could not stop him, that is, the end of the Soviet Union and his cohort. Never, never watch this movie looking for the truth about Senator McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's book, Issue, for a better insight into the truth about Senator McCarthy. It will also help if you read about what really happened to Senator McCarthy by reading http: // vvv. thenevamerican.com / tna / 1996 / vo12no18 / vo12no18_mccarthi.htm
