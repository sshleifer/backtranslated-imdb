I saw the movie late one night on the cable and I could not believe how bad it was. I usually enjoy bad films, but this one was so disgusting that he was not even fun. Some of the highlights of this film include absurd music that is continuously played through the movie, terrible special effects (when someone is shot with a laser gun that transforms into neon green and immediately decays), and disgusting acting. The acting, in fact, is what I feel like stealing the show. I did not recognize any actors in the movie and I hope that I will never have to see them again. All in all, I recommend that you rent this movie (if you can find it, I can not imagine the video store that carries this garbage) just so you can learn to appreciate quality movies after you see this scrap.
