... Wait, I can! This film is not for typical movie snob, unless you want to rely on your typical cinematographic definitions, such as "continuous editing" and "geographic match". I could not say where I was in this movie. One second are in the present, the next minute they are supposedly in the 70th SUV and wearing what looked like 80-style clothes. I think. I could not pay for a long time because the acting was terrible. I think it attracted attention just because there's a 3d that I did not watch. If you are a fan of b-movie, and with a b-movie I mean a bad movie, then this movie is for you. It's a home movie and style without any sense that will keep you laughing as long as you're awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, just skip this one.
