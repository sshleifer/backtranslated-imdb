This is not a movie, it's a 111-minute evangelical-Christian preach that is covered with red American sports, high school football. Another of the long, serious messages converted, which are presumed to have been sparked by the ghost, to go abroad and turn their uninhabited neighbors. Dialogue like "You've won the great when you have accepted Christ" loses all possible complaints in the camp because of the disturbing intensity of the submerged black eyes of the director / trainer Alec Kendrick. Then there are "parables". Two farmers have prayed for rain, but only one has prepared his field to receive it. What do you think God blessed? This rhetorical question aims to predict a marvelous climax, during which the coach asks his shaky backup kicker: "Son, do you think that God could help you do that?" It's a kind of fun we could expect to receive infinitive funding based on faith, only if the hegemonic quest of the evangelical Christian administration in the world convinced us to become "devout" after their example. You see poor Giants coach in the apocalyptic finale, inviting his team to cry "Who's With Me!" while the pious Eagles on the other side quietly continued to do the work of the Lord. So, do you think that our terrible support makes his blow to ruin these self-grievous goliaths? Well, we all know that fanatics can not lose. Put it this way: move the playground to the Middle East deserts, replace Christian proselytism, and this meaningless nonsense can easily be repackaged as a parabola of the Taliban and the supremacy that pious believers of this garbage might think about a minute. Fortunately, they will not care, nor will they have to: as the coach tells his team of serious empty bowls before the game, they are answered here in this book. And the Christian Right will devour this on their way to their Rapture, for that final victory for which they have prepared their fields.
