My friend was acting as an agent of the FEDS (a non-spoken part, as far as I remember). He brought him to a DVD to see him. She was "interesting," but she felt very much like an amateur movie. A well-made amateur movie. It's really boring and badly written. It was probably fun to work and be involved, but definitely did not deserve any broad release. Maybe you would enjoy in Omaha, but this California girl was bored and sincerely felt embarrassed about my friend's participation. If this film producer made more movies, you really should try to have a really interesting story, and GOOD actors. I'm sure this was an excellent learning tool for them. I wish them luck in the future, and I hope to improve my film creativity.
