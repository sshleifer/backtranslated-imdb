this film was made for the Asian / Chinese market, especially for lovers of Jai Chou, one of the biggest music stars in Asia. Jai Chou is a very talented writer / singer. He is central as an actor, although he appeared in several large-scale budget productions ("Initial D", "The Curse of the Golden Flower"). Amazingly, he also won the Golden Horse (Taiwan) and the Hong Kong Film Prize for the "Beginner D". The supporters are very well selected, which appeals to everyone from China. Actors include many famous film / TV actors, singers, even sports commentators (Huang Jiankiang of China). However, they did not have enough time to show their talents. The biggest mistake is that Chu took over the position of the director and writer. He has a reputation for making shallow and meaningless films based on inconsistent scenarios. With their poor directing and lame story, all talented actors, fantastic visual effects and the production money tones are lost. However, the terrible film was successfully redeemed over $ 10 million, perhaps even more in Asian, making this one of the greatest successes in the Asian catalog. Conclusion is: you can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talents are spending, or if you are simply following your kids who are fans of Jai Chou.
