I never saw the old version of 1973. I am Nicholas Cage's fan (by the way, I behave as usual). This film probably took five minutes to complete the whole plot (I see it is done on a cocktail napkin for dinner), if you can not understand the ending of this glory in the first thirty minutes, probably this movie is fun. This is, lately, a terrible routine that Hollywood seems to have dug himself up with a horror / mysterious / thriller genre, unable to give enough credit to the audience and write a fresh, smart and tempting script, they print some nasty music. and drop a few things to jump a little, and then send a final impression to your local theater. At least, he did not have a camera syndrome that was in his hand.
