Shame! There I was, comfortable in the armchair with a beer and a popcorn bag, buried in hope for another great Muppet Night of Fun. What did I get? Dissapointed! How can the Muppetts go from a sublime Christmas Carol to this? Humor was terrible, the songs were worse than Countrie and Western (and that's what's saying), and the plot was as confused and poor as Blind Sing. I think that the main problem is that the attempts of the island of Treasure have become too much of a waste of time. A short story, such as Christmas Carol, is perfect because you can intertwine Muppet's motives ... there is a need to withdraw the plot to stop all the fun. Where are the Muppets? What do you think of the wizard from Oz?
