A film that captures scenes of scenic sightseeing caves. Remember anybody from this film except Michael Pataki who issued extreme pain like JC in "Five the Hard Vai". He's a really boring sheriff to whom I applauded when he practiced a pendrek on our furious doctor. You will most likely laugh the most with seizures Dr. Becka nowhere. Can Mrs. Beck be more wooden? Seriously, if you take a 4-leg branch, put it in a hot tub, you will not be able to notice the difference. Fear and uncertainty look at the clock wondering when the loans will turn. Take a look at it as a late night movie, MSTified, but do not go away.
