After reading some good reviews about this film, I thought it was time to go and see it. Well, I do not know why I was tortured. Basically, this family has been entrusted with a trail leading to a great stock of ancient treasure, hidden by Templar during the independence war. Obviously, it must be kept outside the hands of the British at all costs. First, why did they say that knights move goods from Europe to America? How did Nic Cages figure realize that 'Charlotte' is actually a ship? How do they discover all the traces and riddles in a minute? And how could two people suddenly become masters of thieves and steal what is probably the best preserved paper in the world? These are just some of the holes in this stupid Hollywood campaign. Cage was in some great action movies - Face-Off and The Rock-so why did he go down on this? Is it too old ?! His character is pretty boring - Somehow this 'ordinary' guy steals the Independencd Declaration, tops up thieves with weapons, escapes from the FBI and generally seems invincible. The whole film actually does not make any sense and everything in all this was a pretty disappointment.
