So how did I suppose I know it's "stupid" promotional "Lordi Motion Picture"? I mean, I realized when that dinosaur costume appeared and when the singer performed, I ran the Hard Rock Hallelujah to myself ... even though I hate that song. "Dark Floors" refer to a young autistic girlfriend who is in the process of getting her out of the hospital over a protective father when, like other people in that particular elevator, a moment's spit ... When they arrive on their floor it's rather surprising to discover that there is nobody else. The hospital is empty ... Except for many monsters that chase them for no reason ... They go through corridors and stairs, meet all the members of the band in metal in their unusual, shocking shock. - Wear the costumes ... There is nothing to remember here, except for the stupid acting, the lack of up / nudity, and the extremely shameful promotional edge, which reminds me of "KISS Meet the Fantomas of the Park". Yes, you remember that stupid one? I wish I was not ... I would just recommend that I avoid all these Ghost House movies like fungi and not listen to Lord because they are Guarnans!
