About three minutes into this thing I started fast forwarding, pausing only during nudity (why bad movies always include such good women?). In ten minutes I ended up, and I wanted to get my money back from the store. People who write these films should sanction MPAA. Go writers - bad guys always get in the car with a bomb activated by a remote controller of a good guy! That's how it works since the Ottoman times! Likewise, in order to add insult to the injury, the "turning" in the end was so formatable that it could come from any action movie written in the last 25 years. Burt Reinolds was fine, but he should concentrate on real films. This film is just a waste of time - Run! Run away!
