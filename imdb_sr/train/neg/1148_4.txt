A pedantic, long-standing fabrication attempting to record the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It starts quite promising, with still relevant investigation into the explosion of the aircraft, but the melodrama with James Stevart and wife Vera Miles simply gets on the road (Miles had the habit of playing lousy women under duress, and her nasty nerves come here layout). Distinguished director Mervin Leroi led this adaptation of the book Don Vhitehead, but despite the talent involved, the picture failed to create much impression. The best performance turns Murray Hamilton as Stevart's partner, but most of the dialogue is absurd, and persistent pacing causes the movie to appear twice as long. * 1/2 of ****
