This is what happens when you live in China, and a local video store runs in English - you are blessed with this work of what appears to be Romanian cinema. Still, I think it has real comedy potential. Spojleri technically follow: Although I do not think it would really ruin anyone's pleasure to see why the movie set in the casino has a scene of archery on the beach, even in the flashback. This mystery, and many other riddles, should still be used by desperate comedians, perhaps when it stuck in Bucharest. Allow me to wonder, too, why perfectly good people allow themselves to abuse the film like this. That's sad.
