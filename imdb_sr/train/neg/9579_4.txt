Here's the horror version of PRISCILLA: THE DARK OF THE PASSENGER (jelly!) With Melinda / Mind Clarke as Candi, a deserted man who pulls a bank robbery with boyfriend Johnny (Jason Durr). He ends up in a prison in the south of the border led by a sadistic boss of the screws (turning Robert Englund into a blunt). She and her beloved lovers of puddles hide in the monastery of the gas station until they transform them into a recently meteor. Dogs turn into a disgusting "queen" dear queen, and Candi develops a very long, talkative, killing a language that can not be controlled. The robbers in search of stolen spoils and other various killers add additional complications. First, Clarke is fantastic and real what can be done from this movie. You are watching her and seeing someone very funny during the scene, very persuasive during horror scenes and VERY sexy in various wigs and masks, including an eye-popping, leather latex bodysuit ... and wondering how this actress is not a huge star. It is a pity that the rest of this cult attempt does not fulfill its promise. The guilty saying / scripter Sciamma, who thinks that just a weird premise is enough to keep a laugh ... but his vulgar gagi, boring backing characters and stupid dialogue are not a substitute for a true sense of humor. Another nail in the trunk; the film looks cheap, many colors and sets are unusually dimmed by mud photos and dusty desert locations. Fortunately for Sciamma, Clarke is in her movie, because she keeps you by herself.
