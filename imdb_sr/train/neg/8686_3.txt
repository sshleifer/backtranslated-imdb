I refer to this as a "spoiler" just because of some of my commentary content, not the content itself. While reading the comments, it's obvious that these Republicans somehow tolerate the show, but we dislike it, while Democrats seem to enjoy their so-called truthfulness. One reader even (seems to) actually indicates that he believes that these events occurred or that they could have happened when Bush was in elementary school. is that the group that made this series must be really Bush's hatred. In the episode I last saw, s02e03, it turned out that the program had to be compiled long before McCain became the main nominee candidate; because the other former runners have dominated. Another thing that attracted me attention was the use of accessories in wardrobes. I thought the series was surely made in Europe, certainly not in the United States, because I do not know the home of the US that has no built-in wardrobes, and most likely in the artists' homes. While watching the show, yes, I'm really amazed by it, amazed to see what a great desire the writers must do to do everything that can shame our president. Of course, there are problems like most Americans will agree, but that's no reason to be so hateful at public exhibitions that are seen all over the world. Perhaps this trend is now set by this show and the network, so if they enter Obama or Hilary, will they continue to produce and broadcast the same kind of "humor" about them? Just one more comment comments commentators. If there were any changes in the 2000 elections, according to that writer, he was so sure that there would be a completely different eligible president. Wow, eager to think on his side. As far as the 911 is concerned, I believe that it was launched when Clinton was president, and I can not see that if Gore was the President, anything else.
