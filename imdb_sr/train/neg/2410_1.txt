The Hood of the Dead Dead and all the other films directed by these guys seem to have gathered and recorded this with their friends who have zero talents one afternoon when they were bored (the lines are completely unreliable and unconvincing). I think 95% of amateur movies and 90% of home movies are better than this movie (although the similarities between them justify comparison). "Hey, let's see if somebody is stupid enough to buy our movies!". I hope no one else is. My apology to those involved in the flick as this review is a bit sharper, but I was a drug that read your false reviews and bought a movie.
