My first thoughts about this film were, of course, bad. I was expecting a terrible, stupid acting, a bad party, a funny movie with special effects. What I actually got was not that bad. quite interesting, and the script was actually pretty good and decent. The acting was not bad, and all in all, I enjoyed watching this movie. , and I'm glad to know that this movie managed to drown me, even when it was not so good. All in all, it's a movie to be avoided, but for me it was not as bad as I expected it to be.
