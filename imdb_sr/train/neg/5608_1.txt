I was interested in watching this movie. It seems that many people are excited. I have my own beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I am open to any attitudes or opinions. It does not matter to me whether Jesus existed in the way that is written in the Bible. If Mary was innocent or not, or all other similar pagan coincidences. For me, the idea of ​​salvation, the idea of ​​love, is the only way to find peace in this world. What made me angry is when someone takes a sentence, present it as a fact, without showing the context that is written. For example, they showed in this film a big sentence: "My enemies who did not want to be king over them - bring them here and kill them in front of me" Jesus (Lukas 19:27). I tell you it's a context. Jesus told the story of the evil king. There is no passage in the Bible where Jesus supports killing. He is love! After they quoted the Bible incorrectly, they introduced us to shouting people (pseudo-Christians) filled with hatred. Most viewers do not check the information presented and start thinking about Jesus = hatred = not good for me or for anyone else. It's pure manipulation of people. Please, use your brain. Do not take everything you say in this movie. We destroy our own basis, our civilization if we begin to separate Jesus in this way and the message he has given us. You saw the branch on which you sit.
