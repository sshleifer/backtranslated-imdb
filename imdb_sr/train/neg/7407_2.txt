1st vatched 6/18/2009 ?? 2 out of 10 (Dir-Pete Riski): A strange psychotic film about a girl with autism who is being tested in a hospital, the power flashes, and then all the hell breaks. Frankly, I'm not sure how the intentions of filmmakers were on this one. What we get for the next 1 hour and a half (at least not longer) was the twisting horror / tvilight zone / zombiefest / ghost movie that really ended without any sense to the very end. Initially, after a power outage, everyone disappeared in the hospital except for a small group of unmanaged, including a girl and his father. There is a typical boring character, a creepy old man and a typical guy who is similar to many terrible festivals and, of course, a young girl attracted by the main character. Random things begin to happen at various times as ghosts and monsters appear, a hint that time is dying, and dead people like this little group are trying to escape from what they are in. Of course, the autistic girl is somehow the center of everything and me. I really hate how they used this girl's trouble and insinuated that it was the cause and to put it in a hospital where people care about it is really lame. We never found out the answer to what's happening, which is very weird, so please avoid this dog. Unless you want to be distorted and confused for an hour and a half, it's not for you or any devotee. What a waste of time?
