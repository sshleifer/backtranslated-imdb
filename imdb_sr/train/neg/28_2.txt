This movie is horrible. You do not have to read this review further. If you plan to watch it, it's enough to say - do not (unless you learn how to make a good movie). Through the movie, I thought it was interesting to find someone who spoke and looked like Michael Madsen, only to find out that it was actually him! A new string even for him! The action is terrible. People who claim that they have never seen a decent movie originally or probably unprecedented before. Even under the standard of Hollywood action, this is a horrible movie. Do not look! Instead, go to yoga - at least you will not feel like killing yourself.
