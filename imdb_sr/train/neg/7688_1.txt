A terrific film made in the budget of about $ 9.99. Very obvious miniature sets, bad acting and a terrible story of extraterrestrials using discarded meat from the butcher as fuel for their spaceship were used. The film contains some blood (insufficiently disturbed) and a figure with a blue color that replaces one of his hands. (Yes, you've read it well.) One rescue grace was a song performed on a "shovu talenata" (how about irony?) By the punk / new wave of a band I think was called " 'A A Heat Seeking Missile.' Besides, this is not worth your time, even on a "bad" level. Watch whether you are in raw alien movies, but anyone else needs to keep it clear. Rating: 1 out of 10
