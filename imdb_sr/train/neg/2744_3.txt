I was bored about 22 hours, so I watched this movie. And I could not stop laughing. Everything was so funny. The way children behave as though they were older than 11 years ago just attacked me. One of the kids had a ring, which allegedly killed people after 3 years or more. That gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster. It's quite difficult to seriously understand young children, especially when it comes to eating worms. They act as if everything is so big, as if Billi (the main hero) does not eat worms, then the world will end. that a five-year-old says 'penis'), but not for teens or adults who do not want to spend their time.
