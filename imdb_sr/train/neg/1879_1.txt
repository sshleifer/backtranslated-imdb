It's hard to believe this is a continuation of Henry Fool. It's hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both films. While Henry Fool is refreshing, witty, comical, Fai Grim is slow, boring and does not go anywhere. Where did the wisdom disappear? I am confused. It's been 10 years since I saw Henry Fool, and many of his dialogues and scenes are still alive in my memory. Fai Grim is painful to watch. This is not a mistake by actors who are good (Parker Posei) or great (Jeff Goldblum) - the guilt is entirely in conspiracy, dialogue, and even some of the recordings (low budget is not an excuse). Great disappointment. I'm sorry I could not pay attention to the plot, I was so boring, so disappointed ... if you enjoyed this you might not enjoy so much Henry Fool ... two movies have nothing to do with it with others ... there is no continuity in personality figures ... it's all a scam to get fans of Henry Fool to watch the sequel. Exclude this Now - Henry in some kind of prison with the Taliban?!?!
