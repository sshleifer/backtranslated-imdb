Frustrating and irritating. The scriptwriter does not have a true understanding of human nature, but multiplies the clich√©s in an unrelated manner. Character is not explored in depth. These are dolls that are immersed in a work that openly admits that he needs a dramatic element, a mother's affair with her daughter's mistress. Anne Reid delivers excellent performance despite being given some unusual situations and lines, as she passively says her angry daughter might get stuck in her eyes. The scenario is by Darren (Daniel Craig) as Dr. Jekill / Mr. Hide without any indication why, except he bite cocaine before the big scene. Mature writer could do much more with this topic.
