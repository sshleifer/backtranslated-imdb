Funny little boots that deal with foam and reproduce themselves. So far for the horror elements of this film. The rest of MUNCH is played as a really retarded comedy that's so stupid that it will not be funny after 15 minutes. I can imagine little children who cheer on these little boogers, but adults will only be left with those supposedly "smart" references that are transmitted to things on the screen, such as the records of Captain Kirk from STAR TREK, the most famous scene from ET, a sharp statement by the film's author "Look! We have repaid GREMLINS's success here!" and Clint Eastwood's cardboard clip that tells us ... what's true about his Western films? That last one is completely lost to me ... Oh, yes, and the disposal of chemical waste in the cave seems to be a bad thing. I do not know where they got this idea. I do not say that MUNCH is the most unfavorable film in which one can sit down. It's really, really stupid. And if you manage to crack a smile while you are watching it, you will probably feel stupid that you did it after the movie was finished. Good evil? Yes, but only if the "stupid", "retarded" and "ridiculous" criteria you are looking for. 3/10 and, well, uh, 6/10.
