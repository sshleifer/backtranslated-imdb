This movie . . . I do not know. Why would I take such an unmistakable character like Pippi Long Sock and throw an unusually charming Tami Erin, I will never know. Why spend money on the art direction and some non-all-bad special effects, then they did not bother to edit it properly, I will never find out. Why are sets and costumes sometimes in a period, and sometimes bizarre, why they ordered those bad songs, why the script does not make any sense (even on a dumb, childlike movie). . . . what did they think? Nothing about this movie is exactly the way it should be. Each part is synchronized (and always bad), every sound effect is a little wrong, each change is in the wrong place, each performance is bad in some way. It succeeds in creating an appropriate atmosphere, despite all the problems, but NEVER does not record the magic that is the creativity of Astrid Lindgren.
