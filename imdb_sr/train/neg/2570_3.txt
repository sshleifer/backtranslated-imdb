I read that "The Girl in My Soul" came out during the low period of Peter Sellers. Watching a movie, I'm not surprised. Almost nothing does not happen in the movie. Apparently, the presence of Sellie and Goldie Havn should help the movie; it's not. The whole movie seems to have randomly recorded everything that happened without anything. Maybe I did not see every movie about middle-aged people for older people who are trying to be a hippie, but this movie gives a pretty bad name. much better movies than this, so do not waste time on this. Pretty worthless.
