I chose this movie to replace the sad choice of daily television and go with the thirst for femme fatales. Well, for the previous one, it's better than daily television ... although I'm not sure how much. It has its own points, but after the first 20-30 minutes, the good points are shifting and it comes to the conclusion that they watch a movie made for a TV that is made up with little time to do something that will to be held together. In short, an awful film of the Sci Fi channel type. It has its own points like the future dirty, like the "Blade Runner" showed ..... of course, this is not a "Blade Runner." Captain looks, he kind of feels like actor Robert Forster , the person he might be nearby. But, unfortunately, he rather feels like a poor "Andromeda" rehash where the crew's muscle consists of poor copies of smart artillery "aliens," the mysticism of Vampire Villov is sexually intensified , and the new captain could be like Jan-Michael Vincent running around "Danger Island" in "Banana Splits"; he only put uniforms with elephants, there are very few rights to that. They all run around with their version of the lunar force inside a ship that looks very similar to Eureka Maru because they fight against the class of 'people' that occupy the universe and are shattered to several different tribes or sects of various evolutionist traits ....... like Nietzcheans in "Andromeda." Perhaps they will have the edge with Michael Ironside, but after a while, he gets the feeling that he took the role as a hoot! Probably having fun doing it, but he does not help the movie. It's ..... "okay". OK in the way you can watch the DVD once without shutting down; if they watch it with commercials, they will probably change the channel. You could look at one thing .......... but a few hours later, you wonder what made them see it all. For me it was femme fatale. ............ when she fought.
