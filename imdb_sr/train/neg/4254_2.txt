I can not believe that the same guy directed this shit and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh and well written, if it behaved poorly. Starts defeating Dracula at the end of Drakule 2000. Then he ignores the narration after which he describes what happened after that. Narrative tracking could somehow make a good sequel, but Craven decided to go into the style of his older films, without a good connection, but the name of the main criminal. different (from dark hair in Dracula 2000 to blonde here). Avoid this movie if you have respect for your taste in movies.
