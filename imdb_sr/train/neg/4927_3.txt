Lois Weber, a self-proclaimed missionary through the film, wrote, directed and produced other films about controversial topics, but this may be the first to get wide-ranging, thanks to TCM. This film is her indictment of abortion, but she cleverly confuses the problem by bringing eugenics and birth control, leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion. Her talent in writing and other film skills here are well presented, but can be forgiven for wanting to use less of them didactically. If you wondered what Tirone Pover looked like, Jr. "Famous father", here's your chance. In 1916, fashion and cars were also exhibited to contribute to the interest of this museum piece. It's pleasant even if you do not appreciate the propaganda.
