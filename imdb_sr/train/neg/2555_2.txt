This film is probably one of the most terrible horrors I've ever seen. The length was not long enough to include a good story. Also, the way the feeders died was simply meaningless. The mother suddenly dies from falling through the shower after she stumbles on the action figure, and the dad kills a policeman? I can see where some originality may have been what they went for, but it could have been better. Also, the hype of all of this made me push myself to stop before it was over. After I listened to Luci's name and realized that it was Lucifer, I wanted to get stuck. Yes, it is interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. It's a male name. It needs to be given a male character. All in all, the film was boring and could have used a better plot.
