This beautifully captured and scripted episode was omitted for two reasons. 1) It may be the morality of the fifties of the last century, but no man who remained alone on the asteroid for years would react with such a hysterical negativity to the gift of female androids. 2) It was not at all an android, but a woman, beautiful Jean Marsh. The popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origin to this episode if I did it properly. In fact, the modernization of sexual robots is in the news as I speak. . Her leanness would then add a creepy element. Instead, it becomes a beautiful little love story about two people in a distant star. The twilight zone always provided imagination and gullibility. Normally nobody cares. But this episode seemed to be a limited Calvinistic morality that avoided what would mean masturbation with a machine, or complete negligence.
