The virgin virgins are so bizarre and incomprehensible that they allow the viewer to interpret them subjectively, applying whatever meaning he wants with his inexplicable excesses of sex and violence. If this was an intentional feature of the film, it would be the work of postmodern brilliance - but of course not. Without excessive plotting, let's make a quick tour of the events. In the hidden cabin, there is an orgy that involves wrestling in toples and diaper. In later years, organs are in progress, but unconsciously followed by a monster that I like to call "muddy ninja". This monster precedes the killing of the orgies one by one, except for the virgin virgin (if you do not count oral sex) that receives its seed and thus becomes so passionate as to want to masturbate with someone's cut off arm. She finally pulled out her gut, and there is a scene that seems to imply that she is pregnant with a muddy ninja. You got all that? If you want to rent this movie, it's best not to speak Japanese and you do not have subtitles. In a season filled with boring Hollywood shifts, putting this into your VCR can be a movie equivalent of shock therapy. It will surely be something else.
