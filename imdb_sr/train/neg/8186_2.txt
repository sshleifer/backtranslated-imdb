Has anyone read the script? This must be something of the worst writing and directing throughout the year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Veisz and Miranda Richardson could not get this out. Approximately two-thirds seem to have Giamatti's eyes talking, I can not believe I signed the contract. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's on a really bad Christmas movie list. There are not enough lines, but what else can I say? Okay, the movie does not move with Vaughn's dialogue, his character is just a creepy guy who just can not get through. It was just a dark walk through which no one seemed to be able to enter.
