Okay, after watching this empowering movie and losing an hour and so many minutes of my life here is the basic summary: Genie comes out of ghetto boom, gives this child hairy hair 3 wishes, the child loses his desires for oblivion, shaky shit in the tail, and I guess that's the case. So I was laughing mostly, I cried ... but mostly I was laughing at the sloppy comedy that came out of the wonderful acting nba plaier / rapper and the hairy hair guy. I recommend this film for kids from college sitting and drinking beer with their close friends and seriously they need a good laugh. I will give him only 3 out of 10 b / c. The film is based on 3 magical wishes. If I had 3 wishes, I would delete this horrible movie and that everyone pretended that Hollivood was not wasting money on this.
