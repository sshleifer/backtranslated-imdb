I've heard (and read) so many good things about Veeds that I was looking forward to getting attached to another great series of cables (such as Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men), but it slowly eroded with every episode I watched from the first season. (did not pass the first six episodes) Writing was non-original, fictitious and showing black people embarrassing. Dialogue was forced, as writers are trying to be exaggerated and smart. It was a rare moment when I actually sounded a laugh. The characters were never developed enough to take care of them, they were selfish and irresistible. I am absolutely crippled by the addition of cockroaches (which was supposed to be returned to Catch the Predator) and the removal of Hood's daughter Kuinn from the actors by sending me to the boarding school in Mexico was so neoriginal and clich√©, I had to conclude that the writers tested the loyalty of viewers. The episode after the episode less I liked the characters and I could not go past many technical shortcomings in the story. Besides this I heard that the second season was not so good, so I lost all the motivation to continue watching this show. If you are a fan of good casting and writing, I suppose this show will be a challenge for you to like, unless you are naturally dashed and then all bets are off.
