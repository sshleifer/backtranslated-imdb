with all the European studios involved in this, you would think to get some nice photo; but the local color is minimized. Irritation br. The story is hopelessly confused. There is an assumed romantic story that is deliberately confused - is she or not a lesbian? - for no purpose. Police officers in the film are the stupidest thing they have been wearing for a long time as a serial killer. There seems to be some kind of message about the Spanish civil war in the mid-1930s, but since almost everything is included dead, there is no point in that. Part of the narration (which part can anyone say), you can never even look at the battle with bulls. Earnest Hemingway would have hit the director in the nose - my blessing.
