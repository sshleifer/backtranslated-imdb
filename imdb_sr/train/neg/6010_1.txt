This film is perhaps one of the most lonely films in 2000 that I've seen! Especially music does not create uncertainty when people suddenly disappear. Such aspects, such as the military situation, are not treated with the necessary seriousness. The story itself has problems: the UN could never take power over the whole world, because only the United States would not allow this, but not countries like China, Russia, Japan, etc. This would also be played against someone trying to take over the world as Nikolae Carpathia does. This reminds me of James Bond films, but they have more action! Of course, the film is made for Christians and only for Christians and they can enjoy it. Since I can not consider myself a Christian, I consider the whole idea to be ridiculous. It seems that this prophecy, if it is believed to be true, is dangerous to other prophecies of cults for the end of the world. Why be afraid of such opportunities when we can make life as good as possible here on Earth
