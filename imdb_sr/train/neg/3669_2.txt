I really can not think of anything good about this movie ... nor one thing. The script is a nightmare. The writer blurs the boundary between chemical and biological properties and does not seem to understand the difference. I would think that at least they would get a technical advisor. The performances were bad by most actors ... although I really do not blame them, the material really stinks. The editing was equally bad. Now I'll stop ... everything is bad 2/10
