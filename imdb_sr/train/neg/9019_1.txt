Why else would you do that to me? It's not that I expect Dean Cain to produce hit movies. Or even decent movies. I've seen Lois and Clark, I'm aware of how ... "good" Dean Cain. Obviously, this will be a great movie, and each movie has its own special way to make it all over your head. I'm not going to call these spoilers because you can not really ruin this movie more than it already is. For starters ... why is this a fake helicopter? I mean ... why? How is that a Chicago scientist and that another scientist from LA and none of them could be more Eastern European if you tried? How hard would it be to get either an American actor, or just change that lame state sheet that gives us a movie to say that these people are not American? Why are two times when the film gives us a line of snails? We got a helipad-day, and then a kaspanski day later. And that's it, who cares about the timeline. To be honest, who was worried about it even when they mentioned it, but I guess it does not matter. Does the movie really improve if you can see it through multiple screens? The answer is no. This dragon can safely walk down the corridor ... and over ... and over ... and over ... </ br>> Who on earth was responsible for one from the worst endings in film history? That was exactly from Scooby doo. Oh, the dragon is now dead ... say, will you have dinner? Of course, but not in some Chinese place .... with a dragon in the name !! AH HA HA HA !! HAHAHA !! HAHAHA! I was Superman! AHA HA HA! HA-HA! Blending to Black <br /> <i> God, it made me so stupid. But I never fear ... although the whole building has exploded ... and no one has stayed alive .. for some reason there is another intact, idler laboratory that has pretty well survived, so I can make a sequel. Time for all of us. <br /> <br />
