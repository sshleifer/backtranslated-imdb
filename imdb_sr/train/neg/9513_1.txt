I tried to watch this movie three times. The night I rented it. It's been about 20 minutes in the hope that it will be better to rest. I watched another 15 days the next day, almost vowing how stupid it was ... It was not even ridiculously stupid that it was sometimes a fun movie to watch, but this movie was just bullshit with a big S (if you know what I mean a censored world in which we live). And at the end of the third day, I watched over an hour of nonsense and I did not enjoy at any time! No one. How this script became green. Oh, boy! G / G 1/10 - one for cheerleaders ... deserves at least something for all of his works.
