Wow, I knew this movie would be bad, but not so bad. Roddy Roddy Piper is a sickly retired retired cop (clich√©!), Who helps everyone - he smiles as a patient after an operative lobotomy and complains about his dead son. His adopted son returns from the Special Forces Armed Forces and because he is "seen" - is shown by pressing his teeth if somebody mentions anything about the past. It's time to clean the streets of another guy who once knew Piper and his dead son (who killed a bad guy) and his adopted son. \ T has no reason to want to jump on the bones of an ex-soldier. This happens in about 2 minutes from one scene. The action could save this film, but it's even worse than the story and acting. Everything was done earlier, everything was done much better (Ong-Bak is a great example). This is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I watched Vatervorld twice. Erm, the film is called THE CHAST (It's written wrong for Americans) and the label has "from the creators of Bloodsport and Kickbokers" - see other films by director David Vorths and you will soon understand why they put these two films there, although they have over 10 years. Such classics as "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" - all that really says. I'll give you 10 pounds if you do not go to see this movie. PS - I apologize for the unknown names of characters, yet I tell you something.
