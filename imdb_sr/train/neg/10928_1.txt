I just watched this movie, and what a waste of time. The film was predictable and slow. Basically there are Mormon bad news that play the church. Instead of watching this movie, I should have a root canal. The Kamey appearances were obviously initiated by sponsorship / funding. This film had the potential for unintentional behavior shown by mormons when playing church basketball, but because it was rated PG, the real nature of the spectacle could not be transferred to the movie. The acting is terrible with the exception of Clint Hauard and Fred Willard. The appearance of Thurle Bailey in the film was completely unnecessary.
