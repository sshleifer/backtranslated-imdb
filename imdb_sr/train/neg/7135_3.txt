I'm sorry to say that there is no way, in my opinion, that Enzo could really be able to keep up with the Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The advantage of the S7 would be too great. The S7 has a power ratio of 3.93 lbs / hp while Enzo has 4.61 lbs / hp. The S7s loving end is much better. I'm sorry about Ferrari fans, but Saleen does it much better. As for other parts of this film, I just have to say that it is so substandard that it's pathetic. The story is too weak. The play in this lemon is worse than daily soap. I can say it as much as it's debating about negative psychology. This film is nothing but an obvious definition of what narcissism and sociopathy are. Everything revolves around these rich punkers who get their stones while showing only the traces of acting remorse for all innocent traffic participants who also cause injuries or death. I can not give a movie "1 star" because it did not make me really get out of the theater. I also think he has an incredibly beautiful brunette with murderous blue eyes as the leading woman who is preparing him to be completely hopeless .... although there is no way to put her singing on the cover of 'Variety'. The type that plays Jason is SOOOOO jumping version of James Vanderbeek.
