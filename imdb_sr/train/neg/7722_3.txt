An extremely bad action movie in the main role of wooden Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee, trapped in the role of an assistant who never looks like a gel. The action is at best an average, a little nudity squeezed and that Tia Carrera uses a double body! Setting up is a common reconnaissance officer who is forced to break a new partner on a big case, makers are trying at least to give formulas to Lundgren cop with Oriental values ​​and Lee's modern city skates, but there is a zero character development that makes him The almost comical, Lundgrens oriental warfare outfit for a big bribe must be seen to be believed. Action sequences are by numbers, and Lee (who would continue to make a great crow) never got the chance to show any special brilliance of martial arts. But, bearing in mind his glorious origins, he had to be under great pressure and was much better off, without having to live up to his father, taking on a very different role in Vranje, who showed how a unique actor might have become if not for his tragic and early death. Unless your hardcore Lundgren fan or fan of poor film action movies of the 80s (I think Cobra etc.) then avoid. Bad 3/10
