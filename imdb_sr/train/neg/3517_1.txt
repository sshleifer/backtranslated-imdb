I do not know who wrote the script for this film, but I was irritated at first. Of all the possible decisions that could be made in the mountains, why make the decision, which is the most dangerous of all? Why do criminals behave stupidly, even though they managed to get a huge amount of money from the bank and get out of it? Why does not the main criminal hijack a helicopter, kill Stallone, grab money and fly off with chickens like a hostage? And there are more cases of illogical behavior. I would give this film 5 points for a nice action and a great landscape landscape, but due to illogical behavior of the characters, I can only give this movie 1 point ...
