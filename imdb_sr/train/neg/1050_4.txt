Nathan Detroit is working on illegal high-roller games in the NIC, but the heat is on and he can not find a secure location. Bet on that chronic ski gamer Ski Masterson that Ski can not force the primary missionary, Sarah Brovn, to go to dinner with him. The sky takes on the challenge, but both men have some surprises? This is one of those fifty MGM musicals in tight colors, with great sets, loud music, roles greater than life and performances that fit; Broadway pictures for a big screen if you like things like this, which I do not know. My main problem with such films is simply music. I love all kinds of music, from Albinonia to ZZ Top, but Broadvai shov melodies at the time of swing with a constant pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet flourish at the end of every fourth bar are not my cup of tea. This was written by the tag of the team of Frank Loesser, Mankievic, Jo Sverling and Abe Burrows (based on several stories about Damon Runion), and while the action is pretty kind, the songs are poor. Blaine's two numbers are, for example, identical, unnecessary, not progressing toward conspiracies and rubbing in their ears (and they are also flagrantly misogynistic if such a thing is bothering you). There are only two unforgettable melodies, "Luck Be A Ladi" (sung by Brando, not Sinatra as you expected) and Sit, Rockin 'Boat (beautifully performed by Kaia), but you have to sit through two hours to get them. The main trump of the film is the young Brando who gives a thoughtful, relaxed performance; also sings very well and even a little dances, and evenly matches with always interesting Simmons. The sequence in which the two of them are fleeing to Havana for the night is a welcome break from Noo Iavka's noise, burglary and murder. Musical fans can dig this, but in my opinion, a musical must do something more than just a movie show.
