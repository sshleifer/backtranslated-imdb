This is the only worst movie I've ever seen. Let me repeat it again: THIS IS ONE BEST FILM I AM SHOWED. He had all the bad ears of a bad movie: mistakes in continuity, bad writing, bad behavior, poor production value, bad music. I thought there were a couple of points for horror movies. First, it should be tense enough to scare you. This film also gets F in this category. The other thing is that when a person dies, or something bad happens to them, we should take care. This film also gets F in this regard. First story, a woman gets a sword sword after she feared it would happen to her. The next story, CSO, dies of carelessness and conversation with a dead friend. Oh, and there's a terrible story about a bad roommate. Come on, can you choose topics that are a little more interesting and somewhat less than being alone in the house, to be anal-holding, and having a roommate? It turns out that all these stories are hallucinations, a virtual reality initiated by the Doctor, who uses it alone. Wow, stupid. Allow me to explain something, I enjoy watching bad horor movies and laughing how bad they are. I can not do this with this. It was the ultimate pain to sit and watch. Under no circumstances do you watch this movie. You'll regret it.
