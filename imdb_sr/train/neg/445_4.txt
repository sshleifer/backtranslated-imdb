One thing that amazed me about this film (and not in a good way) is that Nathan Stoltzfus, who seems to be proud of being the main historian of Rosenstrasse, was one of the historians who worked on this film, given many real events have been changed or ignored. The other reviewer said that Von Trott said she never thought that Lena lay down Gebels, but in that case, why did she leave any impression that this happened? Why not show other possible reasons for the release of men, such as the Stalingrad disaster, or the fear of the Nazis that the international media, headquartered in Berlin, will find out about the protest. Also, why did the whole story play another violin of the bad story of family attachment that was performed over and over again? It must be something as horrible as it can carry its history! In places it was as if the film had two stories that seemed to have little in common. All in all, this film did not succeed in its goal, which was to draw attention to a little-known act. Resistance, which is a shame, because it was done better, could have a big impact.
