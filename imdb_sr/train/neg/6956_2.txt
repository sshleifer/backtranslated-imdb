I'm sorry, but every time I see a movie in which a woman strikes a man, and a man does nothing but a movie, the film loses all credibility. Thus, the new (woman) Starbuck immediately ruined the action before she even came down from the ground (without a boring intention). Dirk Benedict was much more convincing as a sensitive type of hero than Kattee Sackhoff, who will in future be regarded as "a striking, exciting, compulsory, revolutionary performance", politically correct. newspapers on today's transparent copies; but essentially, it's just a tired, old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a city house: the biggest clich√© on the screen today. Maybe I'm giving this series another photo, but only the caricatures of people will not keep me aloof. As James Hilton once complained, "The story, please, just tell me."
