This waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great movie. Nothing new or original is added except Perry's backflash, which are of marginal interest. It lacks the documentary feeling of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective. There is also a painful lack of a sharp Kuinci Jones soundtrack that has contributed much to the original movie. I do not understand any high marks for this. It's pretty bad. Why is someone wasting time and money making such a shit and why I lost my time watching him?
