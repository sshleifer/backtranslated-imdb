After listening to this film for years, I finally decided to rent and watch it. Let me say that I'm glad that the rent was free from the local library. This move was slow, dull, unreal, and the plot did not make sense. After 2 hours, I was ready to crush that underwater Texas city and put a group of these characters out of their misery. I understand that the taste is subjective, but believe me, I just do not understand all the hypo if I heard about this movie. Dallas provided such a good detail of life in Texas as this movie. Rent it only if you want to understand how film studios can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the public that a bad movie is good.
