I have no idea who audience director George Schlatter hoped to sell this comedy. With Redd Fokkom in the central role and enough pieces of glove and polyester for the carpet of the seventies, "Norman" plays as a picture in combination with any number of stupid series that include comical misunderstandings, not to mention the elongated cavalry Vailon Flovers! Based on the performance of Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this story of the alienated couple (Fokk and Pearl Bailey) teaches that their son is secretly gay - and lives with grinding, a white homosexual - he has enough limping. jokes for the embarrassment of any early episode of the Tri's Compani. Bailey maintains his dignity, and Fokka's pure confusion is good for a couple of sneaks, but other performers are humiliated. * from the ****
