There are two reasons why I did not give 1 for this movie. One of the reasons is some of the actors (such as Malcolm McDovell and Gvinith Valsh) who tried to play on their usually good acting level. However, in many scenes they were somehow blocked by bad scripts. Another reason is a good idea and a look at cyborg, which is completely different from most of the other roles I have seen so far. Everything else in this movie is just as bad as it can be. Boring scenes, useless and boring dialogues, bad script work. And it seemed to be the first movie for many actors. Maybe it was an interesting story, but they were completely gone.
