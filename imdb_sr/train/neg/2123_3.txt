I'm going to UCSB and I attend classes with executive producer, Alison Anders. She is a wonderful teacher and director, so everything she put in her own name, I think she must be pretty good. This film, as a selection at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, looked like a good choice. While this film included some beautiful shots and cinema, the lack of story and coherence really took away everything he tried to accomplish. My main problem was that this was somebody's first movie and you obviously could have said it. The bad acting and worse scenario stopped this film. Soundtrack had some good music that gave the feeling to the main characters who were struggling to cope with the sadness that led to his departure and now returns the place where he grew up. I just have to say that, despite some of the better crafts of the film, the lack of a story and performance really prevented it from being something good.
