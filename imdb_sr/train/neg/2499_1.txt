The actors of this film include some of the better actors of the New Zealanders, many of whom have seen incredible roles, but this film fills me with deep shame just because I am from the same country as they are. False American accents are the first clue that things go spectacularly wrong. As another review, which is quite obviously noticed, a luxury cruise ship is in fact an old ferry for cars, decorated with several color flags stolen from a used car. Most actors seem to be from the (big) long Neveland Soap Shortland Street soap. As if this film was conceived at the Christmas party in Shortland, the result of an excessive number of gin, and perhaps a little salmonella. Imagine "Under Siege" to get to know the "Love Boat", set up at your local primary school under the direction of autism, and get an idea. If you are an actor, I recommend you take a look at this film as a study on how to destroy your guardian.
