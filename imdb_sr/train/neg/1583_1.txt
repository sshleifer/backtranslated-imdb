I'm a big fan of Stephen King. I loved the Man running. So, obviously, I was very excited that somebody made a movie. And when the local network showed the film, I was in the sky. I was ready for a night party! The first indication that something is wrong is when I noticed that someone threw Arnold Schwarzenegger. I simply could not believe that a man who became famous for films filled with running 'shooting' could play a cunning part, as described in the book. Still, I was convinced that it would be a good movie. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents? Well, it is not. Soon I learned that the only reason he even acted was that somebody had processed the whole story in order to make it about a 'shoot' fight. Yes, it was a standard Arnold movie: the hero was wrong, the hero solves problems by bending his powerful muscles and scaring everyone, and the hero gets a girlfriend. This is not what the book said at all. I know that books can not be put on the screen literally, but it did not have anything to do with the book. Stephen King had to openly condemn any association with the film and should have banned the use of the name "The Man Running" for this shameless loss of film. I do not speak this often, but this film is BAD. If I were not at home and watching, I would throw a rotten tomato on the screen. Once again: bad. (Remember that I used "someone" a lot. I did it because I'm sure many people are ashamed that they were working on it and I do not want to embarrass them even more by calling them here )
