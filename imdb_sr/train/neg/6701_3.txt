I've been an ecologist for years and I really enjoyed this show. I set him up to record all the episodes, because I thought I could really learn some great new things. I could probably walk past Rachelle. I'm sure a lot of things are organized to look like real shov and to like that class of viewers. It does not work for someone who is really interested in improving the planet. This show should be called Rug with Rachelle. it may be another performance that is really serious about the environment of a good idea. It's not necessary for some of us to mess things up. I no longer record an episode or watch a show, but let me know if it's a real green show.
