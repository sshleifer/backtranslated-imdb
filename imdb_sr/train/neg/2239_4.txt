The action has already been described by other reviewers, so I will simply add that my reason to see this film was to see Gabriel Drake in all of his undoubted glory. the most sexiest, most beautiful examples of "stylish allies" that were devoted to celluloid. From its era and the like, only equally exceptional Jane Asher is coming close. What about the actresses with the music brothers? (Nik Drake and Peter Asher) For those who love me, Gabriel admired, her scenes in this movie will not disappoint. It has a magnificent figure, and none of it has been left imaginative here. Overall, the film is very bad and of its time, very inexpensive. The song covering initial loans seems to last forever and terribly.
