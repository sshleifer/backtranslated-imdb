I did not expect much from this film after the terrible "Life is a Miracle". It turns out that this movie is ten times worse than "Life ...". I have the impression that the director / writer just jokes with the audience: "let me see how much of the void can (the audience) resist". Dialogues are empty, ... the scenario is minimal. In a few moments, the photo is really good. A few sarcastic lines are half-funny, but it is difficult to sincerely laugh during this "comedy." I laughed at myself that I could watch the movie to the end. If you rise above the fiasco of this director, ... you will find a good acting of several legends (Miki Manojlović, Aleksandar Berček), and very good performances by Emir's son Stribor Kusturica. In short: It's a pity for such a good director! Emir Kusturica is still young and should record the best rated films. Instead, he decided to make this low-budget film only for my private theater, with an arrogant attitude towards world trends and dismay for old fans.
