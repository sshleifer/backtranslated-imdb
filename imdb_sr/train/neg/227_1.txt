Was this a comedy or a serious drama? This film begins with a carefree scarf among the three women. Fine. She turns into a conflict between women when one of them gets to know a man. Fine. There are several antiques among them. Fine. But when the work is thick and finally becomes black, I began to wonder if I misinterpreted the first part of the film. It continues in this vein for some time until, in the end, it does not try to return to the original light heart. But now it's too late. It's hard to figure out why these women would still talk to each other and the finals are unconvincing. Indeed, a lesson (anyway for British filmmakers) about how not to film movies. It's hard to see how manufacturers have ever found out that this movie will work. And boxing showed that it was a real flop because I never heard of this movie until this weekend (four years after its release).
