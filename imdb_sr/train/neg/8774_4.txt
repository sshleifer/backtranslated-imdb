Story: A 4-hour film shows adequate details about events in the Kargil area near the LOC in 1999, when Pakistani infiltrators crossed the LOC and entered deep into Indian territory and Indian vengeance. To find out more about this story, I suggest readers to read news related to Kargil. Comment: If someone is looking for a story about the formula in this movie, then you can be sure that it is absent. LOC is a story of pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage, and a lot of bullets and blood. The movie room I was watching in this movie was full of whistles and calls when the film shows Indian courage. The film's audience seemed like a crowd like in a cricket match in India and Pak. Watch the film as a tribute to the sacrifice of the army and the characterization of real-life war heroes (4 PVC hero parts) who sacrificed their lives to be able to see this day. The film made a brilliant view of the army that struggled with all odds in difficult weather conditions. Negative films are too stretched and the songs are extremely boring.
