This film is the ultimate waste of time, the action is terrible, the dialogue is terrible. Playing is fine, but the actors have no complication or script to work. Photography and some of the special effects are fine, but again there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch. There is no logical progress in the story, the story is completely meaningless. It's not even scary. To make the movie terrifying, there must be at least a small element of conviction. This film has no conviction. In the film there are only three signs. Each character is shallow and has no personality. Most of the special effects and make ups are poorly made, or to a large extent central. they were curious to see a totally horrible movie.
