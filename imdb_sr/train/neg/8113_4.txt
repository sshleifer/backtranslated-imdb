POPEIE AND BIG FOOT **; POPEIE'S ENGINE COMPANY **; I KNOW THE POUND ** 1/2 I used them as a kid, but I caught one episode of the series that consisted of three caricatures, now a few years later (preceded by the theatrical projection of the pirate yarn RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS [1953]), I see how they do not keep all this good! The character Popeie is not very compassionate to begin with, Olive Oil is extremely proud, and Bluto's antiquity has failed to cause much interest either. In short, the scripts were alarmingly thin, rather terrible and generally incapable of lifting. They are strictly underage, but I doubt that today's children would even have the patience to keep them! Moreover, the style of animation is unattractive. Taking every short one, I suppose they have improved from one to the other: after the initial shock, one adapted to its core quality as it was, so the third cartoon easily results in being the most entertaining ? Pope is a trusted army of mascot of camouflage goat whose huge appetite does not cause the end of evil (barely genuine, I know, but always a fun trick). One of the interesting elements was that shorts were stored with Popeye by delivering moralistic parts of wisdom to children in the audience.
