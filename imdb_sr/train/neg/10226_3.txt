"Do not try to watch this movie" would be a better tip if you love Marilyn Monroe in her other roles. This was a great disappointment given the great role, not just Marilyn. The story was nothing but surely anything similar to the VHS box, of course. There was simply no tension, precious little excitement and too dumb places, most of them trying to show why the "Nelly" (Monroe) was so confused. It was not a good role for Monroe, although I did not have to see that this character knows he can act. "Some Like It Hot" was good enough proof for me. But this role was simply not suitable for her, and it's no surprise that she was not one of her more popular movies. Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagnei, Donna Cocoran and others. Summary: It's not a fun and fun game.
