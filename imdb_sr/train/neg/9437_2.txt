I've never really considered myself a "student" when it comes to watching movies, watching them, forming an opinion, and that's it. But Unhinged has changed all this. This film is undoubtedly the most comfortable attempt to shoot movies that I have ever seen. Every kid who at the university is thought to be the next Spielberg or Tarantino, this film should be handed over with a manual titled "How to not make a movie". Not only does not have a story, even the filmmakers were not competent enough to make a movie worth watching. It's been a long time since I saw it, but all I can say is to watch footage overhead in the introductory scenes. They never stop! It's almost like your teeth dragging, but not so much fun.
