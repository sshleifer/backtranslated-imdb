It's astonishing that this movie turns out to be one of my hitters. It's by far the worst movie I've ever seen. this feature is not even close to getting, but one of the angles of my mouth is slightly tilted. After the first, very unpleasant part, you hope that the other parts will be a little bit better. In vain you hope, from there it goes just downhill. The film has no story worth telling and repeats this story three times. We can only hope that with some miracle all the remaining copies of this film will be lost forever, and Trent Harris will never lay hands on the camera again ...
