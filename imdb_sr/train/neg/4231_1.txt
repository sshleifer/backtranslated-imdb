I felt obliged to watch this movie all the way, because I found it in a cheap bucket and bought it for my own, but I came to many times to exclude it and write off the money I paid. If you are a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is OK. If there is something that the creators of this film know, it is the creative use of false blood and parts of the body for a painful effect. If that will not delight you, then hold on. This film was filmed on a home video camera, with school equipment and horrible actors. It's synchronized with German, but even if we allow it, the sound is terrible. This film is the same budget as the budget, except for the above-mentioned special effects. If they spent a little more money on the actors and made a script instead of blood and courage, the movie could be a bit more pleasant. The story is about three men who land on an inhabited island army of kosher saddles. They are trapped, and the rest of the film is about their attempt to escape. I call it the poem in the weakest sense, because it is actually a series of scenes of torture and fights that are dictated by diamond dialogue filled with indecency. as foolish up there. Consider yourself warned.
