If you've seen much less movies, this could be great for you. If you've seen a lot of movies, this is a joke. The act of real heroes is shown very badly. Not to mention, there are songs, there are many flashbacks, and most importantly, the scene of the fight is stupidly performed. New characters, good direction, would have a better job, but since they contain all the heroic heroines / heroines, you can predict what will happen next. You do not feel sad when something happens, the emotions they say are terrible, mainly because we saw this actor in 1000 other Hindi films. It's assumed to be a real movie, but it does not show. Sometimes you are wondering, you have thousands of military vehicles loaded with soldiers moving and Pakistani bombarding them and none of their bombs hit them. Are the packages very bad for the goal or have the director made them stupid? There were only a few characters who played what was very good, but as for the plot, the action, it's poorly directed. This movie could have been short if the songs, memories, memos were taken out.
