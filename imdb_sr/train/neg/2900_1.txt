I have a rule of 5 minutes (sometimes I'll leave a levai for 10). If the movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes, it probably will not be better. I have not yet experienced any of the films that proved to contradict this theory. Day in real life is definitely not an exception. I watched this turkey and thought; Wow, this is not funny, it does not touch, it's not sad, and I do not like a single character. The story of a columnist / widow who was raised by three young daughters, love with his brothers. I suppose the slogan would be a "columnist of advice that could use the advice"? I do not know. The character has not in any way hit me as someone who is able to give advice. I suppose that's the irony? I do not know. He goes to see his parents, brothers, sisters and their children in some type of family vacation, which seems to be very sweet, and potential food for a good comedy, a story ... nothing that ever appears. The central story is basically how she loves this woman, but she can not have it. Anyone with a pulse will realize that it will ultimately benefit, but you have to suffer through a painfully awkward, banal, lifelong movie dialogue "killer of love" to reach the inevitable happy ending. is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
