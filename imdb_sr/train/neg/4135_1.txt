This film was so bad that I had to speed up most of it to get to the good parts. What good things? The only thing that was worth was the end (those who saw the movie will know what I mean). I had a lot of expectations from this movie, such as the underground world that met with the dawn of the dead, met Freddy against Jason, but what I got was this shit. The story was forgetful, the actors were badly used and what the director was thinking when he did this. This could have been great, but it turned out to be the most interesting film I've ever seen. Okay, so what if there was a little T and A, I was looking up and I was bitterly disappointed. Do not expect the movie to be good, but if you want a bad bad horror, be sure to watch this and see how the horror movie should not work.
