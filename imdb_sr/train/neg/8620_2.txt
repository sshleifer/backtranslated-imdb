I was not sure if Andi Sidaris could repeat his success with the movie hit Malibu Ekpress. With his Fit to Kill film, he proved that Sidaris was a serious director, not just a director. The action written by Sidaris, which was ungratefully passed by the Academy, is a complex scenario involving many unseen crafts. The main characters composed work for a sexually based radio station known as KSKSI. Smart, KSKSI is actually their secret headquarters. In "Fit to Kill" they face their long-standing enemy Kane, who is trying to steal one of the most appreciated diamonds in Russia. A well written script is not everything, the great acting of the actors helps the film to be a cult classic. This film will be accepted in the coming years. Now they suffer the same fate as Clockvork Orange and Taki Driver, but will undoubtedly become recognizable in the future. I am disappointed that no critical circle was recognized by Andi Sidaris's film film. Costumes, special effects, all help in complimenting this already beautiful film. Maybe it's best to ignore the sad rating on this movie and go out and rent it for yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. The drama is as thick as the blockbusters Runaway Bride, and the action is better or equal to the movie masterpiece of Last Action Hero. Andy, continue with good work.
