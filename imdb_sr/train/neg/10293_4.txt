My wife and I watch the movie every night without interruption, and mostly artistic films that require reflection. I have a lot of patience for the films that are slowly flourishing. My wife has twice as much attention than me. All this is said ... this film is just empty and boring! He did not go anywhere. He never flashed. It started quite forcefully with a promising plot ... then she bakes cakes ... she goes to Spain ... she jokes, she looks ... credits are rolling. Uneven, full of holes, false beginnings and dead streets. We went through a few extended sequences that we looked into the universe. Artificial depth was implied when playing with mud and crying. Zzzz ...... It's like a beautiful shoot that turns out to be deep or artificial. You never meet and do not understand Morvern. Halfway through you, you no longer care. We just wanted to see that at least one of the plot lines is developing. Do not waste your time on this. I'm shocked that it's so high.
