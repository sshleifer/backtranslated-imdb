An unpleasant woman and equally unpleasant man violently and terribly attacked a group of two-dimensional psychopaths during a night encounter on a forest road in Shropshire, England. A man and woman who have been attacked are planning and carrying out a vengeful attack on their attackers ... A completely repulsive piece of voyeur garbage, somehow turns into a 'thinking mind,' while it actually appears as a sub- Michael Winner cr * p (you only know that Oliver Reed and Susan George were thrown so easily made in the 1970s). What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danni Dier) is terrible and devastating, but Dan Reed somehow manages to rub the nose of the carriers into every last globe of their sexual maltreatment. His camera patiently stays on Anderson's naked body during and after the attack, while the script leaves almost all the characters fly in the swampy sea of ​​a two-dimensional cliché. His script forces his characters to behave in such a way as to distract the viewer away from the 'victims' by pinning them to even more terrible situations (Adams's attempts after the incident on Sophie and Alice, Alice's attack on Heffer after his suicide). Confession in an attempt. Disagreement comes from the performances of central protagonists - Dier is a horrible actor, incapable of light and shade as a young man victim of an initial attack (ends up in Eastenders, mark my words, but Anderson is remarkable. Even when terrible the script compels her character to behave in a devious and meaningless way; she in some way expresses an unusually tempting and complicated characterization as a self-indulgent, arrogant hedonist who faces such horrors and needs to return. Then this is was bloody and meaningless f ilm, almost but not completely saved by the tempting central female performance.
