Mostly a typical propaganda movie for the last good war. But there were a few things that hit me. The first was the use of loud epithets. In two cases, Scott stands up once, once at the start when he targets the target during the bombing ("curse") and once tries to place the bomber to become a pilot ("s *% t"). I could make a mistake about the second degree, but I repeated it several times and it seems to me. The third is when Anne Shirley's character wants to forgive O'Brien and happiness ("Give them hell") over the engine noise. She must have thought it was too tricky, because it clearly says "heck". I also found an interesting character that has moral problems with bombing, especially by bombing civilians. The avuncular superior asserts that only military targets will be affected due to the precision of the bomb used. Bearing in mind what we know about LeMai's later strategy of burning Japanese cities in oblivion, this scene plays with little irony. I recall that McNamara quoted LeMai in the Maggie War, which led to the fact that if the US did not win the conflict, it would be tried as a war criminal. The ending is too high, in line with the movie. It reminded me a little to the end of the Wake Heat (I do not compare movies, just the end!). Maybe it's just because it's blown up. Bloved up good good !!!
