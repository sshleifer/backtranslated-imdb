If the scale was negative, I would be happier. Watching Sushmit Sen was nice, and Nisha Kothari has a great future, but the producer and director have ruined every delight in this story. Choice of angles, choice of lighting and all that hindered the attempt to remember what the story is. Oh, if those songs and dances do not make you ears from your head, first. The film could have been made twice in 1.25 hours, and was pretty good, somehow like "Seven Samurai," but the director and writer did not go that way, even if "citizens" finally found their backbone and want to help. This film fails on many levels: editing, writing, photographic corner, style, lighting, script - the name of any aspect of this movie - it was bad - probably food from the caterers was bad. Never in six years I did not watch Indian (Bollivood) movies when I saw something bad.
