This is perhaps the worst movie ever made, and maybe it's worth looking at just for that reason. Streisand is ridiculously incredible as a young woman posing as a man to study Judaism. Soundtrack is a torturous, and Barbara points out some of the bleakest boring films. And do not even start me on the plot. In fact, you will get more reassurance from this movie than many comedies, because it's so terrible. Streisand's unbridled ego, thinking that he could somehow raise this stinker to the heights of the Oscars, led to this disaster. I'm pretty sure that the novelist, Isaac Bashevis Singer, hated this film and never forgave Streisand. I can not blame him. This movie is like watching a car wreck in a slow-motion movie for two hours with the sound of 'The Sound of Music' playing back on the old turntable. It's really so bad. I'm wondering if any of Streisand enjoyed this film at the level that was intended.
