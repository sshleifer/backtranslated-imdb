The film is very terrible and humiliating for the victims of rape. At first glance, this can be a smug film about rape, but if you dig under the surface, what lies is not so positive message of rape. Aishvaria, a victim of rape, appears to be a helpless victim who can not bear everything, because she is a woman. She needs a man to help her. When society goes around and comments on it, it does not advocate for itself. Everything is left to Anil Kapuor to speak until Aishvaria cries. The director (Satish Kaushik) went wrong by showing the victim of rape as weak and subdued. What would have been more effective was the showing of a strong woman who bravely rebelled against her enemies. The director is known for being a chauvinist. His films are usually full of bad women, but he tries to hide them in controversial roles. He should learn that just because the role is controversial, this does not mean that the personality itself is strong. She does it to please a father who thinks he's dirty now. Although it is commendable that Chess shows the stigma of rape victims in such a strong light, what he does not show us is whether Ash's father has made a mistake in doing such a thing to his daughter. So there is a confusing message of rape. Comedy is also not needed in such a powerful movie. Moreover, the comedy is simply not funny. The ashes are wood in their role as Anil Kapoor does nothing but shouts. Music is central except for the title track, which is beautifully painted (the only bright spot of this movie). The role of Sonali Bendre is disappointing and futile. All in all, what could have been a great film for memory ends up as a terrible porridge that will give some viewers a serious digestion.
