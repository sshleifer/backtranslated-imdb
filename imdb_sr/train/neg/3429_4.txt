I got a copy from the author of this movie about soulseek. I have to say that it is pathetic and easy to watch how two policemen act, but I watched the movie as a joke and since it was a homage to the august's undergroung, which I accidentally saw in my book as a terrific film. Its quality and everything about it is pretty bad, but it's fun and something to talk about among your friends. It reminds me of the thunder, but good things. I recommend that you see this under two conditions, if you are bored and you need a good laugh, or a tall, otherwise just let go. It's safe to download. and murders are pretty fun. as if they zombie rips Satanic fans of a dick and stab someone in the head of it.
