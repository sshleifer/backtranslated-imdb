This film was probably as stupid as The Naked Gun (which should have been). Example: 1. To falsely drown, Roberts secretly keeps swimming classes in the IVCA. After her "death," IVCA invites her husband to work to express his condolences. HELLO how did he get his work number? 2. Before leaving the city, releases the ring into the toilet. Days or even weeks later, her husband found her in John. Does that mean that the VC has never been washed? 3. There is no explanation as to how she pays for her mother in the nursing home (after she did her rich husband back). At the end of this fatigue movie, Roberts suspects her husband is in the house. Instead of running for her life, she runs to the kitchen to see if the cans are neatly complex.
