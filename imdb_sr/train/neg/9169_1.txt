It's getting really bad. The only semi-redeeming quality is the effects of the thousands of bullets used during the film. There are contextual errors everywhere. The acting is terrible, except Kirk. The story is grated as a grail, and the belief that a movie video game only kills a movie, if it was not already a corpse. All in all, it's the loss of your life. I would give this a null that it was an option on the grading scale.
