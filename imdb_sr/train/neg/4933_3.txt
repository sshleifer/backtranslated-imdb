This film was not as bad as compared to the first two pieces of the original. He was directed by Martin Kitrosser on Friday, the 13th glory. The acting is really bad, but the effects of the above and the special effects help make it interesting. This is one thing I like about Screaming Mad George (make up the effect of the filmmaker), its effects are so inaccessible and bizarre that they will keep you looking at a bad movie just to find out how much they will get a crazy movie. The movie is not so nasty, but there is an extremely nasty scene in the center of the game that includes a red toy (what!?!) Mickey Rooney makes a guest appearance that probably was not too enthusiastic, but needed. money at the time, maybe? If you liked the strange fourth war (my favorite of all 5), you probably will like this. I loved it better than Matrix! Enjoy.
