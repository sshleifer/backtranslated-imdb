After the already disappointing "Final Conflict", the series hit the weakest fourth position. At least the third film tried (unsuccessfully) to continue the story of Damien, while this simply rehashes and copies ideas from "Omen" (the animal is afraid of the Antichrist, the death of a man is very similar to the death photographer in the first movie). But what looked exciting and creative, it looks stupid here. And the girl looks just like a spoiled child.
