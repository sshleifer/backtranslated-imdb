This film had the potential, but what makes it very bad is the actress Lindsay Crouse. I've never seen anything in it before, and there may be some Crouse fans who like it in another, but her performance in this movie is bad. When she delivered her lines, she seemed to be trying to make sure she had the right lines and simply read from the list in her head. So, her voice has very little inflection. I can not believe that it was someone who was acting poorly in the movie. She must know someone in business. Now I do not like to signify it for her, but the comment must be "this" long and its performance is what sets it apart from anything else. Br /> However, I liked where the story went, so I continued to watch it. The first part of the script has a good movie. But the end was disappointing. Maybe she would like her acting to be better.
