The story of the movie was as simple as her morale: Go find the girl, marry her, live with her happily for the rest of her life. Although the film had some nice moments and reversals, most remained on the surface of what could be shown in a film with the same story. he was mocking, probably intentional. A more interesting story would be a mixed couple. If you want to watch a movie that does not need too much concentration, which can be watched by a whole family and that teaches your children modest and conservative value (in addition to modern tolerance ;-)), you will be fine with this movie. Can be shown at a family dinner ...
