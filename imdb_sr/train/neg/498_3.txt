I saw this movie when I was much younger and I thought it was funny. I saw her again last week and you can guess the result. A few funny parts, very little and too long. Getting started is the only thing that's funny if you ask me. If you want a total b-movie this is a good choice, but do not expect too much of the size of the dwarf dwarf
