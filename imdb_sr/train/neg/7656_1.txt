Alone in the dark is one of my favorite games of the role of all time. I remember looking at my computer screen all night, trying to get away from that villa and actually I was scared when the monsters came to surprise. I do not recall any success stories in this new Hollywood genre, although some are amusing enough to be visible. Nevertheless, I am a big fan of the game that I could not resist. My reason was that if the film had a plot that looked like a game, it would be fine. Man, it was 90 minutes (which looked like 300) of my life that I will never return. If I had that chance, I would gladly have them reorganized the sock drawer. This is not even in the category "so bad is funny". You would have thought that even Christian Slater had more sense than to join this stinking bomb. Tara Reid ... I'm not complaining about her presence. However, if the purpose of this chicken is in the main role to have a scene of sex - I fully understand and support (hey, I'm a guy!) - I saw more of her body at press conferences. There is no conspiracy about which is being talked about. You will not waste your time on it. The credibility of the story sank below 'I did not have sex with Mrs. Levinski.' Acting is just a few words above 'Street Fighter', which, incidentally, is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I would recommend this to OVU. Children, I recommend Video games. She has a much better story, acting and much more excitement. As far as the film is concerned, here's the spoiler - CONSCIOUS! Wait for the porn version.
