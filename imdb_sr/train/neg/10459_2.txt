Uncoordinated, vague, bad scenario, bad photo and direction ... all in all, it is obviously poorly designed the first effort on the commercial creation of films by good people in TBN. the success in the past, helping to "China Cri," the story of Nora Lam, brings to the big screen. Or "The Omega Code" is an unfortunate mistake. As a Christian who supports TBN and many of his programs and who liked "China Cri," I still can not recommend anyone to this movie. They work very well with their service, but this is not an example of this. Do not spend money ... instead, rent "China Cri".
