This is OK movie, but he lacks any real depth, neither emotional nor in terms of narration. The story is based on real events and it limits the amount of action to almost nothing, and not on the real uncertainty. Washington is probably in the lead, but he sleeps asleep, there is no room to master his muscles for him or support. The story simply drops a little flat, even if I have never heard of the title character, the ending was obvious, but unlike other films about such injuries, this has no emotional impact, you do not care about it and motivation those from outside help to look more academically than worry about his well-being. There is an attempt to inject some emotions using a boy outside of which the hero adores Carter, but it seems forced. It's OK movie, but immediately forgotten.
