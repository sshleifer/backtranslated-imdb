I can not believe that this movie has gone into video and that video stores are ready to put it on their shelves. I literally asked for a refund. Remove the fact that the film has no historical truth, and it's still the worst movie ever found in the video. It's not even good enough to call it B. Do not spend money or time on this movie. Just giving voice and terrible music made me angry. Anyone involved in this movie should be withdrawn from the trade union, give the industry a black mark, but after watching most of this film, I really do not think anyone is involved in a union.
