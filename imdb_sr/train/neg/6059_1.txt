I must say that I am a fan of the man who created Night of Witch / Fog / Christine / The Thing - probably his best films. Then you get this POS. I can not logically think that he has made any effort to do this as he did with cigarette burns. At least his son made a decent soundtrack. You need to look at it from a standpoint that it did not seem like a movie. It seemed like someone else directed it. I will not believe that Carpenter made an effort at all. I just listened to his old school H2 / H3 / The Fog soundtrack and it was great, especially for the time. > He used a style that nobody had and it worked well for his films.
