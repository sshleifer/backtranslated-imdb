Waitresses: Honey, here are the eggs you ordered. Honey, like a bee, you understand? This is called a meaningless hint. Edward Basket: A? (On the way) Korpa: Here's your doll, girl. You really should not be so careless with your stuff. Little girl: Yes, whatever. Impact! Boom! Vhoosh! Crackle ?? Cart: I think something bad will happen. <br /> (Later) Basket: Mmmm. Vicodin! What the hell? ? (Open letter for tears.) Vov! My ex-girlfriend's manuscript really improved. And look, her missing daughter looks like a girl with a doll that I was accidentally responsible for killing, in a way. And somehow it has my hair. I wonder, do I bother and find her? Let's see what my friends in the station think. Basket's fellow male policeman: HAHAHA. Vilou is a funny name. Basket: I think something bad will happen. (On the island) Basket: What's in the bag? AHHH. Wooden noun: It's not her daughter. (In the tavern) Basket: Can you swing it? Big-boned, wood-called tavern vench: Huh? Basket: (breaks the bee). Everything is fine. Sensually beautiful, once-promising actress who plays lusty maid from a tavern: It's good. Honey is not a plant. (On Greenery) Villov: Oh, yes, and I forgot, you are my father's dad, Conan, I mean, Roven. I could stay and live with you. But I did not. Instead, I wanted to be a princess of a hive. I mean, it does not matter. (He nods his head, the jerks wake up, they widen the eyes to the proportions of the anime). Mwah, kiss-kiss. I love you! What were we talking about? Basket: Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Villov: Edward. Sniff. Blink. Why. Are. You. Shouts. At. Me? Is it because I screwed up your Vicodin? Sniff. Snore. What were we talking about? Cart: I think something bad will happen. Villov: My lips hurt. <br /> <br /> (In classroom) Rose: What is a man? Gemini, in unity: Falic symbol, phallus symbol. Rose: Echo? Echo? Basket: Stay away from the bike. Rose: And I'm a good twin. Basket: I think something bad will happen. br /> (On Hives) Basket: Hmmm. Hallo? This, oh, oh, oh bother. Stupid old bear. Snore. (In Queen Victoria Bee) Sister Summersisle: You have so much potential. What are you doing here? Did not you have been a kid who was lurking in Moonstruck's face? (Licks lips.) Basket: I wanted to ask you the same thing. Where's the girl? Sister Summersisle: How are you doing drugs? Let's talk about the importance of my superfluous ones. Shopping Cart: Look at the semi-truck moving towards us! Aaaaah! Oh. Does not matter. Damn it! (He's drinking another pill.) Mmmm. Thorazine. (Back to the cafe) Big bone, the superb coffee bar: I tried to watch Veightvatchers, Jenni Craig, South Beech, and since last year, I increased the size of the medallion suit. Wooden name: HAHAHA. Better to bake this crazy policeman, my dear. Big Hair Girl: Totally. Basket: It was the last straw that broke the back of the Shopping Cart! Take it, girl! (Slugs her.) (Edward Basket mysteriously attacked from the back) Voluptuous tavern vench: EEEE! Thirsty! Leave the island and take me with you! Do I have to fight you or what? I say, get rid of it! EEEE! Basket: Take it, girl! Ellen Burstin: And who can forget the part where the mobile phone's phone rings in the middle of his scene of the medallion suit and then the call pull it out. It's like a wireless ad: Help me! Can you hear me now? Hahaha. Kate Beahan: And do you remember when I produced bullets that I pulled out of Basket's gun? He looked so surprised. You should be more careful with your stuff, Nick. Hahaha. And your choice of movies. Everything: Dron must die! Shopping cart: (screaming) Oh, yeah, you bitch? Well, the baking will not help your goddamn honey! Aaah. Legs! Honey, honey, put that torch out and get away from the suitcase. Honey! Smokey Bear says they do not play matches. Hahaha. What the hell? Pay attention to that half-truck! Ahh! Oh. Damn, these flashbacks from my phase of drug experiment in the seventies are getting old! Where's my heroin? Ouch. Ouch. My watch is not resistant to fire. Ouch. I think something bad will happen. Can you hear me now? I'm ready for my job. Damn it! (Six months later) A strange girl in modern costume clothes: I told the same case the case to take me with me. Innocent young angry: I like to help people. Volptuous vench: Then pull me out of my contract to continue! I think something bad will happen. EEEEE!
