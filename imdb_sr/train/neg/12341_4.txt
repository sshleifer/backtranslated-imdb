Terrible incidents are not just a matter of the 21st century. Before the 'Scari Movie' series, there were several examples of this genre, mostly in the 1980s. But, as franchised, most of these films have been hit or missed. Some like 'Elvira, the Mistress of the Dark' are generally rising above that, but others like 'Saturday 14.' and his sequel fail to laugh. But of all these types of films there is one particularly large offender, and that is 'Transylvania 6-5000', which is a great waste of time for many reasons. Some of the quiet humor are fun. Coward, but catch the song. Some good Transylvania locations. Cons: Threadbare plot. Mostly tiring pacing. Most of the humor simply does not cut it. Monsters are given a little work and a little time on the screen. I thought this should be a subtle movie about monsters? A bumpy ending that will probably cause anger to viewers. Final thoughts: This is a comedy? If that's why why are really funny bits so small and far between? Comedy should make us rolling on the floor, not turning our eyes and kissing, that it would be done. I can not believe that Anchor Bai has published this tired garbage. I admit that this is not one of the worst movies ever made, but it's not worth the time or money, even if you are a fan of some of the actors. See 'Transilvania Twist'. My Rating: 2/5
