### Spoilers! ### What Offers This Movie? Off-line installation and cinema that coincides with a terrible complication. It's sad to see that the talents of Denzel Washington have been thrown into trash like this one. They must have been hinted that Mexicans can not be saved, external forces are needed, perhaps militaristic, American. And we know that his father is a blatant character, but he is a Mexican, unlike a woman who is more appreciated by Creasey because he is an American. He killed them all, thinking that she died. And is it? Of course, she will not, she is a young child and you should not hurt the sensitivity of a Hollywood fan. The excluded scene was the only thing that prevented me from ranking below the "incredibly successful" (as some critics pointed out) 'Taken'. The folly of such films will take time. It is in the rating of such films that we must doubt the IMDb's credibility.7.7 for a movie like this and 7.0 for Mi Owen Private Idaho. Imagine! The mine will range from 3.5-4.0
