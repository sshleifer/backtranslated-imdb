When I saw the performance of this movie, I thought it might be stupid, but at least it would be fun. I was wrong. Though the producers somewhere deep inside of them had an interesting message about the parents being left alone and reassessing their lives, the way in which they were trying to deliver the message was terrible. The first fifty times something silly about what happened to the couple was relatively fun. But in the end, I could almost predict what kind of stupid misfortune will happen next. Through the film I like the total maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else is at best central, which is still central. more than I can say for the film itself.
