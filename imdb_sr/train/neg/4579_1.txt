"What do we know about the bleak?" It was one of the worst times I've ever spent in movies. It was less of a movie and more special after school, but at the same time nothing special. The attempted narrative in which they based their ideas was absolutely pathetic, which almost everyone will say. Marlee Matlin should not be in her underwear. I will not stay on it. What I will uncover is a critique that many can not formulate. This film, though boring, also suffered a huge drawback in reasoning. It was terribly contradictory, because it took such manipulation, became the creator of your life, the manifestation of abundance, a colorless piece of propaganda. Interconnectivity is explained as a major side of our existence. However, the film encourages us to control our environment with our minds. It completely ignores the fact that there are other people with minds who can control us, which is more the case. Or at least the structures in which we exist are to a large extent limited. In this way, the film was poorly solipsistic. Solyssism and interconnection are simply not mixed if you are not God Almighty. If so, you will be impressed (?!?) With all the neat things that this movie will discover to be able to do. If not, you will be very disappointed, moron, or maybe both. Also, the title is so funny, I have a problem to warn people not to watch the movie because I feel retarded by mentioning it by name. Shame on everyone involved.
