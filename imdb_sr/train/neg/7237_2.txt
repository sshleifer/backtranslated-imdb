Life is really too short for such films. I knew it could not be good to understand what I already suspected - that David Schvimmer would play the same kind of person he plays in 'Friends'. We face this, or the guy can not play anything but dumbbells or he never offers other parts. I have the feeling that it's a mixture of both. And I must say that it's extremely difficult to love a movie that completely loses significant talents by Gvineth Paltrow, Barbara Hershei, Tony Collette and Carol Kane !!!
