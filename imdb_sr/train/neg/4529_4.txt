I will not describe the story, as it was done elsewhere. We are great fans of Clive Owen, and when our Netflik recommended film, we were intrigued. No wonder we never heard of this "movie" because it was the BBC Television movie since 1992. /> But, you do not mind mechanics, because the story itself will lead to sleep. It's an interesting human story, but not at all tempting, and there's almost no end. You do not care about the characters because their lives are as boring as your life watching this boring movie. Save for two hours and do something to make time more valuable.
