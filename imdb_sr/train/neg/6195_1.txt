Badli made. The terrible acting and ending the director looked out of nowhere because the film was sincerely no less boring. Shockingly, this film is considered a prize at a film festival in Gijon. Everyone who came out of the theater were the same opinion as me - what's the point of even filming the movie? Referral to Iraq was bizarre or simply misconstrued. I am delighted that this film was given a release - very, very disappointing and time-wasting. I'm sorry, a terribly negative review, but I hope some people will refrain from the same mistake. It's a pity we did not have K and A at the end of the movie - it could have been interesting now.
