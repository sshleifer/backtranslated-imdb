When the film is independent and not rated, such as the Hamiltonians, I expected from the norm, cut your heartbreak. I know good movies do not always contain blood and violence, but I read reviews, I visited a website and even convinced several of my friends to pay $ 9.50 to see this horrible movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I expect horror, not Davsons Creek with incestuous tones. My expectations were extremely low for this film, but the low expectations for the film were recorded in hell when I saw it lasted an hour before we saw the first drop of blood from someone's finger. There was too much holes in the soil and too much imagination left. I'm sorry I did not see happy legs. I think there could have been more violence and killing in that movie than in Hamilton!
