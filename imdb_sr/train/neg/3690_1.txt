Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in her life. This is the film that caused his fall. It was put up for sale with many hyperdromes, but it was badly broken and led to serious financial losses for its manufacturers and distributors. The landlord had to pay them personally for the loss incurred. Soon after his release, he tried to embark on politics, but failed. It's a very bad movie with terrible acting, poor quality lipstick and a pathetic scenario. Through the film, Rajinikant looks like a person suffering from a disease. I am one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba, the first day of the first performance in the theater. The audience was so boring that most of them left the theater before the break. I'm sorry, I will not recommend this to anyone.
