Is this a stupid movie? You can bet !! I could not find a moment in this film that was creepy or scary. Stupid moments? A lot. Stupid characters? You can bet. Bad effects? Everywhere! Rick Baker may have gone and made bigger and better things, this is not one of them. Oh, people have to start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson is raw. He's the darkest doctor I've ever seen. There is someone who melts in Ventura County somewhere, he is not very happy that his wife is pregnant (probably because she is 55 years old and weighs 90 lbs) and there are no crackers that can be found anywhere. In addition, he has a general assistant in his interference who wants to find the astronaut Steve. And the local sheriff wants to know what's going on, even though Mr. Nelson can not say anything to him. There are also some random characters thrown to a great extent and meeting a melting man. In the end, the film ends, and the monster gets into the garbage to become compost. In the end, that's exactly what you need for a great episode of MST.
