I think this would be a much better movie that the Cayens were shown in a more convincing light. My family is from the southeastern region of Louisiana and I live in southeastern Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I've never heard people with whom I grew up in a conversation like these people. Cajunts are shown as backside backwards. Most Cajuns I know are well-educated, proud people and do not sound unkown when they speak the way those people did. All in all, it was OK movie, with great landscape and music. I understand that the writers were from the Charles Lake, and have knowledge of the area, but because of the love of all things Cajun, please actors study the language, live among the people you portray and understand how they are before you try to behave like they. In my opinion, when actors believe that this person is, it's a much more pleasant movie!
