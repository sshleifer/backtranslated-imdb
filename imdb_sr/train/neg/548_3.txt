I've seen 7.5 IMDb ratings on this movie and based on that I decided to watch this movie that my comrade rented. She said she already saw it. "It's funny and sad! I cried the first time I saw her," she flew out. Perhaps compared to other Bollywood films, it deserves 7.5 out of 10, but compared to all the other films I've seen in my life, this does not deserve more than 3. Every movie I can constantly guess what will happen is not good for me. The characters are incredible, that the act is not real at all and their motives are fictitious. It's too dramatic and the songs are not that big. My biggest problem with Bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety. All emotions are too exhausted and not real at all. Every emotion or connection between the characters that is least subtle must be increased by an unnecessary song. I think that I realized that the relationship between father and son was more like a friend between a parent and a child, and that it was not necessary to transfer it through a five-minute song. A stupid comic relief with a gossip of laughter was not ridiculous or necessary (we realized that Lakman was not the sharpest tool in the shed). If the film tries to cause tears through the hardest possible ways, it simply is not meaningful, just a bit embarrassing. ***** SPOLER ***** <br /> <br> In general, if someone has a terminal stage of lung cancer, their son who lives with them knows that something is wrong, and that he does not say. Too many holes for calculating. Initially, the movie was fun and cute in the way Bollivood films watched people who did not look so greedy, but simply became tired. It takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is fun and honest, and the best way for this usually is not to have all the fun parts in the first half of the movie and all the essential parts in the end. ***** SPOILER CROSS ***** Maybe it had a little more depth than other Bollivood movies I've seen, but not much. I spent more time laughing at the nonsense of the movie from the parts that should have been ridiculous. I did not spill any tears, nor did I feel like it was, but I was overwhelmed by the feeling of disgust at the attempt of dramatic ending. I do not recommend this movie if you want to watch something good, I recommend it if you want to watch a Bollywood movie that's somehow sad.
