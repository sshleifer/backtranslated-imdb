Now, for the sake of the truth, a very bad story - for a movie of Valt Disnei which is a total rubbish. When the Robinson appeared, the movies were everywhere, I was shocked at how bad it was. As if "Alice in Wonderland" was wrong! I feel like they were short on the ideas that some of them mixed up some crazed garbage to try to get out - and not. After that I sat and wanted an end. My younger brother lost interest halfway and was confused by the story. The characters are weak and after it seems that robinsons do not care about finishing, you just want the movie to end. It's a movie to be forgotten and quickly forgotten. If you have free time, do not spend it on this.
