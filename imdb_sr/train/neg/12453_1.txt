I was always a big fan of Linda Carter-Vonder Voman, and when the Sci-Fi channel led this film, I had to see it. I was bitterly disappointed. This is the movie Vonder Voman in the name itself. A real costume [she must have refused or commissioned big changes] and the action takes place like James Bond, a poor man. None of the things made the comic hero a success, i.e. superhuman power or decisive will. I do not think Cathy is so attractive anyway. I would not waste my time on this.
