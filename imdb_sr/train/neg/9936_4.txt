I picked up this for 50 cents on a flea market, he was pretty excited. I found him fascinating about 15 minutes, and then he just repeated and bored. It's nice to see Mick and the band at their peak, I wish there was not so much duplication of dialogue that I could hear what they were saying and playing. Skates are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple, varieties of poorly written Monti Pithon on acid. I spent more time watching the late 60s of England, not what actually happened in stupid sketches. This film is a good reminder that time really changes, and what matters is quickly becomes simple silly. Good song, but now it's on death recorded on this DVD.
