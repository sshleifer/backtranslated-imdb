We have a lake. We have an animated meteor. We have a killer dinosaur with footsteps. Ok, let's call this movie CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmm, two idiots call Arnie & Mitch to define the ultimate definition of "comic relief". We have to have a sheriff who does not really do anything in this film and who no one listens to. Shit, we're halfway through the movie and we forgot to put in a bad guy! Do not worry, let's meet some guy with mustache, let him rob a shop to show he's a bad guy and then to show him somewhere near the lake, to drive him through the woods, all for the purpose of ending up as a dinosaur snack food. It should work. Complete, clumsy mess, this movie. His logic will turn your mind around to make you laugh. First film with Dave Allen as "stop motion control". After this, he teamed up with Charles Band for several years until the mid-nineties, when Band was running out of money to pay him, I suppose. The effects of dinosaurs are charming and the whole movie is quite unusual funny. Unfortunately, this is the only good thing that can be said about it. Good evil? Yes. The bending logic in the narrative should be a sufficient reason to put it on the list. If not, Arnie & Mitch will make a trick. 3/10 and 8/10
