The saying "Never judge the book by the covers" was cited as a warning to those who do not look under the surface. As I watched the artwork, "The King of the Ants" I immediately thought HORROR! The mysterious images proudly displayed on the cover and their back spoke of a dark vision, the synopsis promised a story of murder, betrayal and retaliation. Instead, what I discovered under this surface was less interesting than what you can find below your average rock. The "king of ants" has Chris L. McKenna as Sean Cravlei, an average guy ready to make a name for herself in this world, even if it means murder. In addition to being Sean Cravle's someone who does not care, I have never felt any compassion or sympathy for this character. In fact, he is incredible, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Rai Mathevs), who turns into an uninspired performance as the worst, which is an extremely funny dialogue that is forced to recite. Insert Kari Vuhrer as a sad widow who obviously has unconditional trust (especially homelessness), and little or no common sense, and George Vendt as Duke, who is basically a sober norm of Life, but SIGNIFICANT! Now there are several interesting "hallucination" sequences in this film (the source of the cover page), but this film never penetrates further into the world. He prefers to bombard you with unmotivated characters, bad dialogue and a little unlikely event after an unexpected event. Oh, horror!
