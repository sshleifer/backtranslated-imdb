I thought Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was a pretty good horror movie. When the body of a terrorist, infected with a stolen chemical, was found by the US military, the body was then cremated, releasing the virus into the atmosphere across the small island. Soon the infected locals will turn into zombies of hungry flesh, and a group of soldiers on leave must unite with a group of tourists and embark on an abandoned hotel as they try to fight aggressive living dead. I did not find this film as good as the original movie, Zombie Flesh Eaters. But it was still a good movie with good action. I did not think it was one of the best in the series. 4/10
