Let Paul "brainwashed" Verhoeven to make sense of the pointless and minor version of the INVISIBLE MUSIC story. If I were to direct a Pokemon movie, I'm sure it would turn into a kind of huge orgy. I do not mind sex or even slease (check my other critics) on the film, but honestly, it's obvious that the director has one trace of the mind and could not see the interesting aspects of the invisible story of a man than the stinking implications that come with him. It's a shame because it might have been good that the film did not spend so much time with the invisible Kevin Bacon who catches women. Actors' actors do what they can with one note of cheesy scenarios, but I felt bad for some of them, including Villiam Devane, who is completely lost here. But what could I expect from the director of SHOVGIRLS, which, of course, is much more fun than this hard and bad movie.
