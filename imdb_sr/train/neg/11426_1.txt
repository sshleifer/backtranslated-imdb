Heather Graham could not play a convincing lesbian if her life depends on it. Who do film producers think? ABSOLUTE BEST, the most unrealistic movie I've ever seen. This film is so bad that I felt compelled to apply for the IMDb and to make sure that the rating of this "film" falls. Omg I'm Heather Graham, I just kissed a drunkard, so when I fainted, I'm really going to walk around my room so that we MY HEADS ask: "WHAT I HAVE?!" Jesus Heather, go over it and grow up ... feeling towards idiotic producers ... and while I'm on it, instead of making this movie all about the pathetic excuses for a story, it might be more appropriate to focus on a figure that is mentally unstable. .. as your so-called "lesbian" figure ... after all, I know that for the first time I had gay sex, when I left the next morning and jumped into the sky in excitement in the middle of the street ... honestly b * tch, get a grip. .. WHAT IS JOKE! and please keep in mind that there are many much more disadvantages and terribly stupid aspects of this poor film, but I am so troubled that I even think more about it. in the end, if you are a smart person you hate this movie, and if you are not a smart person, then you will like it ... it's so simple.
