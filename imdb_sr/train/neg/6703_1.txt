I noticed that this film took the greatest burden of insult. Probably some of them have earned, but it was not so bad. Well, I'll be honest: I never want to watch this movie anymore. It was a bad movie. But I do not hate this movie, I tried to tell the story. As a drama, this movie could actually work well. I just think the filmmakers have wrongly determined which way they should do it when they did it (it should add more ridiculous parts if they want it to be a comedy). With transcription, he could have been a great movie. But as a satire, it did not function in the present form - many scenes did not fit into the context of complications: for example, the scene of robbery makes little sense in the story. Still, it was not the worst independent movie ever made - is it in Top 10 Worst? This is debatable.
