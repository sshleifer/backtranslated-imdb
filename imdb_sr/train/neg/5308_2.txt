Nothing can prepare you for another bad bimbo trip! This time you have brought in the unavoidable Fred Olen Rai! As for the exploitation of films, this one does not click! As a science fiction, it's simply non-original! All we see is an ugly, female android that wears a bikini to destroy the Earth, and shows everything that is almost naked to resist! Give me a break! If this kind of fun is yours, then why not dust from those old SI bathing suits from the attic to change?! It would be much better if you did not set the spine factor to a very high, but that would not make this a great one. I would like to point out another film called ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Vinorsky, which resembles the identity of the ALIENATOR. This illustrates why top-level "femme fatale" action movies of the first order can not be translated well in America. Excuse me, boys!
