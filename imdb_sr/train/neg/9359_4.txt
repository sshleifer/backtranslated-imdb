This film is probably pro-Muslim. Why write it? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives for the first 20 years in a Christian village. At the end of the film, he was apparently a Muslim because of his nose in his head, that he kept the amulet and his general clothes. He has a six-year-old child who wears the same head and is therefore probably a Muslim, even though his mother is a Christian. The main figure thus chooses to appear to be a Muslim, and his child becomes a Muslim. None of the other male main characters, who are Christians, seems to be breeding a child. At the end of the film there are more Muslims in the film world, so it looks.
