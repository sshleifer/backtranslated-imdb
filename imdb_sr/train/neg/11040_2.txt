You must once watch this show that you've seen everything, the formula is exactly the same in each episode. Jim does something in the way he thinks well, but he upset his wife, finally finds out what he did for her, she strokes his face and gives a smelly smile while looking shyly. In fact, the stories are so silly and colorful that I'm going to stab into one now. Episode "Valentine Pai" Jim's wife remarked that all of Jim's weekly salary is gone, and then she explains to her that he was lost in the casino. She screams and leaves the house complaining of how terrible. Then he appeared on Valentine's Day in a limo with ball tickets (explaining the missing wages). She sees 'her' mistake and the usual 'Oh Jim, you're so beautiful'. Another very obvious subject is the fact that Jim's character is based on Homer Simpson, who, as a character from a cartoon movie, can get out with warlike and ignorant people, when trying with human beings. does not work, and Jim simply passes as an arrogant, self-centered jerk. IMO is the only reason that this is a success simply because we have so many people in terms of human beings with TVs, you can now make a show about the man who isolates the walls, and you get the audience. "Two and a Half Men" is fantastic and funny on the other hand.
