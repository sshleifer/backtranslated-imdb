It was one of those late nights. Sometimes they are big. This was terrible, but it really did not have to be. The film had a very good cast. How can you do it when you have Charlston Heston and Jack Pallance? We are talking about the Oscar winner. He had good special effects. He even had some really good tits! I mean beautifully shown, a full breast with a full nipple and at some point even some beaver. But it did not make up for one missing ingredient - a story! The action was ridiculous. I do not mean the "solar crisis" that explodes in the sun, but that was bad enough. It was the rest of things - oh so stupid and completely predictable evil corporation. A man who just STANK! No amount of good acting or cold spaceship or combat scenes can be circumvented. I saw wonderful science fiction movies that had tiny heads and budgets. All the difference is in writing.
