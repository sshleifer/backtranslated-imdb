Much is written about Purple Rain, an obvious "kuin-essential" musical bio-film, but I'm here to tell you that the movie does not deserve a high score. First of all, the real thing is a great musician, and music is the only area in which Purple Rain stands out. Even the result is enchanting, and if it was recorded exclusively as a concert movie it would be a great experience, unfortunately it is not, and as such, there are some problems. First of all, this is a terrible acting / writing, the Prince's character "The Kid" should be distinguished as some kind of mysterious loner of a few words, unfortunately, it's just scratchy and incense. A good lonely figure should have at least some talkative moments, unfortunately Prince's character rarely has more words in the dialogue in the film and it is hard to believe that he will get a girl in this way. It seems to me that there is little here, which is a shame, because you can say that it is a character that is terribly in conflict and lives very complicated in a lifetime, but we are never allowed to enter it. The amazing aspect of this movie is how much it is happening at the concert. The Prince and Morris lives seem to occupy the back seat before the shows here, which I suppose make sense from a business perspective, but it's exhausting to have a two-hour film in which half of it seems to be taking place on the scene, especially when the stories about the characters are returning Push to the side for it. To summarize: This is not a very good movie.
