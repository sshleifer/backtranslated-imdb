I do not like this movie. The original phantasm had such a beautiful ambience and mystery. Like many horrors in the '70s, it looked and seemed like some creepy, unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, from the late '80s, raised the action, but kept this good mood attention. Unfortunately, Phantasm III is just terrible. It's boredom explains all the strange events in the previous films, which diminishes, and does not extend their power. It shamelessly degrades images from the first phantasm as a cheap restoration of the original. There are so many flying spheres in this movie that they look more like home pests than endanger fatal orbits. Hundreds hang from the ceiling like Christmas balls that swing in the design. Did no one - master preacher, DP, editor, director - noticed or worried that they looked so stiff? Worse still, Phantasm III represents a banal, barren joke for another. How much is different from the intensity of the first movie. The original fantasy used humor to ease its tireless focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to set up countless cheap jokes about Reggie's hunchback: a few refer to the "flying balls" of the ha ha ha, oh, stroke, balls. Maybe the crew got a blow from these jokes, but they're on us.
