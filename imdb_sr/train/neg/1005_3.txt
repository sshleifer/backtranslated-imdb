When you go to an open cinema under the Greek summer night, you usually do not care about the movie! Edison started very well with the good efforts of the singers-who-want-to be actors and once again a great Morgan Freeman, but ... (The movie usually has a good start to capture the audience, done, a bit boring) yet a story that fills the middle of the film is more about the characters, and less about the action done, and the third part is something really good that you can remember the movie ...) when you see 30 elite policemen (full of weapons can destroy the building) shoot at the guy behind the car, do not hit him Once he kills everything (but 3), then the guy pulls out a flame thrower (to kill the other 3), you realize that the Greek Year of the Sky is filled with stars is too good for the film to hinder it!
