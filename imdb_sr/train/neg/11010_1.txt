This movie does not even deserve. This was a waste of time. It was a loss of film and money. It was not offensive, but everything was provocative and disgusting. My spoiler is the one I think everyone should read. There is complete nudity and disgusting language. But not only that, there is no dance line, the actors are terrible, the accents are horrible, the actors are a bit of time and I was even excited to watch this movie! The only reason I rented it was Brian van Holt (who only got fifteen seconds, by the way). I think that may have been a mistake for the directors and editors, but they repeated two or three times the same segments, adding only a new sentence. Film similar to this is the Eraser Head, possibly the most disturbing movie. There is no line-up plot, and it's not funny. Although it does not try to be funny. Do not watch the movie.
