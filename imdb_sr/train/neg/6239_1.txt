Where was his critique of democratic and republican administrations? After all, he served for 17 years and more in the government body where his influence was undesirable. Oh, I forgot about eight years when he was the second in the command of the most powerful nation on Earth. The film is happy to show the snapshots of young Senator Gore who asked why NASA's scientist was forced to change the conclusion in his scientific work, but he did not ask for Clinton / Gore complicity in global warming. Probably too close to the election year, or maybe hurt the chances of Hillary's '08. In any case, he is a political coward and a party man to the end. He does not offer any criticism of consumerism, no criticism of capitalism, nor the path to that is the history of industrial development that brought us to that moment. In the end, this film was much more about Mr. Gore himself, and not about any real problems that our environment faces. Mr. Gore, if you really wanted to make a film of the campaign - shorten it and name it as it really is.
