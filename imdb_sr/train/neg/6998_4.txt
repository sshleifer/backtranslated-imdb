Hollywood has always had trouble reconciling with a "religious image." Strange Cargo proved to be an exception. Although he uses the talents of a top-notch actor, and is produced on top budget, with appropriately photographed Robert Planck, the film is unsuccessful in assessing credibility. Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden decline of fantasy elements harms the audience's involvement in the action and fate of characters. It was hard for me to sit quietly through all the fictional metaphors, parallels and biblical references, and it is impossible to accept the self-satisfied know that it was bought in the light of Ian Hunter as Christ's figure. And censors in Boston, Detroit, and Providence at least agreed with me. The movie is forbidden. A little Boston / Detroit / Providence cinema, if any, complained or traveled to other cities, because it was obvious from the story that Gable and Crawford were somehow included in the "picture message". Everywhere she fell. It's strange that the movie enjoyed a kind of revival on TV. The domestic atmosphere makes the film algorithm more receptive to spectators. However, despite the growing reputation of a strange or unusual movie, the plot of this Strange Cargo runs through predictable, highly moralistic lines that will not be speculated that the main characters will finally settle with fate.
