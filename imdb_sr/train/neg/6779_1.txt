There is a high level of expectation when you sit down to watch a comedy with the acting team led by Cari Grant, Jaine Mansfield, Rai Valston and Verner Klemperer. These expectations were further encouraged when the film was directed by Stanley Donnen, whose comic touch was so obvious in, among others, DAMN IANKEES !, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. For the first five minutes, or so, it seems that these expectations could be fulfilled and then ??. Nothing. What should be a light comedy, plunges into a lead, a heavy hand, a melodrama, with narcotic smiling. Relatively newcomer Suzy Parker is often criticized for her performance or the lack of one in the film, but in a film in which even the great Cari Grant often appears flat and woody, attacking Parker seems unfair. Not even such a brilliant light as Audrey Hepburn or Doris Dai could change the richness of this curvy, gloomy and totally meaningless letter, which clings awkwardly and retreats the interest of viewers and patience with him. The rest of the actors, especially Ray Volston, continue to try to breathe life into the process, but the terrible script is out of reanimation. Desperate, insignificant efforts to divert half-hearted laughter from the stiff audience in the final moments of the film only serves to add insult to injury. This film is nothing but a great disappointment at all levels.
