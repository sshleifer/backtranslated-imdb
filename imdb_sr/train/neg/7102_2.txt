OK, I admit I watched this movie at the Mister Science Theater 3000 (which I am a big fan of), but I'm not one of those people who automatically give MST3K a movie 1/10 rating. Although I hate many films they play, and some are among the worst movies I've ever seen, I actually managed to enjoy some MST3K movies. That's what's said, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. (No wonder, in fact, the writers of the MST3K have commented that this one was one of the worst. Do not trust me? See their site.) This film is a good example of what I DO NOT need to do in the movie. The dialogue is very bad, the acting is worse, the cinema is pathetic, and the direction (perhaps the best thing in this film) is bad. Pacing is the worst part of this movie. Several times in this movie, the viewer had to wait literally a few minutes for something to happen. Although the minute may not sound like a very long time, it can be in the movie, especially in this one. I'm sure it was supposed to create a mood, but it was very boring. He really felt like ten minutes. If the "suspense of incredulity" means "almost fall asleep during the film," then there is plenty of it. But the CONTEMPORARY person is so terrible that there is no way that I may have been interested in anything that is actually happening in the film, and so "suspension of unbelief" really does not exist. One of the worst, and probably the most lonely films I've ever seen. 1/10
