I would put it to the top of my list of movies in the category of invisible rubbish! There are movies that are bad, but the worst kind are those that are untraceable, but you presume that you love them because they should be good to you! Sexual sequences, so shocking in the day, could not even wake up the rabbit. The so-called controversial policy is strictly high school other amateur nightmare. The film is self-conscious artificially in the worst sense of the word. The photo is in a rough grain of black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! Some people call it art? <br /> <br />
