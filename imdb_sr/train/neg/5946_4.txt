There is absolutely no complication in this movie ... there is no character development ... there is no climax ... nothing. But there are several good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good. So you go ... as a movie as a whole it's pretty bad, but if you love a stupid movie that offers nothing but a good action scene then watch this movie. Do not expect anything more than that. Dense acting and not so bad direction .. A pair of kimbo Kimbo and Carano ... I was looking to see Caran a little more in this movie .. she is a good fighter and really nice girl ... White is a great martial art and a decent actor. I really hope that in the future there will be a better film, so that we can really enjoy his art .. Imagine a film with Wit and Ja together ... that would be great
