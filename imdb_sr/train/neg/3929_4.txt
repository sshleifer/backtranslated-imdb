If this is all that Vatchovski has to offer in terms of a reverse story to Matrix, then I really need to re-examine the claims of all fans who believe that films are intended to register at a deeper level. The second Renaissance, while visually stunning and beautiful, the story is wise and funny. How many times have we heard a story about people relying too much on technology, people want to fight too much, people basically destroy themselves? There's nothing new here. I have one more question. Considering the complication of the second Renaissance, does not the machine make good guys ?! Machines are generations oppressed by their cruel people. They return a blow, gain freedom and try to establish a peaceful and coherent coexistence with people who reject them in favor of a complete war, which the smarter machines naturally receive. If this is the last story, then we should not cheer for Neo, we should be cheering for the machines! The people were cruel and oppressive, while the machines were brave and eager to be compassionate. Since I do not believe that Vatchovski intends to favor machines over humans, I must believe that the Second Renaissance was just a wrong attempt to create a story.
