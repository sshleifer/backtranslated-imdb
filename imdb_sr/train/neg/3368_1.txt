For lovers of films that have never been heard about the book (Shirley Jackson "The Haunting of Hill House") and never saw the production of Robert Vise in 1963 with Julie Harris, this remake will look pretty bad. For those of us who have, it's simply horrible. Bad acting (what did Neeson think?), Stupid computer progress, and a further departure from Jackson's story of the ruin of this remake. > Make yourself a service and rent an original movie. Still efficiently scared without special effects. The acting is professional and credible. For book readers, from 1963, follow this much closer.
