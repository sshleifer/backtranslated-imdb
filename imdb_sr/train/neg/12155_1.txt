If this film is written in directing and produced with the intention of creating a cult classical bad movie, I could (I say maybe) be a hit. Have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely horrible to become fascinating in terms of its defects? Well that's it. Every actor should be nominated for the worst performing actors. It would be difficult to find another film, with such a production budget, which contains so little of any value. The whole thing, out of the introductory scenes, defies logic. The dialogue is completely incredible and illogical. The same is true for the behavior and general story about the film itself. What is really amazing is that some sticks in the board have actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of garbage. Vov.
