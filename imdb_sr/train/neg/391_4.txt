For the first few seasons, I thought the Apprentice was a very interesting and exciting performance. The combination of TV reality and a 16-week job interview was innovative, and the producers managed to keep the show relevant, not too "out there". New season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has nothing to do with business - in general. In earlier seasons, they put much more emphasis on job-related tasks - now the focus is mostly in a meeting room where participants are expected to do everything to keep them in the show (that is, lying, talking about garbage, backstabbing, etc.). The meeting room can be fun to watch, but it's fun at low points - Sometimes you are wondering if you're watching the repetition of an old episode of Jerry Springer. Tasks in the show are, in most cases, boring and mostly showcase for companies that are stupid enough to pay NBC for publicity. And what is the deal about half the participants living in tents in season 6? It's just stupid and has nothing to do with business in real life. I have absolutely no respect for any of the competitors this season, all of us seem like idiots. In earlier seasons, at least some of the competitors had little integrity, it now seems that competitors would kill their mother to keep them on the show. It seems that Donald Trump's huge ego is becoming bigger and bigger for every season that goes by and to be honest, I do not see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him. His rationality in the meeting room mostly makes no sense and sometimes he seems to just like to destroy people for what's worth. R.I.P Shegrt. Please NBC, for God's sake, show the show as soon as possible. It's too embarrassing to watch. Apprentice was once a great TV show, but now it's just a big fat joke.
