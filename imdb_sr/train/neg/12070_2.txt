I accidentally bought one of those 50 "Legacy of Horror" films and do you believe I'm still looking through them to find a good HORROR movie in it. Sometimes you like another fun such as The Devil's Messenger or The Devil Bat, or one of the great Alfred Hitchcock movies (some are not horrible but there just because Hitchcock directed some horror and tension), but sometimes it looks like to put movies like The Island Monster because they can not accept the fact that they would be easily forgotten and should be in that case. So we opened up for the idea of ​​Vesting Games. . The rich, but cruel and insulting father who played Carradine (the only permanent feature of this) died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who still hated him. Carradine gives enough good performance as always, but has largely remained in voice recording and flashback sequences, leaving us to sit through the central / horrible performances. The rest of the actors either exaggerate or turn into scenes. Since it was an independent film of the '70s, lighting and effects were pretty limited. It is difficult to build a lot of tension when the viewer can not see what is happening in some scenes. Some actors like Igor and Elga are at least trying hard, and I am ashamed of admitting that he eventually left me to laugh mainly for the sake of pure nonsense, but with a little less fortune that they got a version of the plant, or rather obviously who it is done, but it is not enough to improve the quality of the film. You should not love characters because they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic, but take it to a completely new level and make many invisible. Death scenes are pretty bad, and uncertainty is not actually there. It proves that you would probably enjoy the movie "Chilling" that contains movies like a house on a fretted hill, a small grocery store with Jack Nicholson, and the Night of Living Dead over it. This is best avoided.
