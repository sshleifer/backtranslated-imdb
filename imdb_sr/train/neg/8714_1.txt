I could not stop laughing! This film is incredibly funny and stupid! But it does not matter, it's very fun! In this film you do not have to pay attention to anything! The acting is the same - LAME! Dinosaurs are the same - GUMA (Oh, I could see a stick holding T-Rek head for a moment). some scenes his head looks kind of stuffed and looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten. The action is fast, sometimes too fast, I'm actually talking about quick editing, they were edited so fast, so we can not see rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! to late, they are tires! Well, the only thing that's interesting here is to see Rick Dean in this sequel. What can I say ... do not rent it ... watch it on TV, with friends, it's much fun!
