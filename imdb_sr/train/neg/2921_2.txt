The story relates to genealogy researchers (Mel Harris) who hired her aunt Estee Lauder as a cosmetic queen. Her aunt (after the marriage we left) is trying to find her long-standing family in Europe. All that needs to be done is a photo of a young girl standing next to the decorated music box. The researcher goes to Europe and leads his search in places like Milan, Budapest and Vienna. The landscape is the real thing and it was actually filmed at the location (unlike the murder, she wrote where Jessica should visit the distant end and Lansburi never left Burbank). In any case, she meets a young man who also tries to solve her family mystery and unite to find traces and threats to bad guys. Dialogue, especially romantic dialogue, is terrible. I watched this for scenography, but the scenario was so bad that I was just left to see if it would get worse. Yes. The act was also turned off. I see why Mel Haris's career never started after the thirtieth anniversary, but she is adequate (she looks too old for her). But the supporters are directly from the home to the game. I lost counting how many times they say "Budapest" to each other. Yes, pronounced Bood-a-phesht. We know, all right? Halfway, I realized that this was one of those Harlequin movies and it's safe. I guess it's all talking.
