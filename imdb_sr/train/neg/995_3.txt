Rosario Davson plays a girlfriend who is raped, and then begins decent in the dark until she has a chance to get revenge. Although it is clear why Davson took over the role, he had a chance to show his acting heads and make a small independent, decisive non-sexual film, and it is also clear that apart from the fantastic good looks, Davson seems unwise in that role. Excuse me, I just could not find it. It's not a mistake, I felt so, I had no idea where she was. Yes, I know it's on the screen, but although I spent most of the two hours watching it, it did not leave me impressed. The guilty script for this, because apart from the end, it did not seem that much of what happened on the screen had a real meaning. People seemed to be more holding than real, and what was happening did not fit. Forgive me for being vague, but nothing in this movie, except for the end (which I would like to talk about, but I can not spoil it), and the image of Rosario Davson as nothing more than a picture, he stayed with me What can I say, this can Click with you, maybe not, it's time for me to not return. Just for fans of Rosario Davson, although they were warned that there are several real reasons why this is NC17. (And Rosario, please, you are better actress, choose better scenarios)
