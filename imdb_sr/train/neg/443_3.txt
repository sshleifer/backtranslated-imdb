All in all, an extremely disappointing picture. Very, very slowly, it builds on the basic story. The role of Mary Schr√∂der in pursuit of her family in a secret past. (Every phenomenon lasts forever. There's really no rhythm in the movie.) *** SPOILERS *** Her mother Ruth was saved by a Nazis, from a German woman, played by Katja Riemann. The whole character Ruth is so dimensional, so stereotyped. *** SPOILERS PLACE *** The film is cut between today's New York and Berlin and Berlin's 40s. Please, when you do, give the audience an indication of when the story is going on. There is never a clear indication of time? very embarrassing. The worst part is the end. *** SPOILERS *** A whole show and a joke about the Jews being so terribly tortured, simply because of a bureaucratic accident! Give me a break. So the Jews got out of Rosenstrasse? The question of who released the Jews never answered. Did the Gebels get rid of them? Did Lean Fischer sleep with Goebels? In Venice, the film received an actress award for K. Riemanna, why? ?? I have no idea. Must be a Jewish theme?
