You can not imagine how I rejoiced with the king of ants. As a big fan of Gordon, I was waiting for a European premier with vicious expectations. Especially because I loved Dagon - Gordon's last achievement - so much. The king of ants was premiered here in my country and Gordon himself came to present it. Unfortunately, I could not go and congratulate him on this. The king of ants is his most inspirational and central film to date. Really, the level of quality has never surpassed the standard TV-thriller standards. The draft sketch is terribly routine and with the exception of a few bad scenes, the typical Gordon-touch is never recognized. On top of that, already a bad script has more holes than a Swiss cheese bowl! This includes a young fraudster who is hired to commit murder. And of course they do not pay it. And, of course, she falls in love with the victim's wife, and, of course, she is being refreshed. Only the sequences in which a man descends into a spiral of madness is worth mentioning and they are the only ones who remind you of the fact that you are still watching Stuart Gordon's film. Acting performances are below average, and McCenna as a heroic life, George `Norm Peterson 'Vendt as a fat-faced bastard, and Kari Vurcher as a benign sex bomb. Extremely illogical things happen constantly and the dullness of the story very quickly becomes irritating, while the effects of make-up are not enough to satisfy even amateurs of amateur horror. I read a few more comments about King of the Ants, claiming that Gordon is the best, since he is finally provoking a mature movie. much. Oh well, I guess every good director runs out of steam and inspiration in the end. It's a shame that he overcame Stuart Gordon.
