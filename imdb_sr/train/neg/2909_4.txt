Watching Tom Hanks as an assassin for the Irish Mafia is a bit like that of Jimmy Stuart as a serial rapist who just does not work. It was hard for me to accept this. I do not think Tom can not behave that I've followed his career since mazes and monsters, but for some reason this came to my mind. Maybe because I'm a graphic novel fan and I risk to sound like a fanboi (the only form of life lower than a fanboi is a cockroach) The movie as a whole does not work. The additions to Jude Leo, and taking everything else left me feeling cold and more than disappointed. I expected a big movie about Bonnie's crime and Clide Mendes took all the heart out of the story and left us just with naked bones. There are things to be loved in this movie, however, cinema takes away breath by filling the screen with beautiful pictures. Paul Nevman is as good and really enjoyed the result, but Tom as Sullivan's "angel of death" was completely flat.
