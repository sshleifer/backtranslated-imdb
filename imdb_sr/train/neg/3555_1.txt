Many years ago my filmmakers and I went to see a horror movie that we thought would be good because it played John Cassavettes. For the unknown, John Cassavettes was an actor, screenwriter and director (married actor Genom Rovlands), nominated three times for Oscar, who wrote and directed a series of good low-budget films using his income as an actor to sustain himself. Until seeing Incubus, we did not understand that the income of John Cassavettes was made from any film offered to him. If we knew what the film was, before we saw it, we might have avoided it. But we did not get out. At that time, my friend and I, funny, showed that it was the worst movie ever made. Frankly, this is not true. I've seen many badly recorded movies on Cinemaku on Friday night (did I say that loudly?) Which are far worse than Incubus. Almost every film with Brian Bosworth is by definition a worse film than Incubus. Sure, Santa Claus wins Martian is a worse film than Incubus. However, since then, I have been using Incubus since then as a threshold below which I do not want to fall. When you talk to this friend about a movie I've ever seen, I'll always notice that it was better (or worse) than Incubus. <br /> <br /> http: //thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
