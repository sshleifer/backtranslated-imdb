I had great expectations after "My Beautiful Laundry", "Bend It Like Beckham" and (less) "East is East". The history of the British Asians that fit into their adopted home has had many good moves on the big screen, as well as a series of excellent TV and radio series (goodness me gracious, etc.). This fall. Despite the good start, he quickly climbed downhill. In the end, this was a terribly typical effort by the BBC, complete with strong regional accents, crazy cast characters, "they were days", and many "problems" in an attempt to be worthy. I found out that in this film appeared in many spots. Writing is predictable. Every possible cliché is drawn and broadcast. In fact, I have a problem thinking about any cross-cultural / intergenerational devices that could not be used. The characters were thin and cliché: an eccentric nonconformist minister; good meaning, but ultimately a racist old woman; overweight aunts; push Indian parents; neighbor of the working class; 'wise' deep granny; riding motorcycle. The scenario was weak, with every chance to shock the audience with an open racist dialogue of two adopted racist white men. And why it had to be set in the 70s (except for the soundtrack of the 70's), is a mystery. Maybe it makes incredible characters a little more convincing to people who were born after 1979. I do not know. Even these things aside, good action could have taken it into a respectable ambiguity. Instead, the usual suspects "BBC comedy" were drawn to extinguish them. "Bend it like Beckham" had a far better comic acting (and a serious acting, in fact) than this, with practically unknown actors. In short, lazy cliche script, over acting, in a blunt form predictable story. Let him go. <br /> <br />
