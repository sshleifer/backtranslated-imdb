This movie is horrible. Give me a dentist any time! Can you believe that one of the main TV stations in Arabia had this as your Christmas movie! I can only assume they were expecting to entertain the audience with Dudley Moore, not this. The last time I looked at my bottle of hot water, he had more acting, better plot, more drama and much more interest than this celluloid waste. Do not even look if you're drunk!
