If you've seen other movies like this one, they're probably better. The Omega man comes to mind. Thanks to the studies, they avoided a huge, unnecessary, big budget technofest that features films of this type. Additionally, the setting and premise were excellent: four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us is trying to escape from a huge infectious lethal illness. What's bad is ALL the rest! I'm tired of the infinitely stupid, negligent, bad, inefficient, arrogant characters in the film. This largely describes everything in the movie. I rented it and I found myself shouting on TV several times, "no, do not do it!", "Why are you so stupid," "watch!", Itd. The real lack of character development is obvious halfway. The film should give you a strong personal connection with at least some characters, so you really care about what will happen to them. This one does not. Also, it should have been a longer, more involved end of the film.
