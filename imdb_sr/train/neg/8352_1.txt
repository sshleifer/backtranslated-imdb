I rented this movie because it belongs to the genres of "romance" and "western", with some striking landscapes from Grand Canion. This film is pure trash! The romance is between a young girl who has not gone through puberty and a middle-aged man! A child is also likable to other men who are trying. It's sick. Peter Fonda is portrayed as a brilliant attempt to resist her attraction to Brooke Shields, and her character is mostly the one who strives for that relationship. She tries to wash her, but in the end she surrenders and rides out as a happy, beloved couple. That's disgusting. I do not see how this movie could attract anybody other than pedophiles.
