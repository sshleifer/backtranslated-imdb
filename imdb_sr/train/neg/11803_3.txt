When someone is processing a classic movie, remake is always unfavorable to the original. Also, there is a possibility that the remake is so radically different that the audience is too unknown. Well, the television version of "Double Indemnity" from 1973 has almost the same scene and dialogue as the original from 1944. . The main difference is that the remake seems to have no energy at all. Fred MacMurrai was brilliant as the defamatory insurance agent Valter Neff in the original; Richard Crenna looks just tired and tired. Edward G. Robinson brought a great manic energy to his role as MacMurray's boss Barton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, a good actor, seems almost bored in the process. Samantha Eggar is wrong as Phillis Dietrichson, who is stabbed backwards; While Barbara Stanvick was wonderful in this evil role, Eggar is exuberantly kind and persistent, and it looks like she's far from the place. taking the role of Porter Hall as a key witness, bring a life to the film. In particular, Webber recreates the role of Norton in the context of the 1970s. However, after the film starts, the whole thing just lies there, with no life or electricity. This is a movie that should never have been worked out.
