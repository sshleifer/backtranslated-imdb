I watched this film at the Rotterdam Festival, as did all other voters. The director was present and it seemed that he worked very hard and was very dedicated to the project, which, in my opinion, explains the above-average reception and marks it. The most striking is the feature-length episode of Aussie's favorite "Round the Twist", but it takes too much seriousness to even have that feature. The movie itself may be worth looking at if you are trying to make a world tour in the cinema in all the UN member countries because I can not imagine another Fiji film, but it was generic in general, it behaved poorly (though by amateurs) and prey subordinate mentality. It seems that these stories must have been for the islanders to try to swing, but as long as there is a substantially decent white governor, all problems can be solved (leaving the island).
