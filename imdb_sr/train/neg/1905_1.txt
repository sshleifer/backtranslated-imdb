I am one of the biggest lovers of silent comedians and I probably have reviewed more Buster Keaton films for IMDb than any other person. Every film I've taken since the beginning of my career until the early 30's with just two exceptions, I've reviewed, so you can say I'm a big fan. That's why I considered this episode so painful and difficult to watch. I loved the film of this man and I was constantly thinking "Buster, how could you?". Well, now that I'm thinking about it, I guess I can see why Buster Keaton acted in this horrible episode of THE TVILIGHT ZONE. He lost most of his wealth after an unbalanced divorce in the early thirties of the last century, and his film career as a leading man has long since passed. Now, in the sixties, Keaton needed the money and loved his rebirth in popularity, so he dealt with everyone who was willing to pay - appearing in movies on the beach and this riot from a big series. The biggest problem with this episode is that it is terribly written and Buster deserves much better. The show should be ridiculous, but it's not that instead of being honored with silent films, it's just painful to watch - especially when Keaton puts on that stupid helmet for time travel, as well as all the badly slapstick. Do yourself a favor, SHARE THIS ONE - it's a pale imitation of a size that once was a Keaton career!
