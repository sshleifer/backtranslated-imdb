Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and $ 2 for rent in my life. If nothing catastrophic happens before I die, this will be the greatest regret for my life. Who ever thought of this movie, or financed it deserves a blow between the legs, because they thought there when they were filming this movie. It's about an overweight guy who's a hopeless romantic, and writes pretentious nonsense trying to pass like poetry. He joins his love friend when traveling on the coast. Where girls meet and similar. Only a fat guy does not get a girlfriend. Leather shifts do not irritate me, I take them for a nominal value. But this film is trying to be more than a movie. It's about a fat guy who seeks love in a girl, but then he sees a second bikini silicon girl who enjoys his poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball who gets money for his family and impresses ladies, just because he already has his lady anyway. The dialogue is awfully awful even for the C film. Supports the tone of black stereotypes, without character development, it is a glorified porn movie, without pornography in it. Never watch this movie.
