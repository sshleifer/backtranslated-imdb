Wonderful actors. Bad script and not too big a line. My main problem was that I simply did not look at any of these people. No killer, no victim. The settings were pretty gloomy. The character of Dennis Quaid was so badly written, I did not care when the end came. He returned his child. Very important! I wanted my money back.
