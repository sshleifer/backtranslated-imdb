I have to confess, I do not remember much about the characters or stories, although I'm not sure that it was, I was so upset with this film that I was hardly focused on it. How can you call the movie "Tulsa Keys" and then record it in Texas? The flat desert land around Arlington (I think it was the location) does not in any way resemble the green hills around Tulsa, and the famous person in Tulsa would have a much nicer environment in which to live. Tulsa would otherwise understand that nothing in the movie does not resemble him at all. Did not anyone see at least Rumblefish or The Outsiders? I know this sounds great but I can not. I watched this because I love James Spader and I usually find Eric Stotz interesting. But even these two intriguing actors could not revive this winding, and the story of self-involved people who are NOT in Tulsa !! I'm sorry, it can not be more expensive in Oklahoma. What if "Live and Die in LA" was killed in Toronto? Is that bullshit? Well, this works.
