It would be better to be amplified significantly by doing it as a 50-minute episode of the External Borders. Too much redundant material and things such as the main villain who seem to have escaped from the Phantom of the Opera did not help. The whole range of "Night of the Living Dead" was extremely stupid and completely unnecessary. After all, if the dead were to punish someone for their sins, now remind me who killed everyone else?
