Much of the scene should be cut off. There are many scenes that should be cut off. For example, a scene in which hunters mention "I have spiders on my dick," "I love dick," I play on a mud scene, or in a bar scene where professional hunters on dinocroke are the main job of a snake. br> How about other horribly unrelated scenes with a woman, Diana who wants to lose her virginity to a walking boy as if wearing women's panties of three sizes too small. As they made love, did not they realize that they did so next to the little boy who would soon escape and lose his head? Why did they work in the living room? I mean, his head really turned. What do you say on a beach scene that resembles Steven Spielberg's Javs scene in Grant Lake. All these strange scenes can easily be dubbed and written as a comedy. Here in my local city, the Cineplek Theater advertised Dinocroc for months, and I'm glad I did not watch it. because I later learned that it was shown only 1 or 2 days before it was canceled. The film was TO bad. I suspect that Dinocroc is not a good movie that looks at the review. It contains the leg of Dinocroc, which looks like a child wearing green pajamas and claws and walking up and down as a 2-year-old. It can easily be overtaken as Babi Geniuses. If some students of filmmaking want to learn what to do, this is a real classic waste. Like Diane's boy walking as he had an advanced syphilis case, he wondered what a poor woman sees in this guy who looks drunk even before drinking a beer. When does this happen, who cares about Dinocroc? Men's panties looked more interesting than the whole movie about Dinocrock. His acting was so bad that he was a much better substitute for Mr. Bean. MOVE OVER ROVAN ATKINSON, here's a man with better comedy talent in a horror sci-fi movie. Perhaps the worst in Hollywood history.
