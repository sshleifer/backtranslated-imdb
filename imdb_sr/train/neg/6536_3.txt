It seems that this DVD is targeted at someone who will just put it and play in an endless loop in the background. It is organized as a series of music videos by Grand Canioni set on various pieces of Tangerine Dream music. Unfortunately, TD music is annoying, and the transmission to DVD looks pretty blurry and blurry. Too much DVD for what it is.
