The American Human Association, a source of the renowned disclaimer of "No Animal Damaged ..." (registered trademark AHA), began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago, after connecting the eyes of the horse was forced to jump until his death from the top of the cliff for filming in Jesse James (1939). Needless to say that a horrible act killed for me the whole aspect of the fun in this movie. I suppose it could be said that at least the horse did not die in vain because it was the beginning of the public's awakening from the gruesome and terrible pain that caused animals to the glory of film creativity, but I can not help but feel that if a poor animal has a choice, it surely it would not be the way he would have taken!
