After watching this, I thought, there are either too few good writers and directors or many producers. In any case, this is a horrible movie. It's terrible in a way that it's not fun, but it makes you tease and tremble your teeth. It makes you cry "this is wrong" on the movie. Immersion is zero. So far, most of you are probably accustomed to horrible mistakes / odds in movies where computer hackers are in them. This film is like that in every way. The only good thing in the movie is Emili's girlfriend, which was greatly played by Eliza Bennett. I hope it will become great, and do this ... at least something worthwhile. Do yourself a favor. Do not look at this. There is no real action. Total waste of time.
