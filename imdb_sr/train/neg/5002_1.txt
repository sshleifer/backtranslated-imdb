How was such an awesome script managed to attract this actor? Funny, predictable and completely incredible, this is well-acting and smoothly directed, but the material is so bad that it still qualifies as one of the worst trillers of all the time I've seen for years. Stunningly bad, not in a fun way. Avoid at all costs, even if you are a fan of someone in the acting team.
