After Disney's spirited George from the living, I had great hopes for this film. Great disappointment. Thread bare plot, bad acting, bad visual effects. This film rely on chromatic single-layer, idiotic (and pointless) product placement, and the strongest boring blow in that car. I took two young kids to see him and they got bored. The only laughter received from this movie was a poor performance when a laugh was needed to show the guy who put him in the groin!
