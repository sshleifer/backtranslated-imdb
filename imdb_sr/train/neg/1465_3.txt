First of all I would like to add that I am a historian in a way, so what I'm looking for in a film based on historical events is that it's actually based on historical facts. But this is not the case in this case. Of course, the movie is fun and everything except the fact that it is not entirely based on true facts is more than boring. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth, he even worked for the Jews before the First World War. However, during the First World War, he then formed his views on the Jews. His upbringing in this film is also incorrect, Hitler as a child was not an upset little crap. He had more or less normal education. Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important parts that contribute to Hitler's puzzle. Robert Carlile is an excellent actor, but does not fit into Hitler's role. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as he was shown here. In the younger years he was a charismatic person who "manipulated" people with their charms. His unstable behavior and outbursts of anger began in the turning point of the war. I would like to see a film about Hitler's life based on real historical facts, not on the accusations. I really hate when people put their finger on, for example, Hitler and others and tell the inaccurate stories just to paint them as pure evil. It's much better to tell the story exactly as it is, so everyone can learn how it looked! Those behind this film should have done some research before they did this. Because it looks like they did not even know what really happened. Hitler was not even shot at a revolutionary march in Munich, his shoulder was wiped out of the cup. It gives you more to see a good documentary than to see this.
