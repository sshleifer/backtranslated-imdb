In 1925, childhood friends Marie Dressler (like Maggie Varren) and Polly Moran (like Lizzie Praskins) oversaw the wedding of their children, Anite Page (like Helen) and Norman Foster (like John). Before the celebration, Mrs. Dressler turns the rule of her small city bank into her son, Mr. Foster. Six years later, the Great Depression brings many bank closures and financial insecurity. Banker Foster is able to survive, thanks to the wise planning of Mother Dressler. But, Mrs. Moran is worried about her fortune and loudly demands complete withdrawal. Other Varren Banks clients hear Moran's joke and start to question their solvency. Soon, the family is in a financial crisis. The scant critical and financial film "Emma" came out early this year, and MGM had to wish to get the new Dressler's movie as soon as possible. possible. Dressler's 1931 hits, "Reducing" and "Politics" were still making a lot of money; and Dressler became US # 1 Bok Office Star in 1932, according to the list of industry standards compiled by Kuiglei Publications. "Prosperity" certainly celebrated Dressler's status, but production seems unusually shattering and hurrying. Actors do well, taking into account. Something more worrying about the direction and editing, and some more attempts, would help? Apparently, they needed them in holiday theaters. **** Prosperiti (11/12/32) Sam Vood ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Anita Page, Norman Foster
