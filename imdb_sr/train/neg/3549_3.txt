Do you like to get up? Then keep away from this ... During the early rounds, there are actually good comics, but if they do not have some sweet qualities, they have a chance. Any controversial material and you are OUT! ... and I think I was hurt as much as the comedians who were rejected, when I see who the distorted judges have let go in. 1 of my first 4 has done so far from the previous one. Half of the finalists gave me a laugh. Several of them have raised their materials elsewhere, which seems to have no problems. It's more fun than much of what's on TV, but it's incredibly hard to watch without thinking what could have been. If the producers changed the name of the competition to "Last Clovn Standing", all my critique would have lost the validity. Maybe an idea?
