This piece of shit could have been praised 60 years ago, but that's one of the most diverse films ever made by Indian Indians playing white people. Right-wing Republican James Stevart was a huge real-life racist, just like his close friend John Wayne. In 1971, Stevart fired Hal Villiams with "The Jimmy Stevart Shov" (a short-lived series that mercifully collapsed) just because Villiams was a black man. As if this was not bad enough, this film is very obsolete and boring. Watch "Dancing With Wolves" instead of a less racist look. Stevart was in the forties when this horrible movie was made, and even with his ridiculous perik still looked like a pedophile pursuit after 16 years Debra Paget. I'm surprised that it was allowed. 0/10.
