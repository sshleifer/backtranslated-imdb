This is a typical late-night Universal Horror Flick: its technically competent, if it's about numbers, with a complication for cutting cookies and some serious exaggeration. The most interesting part of this film is his throwing stuntman Randy Hatton, a man with bone disease as a "monster" movie. It's sad that this man was exploited, but he probably made good use of the money they paid him. Hatton is less terrible than the studio hoped, as I felt more pity for fear or even anxiety. Martin Koslack is on board as a crazy filmmaker, and he is very funny in this part. I like to see Koslack in anything; For some reason, I am amused. The only other part of the movie that entertained me was the absurd film of the film about the world of art. Here artistic critics are shown who enjoy their ability to break artists; This is alongside the male "hero" film that is the "artist" painting ... gets this ... pin up girls. Somehow, the work of our hero is considered shoulder to shoulder with a vile absurd sculpture. It is also fun to be the main annoying critic of the film, who at one point claims to despise the artistic art of the hero because "there are no such women", which our heroine answers with the certainty that the critic simply does not come out enough. . Finally, there is also a part of the subgroup of heroin (which is itself an art critic), the indoctrination of the leading man ... totally antifeminist and funny to testify. All in all, this film is a pretty central picture with a few fun elements.
