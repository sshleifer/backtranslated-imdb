The only movie I've ever left. Amazing, because I paid for myself and my meeting and I'm really cheap. But my brain could no longer bear a bundle that had accumulated, especially because I could write more fun material while I was tied and gagged. From the beginning to the end this movie insults. Worse, it's not funny. It was not funny then, and now it's certainly not funny. But worse, this film is the beginning of the end of a truly smart, sophisticated comedy. This is a youthful, really scenario scenario, and ideas began in the era (which continues to this day) in which cheap laughter and sexual hints dominate the culture of comedy in the film. Which high school student did not think? Start of the end.
