This is no doubt one of the worst movies ever, I stress, EVER made. Worse still, my old hero Dolph is in it and plays him. Jesus ... The story is actually pretty good, but the way it's done is that even my body is hurt. Fighting scenes for beginners are also choreographed like a fight between two drunks who throw it into the gut. Actors, except for Dolf, who somehow squeeze, perform so badly that you can not help but wonder if their reason for being is that all the directors of the director, who, by the way, are mostly absent, if not all the time. This is 12 million spent in an unimaginable way, because in terms of effects and landscape, costs can not be a cent above ยง1000.
