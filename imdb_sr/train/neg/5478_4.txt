Without any better, I decided to look at the "Aztec Rek" (how it is charged) for hell. The silly story may have played better that the effects of dinosaurs were convincing. They actually looked like animations (those rough designs later used by artists to complete CGI effects, adding more detail, smoother movements, etc.). Absolutely horrible dinosaurs, which is the only reason you would probably want to go through this. One of the factors that He was buying a wonderful Dichen Lachman like Aiacoatl. She kept my interest; that only the budget was enhanced and that some convincing dinosaurs could be used. Disappointingly. At least the actors and the team got a free trip to Hawaii, where the film was filmed.
