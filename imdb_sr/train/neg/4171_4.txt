I walked this title 15 or 20 times while I was in Blockbuster, looking for something that is half-way to watch. All I can say is that they were all in the middle of decent movies the night I chose to rent this. I will give him the merit of being better than the "Dracula 3000", but in reality it's pretty easy to say because he did not have Caper Van Dien in it. Other things that were missing in peaks were: an interesting actress, an interesting story, good dialogue and originality, but I suppose you can not have everything. *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** Vampire Hunters (one of which was a vampire ... go figure) flew from the mining colony to the mining colony trying to destroy all the vampires he could find. The crew consisted of: Captain, who does not die, who dies early, his books, but also the inexperienced first partner, the aforementioned vampire hunter for the vampire (not mistakes), a cowboy who wants REALLI, REALLI butch Asian commandos, a "tough guy" female ... almost sounds like an actor for MTV's 'The Real Worl'. After the captain dies in violent conflict with a bunch of bloodsheds (and as it turned out, fans of finer parts of human anatomy), his first friend takes over ... blah, blah, blah ... everyone hates him .. blah, blah, blah .. . I could proceed, but as I said that the same story was used in about a hundred other films of this genre. The effects were cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this movie outside of me. The vampire vampire hunter (still not a mistake) was quite hot, but of course, if you wait for her to reveal more of her décolleté, look somewhere else. I can not say that it was the worst movie I saw, as I actually rented 'Starship Troopers 2', but wait for it to come on the Sci-Fi channel.
