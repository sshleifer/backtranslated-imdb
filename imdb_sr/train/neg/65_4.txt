I did not really get a rating for Amate Girls and I think I was really good and gave her 4 out of ten. my eyes. There are so many cliches in that flick, a woman's hair is just terrible and most of the scenes are more than unreal or looks fake. There is no real passion in this film, but a bunch of actors who exaggerate in all the borders that hurt. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so in my eyes it's just not good. Looking at him, I could not believe how it did so to my TV in my living room in Switzerland. But .. maybe it's still OK and just lost in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen and certainly not in a good way! Sorry.
