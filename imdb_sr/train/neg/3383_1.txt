For the first time I watched a live musical at the Denver Performing Arts Center and it was absolutely amazing, Stunning and had such a fantastic continuity of complicity and dialogue that I liked much more than most of the musicals I saw on stage. It's interesting that you NEVER seen Zach's face. He was always in the dark, but his presence was powerful and directed the direction of the whole production. When I heard they were filming, I waited with saturated breath, but when I watched the movie version, I was so disappointed that I felt I was cheated. The film lacks a stunning mood in live production and never allows you to be completely close to each character. Personally, I would again like to see the live version, and if it ever should be revived, I would strongly recommend that you leave your own way to see it. This will be one of the unforgettable experiences in which you will enjoy.
