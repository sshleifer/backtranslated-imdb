This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen, everything is bad and incoherent about him. The acting is absurd, the costumes are even thinner and the story does not exist. This sword and adventure movie about poverty was intended to encompass some of the successes that Beastmaster and Conan enjoyed, but this does not give us any reason to follow. The main character is lukewarm and boring, can not even fight with the sword, and the sword is from the 16th century. All action sequences are such, slow and unreal, not to mention the castle and terribly obsolete music whenever they ride a horse. Do not even bother with this shit.
