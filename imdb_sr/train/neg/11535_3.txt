Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, motivated, career woman who takes over the working class Danni Dier for a night party. After a stupid accident in the village, they were brutally attacked. After recovering, and after accidentally encountering one of the attackers, their thoughts turn to revenge ... I thought the Straightheads were terrible. Violent, brutal, misogyny and unpleasant. If I did not like that phrase, I would call it "Straightheads" a video, nasty. Certainly it was a movie that would not have a budget edition directly on the video during the dark days of the 1980s. Frankly, I do not know how Straightheads got a movie release. I am not a culprit. I do not mind sex and violence in movies, but they must be married with a) a good plot or b) good description or c) preferably both. "Straightheads" did not have either. There is no progression in the plot or characters, and too much remained unexplained and unspoken. Fortunately, "Straightheads" did not go anywhere fast. It was only 80 minutes long. It was a disgrace, because here was the interesting movie movie, with a particularly interesting twist in conspiracy in the last third. How often I say it, but it may have been good that it was right. What a shame. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dier, but they are hiding in this movie. It is especially underestimated (and is still particularly appropriate). If you want to see a good British movie about revenge, rent or buy Shane Meadows' Dead Man's Shoes. It's a little masterpiece. Last weekend I should have seen his "This is England". Ser sera sera ... \ t
