Since the kids forced me to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last two Christmas, I feel adequately qualified to judge this version of Dr. Seus' classic story, and ... it's not very good. First, after a classical act such as Chuck Jones's animated TV a special program will be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so difficult and susceptible to be positively hampered. I admit that there is a handful of inspired legends, but overall, the film appears as a cash money calculation, at the same time as it allegedly condemns the commercialization of Christmas. Jim Carrey is usually here above the top, but it's totally inconsistent with the character of Grinch. As Boris Karloff characterized, he was slowly slow; methodical and cunning. There is no method for Carrie's madness, and that's just the most obvious mistake. Talented actors such as Jeffrey Tambor and Christina Baranas are completely lost here. Why, Universal, why? I mean, I understand that Tony Hopkins will take any kind of role (similar to his countryman Michael Caine), but this should be submitted under "Movies that should never have been made." This does not sound good for the Cat in the hat, even for the thinner part that the Universe prepares for this Christmas. I have the feeling that I will recommend the same recommendation for this, as with this: skip it, or read a book or watch a TV show. This is 2 hours you can never return.
