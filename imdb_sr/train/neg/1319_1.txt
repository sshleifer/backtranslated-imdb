Probably someone heard about Alberto Tomb. An ex-policeman, formerly a heavenly champion, and now, THE WONDERFUL Actor. "Alek L'Ariete" is planned to be a TV "mini-series", but Italian television itself refused to show the movie on its channels. Now, believe me, it's a funny movie. The script is simply hilarious (it should be a drama film), something like a 5-year-old child's job. But what really strikes you is an amateur actor: Alberto Tomba, who was not really convinced as a policeman, plays a terribly stupid figure: a special operator Italian policeman specialized in breaking the door! ("ariete" is "ram"). This super-boy will try to save a young beautiful girl (the real Italian "little" TV shovgirl, married by singer Eros Ramazzotti): fin, but absolutely incapable of acting. Lose this and do yourself a favor. A film that is embarrassing for Italian cinema: only John Travolta in Earth Attack is closer ...
