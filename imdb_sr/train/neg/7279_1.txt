I just watched this movie at a local television station (TV8 in Big Chuck and Little John in Cleveland, Ohio). I've never heard of this film and decided to watch it. it can even help me to describe how bad this movie really is. The scenario is terrible. The acting, well apart from one of the two exceptions, is meaningless because there is nothing in this material that deserves any real effort. It looks like a bunch of small ideas, the rest of the different writing, where it is thrown into a mixer. It's not just funny. The "Parodian" aspect is at best taut. Some references are almost obsolete (even at the time of publication). No wonder I never heard of it, it's really bad, worse than anything in Saturdays Night Live, MAD TV or even in In Living's worst day. If you see it on TV, it's an excellent example of NOT filming a movie. Whatever you do DO NOT REMOVE THE CENTER. Adam
