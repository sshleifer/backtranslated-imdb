It's really sad that it was supposedly the biggest budget with which Halestorm Entertainment had to work. Everyone involved should be punished for throwing garbage because the celluloids that have been lost are good only for filling garbage. Not only is writing horrible and jokes are terrible, but the camera's work and the quality of the movie are at best amateurish. Soundtrack sounds like it was created on some laptops. The worst part of all is that I was actually going through the whole thing. I think that just because I could not believe that I actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater in which I watched it actually agreed to show a "movie".
