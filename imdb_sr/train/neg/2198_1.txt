The scientist and his little girl ride out when his speed causes a car accident. He runs unharmed, but he is beheaded. She rescues her head, brings her home and keeps her in her life (!!!!). Then she continues to look for models and strippers for the perfect body for the head. His crippled helper looks over the head that starts to talk and has a telepathic (or telepathic) connection with a deformed monster that is kept in the wardrobe .... As you can see, this is pretty stupid, but I had a certain inclination accordingly. When I grew up in the late seventies, a local TV station showed this film about 20 times a year (without exaggeration). They were shown on Saturday afternoon TV - uncircumcised. Seeing it on TV was great then! Explicit blood and up, together with a horrible monster and humorous sexploitation - who cares if it's good? Seeing this now I realize how badly this is. The idea is perfectly miserable, the production values ​​do not exist, the script is pretty stupid and (apart from being pretty nasty up there) this is boring. There is also a tough fight between two cats and a recognized monster at the end. Add and finish that leaves tons of free ends. On the one hand, this is an interesting example of the exploitative film from the 1960s. On the other hand, it's completely garbage. In any case, this is not a good movie, but it is unavoidable (for a while only) for fans of horror and fans. Also, the laughter of the head is quite dreadful. Pay attention to the final loans to which TITLE is wrong (calling it "A head that would not die")!
