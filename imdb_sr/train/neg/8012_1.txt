As a lesbian, I am always looking for films related to gays and lesbians. However, with this type of crap - it would be enough to discourage every audience. I was constantly waiting for something to happen - anything! - a story to be developed, or just to make sense of it. There was nothing. These were just meaningless scenes, unconnected in any way with anything. The film did not give any story or depth to the character. After an hour or more of this nonsense, I simply turned it off. Do not get lost. Your time on this absurdity. 1 star - and it does not even deserve.
