"Intensive Care" Dorne von Rouveroi is one of the worst horror films ever made. This extremely cheap Dutch slasher movie offers some up and much absurd situations. A strange surgeon has a car accident. He lies in a coma for seven years, then wakes up and goes to the bloody game. "Intensive Care" is obviously under the influence of American films The murders are hilarious and the dialogues are painfully stupid. However, if you are in the right mood, you can give this piece of garbage look. You'll laugh until you hurt this one - you can trust me!
