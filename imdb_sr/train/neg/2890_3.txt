The past climbs on a rehabilitation addict when she reconnects with her sick brother and former girlfriend after what she hoped would be the last in detoxification. "Life drama", presented here in the simplest way imaginable (even writing does not have any angle or wit). Actors are made up of attractive actors who glamorize each other glamorously, and music and photography are sad (some visual effects are ridiculous, indie-clich√©s touch that stink of a poor budget). Although written and directed by a man, it's made by a woman, and I'm not sure, but I think that this may be a special reason why this picture of two men, alienated brothers is getting closer, is never quite gel, never feeling natural or It's an attempt to get into a male relationship, but a careful, sterile presentation is a scam. Nobody is the heart in this, lives, breathes or bleeds this material. "Perfect son" is spreading rapidly from too many cooks in the kitchen.
