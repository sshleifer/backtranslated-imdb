Diana Guzman is an angry young woman. Surviving an inexorable series of disappointments and trauma, she rages to the nearest targets. When she sees violence transformed and focused in discipline in a rejected boxing club, she knows she has found her home. The movie is progressing from there, while Diana teaches the usual age lessons with the skills needed for a successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good in that role, especially when she conveys the fierce anger of a young woman who has been on all sides and fights not only personal circumstances but also rooted sexism. to his direction are all young actors, who fade in relation to the older, more experienced actors. The scenario has too many breaks, which diminishes the dramatic tension. The total silence of the film is exhausting from intensity. This is a good picture you need to see once, at least to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to incorporate her power. Its limitations prevent it from being placed in the "See and Again" category.
