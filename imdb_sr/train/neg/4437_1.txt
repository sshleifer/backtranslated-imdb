"Triumph of Love" does not celebrate anything. It's boring, torturous, 4 hours of torture. In fact, it's just under 2 hours, it just looked much longer. It hurts me to think of the amateur performances of such fine actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shav. Supporting players are not so horrible. Perhaps they tried to be so on the top, to be clowny, but, if so, I did not see it so. Mira Sorvino makes no impression in any way. She's there. I suppose it is a game of the same name, written by Marivauk 270 years ago, much better. It can not be worse. Clare Peploe, the writer and director of this film, is inspired by the recent production of the show. I do not know what she meant when she made this bomb. Maybe it's all lost in translation.
