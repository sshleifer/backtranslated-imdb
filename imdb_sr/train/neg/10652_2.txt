You know Jason, you know Freddie, and you know Leatherface. Now, get ready for: The killer Pin! Thus, in Killer Vorkout, the stupid film I've ever seen, an invisible killer sends out his (or her) victims a huge, novelty. It's a strange choice to be sure, what deserves an explanation. Of course, the film never tried to clarify where the killer got such a thing. As the title says, the aerobic gym is under siege by a crazy killer and everyone is suspected. In fact, the film gives little indication of the identity of the killer, almost everyone in the movie is a potential killer until he kills them. And since almost all but murderers are dead, it's actually just a process of elimination. Strange, while the whole name of the head is killed, aerobics continues seriously. In fact, nothing is able to stop the dance. While the three were killed in a neighboring room, the training continues. Death is not a factor; one character dies, but remains visible in later training sessions. Director David Prior knew what he was doing when he called Killer Vorkout, not Logical Vorkout. Just like a woman caught in a sunbathing bed, I felt very embarrassing to the end of Killer Vorkout. Eventually, fortunately, THE END flashed on the screen. What happened next? You realize, shooting the women they are working on. Even the end of the movie can not stop them! <br /> <br />
