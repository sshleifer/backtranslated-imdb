I would give this film 5 and not 3 if at least in time ... When I saw it for the first time, it was precisely what you could expect from a work that is not based on the artistic abilities of the director, but on an idealist or rather I would say the idiotic habits of our (Kazakhstan) government ... It's a shame because Kazakfil'm shot beautiful movies when he was not honored with the name of Shaken Aimanov, but he actually led it. Films like 'The End of Atamana', 'Kiz Zhibek' or even 'Aldar Kose'. However, after Mr. Aiman's death, the production of high-quality films almost fell dramatically in 10 years, as there were very few films. However, in the late eighties, 'Assa' was filmed, it was a film about the first organized criminal groups in a large country, a year later, Mr. Rashid Nugmanov shot another film with the same performance by the same actor / singer V.Toia. , then he was already a Soviet / Russian rock legend, - a movie called "Igla" (Igla or something) was brand new, someone called that period a resurrection or a new Kazakh film wave. Unfortunately, today we do not have quality films, our directors who are filming films on French and Japanese financial support, and thus the films are not for the public but for professional critics of the author, some of them take the price at the international film festivals of the author, but very few of them are becoming business asset ... and back to our 'nomads'. Such films are usually unpopular due to enormous aspects. The same effect was with Nikita Mikhalkova's "Siberian Cyrillic" about Russian emigrants, which was also recorded on parities with foreign partners, I think they were French or maybe British. He liked it, even in the Russian audience, it became the main theme of comedians and comedians such as 'KVN'. IMHO
