I assume that if you like an endless dialogue that does not pass the story and the vague effects of the camera, such as switching to the stage in the television show "Angel," you will enjoy the film. Me? All I wanted was a beautiful, narrow story, and it was not there. The pacing was practically backward, the points of the plot were buried under the sea of ​​unnecessary dialogue, and there was absolutely no fear, tension or anything. Is it a peasant? Is this Vendigo? No, it's a cameraman at speed. It's not terrible. It does not create a unique tension or atmosphere unless MTV is scared of you. Like those before me, I also noticed that the film creates a smile from the audience to the end. Terrible film.
