Despite the decent first season, this series has never come close to realizing its potential. Set as a prelude to the original Star Trek series, he was convicted almost from the start by executive producer, Rick Berman, who felt compelled to artificially limit and limit the definition of what the Star Trek series could have done (which she made) this futuristic performance is increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic point of view. The real shov-runner, Brannon Braga, did not help things for his uninspired and tired repetition of previous Trek episodes and the careless neglect of the franchise's internal mythology (it was painfully obvious that he was in it only for salary). I've never seen a series that consistently makes a bad service for the actors of talented actors (except for Jolene Blailock) for so long. It's as if this entire series originated in a balloon that exists outside of the modern television landscape where the audience (even the trekker audience) is more demanding and more sophisticated in their dramatic desires and desires. Unfortunately, it seems that Berman and Braga managed to convince more in Paramount that "Enterprise" suffers from a "fatigue from the franchise" and that its main audience has not left, but has been taken off. Produce a quality offer that meets the high ideals and standards of your predecessors and they (the audience) will come. Simply put, in the TeeVee universe where we are portrayed as "Battlestar: Galactica" and "Shield" powers-you would have to give Star Trek the audience that measures and dramatically competes. It's easy and simply.
