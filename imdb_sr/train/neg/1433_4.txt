The pictures are great and reflect the landscape of Canada. The story was, on the other hand, quite boring; For my eyes, this was a love story in the forest, just as Titanic was a love story on a ship. I did not feel the Gray Owl was a great ecologist. I usually love Lord Attenborough, but this was ... bad.
