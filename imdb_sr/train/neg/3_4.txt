If I had not read "Union Street" Pat Barker before I could see this movie, I would love to. Unfortunately, this is not the case. It's actually my kind of movie, it's well-made, and I do not want to say it differently, but as an adaptation, it's missing from every corner. The brutal novel about reality Living in a working district in the north of England caught my heart and refused to leave it for weeks after I finished. When I read about Union Street, tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy, and misery led me to tears. Perfect. The Roman who sometimes felt I could not read anymore, but I just could not drop a novel. Pressure yes, but ultimate flu. Film. Oh God. Hollywood took Barker's truth and reality, and poured a layer of sweet powdered sugar over it. A beautiful movie, inspiring music, great performances, a story of hope and romance ... yes. Adaptation of 'Union Street' ... no. Women Union Street and their stories are cluttered in the Fondin character, their stories are touched, but many have been discarded. I accept that some of Barker's stories are sensitive issues and are too horrible for mass viewing, and that a movie with about 7 leading protagonists is simply not practical, but the content is not my main problem. The essence and true impression of the novel are lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard and graphically described stench of poverty have been replaced by sunshine, beautiful houses and fluttering Villiam's result. > If you enjoyed the film because of its positivity and hope in the face of 'reality', I advise you to hesitate to read the book without first preparing for something more like the 'Schindler's List' ... but without a happy ending.
