I'll start with good things. The film lasted only 86 minutes, and the part was so bad that it was funny. Now for low points. My first warning sign came with a real "warning" on the film. When it started, the following "warning" is displayed: "The movie you see contains graphic and disturbing images, because, contrary to popular opinion, killing is not fun, nice or romantic." I had to save 86 minutes and then turn it off. The first words of the film were: "I am at the glue factory." It was a guy who talked on his phone, and he thought of the nursing home as a glue factory. I do not know why. So, the basis of the film is that some kid is obsessed with the Zodiac killer and begins to imitate him. The budget for this film was at least $ 50 and they certainly used the cheapest cameras they could find. The acting was worse than I read directly from the script. So it seems. The scenario was horrible, and the big "craft" was that this guy who wrote the biography of Zodiac Killer was actually Zodiac Killer. Of course, they tried to show it subtle, but they did it quite obviously in the first 10 minutes. Without any painful details of the plot, there were some terrible events in the film. They are trying to convince the Zodiac to compare it with "one army" because the soldiers are just murderers. Then they tried to try "Satanic worship" by showing some guys in black hoods at the meeting. A big "computer hacker" managed to get the address of this child when someone gave him the name and phone number. For some reason he had to come to the FBI to get an address. I'm not sure why he did not just search it in the phone book or use vhitepages.com. There were also random alusions on September 11 for no reason. I learned that no matter where they will shoot you, the blood will come out of your mouth for a few seconds. So if you like really bad acting, sub-pair scripts, bad camera work and obvious plot, you will love the Zodiac Killer!
