Sogo Ishii can be a skilled director under the right conditions, but Goyoe tells the story of a monk-warrior and his only rival, the descendant of the clan of Genji. Movie capture has the main features of low-budget production, including blur scenes and clumsy editing (those that can be found in insufficiently produced cases). Monk Benkei informs his spiritual master that his fate is in the defeat of the mysterious spirit that keeps Goyoe at night, but he does not understand that this decision will bring him into conflict with almost every element of society at the time - he could bring enlightenment. However, there is no lack of ambition in showing the conflict between the saints and the world. Artys flourishes in some photographs and assemblies to compensate for the loose film style. Disappointment.
