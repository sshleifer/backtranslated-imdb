: Spoilers: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed in the love that looks forward to joy. I've been waiting for a long time to see her, and I finally got a chance when she again broadcast Hallmark on Thursday evening. I love the first three "Love" films, but this was nothing like I thought it would be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there was a way to many nonsense, and the editing was very bad - to many scenes outside the context. I also think that the death of baby Kathi happened so quickly that Clarks' appearance in the film simply did not fit in. It seemed that none of the actors wanted to be there - they all were without emotions. It seemed that there was no interaction between Missie and Villie at all. I think the writers of the scripts should have more to go by the book. It seems that every film that has been filmed so far only slides further from the file Janette Oke. I mean in the film they never mentioned anything about the mine and two boys or Clark for that. And I think the Missie and Villies reactions to Kath's death could show and hear, and not just hear. is my least favorite. I hope that the next four films will be followed by several books, and if Clarks's character is in them, I hope he plays a bigger role and I hope that his part is not so mild. I also hope that there are more Scottie and Cookie, and perhaps Marty, but who knows what script writers will be on sale.
