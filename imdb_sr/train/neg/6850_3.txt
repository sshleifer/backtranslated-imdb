As a girl, Hinako moved from her little village to Tokyo, leaving behind her two best friends, Fumi and Saiori. She returns as a young woman, surprised by the discovery that Saiori died when she was a teenager. She reunites with Fumia and becomes horrified when she learns that Saiori rides mysteriously over the island of Shikoku. Oh, boy. I rent this because I love Asian horror and I think Chiaki Kurii is a wonderful actress. Unfortunately, if I had to describe Shikoku in one word, it would be "fruitful". This film is silly, boring, poorly recorded, unthinkable, and most of all, unprotected. Kuriiama has minimal time on the screen like Saiori Rise, and its character is little given to work.
