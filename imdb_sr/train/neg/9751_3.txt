The only reason why I do not give this film less than 3 stars is because it's not quite at the level of a movie like Manos: The Fate of Destiny. The biggest crime of this film is the fact that the head-meltingli is bored and terrible, unthinkable Britons. The premise of this film sounds potentially promising, the whole concept of teleportation, but the direction they went with was totally uninteresting. It was more a film about funding research and craftiness than designing lasers. The actors were wooden, with no emotions and abstinence. Like a love affair between two scientists - what was all just not intriguing. I have never been able to say what attraction is between them, because chemistry did not exist. I did not really understand why the main character who had a stupid face decided to kill anyone he met. At least now I know that I should always give someone a fair hearing before cutting off their scholarships for research, otherwise they go to the wild, killing ruthlessly stupid gestures of the hand.
