I bought this movie because it was Shah rukh khans Debut. And I also liked to see how he would do it. I have to say that he is great in his role. Divia Bharathi is great in this film. good. Alcot Nath was good at his role. Amrish and Mohnish did well their parts. Dalip was also good in his small role. The actors shine in the Mediocre movie. The direction is average. She's telling us about Ravi, a famous pop singer. She has many female fans. One of them is Kaajal.Ravi and Kaajal are in love and marrying. Ravi is killed by his relatives. He was a widow. Ravis relatives. They go to Bombai. She encounters Raja. She falls in love with him and gets married. Ravi returns. The story is predictable. The movie is predictable. The first half of the boredom. It also pulls a lot. But it is preserved by actors and musicians. The other half entertains. Music is attractive with some nice songs. the first half, but it seems unimaginable. Songs of the songs are boring except for "Sochenge Tumhe Piar" and a song for the rain. Costumes are obsolete. In any way, watch this only for actors and music Rating-4/10
