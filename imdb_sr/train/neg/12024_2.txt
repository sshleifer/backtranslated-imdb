A very boring nonsense I've seen for a long time. The action was full of irrelevance, and the act was the worst I've seen for a long time. To make it worse, camera angles were used for which I felt sick, and the random music was terrible and smothered the dialogue (maybe it was not a bad thing), and the San Francisco pictures looked like that they were stolen right from the promotional video of the city tourist community. Oh, and the compulsory sex scene was not even half well done. Better illumination next time, please.
