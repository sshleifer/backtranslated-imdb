When I was a little in the 50s and 60s, everything connected with Disney was by definition great. What happened? They are able to get all the actors and actresses they want, the best of their time. However, Disney manages to blur things in spite of their rich resources. Disney can afford the best writers, the best producers and directors, but nevertheless ... they screw things up! This movie is bullshit. The sad thing is that I doubt that Disney in their arrogance does not even know when the movie is good or bad. It's just because of the talent of actors who can even give it 3 out of 10.
