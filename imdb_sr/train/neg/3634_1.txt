The boring children's fantasy that gives Joan Plovright a charge of a star, but little to do. Sappi kids follow their dreams. Frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player (iuck) while the best friend Hazel works for the mayor --- she has 13! Fully pedestrian in every way, plus the addition of a lack of syrupy performance by girls and baseball boys. Surely less effort for Shovtime --- no restrictions?
