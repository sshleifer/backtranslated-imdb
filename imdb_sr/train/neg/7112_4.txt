Well, I must admit that this was one of my favorite kids, when I watched it on a home projector like a super-8 reel. Now there is not much to recommend this except the innate campus value of actors who are "frightened" by human skull replicas. Special effects are rather stupid, mostly consisting of skulls on wires and covered "spiritual" images. But there is something that can be said about kits. The great villa in which it is unfolding is pretty scary, especially because it is largely unenlightened (probably for budget reasons?). However, it certainly inspires more laughter than screaming. Try not to giggle when a woman (who works more than her screaming) goes to the greenhouse and confronts the spirit of her ex-wife.
