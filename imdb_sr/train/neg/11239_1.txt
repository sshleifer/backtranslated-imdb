Do not pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! Most people who make positive comments about this movie must receive fees. This is a horrible movie in every way. Imagine high school students with no money and sense of humor who make a slasher / comedy video. They would get this D. The college children would get F or ask them to leave school. Since this monstrosity has been made by "professionals," I think there should be a prison or at least a cinema probe. I enjoy watching bad movies like Plan 9 from the Universe, but this thing does not even belong to this category. Scenario, acting, sound and directing are so bad that it's practically invisible. If you enjoy watching bad movies that are fun with Ed Wood, Blakploitation or 1970's horror movies. After watching, you get the feeling that you have lost your watch and your life.
