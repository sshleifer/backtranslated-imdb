It's very funny to watch "Beretta's Island" as a kind of natural trampoline. This is in response to the type of b-movie Jess Franko. Bodybuilders return a blow (face to face!) Thrusters. Very very stupid blow! : incredibly poorly-directed shooting scenes look even better than fighting in their hands. Shooting the scene is meaningless. Keeping beautiful scenes incredibly stupid. Erotic scenes are very uncomfortable. t miss: Arnold Schwarzenegger's joke at the start of the movie and the list of relatives of Franco Columbus at the end. Special attraction: naked chests.Almoust forget - Franco can sing!
