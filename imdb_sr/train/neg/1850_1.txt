Director Ron Atkins is definitely crazy. This ultra-low budget film records several days in the life of a Harry Russ (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), who got a job from Rubberneck from his girlfriend. It begins to receive orders from the doll to take huge amounts of drugs, rape and killing, not always in that order. What begins as a movie for the exploitation of balls on the wall, remains so, but VEOMA becomes very fast. I rely more on a credible madness. It's hard to forget to see it once. It's like Tom Green ever made a horror movie. My Rating: F Eie Candi: Laurie Farvell becomes completely naked; Jasmin Putnam shows tits and shrubs ANTI-Around the candy: seeing John completely naked
