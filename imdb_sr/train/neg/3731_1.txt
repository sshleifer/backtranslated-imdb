I grew up in a "very Christian" household since birth. I was saved before I saw this movie and the rest of the series and I was forced to watch it in a youth group in my church. This film was very disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally I had nightmares about it for years. I used to stand awake in bed and listen to the sounds of my mom's steps upstairs. Had I not heard her footsteps, I would sneer up to make sure she was not excited. Every night I prayed so much that I was saved, because I was afraid that Jesus would forget me. This is definitely not something I will show to my children until they are much older, if at all. It took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me.
