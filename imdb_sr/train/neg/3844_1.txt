First of all, I just want to tell everyone who saw this movie, that the actor who played "Transvestite" is one of my friends, his name is Robert Dugdale, he is a great actor, although he does not say much about his filmography, he was in a few performances and musicals. He currently resides in Terrace B.C. From here I come, he comes to our house almost every Saturday. * He laughs. * Ok, now about the movie, I would not recommend it to anyone who did not see it, because that's not a movie worth watching, the main reason I found that a bad movie is never stays in place, constantly returns between time, so it's kind of hard to follow in some points, and secondly, his really boring * laughs * Although the acting is great, the movie can not be compared.
