This film was a rather weird viewing experience. The film is obviously based on the show. Now I am sure that everything in this movie works quite well in the show, but in the movie it just does not feel interesting enough to watch. The movie is too "scenic" and did not even make any effort to change some of the dialogue to make it more suitable for the movie. Instead, what is now being presented is almost literally a re-recording of a theater performance, with over-the-top characters and staged dialogue. Because of all this story really does not work and the film becomes almost completely distorted experience. It takes some time before you realize that this is a comedy watch. First you think it's a drama you watch, with strange characters in it, but as the movie goes, you will notice that the film is more tragicomedy, which relies more on the comedy genre than on the drama genre. Br /> Brushes and dialogue are really the things that make this film unusual and supremely, which sometimes really becomes inconsistent. Of course, the actors are great; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among other things, but they do not actually raise the film to the level of 'sufficiently watched'. The story feels completely disoriented. The basic story is nothing and only focuses mainly on the brother / sister characters played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what is it actually about? The film feels as meaningless and obsolete, which has very little to offer. As I said earlier; I'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on the scene, but as a movie it's really not appropriate and simply does not work. Editing is simply terrible and time-consuming and it becomes even funny bad in certain sequences. More than expected by Director J. Lee Thompson, who obviously did much better movies than this rather unsuccessful, stage-based performance screened project. It's worth your time. 4/10
