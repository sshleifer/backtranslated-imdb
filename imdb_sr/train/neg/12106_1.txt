Craven, cowardly movie. Director Boorman shows that Cahill broke into rich houses, but the male resident showed that he is not a faithful nanny, that's fine. A forensic scientist who explores Cahill has been inflated in his car, but he is a rat sourpuss, and he does not look like a nice man, and that's fine. Beits, the owner of Russborrough House, earned his money by exploiting 'dark' digging diamonds, so it's okay to rob the invaluable art of them and hide them in a bunker in the Vicklov Mountains. Garda killed his beads and was involved in his murder. Moral equivalence is sick, Boorman seeks a hit film, but there is no courage to counter the general gang crime, which has terrorized the neighborhood, and left the second wave of scum on Dublin. He even got in touch with his son General while he was doing it. Odd. Eat it for cowardice.
