Ok, let me tell you that I did not expect the film to be played by Jerry Springer as film gold. It looked like someone's bad home movies. He behaved badly, wrote and filled it to the top with the nudity of the most uncomfortable people I've ever seen. Jerry Farrelli Shov "to talk about multiple jobs between the mother, daughter, stepfather and daughter of a daughter.Therefore, the film turns into a unique experience: pornography of white waste. Has sex, intercourse, even sex between Jerry and his wife? This film encouraged me to wish to run out of the theater and get a second pruning, at least mercifully short, disgusting and humiliating: Afro-Americans and the working class of America should be insulted (Hovard Stern, however, should be pleased, he did not ruin his poker because stardom. He was smart, funny and entertaining).
