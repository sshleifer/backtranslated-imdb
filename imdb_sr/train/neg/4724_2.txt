This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it at the premiere at SKSSV and I was extremely disappointed. The director knew little about John Lennon, and even he said at the premiere. This is a drama, but people laughed how the film was raw. It's never a good sign. The only saving graces were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Livien's roommates / bandmates. They were fun while the rest of the movie was too serious. The crude fallout of Beatles' lyrics was absurd. However, the soundtrack was excellent and it was probably the best part of the movie. Unless you are one of those crazy, freaking fans of Dominica Monaghan, do not bother with this.
