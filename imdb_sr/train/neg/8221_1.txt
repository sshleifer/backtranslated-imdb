This "film" is trying to track a genre of low-budget, handheld cameras that have proven to be very effective and successful. This, it does not work and HOW. It's amazing how many so-called "rewards" this piece of garbage is put on the wrapper ... ... why are you wondering what the critics were doing when they actually sent this ... <br /> < > The words do not describe how absolutely horror this movie is. Seriously, THIS IS BAD. I watched it in 20 minutes, almost continually. From scattering garbage to horrible directing, grainy pictures to dull sound, and of course not forgetting the ABISMAL acting, it was an entirely and utterly pathetic piece of so-called movie creation. It seriously, there are no redeeming qualities - in general. Save your money and watch a decent movie with a terrible horoscope, there are many - Dead End, Blair Vitch, REC, to name just a few. CHANGE this stupidity at all costs. DO NOT spend money or time on this piece of garbage that turns out to be a real movie. Beware of all other comments! You are warned!
