I expected a lot from this movie. Something like Lee as Naustradamous as a character, but instead of everything I got was a waste of time and a boring movie. I can not even explain this film. He had a wooden acting, horrible script from a piece of the Bible like hurricane, tidal wave, and earthquake. But that was the end! I had to wait for the rest and hope that something will come about meaningfully, but it's not. This film is about a couple trying to find out about the changes that are taking place in the world, such as the places in China where the earthquake broke out and ended up in a monastery led by eight nuns and a priest. In the end, the monastery was the key to failure. The whole movie was missed and boring. One of Lees is the worst.
