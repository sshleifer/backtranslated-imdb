This is the first non-zombie subtype reviewed ive done but this movie is worth doing a preview for. Dinocroc is a good movie in general, but unfortunately there is still an obvious b-movie. Dinocroc itself looked great, but I thought that the film needed a little more weight in action and violence, because whenever a crocodile is shown or there is not much to do in the battle scene, unless the crocodile is shown and the crocodile kills or repeats itself in the repeated process. Jane Longeneker was hot as a plus and the acting was better than the average, and the most unlikely thing was that the crocodile looked fleshy instead of a cartoon cough * cursed comodo * cough. I enjoyed this movie enough to rejoice that it will be a sequel that is more than what I can say about some films in general. Overall 3/6 stars and a valuable hour.
