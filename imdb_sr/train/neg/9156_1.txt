Ben & Arthur could be 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, starred and produced this film. He himself should have given his idea to a good writer, director and leave the acting to someone who could act. This is a good example that one person controls the whole production. there was nobody to tell him: "It's bad, really bad". Jamie Brett Gable's acting was the only good thing, but he could have been much better with a good director, and better. actors to work. This film is so bad that I think that Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and watch it (twice). acting and direction were so bad, this film was turned into a comedy. You had to laugh in the wrong places. Another good thing ... this would be a great movie. After the first two minutes you will stop watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
