Drew Barrimore continues to see his alter-ego all over the city and it really starts to get ache in the ass. After Dee rented an apartment from a hacker writer, her encounters with the "Other Tree" became more common. A writer-man feels his responsibility is to extract the right thing from his stupor, doing all he can to help, including seduction, as soon as he gets some free time. It's not very interesting, and even less scary, but Drev is as sexy as usual, especially when it gives a rough, rough construction action with your finger ... yes, it's hot! The best scene could be where Drev sticks mom in real life, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife ... hmmm ... and what was your day?
