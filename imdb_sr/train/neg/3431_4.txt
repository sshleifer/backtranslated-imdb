This is not so funny and bloody as the DVD claims. I really like twisted and weird movies, but this is really boring! It's one hour of broken penis, flying Babi Born dolls and lots of rape! I think that the intention with this amateur mole was to make films "It's so bad," but that does not work. It's just bad! A few scenes are fine, but in general it's a mess. If you like this amateur spray (The only way better) I would recommend Andreas Schnass' Violent Shit 2 and 3.
