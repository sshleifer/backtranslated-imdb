I went to see this film based on the magazine Siskel and Ebert; I not only deceived myself, but I also took some friends, and I had to spend the rest of the day abundantly apologizing for making them sit through this pointless shit. After that, I never went to watch a movie based exclusively on the Siskel & Ebert Council.
