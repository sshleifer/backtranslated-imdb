This film was not programmed in Italian cinemas, I saw it at a manifestation called "fantafestival". I think it's terrible because some scenes look like video spots that are chaotic and dark, the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculing and there is no doubt film. Music is completely outside the story and I have no words to describe the visual effects. If you look at the first scene, the movie seems interesting, but a few minutes later it gets busy. The story is interesting, but development needs a complete overview.
