Here are some examples of Pat Robertsons who have dubiously claimed "relatively good results" in predictions. "Very Serious Terrorist Attacks" and "Mass Killings" in the United States in the "second half" of 2007, host Pat Robertson boasted of having "relatively good results" on earlier predictions. But a review of Robertson's New Year's Forecasts for 2006 undermines this claim. He predicted, for example, that: "President Bush will strengthen". FAILURE "The autumn elections will be unconvincing, but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the republicans in power." POWDER * "The war in Iraq will come to a successful conclusion. We will begin withdrawing the troupe before the end of this year." Further, as the Associated Press published on January 3, Robertson has a history of dubious predictions: In January 2004, Emiter predicted that President Bush would easily win the re-election. Bush won 51% of votes this fall, defeating Senator John Kerry of Democrat Massachusetts. ERROR In 2005, Robertson predicted that Bush would have a victory after winning the second term. He said that the proposals for the reform of social security will be approved FALSE, yet again! Hard to speak directly with God ... If God has a sense of humor watching Pattes make a fool of himself again and again ..
