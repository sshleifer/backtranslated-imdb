If you want to see the mystery, do not look at this. Although there are elements directly from the territory of Elmore Leonard, this is approaching the episode of "Dynasty", since the director focuses on "character development" - i.e. Long, boring conversations between stupid, non-featured characters. Some people can make fascinating movies without real action (see "Ekotica"), but not this one. Avoid it, especially if you like the actors involved in this.
