This is one of those movies that you think: would Hulk do the "Real American" Hogan do the same? Frankly, I do not think so and he would be right. I am Italian, I can not be proud of my country for many reasons, but I would not have fun for another team (the French, for example) simply because I'm in love with Juliette Binoche. In addition, the protagonist does not like the desire with a British girl at the end of the film, but with the farm, so why then paddle against Ialea. As for acting, all players behave very badly. And then, you know, I hated the atmosphere of the "Society of Dead Poets". In fact, it's the second movie I hate.
