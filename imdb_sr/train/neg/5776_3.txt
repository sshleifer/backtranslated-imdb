bad acting, bad southern accents, incomplete cinema, terrible script ... I was happy with this movie at the recent film festival and I was so discouraged after I saw it. It contains a talent for the quote / quote, but they do not deliver. Of course, the basis for this is the uneven and uninteresting story that has been said. Do not be tired
