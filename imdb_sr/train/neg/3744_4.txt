This film is an attempt to present the theory of Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel, explaining that Europeans dominated much of the world. The version I've seen about this documentary came on 2 disks that cover hours. I think the information could be presented in 20 minutes. There are utterly useless scenes: Professor Jared Diamond sees birds through binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond does not use it properly with bow and arrow, Professor Jared Diamond badly bakes his snout. Was this documentary supposed to make a hero from "Professor Jared Diamond?" This part of the documentary was so bad that it could have been a hoax. The worst thing was when Diamond fell and cried when he was visiting a malaria department in an African hospital. None of this helps me to understand his theory of Guns, Germs and Steel. BTV, Guns, Germs and Steel said about 100 times. "Can Europeans get their weapons, cords and steel from this difficult situation when they finally get down to work, his theory is just as interesting and extremely boring. Europeans have been occupied by residents of other countries because they had weapons and fine blades against stone and wood Do I really need a professor to convince me of this? It is interesting parts of his theory that explain how Europeans have come to the advantages that enable conquest, but the coverage of the paper is slim. In the end, I think the documentary was only trying to convince If I'm a racist, Jared Diamond will not convince me of his disorderly use of domestic aids. I think adults are not targeted the audience for this documentary. Children can enjoy this more than I. I read that the book from which this documentary is much better than a documentary.
