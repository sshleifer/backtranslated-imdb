I am terribly sorry, I know that Fa√übinder is still called one of the greatest directors in postwar Germany and that most of his films are considered "masterpieces", but when I see "Lili Marleen" today, I am wondering what everyone about this movie! The acting is simply horrible - Hanna Schigulla laughs like an idiot! - The changes between the Nazi glamor and the battlefield are ridiculous, the whole film seems to have been made within two days on the attic. Probably that was the case, and many people are taking this for "real art," but for me this movie is simply poor and cheap. Compare this with Viscontis "La Caduta degli Dei" and tell me again that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
