From time to time you hear radio djs that invite listeners to nominate movies that the listener can not stand or never looks all the way to the end. This is a movie I think ... days later. It has to do with Shakespeare's play. I'm not sure, but I think I took this film for about 20 minutes into it ... I think I realized that my nails on my feet would not cut myself, and they were begging me to cut me off. This film seemed boring and pretentious to me. Although this is the first film I gave such a low score (which I actually tried to watch), I would not want to get you from other movies by English director Peter Greenaway. I remember thinking that his "chef, thief, his wife and her lover" was really a great British film, although his content was sometimes exciting - a great movie, but I can understand why people would hesitate to see him. Another good Greenavai movie was "Zed and Two Zero". He again had some content that pushed the boundaries of good taste, but he was still intriguing. Another film that I usually think is too late for such topics about the shows is "Brazil". I've never been able to watch it all the way - or fall asleep! Unless you have a taste for movies that are important in themselves and that are extremely stylized, strenuous and difficult to track, then manage without a book of scarves.
