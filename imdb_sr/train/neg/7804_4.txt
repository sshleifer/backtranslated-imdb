THE TEMP (1993) did not do much theatrical work, but here are the direct videos you did not want! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is the new wife of Millennium Investments, a high-brokering firm that starts receiving useful suggestions from Secretary Deidra (Sheila Kellei). Deidre turns out to be an ambitious daddy of a girl who will not stand up to anything to move on a corporate ladder, including killing a top broker who can not stand and kill anyone who falls to her side. She digs out the skeletons in Ellen's wardrobe, tries to cause problems with her husband (Barri Bostvick), kills while she seems to be responsible, kidnaps her daughter and tries to force her to mislead the company. Harris and Kellei deliver competent performances, supporting actors are fine and it's pretty complicated, but that does not compensate for the script that travels along the path and offers a few surprises.
