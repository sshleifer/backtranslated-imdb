This was not pleasant to watch. Frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets a normal (boring!) Job just to get his worker to go to a film school, but his stepfather decides to make a document about a humiliating man instead. A documentary filmmaker should show the camera and simply record, not manipulate and comment on the snid subtitles. The sharpness and outrage of the director towards the eye is obvious. And now. It seems that the goal is to make Frank stupid and pathetic, instead of being the most polite of the 3 people who have appeared. It really is. It left me with intense repulsion towards the director of the film.
