Everything about this movie is pork wash. Sadly acting, horrible dialogue, ugly girls. this movie sank into oblivion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director was certainly a weekend. Robert C. he was completely lost and had no idea what was going on. Kids at college are the worst. There is no acting talent in general, very stupid thinking, and only the right dumbbell. Special effects are for birds. The so-called security forces around this park belong to toy land: with stupid pistols, useless walkie-talkie; and a computer system that ranks with rolls of toilet paper. if the park is under construction and nothing is done; Why try to call potential customers until everything ends. writers should be the first victims of disorder along with producers and crew. The entire film belongs to the image of a septic tank on another planet for the purpose of watching. What a gem. Convicts should be watching this, in order to commit suicide.
