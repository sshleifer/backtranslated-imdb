This is a movie that wants to be good, but shit. First, what the hell are they trying to do with the school? I do not think children understand the seriousness of the situation. The girl tells the girlfriend that he is under his responsibility when he asks why he wants to get back for them, but immediately afterwards he gives the gun on the refrigerator and wants him alone to fix the phone line. Where is the responsibility there? I understand that poor actors have to pay for their food, but why they simply do not give them the money they need to make such a stupid movie or give money for charity. Oh Ia and none of them knows how to aim. A stupid guy is shooting at the cafeteria nowhere crazy. Everyone wants to look professional, but they're all bullshit. One more thing I do not believe is that there are no emergency exits in the school where children are trying on a few doors, but they are all locked. What happens if a fire arises, and the guardian of the dumas is dead? It is illegal that you do not have an emergency exit in school. In any case, there is more to say, but that would be too long. I spent some time in my life watching shit.
