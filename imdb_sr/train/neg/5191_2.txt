Ah, boring t.v. performances and pilots that took place in the 70s to equally boring, i.e. movies! Some examples would be: riding with death (the most hysterical poor party), stranded in the universe (confusing and uninteresting), San Francisco International (awfully bored and incredibly confusing), and this sharp Kuinn Martin glamor. Shot in Hawaii (though you would not know it from external shots), this is an apparently failed pilot for a lame spy shoah. The real problem is that you do not like most characters, including the gray protagonist Diamond Head, who seemed to be asleep for the whole movie; his boss, Aunt Mary, who had very strange deliveries of his lines and white hair, as well as darker color; Diamnd Head's girlfriend / fellow agent (hell, I can not even remember her name) a skinny, wooden woman with a straightforward way of speaking that is simply not sexy or interesting; and the vocal assistant Zulu (again, I do not remember the name of his character) who was not bad at small doses. The most interesting person in the whole production was Ian McShane, who was a bad man, but he still proved his acting heads. Apart from make-up jobs, this so-called "chameleon" used to mask oneself was just ridiculous. I have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from a lab that led him to dress like a South American dictator, the US general. I do not even care. The action was not interesting enough to attract your attention in ten minutes, let alone an hour and a half. Just call this - Hawaii Five No!
