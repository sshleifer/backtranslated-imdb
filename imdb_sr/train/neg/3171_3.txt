Was this the best movie I ever saw? Was it the worst? As the mother of four children, it's nice to watch something that was light and fun. It was great, but it was sweet. I think there was definitely room for improvement, but he tried. level of abuse by another reviewer. Apparently they do not care about Eva Longoria. I think she was better at this than in Sentinel. I think movies are a matter of opinion. Actors play a big role in whether it's a hit or a flop. Maybe the actors did not succeed. Maybe there were too many things. I just wanted to talk about an average movie, not a horrible movie. It can only be a piece of chicken. Like The Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband is still talking about it. :)
