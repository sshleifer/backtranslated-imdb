Returning to the cabin next to the lake, does not suit the original in any way. With only one main character (Stanley) who returns to the sequence, the film is not worth 2 hours of your time. I am a big fan of the first movie, the story and the acting were really good, but this is a movie I will never watch again. This is essentially the same as the sequences of Urban Legends and Blair Vitch were similar, but with a much worse game. Personally, I've seen a better acting in soap operas, so it's a shame to just have to laugh. Yes, in no way, I do not recommend this film to anyone, watching it just take away the first one.
