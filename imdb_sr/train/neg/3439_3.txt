***** Probably smaller spoilers ****** I can not say that I liked it, but I can not say that I was ... it was very weird. There are bad things in it, such as, for example, a shark that came from nowhere to the worst CGI you can imagine, if I were a director, I would certainly cut off that part, gave me the need to stop watching the rest of the movie. For some people, this will be boring because he misses actions, sometimes he feels homely ... Take, for example, the scene with which one of his friends died, and the next what they do is what? nop, not crying ... their testimonials to each other .. * Sigh * (right after crying for lost ones) Another stupid thing was when they talked in a boat that they had as " hundreds of candles in the table in front of them ... the boat is surrounded by some burial curtains (old cloths covering windows) and sofas / sofas ... I thought it was stupid, using candles, but not thinking about the environment, except that it's in the sea ... Good, some scary scenes that are beautifully made I loved some. Sometimes a horror works better when it's hidden when is behind something rather than being shown, so this film does it well, maybe because I do not know his little budget, but it works fine for me! You'll feel tense if you forget some holes like those I mentioned above. <br /> < > Do not expect much, but if you like some sort of movie, watch this, be patient, try to enjoy .. lol (sorry for my poor English) =) <br /> Cheers
