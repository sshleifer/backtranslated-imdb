Spokesmen in this magazine are offered as a public service, because the only way to enjoy this costume is to know that our protagonist, Mrs. Barbara Skelton, was eventually raped and killed. And not too early. I shot myself on the screen myself, but I was afraid I would hit James Mason. The original 1943 novel was called "Life and Death of the Evil Lady Skeleton" (I assume that people are not "about how they cried then)," wrote a woman, an English Navy fraternity that was troublesome either cynical or both. Her heroine is devastatingly beautiful, and the author seems to think that if you have beauty, nothing else matters. But other things are important, like the fact that Miss Barbara is the immediate and only reaction when someone approaches her is murder. She killed three men in five attempts. Serial femme fatale has a case of a disoriental personality disorder that should have been brought to Bedlam or Nevgate. Lockwood plays as a narcissistic vamp, carrying so many makeup that I considered it Joan Rivers from the restoration time (or Joan Rivers, restoration time, Joan Rivers, ha!). However, Ladi B. is irresistible to all three main male characters - Michael Rennie, James Mason and Griffith Jones, who all work well, as well as Patricia Roc. Of course, all three admirers understand in brief what the Barbara psychotic bitch is, but they plot in their orbit until one of them finally dawned - by chance, in what should have been either irony or just desserts. Considering the dramatic scene of death with a boom that pulls the camera through the windows and towards the sky, I assume that we care about it to care for her death. But her is the first body we care about.
