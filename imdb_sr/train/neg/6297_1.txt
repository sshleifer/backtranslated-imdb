I am a great fan of Martin Amis, whose book is based on this film. Unfortunately, the director could not translate the book onto the screen. The Roman was thoroughly positioned modern and highly artificial in its wildly exaggerated characters and the disintegration of the traditional lineage and character development. It is a hilarious study of human greed, surplus and emptiness of one of the most prominent contemporary British writers. The director of the film completely missed the meaning of the novel. In his hands, the film screams at a staggered speed, leaving all the familiar tricks and the possible "weird" angle of the camera. It's like Ken Russel acid, and he suffers from the fact that the senior director has lowered himself to a hundred. Even a (short) glance at the penis of the great actor Cristian Solimen was not enough to save this nasty film for me. Abismal!
