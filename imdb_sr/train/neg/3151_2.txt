"That must have been you" is another sign that Hollivood is running out of an idea. This picture is about Charlie Hudson, a former policeman who became an author. When Charlie's fianc√© came out of the city, he stuck with all the planning of the wedding. He spent a week at a distinguished hotel and met Anne Penn as a schoolgirl who accidentally marries. The two quickly became friends and began to plan separate weddings together. This is when it gets boring until now, Charlie falls in love with Anne and she has to choose between safe life or Charlie. This film discovers any romantic comedy ever made and only awaits the film to finish so you can do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge give a really central performance that makes this movie even more tricky to watch.
