It seemed to be a good movie, I thought it would be a good movie, and during the film I hoped it would be meaningful use of my time, and yes, I must admit that the acting talent of Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Navy is really praiseworthy, but despite the best efforts, this movie fails to convey a meaningful message, which seems to have been what Somnath Sen is trying to do. The final point is short and the ending seemed somewhat unsatisfactory after everything that happened; somewhat like real life in that regard, but movies unlike real life end in about 2 hours, and the end should leave the audience happy if it was really the intention of the director. In that sense, I miss it and that's what disappoints me most. Another aspect that worried me was the national stereo typing of American characters - they all look like they were carved out of the same block. . It seems to me that the majority of American characters in Indian English films are based on how Indians themselves perceive the Americans as similar, and it is clear that no effort has been made to give any American in the film a sense of depth or complexity. /> <br /> These two aspects together make a disappointing story.
