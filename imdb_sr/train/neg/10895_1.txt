I've seen a lot of bad movies. I can enjoy most of the time in a horrible horror movie for what it is. But this really means it's bad in the new extremes. It is a blurry, complication for what never goes anywhere and takes its time. There are no shocks, no horror, no tension, only boys rubbing an hour and a half, and then quickly end. Absolutely on a furious horror, avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
