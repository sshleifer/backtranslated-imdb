The scenario for this TV soap is so bad that even A. Hopkins at some point had to play as a student of a Belgrade drama student in order to bring some life in his script-a dead figure. I do not know if it was the director's purpose, but Hopkins Ciano is nothing more than crying, fear and lack of self-esteem. True Ciano may have been all that, but why then do you film a movie about him? Mussolini was a little more convincing, and his long journey was as if it were closer to the truth. Edda Mussolini was meaningless (not Saranda's, but impotent), while she had to be the central figure of this alleged family drama. Watch him only if you enjoy the Venetian soap opera.
