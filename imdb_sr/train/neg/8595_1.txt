Luci Alekis Liu and Cillian Murphi are great actors, who can certainly raise any action challenge they are imposing. Unfortunately, "Watching Detective (2007)" offers only one actor and audience: not to fall asleep during a boring, highly predictable and unimaginable story. 'Detective Watch (2007)' is trying hard to be funny, but the comedy is forced, extremely poorly focused and embarrassed on the verge of total ridicule. After a third of the film, nothing else that can capture even the most satisfied audience, such as friends and relatives of the director, is even hinted, not to mention. I'm pretty sure that everyone who loved him was lying or had to act as Neil's ex-girlfriend did it when she showed her an old black-and-white film about which she did not care. 'Watching the detective (2007)' is not even close to category B, it is somewhere between K & R, like -What? and -Forest questions! The director knows what he's doing! Well, if his goal was to get the viewer to annoy him, he did a very good job! 'Detective Watch (2007)' was a complete waste of time for Luke Alekis Liu and Cillian Murphy. , bur PLEASE do not let it be a waste of time! Rating: 0 out of 100.
