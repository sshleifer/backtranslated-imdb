If you enjoy movies such as American Pie, Road Trip and Van Wilder; Avoid this movie bounce at all costs. It is an inconceivable, evil, soulless waste of resources that should never be discussed aloud; Much less is actually recorded and sold to consumers who do not doubt. The easiest movie I've seen in the past 18 months; um-numbingli bad for the whole 86 minutes is runtime. If it was a lot longer, I would not be able to write this review without cursing. Consider yourself warned!
