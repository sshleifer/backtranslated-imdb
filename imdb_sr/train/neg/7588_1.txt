Warning to potential viewers: if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story "The Most Dangerous Game", look elsewhere. "Seven women for Satan" Only superficially deals with the original work using the name of Zaroff and said that people are a killer of character. to be spoilers. Or not. Boris Zaroff plays writer / director Michel Lemoine. While his ancestor hunted men because they were the only prey that was really challenging, Boris's victims are usually in a position to not defend themselves. The film moves from scene to scene with almost complete lack of clarity. It seems that the director completely ignored the pacing and left the viewer with a miserably boring film. Several individual scenes are mildly interesting (such as a torture sequence), but as a unit, the movie fails to entertain. The spectators who are more interested in the range of attractive and semi-attractive actresses in various stages of undressing, could watch the film. Most will probably find that their time is better spent watching Mentos advertisements. In addition to the side, DVD add-ons included much information on the history of the movie. Apparently, he was banned for several years in his native France, which has pretty much destroyed every chance of a widespread distribution.
