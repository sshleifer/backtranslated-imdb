I just returned from free screenings and I'm very glad I did not pay to see this very sub-movie. The theater was full and the audience was a mixture of children and adults. It looked like it was only about children who were laughing at all the jokes and jokes (a good god liked to hit these poor mice in the groin). The film is quite small, unintelligent, predictable and mostly boring. It seems that the characters were thrown together to fill an empty space, and the relationships between them seemed very forced without any charm. Visual, the film is average without anything that stands out. They have done a decent job of mimicking the clay-like appearance of Vallace and Gromit, but in addition, these are easy to forget images. Although I was annoying during the whole movie, I was smiling a few times. This is not an absolute failure, but certainly I would not want to look at it again. If you are a parent with children (and do not care what your children see as meaningless jokes) then you can freely drive them to see, but not everyone else should spend their money.
