If you saw Sholai from 1975, do not watch this movie. If you have not seen Sholai in 1975, go watch it. But do not watch this movie. This film has all the ingredients that could be wrong in making the remake of Sholaia. Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the role of a psycho-negative at best (Probably only 40 minutes of the reels that should not be burned). If you remove the rest of the movie and just watch how amitabh plays with his character, it would still be worth watching. But like Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal does not justify his talent. Ajai Devgan (Heero) is the ultimate earthly and only reason I think they have thrown Prashant Raj into the role of Raja because he has a striking similarity with Amitabh from his young days. Sushmita Sen is well wearing, with grace and make-up. But the award for "THE BIGGEST performance and any role to date" has to go to Nishi Kothari. She manages to degrade her acting to levels that even high school drama overshadow her performance. If you have a mortal enemy, take him to this movie. :)
