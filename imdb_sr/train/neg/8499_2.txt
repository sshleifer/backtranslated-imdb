It's a thing that just delights the film heads. After all, Feierstein's Flek Crush will know that real men do not watch anything from Truffaut. Perhaps it was interesting that Truffaut said something - here. The motive of the camera as a voyeur was nothing new. Did we all forget De Sicin's "bicycle thief"? Or something from Hitchcock? So all we get is an expanded metaphor of a juvenile like Truffaut, who is spending his free time "choking eyes" in films that destroy classroom discipline, accusing plagiarism (a lot of petty thefts), and ultimately he avoids social restrictions to make his "film". Sorry ... I was there, done it too many times to make this important.
