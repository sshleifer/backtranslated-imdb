Frank Tashlin 'The Home Front' is one of the lifeless Private Snafu Panties, a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the army. Instead of taking Snape some action that would lead to a disaster, 'Home Front' instead focuses on its loved ones at home and how much they have to offer war effort. Snafu realizes he was wrong when he thought it was easy. This is a concept with few opportunities for good jokes, and instead Tashlin plays a more risky card, and extended jokes involving strippers and scarcely dressed dancers instead of a very effective comic relief. The result is a short-term good meaning that today has little significance or fun value, except as a historical artifact.
