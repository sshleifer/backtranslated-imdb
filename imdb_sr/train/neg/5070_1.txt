Television affects society ... just look at the popularity of Cappucino's stores after this debut debut. In addition, real people who look as good as these people do not have any problems. Besides, does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in the beautiful Manhattan attic considering that they are working for a living? NBC just loves to offend the intelligence of the observer, even if they are just around Gump's level. I know a person who earns $ 100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a small one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan that costs $ 2,200 a month in rent. I'd like to see a show called "Phriends," where there are six ugly locks in dead places, living in the neighboring area where the sirens are continually wrapped and someone robbed every week ... and then the landlord raises rent. I'll watch it now.
