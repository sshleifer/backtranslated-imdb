Producers of this film offer paying funeral expenses to all who die of fear while watching this movie. They should have offered intense psychotherapy to all who really enjoyed this stink. The young couple entered the house, in which a woman who looked like a woman from a couple lived. Extremely boring and very predictable. In the end, I ended up not worrying about anyone in this movie. Avoid this at any cost.
