All right, guys, we know why we're watching a movie like "Invisible Mania" (just look at the cover, man!). T and A everywhere (with much more T than A). But ... should not there be a story? "Come on," I hear you say - "These are just girls who are naked! Who needs a story?"! "Well, if this is called" NAKED Maniacs "I would not have a problem. But since these guys write from "The Invisible Man," they must have little stories about it, you know, that your mind would be busy. A crazy doctor creates a serum of invisibility and, when he breaks apart, uses it to spy a naked woman and eventually kills a lot of teenagers. And when you see teenagers who look rude and he goes after him, you will be grateful. One star, for T and A, but has a little too much blood for your skin lovers, so continue with caution. TIDBIT - yes, it's that Savannah.
