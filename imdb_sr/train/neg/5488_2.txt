Why is, in fact, Colin Firth in this pointless film? Was he really so confiscated for money? The film is not clear about what it wants to be, sadness ?, exotic places?, ghosts? Vehicle for Mr. Darcy? It's a confused, muddy mess. It seems that there is some kind of idea that Italy must be good, by itself, and that the Italian has something to offer as a language - but eventually the girls just want to return to Iankland. On the beach, in churches, there are senseless episodes on traffic routes - but what it is about, or why anyone would care is simply not clear. /> In the film was a woman. It was not clear what the business was like here, but she seemed to be there only to make the girl silly, inappropriate, and Maudlin's comments. Should it be about paedophillia? Pretty terrible mess, all in all. I gave 2, not 1 because there is no charm of an extremely horrible movie.
