While Villiam Shater can always make me laugh at anything he appears (and I especially like him as Denny Crane in Boston Legal), well, this show is all about glitz and dancers and screaming and jumping up and down. > It has no intelligence of Millionaire, none of its Deal or No Deal. This show is all about dancing and stupid things to fill in time. > Of course, I was watching him just to check it out. I've been watching him for more than 45 minutes, then I had to turn it off. The best part was the Villiam Shatner dance on stage. He's a sucker! unfortunately, this show will NOT be done. It is a task
