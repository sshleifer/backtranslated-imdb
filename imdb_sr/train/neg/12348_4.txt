This movie is very similar to "Flashdance," you know that dance with Jennifer Beals. That movie is probably the most boring film I've ever seen because it's not bad enough to be ridiculous. "G.I. Jane" is much better than that movie, but that does not say much. Here, Demi Moore is sweating a lot and there is tremendous music and we see her fight and everything, but this is certainly not very interesting. I really think the idea behind the movie is somehow interesting, but the script is too cliche and Ridley Scott can not do anything about it. Well, as I said ... It's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
