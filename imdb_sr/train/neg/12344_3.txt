The exhausted comedy, a sketch-like sketch, which was initially a vehicle for the introduction of former radio star Jack Pearl, is now best remembered as an introduction to America at The Three Stooges. Actually, Larry, Curley and Moe are charged alongside Ted Healy's comedy Ted Healy and his Three Stooges. Although the film is supported by Jimmy Durante (who is completely lost on smoke material) and ZaSu Pitts, the only audience for the film these days are Stooges addicts, and even they will not find much to climb. Incredibly loud and astounding, shows how much Hollivood had to go to reach a certain level of sophistication. * 1/2 of ****
