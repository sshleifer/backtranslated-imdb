I am a big fan of Italian films from the 1970s, and I would not hesitate to list beautiful Barbar Bouchet among my favorite actresses of all time, so I went to this film with some hopes. However, it soon becomes clear that this is mostly a meaningless movie that will not go anywhere. Obviously nobody would go into this, expecting much more, but the fact that this is meaningless is getting all the more disadvantageous when you consider it to be quite boring and not one of the characters is not interesting. As the title says, the film focuses on the 'tramp'; in this case, the one who steals, women and smugglers. This is basically all the complications this film has. The film has the right style of the 'seventies' and the idea that all this is very carelessly getting good. Sometimes it seems that the directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson tried to make a point, although whatever it is, it does not work well. Seeing Barbar Bouchet on the screen is always a pleasure, and that's the case here; She is definitely the best thing about the movie and the sequence in which she hangs out of the car naked is the best part of the movie. All in all, Rogue will probably have some attraction for people who like the style of the seventies, but unfortunately there is not much to offer.
