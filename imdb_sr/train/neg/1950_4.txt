I grew up with Scooby (somehow re-runs where you are) I hate scrappies, I love Daphne, and I feel it is not complete with the whole band. But this is sad, Scooby Ltd. is a comedy for solving the mystery - not a bad total spy jap anime. I love "what's new", they had to give Daphne a risk prone: (and try to lose sex * drugs of the jokes of many generations, but this "get a clue" is straight shit and should not even have tried to do some crazy punk thing with a theme song, and now I will watch my DVD from Scooby doo, where you are to wash the dirt of this new series of my eyes
