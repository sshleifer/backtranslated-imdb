This film was pure pain. Sitting in the cinema in a few minutes, I wondered when the film would start. All settings were in place; a typical love story, characters must overcome their short gifts, the bad guy has to appear, but none of this has been initiated. When these things happened, I was already bored, and the devices were completely ineffective. In scenes that demanded tremendous tension and accumulation, it was necessary to cut the necessary frames. Children's things do not have to be this way. Children's movies can be so interesting and interesting as adults. The excuse, "hey, it's for kids," is a bull. I'll take the "Sword in the Stone" every day. This was terrible. I have the feeling that Disnei will shut everything out these days. And as far as children are concerned, the 10-year-old I've seen with this will agree ... pure garbage.
