If you were to judge only on the basis of the film, the commission that gave the theater musical "A Chorus Line" to the Pulitzer Prize and the Broadway audience that led the war horse for 15 years, were on heavy narcotics, because one feeling this film certainly is NOT. What somebody had to think that Richard Attenborough was most suitable for this material, totally mumbles me, but he's a real musical almost entirely about the movement just sitting on the screen of a bunch of clay. Not satisfied with the original rating as it was originally written, someone decided that what the movie really needed was a new song that would give the movie a zip. So the nominees for the Oscar (!) "Surprise, surprise" are attacking us. Well, surprise, surprise, the song smells like a movie. Rating: D
