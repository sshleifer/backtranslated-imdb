I've seen some shitty movies in my life, but this must be among the worst. Definitely the bottom 100 of the materials (imo, that is). We follow two pairs, Dodd (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and Kirkendalls (Patrick Svaize as Roi and Charlize Theron). Obviously, Lonnie is not too happy with her sex life, and she cheats on her Candi woman, who desperately tries to have a baby. Roi, meanwhile, is not too sure if his cum is ok, so he is examined by a doctor. Now I read the last part of the DVD, but my girlfriend is not, and after 20 minutes she flew out: 'Oh yes, she will end up pregnant, but her husband can not have a baby.' Spot it, because this film is so predictable. As bored. And boring. Meaningless. Offensive. Terrible. Example how this film smells. Two couples set off on their big car to Nevada when they were stopped by two policemen because they did not stop at a stop sign. The guys get to know each other and in the end bribe two police officers with beer. Not only is this scene meaningless and not important (or even relevant) for the movie, it takes about 5 minutes! It's just a conversation and a conversation, without any departure. I still have to revert to thinking about the ending. Apparently, Roi has no problem down there and he is the father of a child. How many times does this happen in movies ... try something new! The wicked woman finally forgives his wife and best friend for having an affair, and all live happily ever after. Iuck. The best movie scene is in the end, with a couple of Grand Canion videos. Why can not they keep the camera for 90 minutes? We expect more of this actor (although Thornton is really trying), but you can not really blame them. The writers, shame for you! 1/10.
