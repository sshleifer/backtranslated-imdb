Where to begin. The film started pretty well, but after 30 minutes, I caught watching the watch. The horror at the beginning of the film was good, but then the story began to be heard. It just got stupid and stupid as time passes. Actors gave average performance in this movie. Vinnie Jones was constantly bored in the film. As the film dragged on, and my word for it, rolling, was becoming more and more tense. *** *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** When I thought that the film could not get worse, towards the final loads, if the skeletal-looking monsters appeared, just to eat dead people which did not make any sense at all. It turned out to be some kind of cult of meat nutrition, and good guys die at the end. The place actually made me laugh at how badly it was. When the lead role is played by Vinnie Jones, he becomes a new killer. In the end, this film made Creep as the best horror movie ever shot. I gave her 1 star because the female lead was pretty good, but even she could not save the train wreck from the movie !!
