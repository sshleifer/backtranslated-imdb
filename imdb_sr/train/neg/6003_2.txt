Sundovn - with the poorest, dirtiest vampires ever seen, along with one of the most appropriate, pretentious scores ever written - and Shane's vampire, which every move and spoken word is so ridiculous that I laughed halfway and turned my eyes over the rest. It seems that vampires do not have any special power - except for the power (sometimes), that they can turn the lamp off with their minds (for a while) and ... That's it, really. Have you ever imagined that Dracula was worried about the fight because he was left without bullets? Me neither. Practically any other movie-Dracula would eat this for breakfast, paint his followers and use their bones as toothpicks. The main plot of the movie is that a human family of four people has been caught. in the fight of vampire gangs - Dracula's against some old geysers. It could have been a good old party, but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by a person who took this film seriously, and eventually destroys the rest of the film that has not already destroyed clay blind mice, central actors. and a funny scenario. In the end, it's too stupid to make it funny. Of course, there are some fun moments, but few are far away.
