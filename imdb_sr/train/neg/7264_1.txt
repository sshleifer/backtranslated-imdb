Just another movie that uses a free frontal male nudity; The horrible acting, plus, the scenes of love are the most non-sexy I've ever seen (and it's not about not linking the idea of ​​two young men making love, because I'm gay). Again, as in the Mil nubes de paz, Julian Hernandez directed an incredibly pretentious film with a story that argues sufficiently for a short film of about five minutes, but manages to record a 2-hour film with him ... And this time , there is not even a question of racism and commodification in the Mexican gay community to be able to talk about it! God merciful, have mercy on us!
