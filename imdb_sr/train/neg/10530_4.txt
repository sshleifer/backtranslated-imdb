The disappointing music version of "Anne and King Siam" by Margaret Landon, which was shot in 1946 by Irena Dunne and Rek Harrison, Deborah Kerr acted as a widow and a mother traveling from England to Siam in 1862 to accept a job as a tutor of King's Many Children - and maybe teaching the Royal one thing or two in this process! The stage image begins well, but quickly loses energy and focus. Iul Brinner, reassessing his triumph as king, is the commanding presence, but is used - by a fictitious story - as a crafty. Kerr keeps her cool dignity and better prices, despite having to comply with Marni Nikon's vocals. Perhaps he had already played this role until his death, Brinner seems to have nothing to do with the translation of the screen except for the bombastic. The other half, when Anna and Moppets made the musical version of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," is pretty funny, and Rodgers and Hammerstein songs are mostly bulky. Brinner won Oscars for the best actor, but handsome Kerr is the one who holds this ball over water. Long-lasting, heavy and 'old-fashioned' in the worst sense. ** from the ****
