The writers and producers of this small excursion collapsed new depths of distortion. Whether the writer's blockade was so bad or the ideas were so dried out that they were forced to include a disgusting scene in which a young woman pulls out in the back seat of the van and then immediately throws a feces into the car behind, at least this sums up what this movie is worth) . We were already treated with another woman who was wetting one of her friends, as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting; once it would be enough ... we got a message! This is taking toilet care humor to another level! If the script and the acting were better then I could easily forget that I watched a movie shot entirely on a low budget video. This was a fairly original story, with a smart (only) direction where we could only take the view from the inside of the van; so it feels more realistic. We could never see it at any other location, such as a store or field where several women disappeared, and this could have led to the necessary tension. The script was terrible. Lines such as: 'I do not feel very well ... I want to go home' after one of the girls is persecuted by a psychopath; being subjected to rape by a screwdriver and shooting at him, seems to be a little submerged. Playing was devil (except for maniac). Did all the main actors in this action learn by taking a correspondence course during a long postal strike! The sound was so bad that I had to watch the whole movie with subtitles. The director seemed to have an easy job in it. It seems that the only direction he had to give was "Scream girls". <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
