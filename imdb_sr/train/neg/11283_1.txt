I felt that rancid aluminum was a complete loss of two hours, the line of complication was thin and confusing, the prestigious line of the players had a terrible dialogue and extremely suspicious accents. Work on the camera was somewhat experimental in some places and although it was possible to see what the director tried to convey, it was even more difficult to watch. One of the most unfortunate aspects of rancid aluminum is the excessive use of narration during the film almost as if the entire action was dictated to the audience. The best performances had nothing to do with acting. In fact, probably the most compelling performance came from Dani Behr of all people, although he certainly plays a stereotyped office. DO NOT under any circumstances watch this movie unless you need a reason to make up for a lost dream, there are certainly better ways to spend your hard-earned money.
