Okay, just reading the title you think would be a good movie. Well, at least I am. It started well, but it got so boring after the first half an hour. * Spoiler * The story of a mother who is so desperate that her daughter becomes a cheerleader who will go to everything to get what she wants. The only problem is that her daughter's girlfriend is on her way. She always wins competitions, and therefore pushes her mother to her "elimination". After talking to the "killer", the mother decides that the girl needs to be picked up a little. So actions are taken, but it is eventually caught. The actors are horrible and the movie is too long to pull, and nothing is happening. Do not waste your time watching this. <br /> <br />
