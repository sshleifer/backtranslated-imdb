this film was a great disappointment. the level of ruthless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. some scenes were really unnecessarily ugly and evil. the main characters were impossible to identify or even sympathize with. the character of the protagonist was slim as they came. the atmosphere of the patient / glass garden allowed her to look over her head. Little or nothing could be learned about the Spanish civil war from this film. Fortunately, I was in Spanish and realized that this is not real! In addition, the use of the same sex as an unpleasant "horror" was also very offensive and poorly processed, while the DVD was packed and advertised to attract gay viewers. actors looked uneasy in their roles as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess. I guess if you like to watch children and pets that are brutally killed, this movie would especially like you.
