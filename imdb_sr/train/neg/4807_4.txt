Ambushed is not an ordinary action. It's a lot of bad to be plain. One man walks toward the other, with a machine gun. The other man fired a circle and shot down a man with greater firepower without any stick of the lead of lead that fell on him. Guess who's a good guy. Ghost. Such is "Ambushed" through and through. It's not a good action movie, and not a good drama, and not a good movie, "Ambushed" fails at all levels with its British veterans who mechanically go through the moves as if they know they are making a loser. Not recommended to anyone. <br /> <br />
