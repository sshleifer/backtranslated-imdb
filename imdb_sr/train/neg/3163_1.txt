This is the first post I comment on IMDb, do you realize, this movie made me come and warn all the good souls that will stop experimenting with the movies. Like most of them gave their comments I thought I was watching this movie because it seemed to have some decent actors (although I read the worst criticism against this movie) I thought I was experimenting with it assuming it was some comedy. , comedy ... then everything started pathetic ... you can believe in yourself, you felt like you're going and pounding your head every time a pathetic woman called the heroine of the movie becomes helpless. ..Huh ~~ So how many people can digest the sick ALL SPECIAL RELIGION, a kind of spirit that tries to do everything that can irritate you and stop you from doing what you do. The next worst thing movie is, "ZOMBIE" Hero, that while losing the fianc√© he wanders like a goat, with black marks in with his eyes, and with the "terribly stupid" sisters of the hero ... you bleed from head to toe if you've tried and succeeded by watching this movie completely!
