The worst movie I've seen from Tera Jadoo Chal Gaia. There is no story, no humor, there is nothing! Action sequences look more like a series of random Akshai Kumar Thumbs-Up advertisements together. It is very influenced by The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle, but very badly performed. I did not expect much, but watching this movie is a horrifying experience that you are wondering "What were these guys thinking about?" The only thing you can remember after watching is the anorexic Kareena in bikinis. The reason why I did not give a grade '1' is that every time I think I've seen the worst, Bollivood proves me wrong.
