The only thing that happened to me after I watched this whore, was that I would never get the time to watch this, again. If you want to see Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn trying to earn what was then there, payments on vacation homes are then in progress. Woody acting, bad special effects, the only comedy was while our alien hero was in a female form and this ended when she made her obligatory b-film naked scene within 30 minutes of the movie. The ability to make what might have been a decent movie disappears when Nicole Eggbert looks at an alien at the bar within 30 seconds, while the police, army and Joe do not remember that a woman is drinking coffee, does not use a glass lunch and wears four jumps at a time. It must be from another planet. Exactly where I want to be when this movie was turned on.
