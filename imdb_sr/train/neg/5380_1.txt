At the time of writing this review, over 50% of IMDB voters seem to have given this film a rating of 10 or 1. I can only assume that those who gave it were either members or team members. They say that, given the enough monkeys and enough time and enough typewriter machines, these monkeys, by accidental prodding on the keyboard, eventually typed the complete works of Shakespeare. However, I seriously doubt that, given the same number of monkeys and time, we could find one who will give this film a rating of 10. 10. I patiently watched the first half, stupidly assuming that the film was at some level , she would develop complications or characters, or perhaps make some kind of social commentary or cause bare intellectual thought. Otherwise, I was ready to accept action, uncertainty, comedy, horror, or even free sex as a way to get my attention. In the end, I was disappointed, and accordingly, much of the second half was viewed at a double speed, while in vain I asked for a small clip of cinematic redemption. Unfortunately, there was none. If "The Choke" is set against Scooby Doo episode, then I'm afraid the cartoon would win hands in terms of mystery, intrigue, and unpredictability. Speaking of characters from cartoons, the acting abilities of different actors differed between the acceptable (at best) and the unfortunate poor with Brooke Bailey's portrayal of a crazy, pseudo-goth-obsessed death, London, which was so bad that I complained . Br /> I'd like to finish on a positive note, but not even a soundtrack, a second-class holiday of modern punk rock, he did not even have fun, let alone serve to improve a very bad movie.
