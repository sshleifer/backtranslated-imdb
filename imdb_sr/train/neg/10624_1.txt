Otherwise, the loleralacartelort7890 says: "It's true that Americans use a secret aluminum anti-radiation alloy, which is not so well known, but the exact specifications are a secret, and why is it secret? Why would they discover it? If they are in space running with the Russians, then it would be very foolish to discover that they had a new technology that could protect the radiation crew. "This is totally incorrect. There is no (and there was no) "secret" in the Apollo for protection against radiation. The design and construction of the command module Apollo has long been publicly available. It uses a light "honeycomb" of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire outer surface (except the window, of course) is covered with a heat shield of a phenolic resin, a thicker on the bottom looking forward for re-entry. These materials are actually better at stopping the type of radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is better suited to stop ionizing photons such as X-rays and gamma rays. is the definitive problem for a * long-term * flight in space due to the risk of large solar torches. But it simply was not a serious threat to the astronauts from Apollo. The command module provided them with fairly good protection during a short (1/2 hour) passage through the Van Allen belts. They all carried dosimeters, so we know exactly how much radiation they receive: no more than 1.5 rem and usually much less. Of the 24 men who flew to the moon (12 of them landed), 18 are still alive. Only two died of cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Svigert (bone cancer). Others died of heart attack, pancreatitis (Roosa), and a motor accident (Conrad). These are in fact pretty good statistics for a group of men now in the late '70s (Shepard would be 86).
