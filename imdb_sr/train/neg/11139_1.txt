There is not much to say about this movie, it's terrible. The idea and the dialogue are far from even decent, the story of a hybrid wolf is not well explained and everything is there and there. CGI is something you would not like to see. So amateur to vomit me. The only good thing on DVD was in Ekrtras. Rag. Everything else, just wasting time and money. I hope that nobody will buy this, it's not even worth renting. Just stay away from it.
