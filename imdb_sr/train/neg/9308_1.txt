this film was definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen some pretty bad movies. I did not like how this movie was shot. all actors are unknown, and it looks like a group of friends gathered and decided to make their movie. but it's absolutely terrible. I've never seen a worse movie. The story is so fake, and I found it took a long time to get to the end of the movie. it was not complicated, it seemed like it was not planned before they started to record. The story is too weird. I did not like the time it took to get to the meaning of the movie. It did not make sense even to record this film. If you're thinking about watching this movie, do not. Just waste your time.
