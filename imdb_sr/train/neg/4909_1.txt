That's right, you heard me. I am the great fan of James Patterson. I have 10 of his books and I read a whole series about Lindsey Boaker. In my opinion, the screenwriter should be recorded. What right did any movie creator have to kill a great work on fiction and turn it into a mockery of a mysterious genre? If I ever thought that Harry Potter had been slaughtered, then Michael O'Hara showed me to be wrong. I can only pray that the next scriptwriter dealing with this fantastic book will do much more justice. Michael O'Hari and Russell Mulcahi: Do not interrupt your daily work.
