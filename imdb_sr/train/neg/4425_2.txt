A film about the Renaissance of Harlem and especially about one author. This is in contrast to the modern story of a young, gay, black artist. If this sounds unclear, it's because it's a movie itself. It's well-targeted, pretty well written and (mostly) well-played. Also, the scenes in the past were shot in a black and white shade. This is also one of the few films dealing with gay men who are NOT opposed to sexual scenes (not so explicit and without frontal). Still, I mostly hated this. The film meandra everywhere, full of unpleasant characters (including the main protagonist) and (this is the killer) moves with the rhythm of the snails. I thought about leaving the theater three times because I was so boring. But the director was there, so I stayed. His talk after the word shows that it was the work of love and that it took 6 years to complete. I really would like to love this (there are very few movies that honestly refer to gay blacks), but I can not. Unless you are interested in the Harlem Renaissance, there is no reason to see it.
