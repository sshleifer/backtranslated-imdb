If I could say it was better than Gimkata, at least I felt that my money was not fully spent. Then I saw Steven Segala on the "Deadly Field". This film should see the resurrection even on MST 3K. If Santa Claus wins the Martians, this could lead to the exploding of Tom Servo's head, wondering what this movie might cause. The writers of this shit should be forced to carry posters every day in their lives that say, "Bitch me waterfall! I was a writer at Gimkata."
