I went to see D-rat in a fuss and with very low expectations. The movie failed to meet them. Do not bother me stories that stretch incredible - remember the reign of fire? - but I expect them to be internally consistent. This film jumped from the screams into a dash without a breath of breath, everything was interwoven with the special effects that lagged behind LOTR or even Godzil. Mystic warrior from Korea, which changes into a form of Caucasian antique merchant and jumps like deus ek machina to extract unhappy protagonists from his latest disorder. A special FBI agent who seems to have been completely condemned to an ancient Korean folklore due to the excellent "paranormal division" of the FED - which has not yet appeared. The lovers are kissing on the abandoned beaches that shout: "I never intended this to happen." Reincarnated couple of long-dead Koreans who "died as lovers crossed by stars." The mystical pendants, the formless hordes of robotic soldiers (who owe much to Orcs of Peter Jackson) and the snake that spends so much time as they spew, every time a prey is picked up in the reach, something comes to turn it away. Dialogue is terrible, wooden and the effect of the whole is to be honest, boring. However, for me, the crowning moment was in the end, after the finals, when the music for the final credits - Arirang! This is similar to Akira Kurosawa who closes the "Ran" with karaoke performance by Mi Vai - and let me be clear that I do not compare the director Shima with Kurosawa in any way. In short, a self-indulgent, inadequate collection of clich√©s and narrative non-sequoists who like the feeling of melodramaticity that is so prevailing in the popular culture of the Koran, but should not be worth the price for a serious film visitor - or even not so serious a movie visitor. I suggest that this completely bypasses cinema cinema and go directly to the video, but I'm not sure whether it's that worth it.
