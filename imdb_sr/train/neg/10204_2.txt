At first it seemed that the film was excellent, that the profile profiles were set for them ... the action seemed to go in the right direction ... however, as the film progressed, it seemed that the director focused on the wrong things. ... or much of it is arranged out of the movie. The identity of the characters changed to the top in the movie. It also seemed to have a lot of implicit meaning - in other words - they had things in a movie that did not fit the film itself. And the title ... there's no where the title corresponds to the movie in the movie ... I suppose the title works for performances ... Actors have done well what they had ... that they had a better director and writer, maybe this would work better . But it's not. So, on Friday, a new horror film comes out ... My opinion! ... do not waste your time and money.
