I just could not finish this movie. I turned down after what I said was my nomination for the weakest attempt at awarding a sexual suggestion: the scene in which Pia Zador, at the picnic, stands between the two boys who want it. One (good boy) begs to see the error in her paths. The other (evil boy) simply asks if she likes the hot dog, which he then holds for her. At the crotch level. I hope that I do not mess out anything to say that it turns, and take a hot dog, with a smile. Just pathetic.
