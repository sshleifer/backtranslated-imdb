It's been almost 30 years and I still hate everyone involved in this movie. That remains the worst movie I've ever seen. Before I see this, I have never thought much of Riches, in one way or another. After watching this movie, I have an allergic reaction when I accidentally see it on TV. I pulled myself to it - against my better judgment - peer pressure. However, leaving the theater, these friends have sworn that they will never again reject my choice of film. Almost thirty years later, we still carry mental scars from this film. On the very bed, one of my regrets will be the time when I lost hope that this movie will be better. It's never been. If you have ever been given to choose, you prefer to watch this movie. I applied for IMDb comments only in hopefully I can warn others not to watch this movie. If I can save only one person from looking at this, then my existence on this earth is justified.
