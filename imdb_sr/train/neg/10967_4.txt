Believe me, I love horror movies. I love films of science fiction. I love independent movies. And, I love low-budget, B movies. Sometimes I even like bad acting, boring scripts, wooden lines, incredible situations, and the like. However, I did not like Christmas on Mars. It simply does not work on so many levels. For all of the above reasons, and more. This includes the meaningless, obvious use of images of female genitals. And many allusions to male genitalia, in a very Freudian way. I'm convinced this is pure from incompetence. Unlike some attempts to do something really different. I mean any film that lasts for years for a movie, it simply can not keep the level of matching and focus required by modern audiences. . However, unfortunately, this was supposed to happen, as we saw that things were happening on the screen. The only kindness I can express is that the picture was ultimately incredible. If this was used at the beginning, instead of the end, the movie could be taken away where it ended in 2001 ... Have not tried it badly. I just do not understand what was so important in this movie that it even had to be made. Was it a conspiracy? Certainly it can not be. Were they characters? I doubt; I mean, I could live without knowledge of Ed. 15. Was it a dialogue? Explicitly, no. Music? Perhaps, but more likely, the careless ego principle should be pardoned. Much better efforts have died on the floor of the cutting room.
