This film was weird ... I watched him while I swallowed a quarter of psilcibe cubensis (mushroom). It was really weird. I'm pretty sure you should look at it high, but the mushrooms were not enough. I could not stop laughing. Maybe Lsd would work. The movie is a bunch of things that turn into other things and dancing. It's really raw for today's standards, but when released I'm sure it was good ... unique. I could see how some people thought this film was good, but I did not think it was very interesting, and then I was in the mushrooms. If you have a party or something, and everyone is pretty hot, climb a few laughs.
