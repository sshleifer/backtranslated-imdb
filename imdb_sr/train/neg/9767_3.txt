I think if you are in the sixties, like me, you are obliged to spend about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely visible fiber vessel. The preserving grace of this strangeness includes a surprisingly appropriate social commentary on the values ​​of the sixties and a series of relatively well-known actors trapped in early (and unfavorable) footage. It's as if Laugh-In's producers sat down and decided to write a full movie, covering all the high points (and more) issues between flower and institution children, and then put in some Hippies and gave them a $ 10,000 budget to finish it . It's hardly a classic, but in its own way realizes how much the time is really strange, stupidity, exaggerated idealism and the intransigence of the institution. Obviously not for everyone.
