The Batman Mystery of the Batvoman, in one word, stood up. The action goes on to say that the mysterious female vigilante ("Batvoman") falls into Batman's grass, and while Batman tries to fight against the penguin / bane / Rupert Thorne troika, he is trying to understand who the mysterious Batvoman is. There is nothing unusual wrong in this, but in no way can one say that it is something special, noting that he really did it to endure. The fantasy mask is Bruce's long-lost love surface and confusion with his head. Subzero was a great event in the life of Mr. Even the Batman Beiond movie turns, Return of the Joker, digged deep with the characters involved. But the Mysteries of the Batvoman had some minor backing, a lot of formulas complemented by a central setpiece on a cruise ship. Frankly, this thing is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight, without the flaw and bite that the Animated Series had at its peak.
