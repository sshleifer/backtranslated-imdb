I heard about this movie some time ago from a friend and recently got it on a DVD. There was much anticipation and excitement as we both both heard that this is a terrifying film, really terrifying. How disappointed? VERY !!!! Except for one scene (we all know which part) Nothing happened! I expected to see a woman in black several times and that she would make a few more unpleasant scenes, as they appear on the window or walk across the hallway or something like that. Almost all reviews here. What a terrible, tangible, atmospheric film. I'm afraid I did not see it. There may be a difference in what people in the US see as scary to here in Britain. A lot of descent after all hyper-examinations :(
