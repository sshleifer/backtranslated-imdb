Another bad one in which one can go is one. Otherwise, it would become easy to zero. Indeed one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, Peckenpah's name was not on what I would never have imagined it did. In fact, one of the San Francisco people I know he was on the set and since the sun's almost sunrise says that Sam is simply a snowman. It's shown in peaks. Laughter in the early part of the film is the only thing in the whole of this mess worth another look. Even Gig Ioung is not visible. This is a real masochistic test. If I were forced into a theater to see him, I would jump to scream. And now I really feel guilty that I watched everything from a very comfortable couch that was too nice to go. What a mess, it seemed less written than fictitious while they were going together. It's not just a bomb, but a bmob written backwards. Iikes !!!!!
