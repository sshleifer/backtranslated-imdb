I'm sick of the movies that sound fun in a single-pollinated script and then ending exactly as they would be in the lower center of the compost pile. Who knows: "Maybe it sounded interesting in the studio, even with a" big name "(like Blair and Hasselhoff - winking, nudge-nudge) and jumping like Hildegard Knef (I do not know , some woman ... But on the film, it breaks down faster than a papier-mache's sculpture in a rainy storm. It seems that these unfortunate people are trapped in an island on the east coast, and one of them (a woman, I suppose) is the target of the Satanic cult wearing a child of hell, while others are grotesque, curvy ways.

It seems that Hasselhoff probably wants to return to the hook with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda. .. well, who knows; Fifth convenience for celebrities or pro-golf tournaments or whatever it is up to now.

And yes, Blair is obsessed, as if you have not seen it descend to the Main Street, followed by marching. No star. "Wizard" - these witches will give you itch.
