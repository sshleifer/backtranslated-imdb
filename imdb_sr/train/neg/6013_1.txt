I have read every book so far in a series that has been left behind, and the film hardly makes any of them a fair one. Of course, I saw and up the movies, but this was incredibly disappointing. This movie would have a good episode of MST3K. The scenario was a terrible adaptation of the book, and actors seemed to read their words instead of actually saying it. The characters were rigid and unsuitable. The effects were untidy and they looked terribly fake. The end was horrible. First, it did not even go through the first book. Second, it did not make sense. If you had not read the book, you would have no idea what was going on. It had to be the brightest, film-finished film I've ever seen in the movie. I'm upset that I actually paid for this movie. If by some miracle he gets a wide release, he should be completely refined and Hollivood to take over. These two film producers and director should leave filmmaking to professionals.
