This film is the best example of wasting large resources in the film. You have the future SNL and SCTV stars at its peak, such as John Candi, Chevi Chase, Laraine Nevman, Al Franken, Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty who essentially make 70 minutes of rough, uninspired farts and racist jokes. The concept of a network from a future subversive society could indeed be brought to some interesting extremes, but instead, immediately behind the gate, a real joke, a minor proctological joke, and remains in that spirit of humor all the way. much more subversive and witty Groove Tube or later, hilarious Kentucky Fried movie. This film is intended only for those who want to see the time capsule of the poor 70s of sketching films.
