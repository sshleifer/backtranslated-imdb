People like me will split this movie. It's just not realistic. The plot is sooooooo predictable. You can predict everything that happens to convientantli Of course, they find mild and become dirty rich, and trick a bad guy. We've already seen him a million times before. The writers of this film must think that most of the films that have been published are stupid. They must be right, because most people actually loved this movie. I mean solving the puzzles in a few seconds. The mysterious mystery room hidden under the Manhattan metro station? I would think that with all the work that was done in New York underground, this room would have been discovered before. and everything that was built during the Civil War? PLEASE AND A Love Story Between Ben and Abigail? how sweet, and I thought romance in the novels of Clive Cussler was weak. They just fall in love, for 2 seconds, WHAT would I be worried about saving my ass and getting something? hell with a girl and dumb paper. 1/10 Garbage
