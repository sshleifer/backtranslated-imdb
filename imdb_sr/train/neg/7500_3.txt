Spike Lee must be one of the most reputable directors I've ever seen. He is a favorite of critics because he allegedly makes movies with "message" or is so much afraid in his approach to make critics who are overwhelmed by Hollywood movie formulas eat his stuff just because they are different. Summer Of Sam does not work well. Cinematic and editing style is Oliver Stone, as well as a story. The action is much like "Do the Right Thing". Showing "Guidos" or for the computers of Italian-American Americans (which I am by myself) is directly from Eddie Murphi's Rav. Only Eddie Murphy's impression of a macho Italian guy struggling with a much higher Afroamerican is much more convincing than the caricatured, wide Italian caricatures shown here (the character of John Leguizamo is a possible exception). Is there anyone who saw this movie that could not figure out how it would end? As soon as Richie entered the film, I could already see a fist in his face and his abdomen in his stomach, but I could see him being charged with being a killer. This figure had the greatest integrity in the entire film, so Lee will, of course, show what happens to people who stand out in the crowd (what a white beard click!) Someone, please, give Spike Liu a lifelong a pass for all the basketball games he wants. So, it may be too much to enjoy the movie for a long time and we will not have to be subjected to his important disturbance, and in addition, I will not have to look at criticisms (some of them that I respect) ohhhh and ahhhh to a czar without clothes.
