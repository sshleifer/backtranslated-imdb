"Son of John Hughes wrote a drama of high school! Wow!" I thought while I was checking the movie information here at IMDb, late Saturday night, after I found myself watching the introductory credits on BBC2. I just finished watching, and unfortunately it was downhill from there to. You probably can not spoil a movie that's bad, but I'll leave the spoofs from this review ... There are terribly plenty of style compared to very few substances: unfortunately, the style is not 8 years since publication. As for the essence, the film tries to show the interesting nature of control in society through the microcosm of school life; but under a bright veneer, a remotely meaningful or relevant argument fails to materialize. The characters are colored in childish wide moves, falling into the kind of generic stereotypes that the writer's father wanted to question at the Breakfast Club. The director of Kile Cooper is doing a decent job keeping a step (maybe he's relying too much on the installation of information, which soon becomes a tedious device, but at least moves the story), but his effort does not diminish enough from the poor scenario and bizarre casting (so that someone should stand aside) Maddoka, "when Blake Shields pushes and glovers his way through the part, I just can not understand), not to mention the many stunts of a real hole (all for a creative license, but when" bad guys "know the identity of" good guys "who their lives Make them miserable, but they do not succeed and in any way to stop them, you really have to wonder why this scenario did not go through several redesigns before production - did Dad even read it?). I'm sure the younger audience could enjoy this movie (and all the power for them)), but it's better for them to hold high school Hughes Sr., and if the idea of ​​rebellion in schools is that What is really Complaint, the classic "If ..." from 1968 is a very satisfactory examination of the subject.
