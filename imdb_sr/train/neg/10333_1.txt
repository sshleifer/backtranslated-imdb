What was an exciting and fairly original Fox series, has degraded itself to a wrinkled trumpet. During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly must see list, not just because of Jessica Alba. Unfortunately, the powers that were at the Foca have decided that they need to fine-tune the line. In the 3 episodes of the opening season, I was completely lost as a spectator (not even to see Jessica Albu!). I found new characters added in the second season to be too funny and amateur. New schemes were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show. In another episode of the season, they even had Macs to sleep and dream - where the first season declared that they could not sleep biologically. Moral stories (the one Hollivood never gets): If it does, do not fuck it! Aziazzz
