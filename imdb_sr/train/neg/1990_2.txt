This could be a strong candidate for "The Worst Movie Ever". Perhaps, without the presence of John Hurth, it can be tolerated as a movie for a child. However, the TRAGEDY of the whole effort is that John Hurt, one of the biggest actors on the screen, is reduced in this .... I gave him two points just because Mr. because he did not escape quickly enough. As far as the rest of the actors are concerned, they are simply horrible. Janine Turner, no matter how beautiful, can not save her soul. And the main actor is, for all intents and purposes, AVFUL. If you can preserve this shame, please do so. It's so bad, it's almost BETTER.
