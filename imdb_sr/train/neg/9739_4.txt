It's not so much that SPONTANEOUS CHOICE has little potential. Indeed, the underdeveloped phenomenon of the title is rather intriguing and, at least at the opening, this Tobe Hooper promises to entertain in a way only the cheesy of the nineties. However, somewhere between Brad Dourif's re-appearance and over-complicated complications, this potential thriller loses its course. Dourif, presented here before its built-in base of horror fans is accumulated, is the average type of Sam. Of course, average guys do not stay long on average in horror films, so after a well-formed contour of origin, we see that Sam's various parts of the body start to light up. He soon fell on other people, much to Lisa's astonishment, which Cinthia Bain played tirelessly. While the film title implies a fiery happy monster at liberty, Director Hooper decided that Sam would be a reluctant killer. This approach gives the film additional human depth that would otherwise be missing, but also prevents us from really fearing a human flame thrower. We wonder if this would work better like the effort of the criminal-against-everyone ala NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. SPONTANEOUS ELECTRICITY is a fairly nominal effort when everything is said and done. This will have additional attraction for fans of Dourif and those who can not get enough horror from the 1990s, whether it's good, bad or between, but only slowly.
