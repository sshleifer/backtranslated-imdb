I've never heard of this before it appeared on cable television. It's very typical for sci-fi late 50s: sober, depressed and not a bit paranoid! Despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple, the film is largely portrayed in the documentary style - which may be a cheap way to leave many exposures to narration and an excuse to upload as many footage as human for what is undoubtedly an extremely low-budget venture! Although not uninteresting in itself (angle-apocalypse-over-renegade-rockets later used, with far greater relevance, both for DR STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964]) and mercifully short, the approach of one movie to his This results in a lot of unintended laughter - especially in scenes that involve the innocent labor and the clueless band of juvenile delinquents!
