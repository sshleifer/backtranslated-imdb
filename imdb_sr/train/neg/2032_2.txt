I have given two stars for the incredible clarity of the DV image, which gives it a cold and dark sterility of its character. That was generous, I know. This film fails on all accounts. I can not recommend this because it is neither poetic nor dull. It's not dramatic, it's not tense. It's not controversial, it's not ordinary. It's just a miserable piece of garbage that no horror or fan can recommend in good faith. . Please, just stay away from this terrible product. Thank you.
