Watching Josh Kornbluth's 'act' in this film reminds me of my TV production class, where it's not funny to have had the chance to prove how deeply they were unconscious. when I try to sync this comedy. Jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed. Delivery is painfully bad. OUCH !!!!!!! Writing is simply dorkish. It's similar to Bob Saget's show. Watching this movie is as painful as watching an hour and a day on Saturday night live (post Belushi). Hate this movie and I want money back !!!
