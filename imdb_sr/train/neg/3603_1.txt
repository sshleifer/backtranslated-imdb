Does this movie sit down? Terrible acting, horrible script, terrible effects, terribly horrible! Nothing here can not be used even for the worst fans of horror! A crazy assassin walks students to college. People appear dead in the corridors, but still, the class continues normal? After the fourth body, I would think that we could allow the students a few days break! LOL. This is as bad as people do. This film should be presented as a means of torture for criminals. You are warned!
