Probably the latest film about Zealands ever made The Jokes They are not funny. Used from other films and just plain stupidity. The acting is bad although there is a great game. The story is uninteresting and boring. It has more cheese than pizza huts. Pizza chefs like acting was 1000 times before I watching this when he came to the TV but he was so boring that he could only stand for 30 minutes. This film is a shit Do not watch it, Take a look at the color instead of being dried
