All the films of David Prior are horrible at all points: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinema, without budget (the director's brother is usually played as a male leader). But they all have incredible fun value because of unintentional joy. The plot of almost every "film" of David Priora (as I like to refer to them) is essentially the same. The men's team of all American commandos raises the air of communist evil. But unlike other Cold War reclaims, such as Red Dawn, Priory films are actually funny because of their rooms and acting. The best part of the Jungle Assault is the scene in which Becker (or was the other guy?) Invited by General Mitchell for a secret mission in South America. The funniest line in the movie is then delivered, something like the effect "this is my roommate, I have trained him well". WHAT. You trained a roommate? And obviously this will be their solution to avoid eviction. If you can find these gems on videos that are used anywhere, BUY them. They are all funny and even funny after a few beers. Watch them with a group of friends for a true MST3K-style experience. So far my friends and I have managed to catch Night Vars and Aerobicide aka Killer Vorkout. But what I most recommend to most is the Final Sanction, with the strange Robert Zard.
