This is absolutely the worst performance by Robert Duvall, who sounds like Villiam Buckley during the entire film. His melodramatic acting performance takes away any dramatic interest. I'm not sure whether it was a deliberate theft or an unintentional scene, but that's the only thing I can remember from a movie that's really forgotten. This picture should be displayed in every amateur acting class on an example of what should not be done. Thank God, Duvall moved to bigger and better things and stopped trying to achieve a cultivated accent. He's a good actor, but that's all. Klaus is much better. His performance is muted and worth attention.
