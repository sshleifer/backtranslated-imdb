Just because someone younger than 10 does not mean they are stupid. If your child loves this movie, it's better to test it. I'm constantly wondering how many people can get involved in something that turned out to be so bad. This "movie" is a display for digital sorcery and nothing else. Writing is terrible. I can not remember when I heard such a bad dialogue. The songs are incredible. The acting is a sub-pair, but the actors have not given much. Who decided to hire Joe Fatone? He can not sing and is ugly like sin. The worst thing is the obviousness of all this. It's as if the writers went out of their way to do all that stupid thing. Big children's films are evil, smart and full of smart films like Shrek and Toi Stori in recent years, Villie Vonk and The Vitches to mention the two pasts. But in the continual dumbing-out of the Americans, they are raging in the duck like Finding Nemo (yes, that's right), the recent Charlie & Chocolate Factory and garbage like a red rider.
