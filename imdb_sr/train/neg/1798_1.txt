How can Ozzy Osbourne's film be still and it's still bullshit? I just do not understand. Trick or Treat managed to do it. This is bullshit and he loves it. Trick or Treat is one of those films about which I have to warn people. It's a nasty beast that causes vomiting, just begging to watch you, so you can feel a lot worse in yourself. The trick or treatment has no factors to buy. For a film about heavy metal, it does not seem to understand what a heavi metal is or what it represents. This movie manages to make a heavy metal scarf, and this was in 1986, probably one of the strongest heavy metal hours. It's a real undertaking, whatever negative. Trick or Treat = so bad that you will be angry at yourself that you watched it. This simple equation will, hopefully, keep you away from this pointless and headless film.
