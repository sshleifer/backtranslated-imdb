The TV Guide calls this film a mystery. What is a mystery to me is that it is possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians can not produce a movie that would rise above the overwhelming level of garbage that this film perfectly represents. This is Bollivood at its best / worst, I can not really tell the difference. Wise sweet, kitsch clich√©s on every level, stories, situations, dialogue, music and choreography. To be honest, you have to be retarded to enjoy. I watched him satisfy his cultural curiosity, but there were moments when I had to leave her because I could not take it anymore. The only quality of the impressive film is the exceptional beauty of the leading actresses. <br /> <br />
