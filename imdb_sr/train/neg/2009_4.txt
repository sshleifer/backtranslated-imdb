This is not a bad movie. The plot (the new house built in the neighborhood seems to be embezzled) is not bad, the mood is creepy enough, and the act is fine. The big problem I had was that, since I was introduced to Lara Flinn Boile (from Twin Peaks and other shows), I could not figure out how it looks different with its seemingly new, big lips. I kept staring at them. They look so inappropriate on her face! They look completely different (and not better). Mark-Paul Gosselaar, an actor playing Kim architect who designs and pours his heart and soul into the house, works well. And Lara (like Col) is also pretty good (but those lips!) As the owner of the neighborhood house. Her husband, Walker (Colin Ferguson) is a suitable wood. Different characters living in the house were also fine. I especially liked Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first people who moved into the house. Trying to drag us into the overall atmosphere in the neighborhood, unfortunately, fails, as other neighbors are not particularly sympathetic. Other films (such as Amitville Hill, The Legend of Hell House) manage to achieve this frustrating feeling, but this simply does not happen here. The closest thing is when Col painting the house image. Another thing that did not help me is a plot that happens with architect Kim. At first, it seems that the victim of the house is the same as the rest (he sucked it from inspiration), but later it seems that he joined forces with him in evil. All in all, it's not a bad movie for fans of horror if you can take your eyes off those big lips!
