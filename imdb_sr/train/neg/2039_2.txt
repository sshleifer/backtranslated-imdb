This film was almost unbearable to pass. I can overcome the fact that it looks as if it was filmed with a home video camera and that this movie should go on for a week, but the characters did not change clothing anymore, but the act broke the fourth wall for me. . I've seen better acting in class 4. In addition, the plot is unrealistic. If a man suspected him, he would surrender him. I was also very disappointed that all the murders were carried out with a pistol what kind of blood was. It's not an imitator. Zodiac has not only killed a gun that the authorities would know he was not. Another thing that really disturbed me was what they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4 when it was the name of a book used to diagnose people with mental disorders, not the name of the disorder. All in all, I think this film is not a movie that can be done with a low budget, at least not as low as they had, or they could be sure to have better actors or more. Many people have taken the low budget path without having to use the horrific actors watching Easi Rider who had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a low budget.
