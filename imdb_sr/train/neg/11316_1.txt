The knights were just the beginning of the series, a pilot, it could be said. The action (I really should not have called it, there was no complication) was not logical and there were many mistakes, like [a warning, I summarize the plot]: At the beginning of the film, someone said that it was only a few These cyborgs (bad guys), but after peak, Nea learned that many more of them were left of them. And it was said that it was hard to kill the cyborgs, but after a month of training, Nea could have killed them with one shot. The film was just a clean blow. I was not at all surprised when I learned that the leading star is a kick boker. It was ONLY POSITIVE in the whole film: it really caused a lot of laughter when he watched it and I talked about it with my friends. I recommend that you watch it if you need a laugh.
