This is by far the LARGEST film I've ever seen. I wanted to expect a siren movie, but at least with some cool car scenes / racing. What I got is nothing. The racing scene is so low budget that they have accelerated them to look like cars are "moving fast". In one scene, the Mercedes SLR goes from over 200 to 0 in just 4 seconds by turning around in circles. Just funny. If you want to see the real movie about cars, watch the fast and furious series. They may be a little handsome, but 100k better than this movie could ever have hoped for. Still better see the Mischief 3000, the best car I've ever made.
