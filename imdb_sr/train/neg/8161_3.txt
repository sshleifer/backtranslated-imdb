Mary Lu is a whore whose spirit seeks revenge for those who let her come to her fateful fate in 1957. Well, the film is mostly going on in 1986. / dumb special effects, including some strange crazy wandering horses. In any case, the spirit of Mary Lu is doing bad things to people and trying to take over the body of one man. Regardless of whether it will succeed or not, you will have to look to find out. In any case, the film is mostly boring and based on a bunch of worthless characters. This is also not a sequel, the only thing that is common with the first is the name of the high school. It's average. terrible mirroring of the back, up, meaningless nudity, house against the Catholic church. The basic thing, boring movie. The act is decent enough to give her 3 out of 10. You can spend time on something else.
