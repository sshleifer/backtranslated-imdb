You must understand that, when the name of the star is incorrectly indicated in the initial credits, you will not have a good time (credit is "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). Have a nice car drive, shoot them, shoot them in action if ALL want to be action, because the relation to what is there is at best and totally incredible. Character motivations, especially Gooding's in the end, are worse than incredible, irrational when they are not hopelessly confused. All I can think of is that Andi Cheng must be a really nice guy who listed these many good actors on this project (he can not have anything on all of them, right?).
