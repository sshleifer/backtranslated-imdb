I do not know what that other guy meant. The fact that this film is independently made does not make it less terrible. You can be a great believer as you like ... the majority of the film is a foolish nonsense. I feel that I was offended by having to watch the first 40 minutes. And it's just not a small feat. Not only is the acting terrible, but the plot is never even close to the developed one. There are countless holes in the story, to the extent that it's hard to even call it a story. I never read the book, so I can not criticize it, but this is the first review I've written here and its purpose is to save all the viewers there for an hour and a half of their lives. I can not remember the last time I even finished watching the movie. This really takes a cake.
