"Pali" are in the category of Loss of Life (VOL). I'm sad that I'm not entertained for two hours now. My other family members also watched this movie and threw down humiliating comments on the screen and rooted for the mummy. I'm sorry, actors (Vagner). I have read other negative reviews and I can not add anything else to this movie except that it can be reduced to 25 minutes in order to be able to take a 30-minute slot on the TV without losing the action. It reminds me of a meal that has several good ingredients, but when served, there is no taste. In my humble opinion, a 42-meter mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improve the action by removing the mystical one and replacing it with a few people who want to condemn the facts and want DNA samples for evil reasons. Heroes were discredited and thrown into the ear of their college. Later, after all the people were screwing in. Heroes would save the day and prove that they were all wrong.
