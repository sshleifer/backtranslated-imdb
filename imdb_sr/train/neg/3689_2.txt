The main aspect of Superstar films at a later stage was the frequency, the gap between one film and the next. As a well-known star of the South Indian film, the feedback he received before Baba were great. From Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films he played in Tamil as a massive hero in 11 years was only 11 exactly at a rate of 1 year. All this was a big hit. He had an image that many could not easily crash. But after Padaiappa (1999), he went into hibernation. His fans around the world, especially in South India, were ready to watch a movie of any kind with its superstar in action. So the Tamil cinema industry decided to come with Baba. Movie producers thought fans would record everything they showed with Superstar in it. But this obviously failed in this film. As usual, exaggerations in the media and fans' expectations were beyond borders. Rajinikant's picture is completely damaged. The fans were crazy. The movie collection did not meet the expected level. The reputation of the big people has fallen. The only positive aspect of this film are the A.R.Rehman's poems. It is well known that Rehman composed good music for some of the worst movies such as Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, En Svasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu etc. Well, I never thought this film would join that league. > You feel very depressed not because the movie is bad, but because of the super picture super image. It took him five full years to completely recover it from two films Chandramukhi and Sivaji and to fans fans what they really want in the superstar movie.
