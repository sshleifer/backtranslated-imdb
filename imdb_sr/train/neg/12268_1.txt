I saw about four other Japanese horror films and they were not too impressive. However, I could feel that there is a reasonable script that leads the way. No here, no chance. It's a detective trying to link similar murders that are happening. When the suspect finds him to be examined, the suspect is cursing because he constantly looks at the spirit. Then, the ghost begins to be followed by detectives in the environment FOR THE REASON THAT NEVER ANNOUNCE AND DOWNLOAD MORE THAN THE POLO FILM. Good enough? Oh no. The film continues to shift perspective on different characters that have little to do with the story. I've already seen this in other films, showing a different perspective. It's not the case here. Also, everything that happens on the screen, which is really tolerable, quickly ends. For example, there are several scenes with a mild instrumental result that is being built and ... then it only cuts to the other scene. I am aware that this can be a dramatic effect. It's definitely not the intention here. It's just a bad editing. Finally, there is a "ghost" that only shouts in a way that is not intimidating or unintentionally ridiculous. It's embarrassing and it's going on a lot during the whole movie. All the scares have been done before in a better way, so you can see that everyone is coming. After one of them, the film is over. At that moment, the confusion wave flooded the audience as I could feel that we all felt we spent our time. Someone mocked the applause and laughter. It was better than the whole movie. Simply put, AVOID.
