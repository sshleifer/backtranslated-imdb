Okay, I honestly do not see why everyone thinks this is so great. It really is not. Two good things came out of this movie. 1. Jack's performance, he was very good. 2. Danni's performance, he was good. No other then became quite stupid. And, what did Stanley Kubrick think of Shell as Wendy? She was so bad. She looked the same every time she was scared. The problem with this movie was the end. I would have more respect if Kubrik would otherwise end up. And the movie was stupid. The problem with the film is that the book was much better. So, do not watch the movie reading a book and you'll be a lot better. 3/10.
