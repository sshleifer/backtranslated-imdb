With the character of British actors and a coveted British photograph from the 1950s, I was hopeful and expected that this film would be more entertaining. Unfortunately, I found myself glued to him for the wrong reasons - I could not believe how terrible it was. I must have watched thousands of old movies and I'm always ready to let them be the products of their time, but this was really hard. As others have noticed, the big problem is that it does not seem to know what it wants to be: a gentle romantic comedy, comedy or musical. I was a bit stunned when Jeannie Carson suddenly started to fall into the song for about 15 minutes! At any level, this is not convincing, neither the story itself nor the fact that Daisy never had any threat in her. Other aspects that defied credibility included the role of Donald Sinden as a songwriter (a songwriter for God's sake!), The fact that Diana Dors has a fianc√© and she seems to have no little interest in her (I mean, Diana) Dors! Come on!) And the absurd scene in the song publisher's office. The whole thing is stupid in the worst possible way. If I had to choose a favorite scene, it would be that one from the beginning with this wonderful actor, Wilfred Lavson - after that everything went downhill.
