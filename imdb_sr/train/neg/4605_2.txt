This film was written by Charlie Higson, who had previously done the "legendary" Fast Shov and his show based on one of the characters of Fast Shov (Toni, a car dealer). He also wrote James Bond's books for children. In fact, before that I only saw Gordon's films based on Lovecraft's stories, and each of them is wonderful. Gordon is trying to do something else here. The style is completely "contemporary", which means the camera is trembling, fast and unusual cut, cold music in the background. It works here, I suppose, but it's still meaningless and cheap. I often think of a cameraman who shakes his dv-camera in front of the actors and tries to make stylistic moves in the pictures (hoping to get something tidy from it). Casting is good, and there is a whole atmosphere, which is the result of good direction. I think the main character, the "zero" young man, is quite interesting in his "zeroness". Fat is also good. And a guy who looks like Alec Baldwin, but he's not. But soon after the start, the film turns out to be something that is not particularly interesting: in this case, I mean the endless line of the sadism and disease scenes. There is not a lot of humanity in this film / story: it's completely pessimistic, and every person in this film is disgusting and hopeless, or soon dead. Needless to say, there is no humor. It's 1'40 long vomiting without relief at any time. After all, Gordon remains one of the most interesting filmmakers who are active today, and I think this film is an experiment, and as a failure in it. Everybody must sometimes get lost, just to learn and find his way again. It could be Gordon's most interesting and empty job.
