I missed the beginning of this movie, which could explain why I did not like it. On the other hand, for years I've been studying the fall of the Roman Republic so I know the story. And again, that could be the reason why this movie does not like me. The film has more historical inaccuracy than statistic. Although this is so incorrect, I do not think they tried to be true, in which case it can be forgiven. The strange thing is that they sometimes go in great lengths to be historically correct to end up being confusing. Like throwing Antonius' marriage with Octavius, and then pushing him to the side two scenes later. Why even mention it if that does not make sense, and Octavia has never been seen? And as Antonius called in his own name (Marcus Antonius) in some scenes, and by his strange English name, Mark Antony in other scenes. that there was no leading ladies. There is not a gram of dignity in it. She is hysterical, dramatic and totally unaware of her own. Instead of being a smart and composed queen, Cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of PMS. 95% of it comes from poor acting, but 5% is also from poor script writing. Too silly dramatic scenes are written in the script. Sometimes you did not watch Antonius and Cleopatra, you watched the immature version of Davson and Joei from the Davson's Creek. If you want to watch something about this period, watch ... everything except this.
