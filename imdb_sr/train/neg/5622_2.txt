OK, apart from psychedelic background images, the information shown here was good. The music I could without it (not that it was bad music, but it did not suit this movie at all). Regarding the content of the film, the director often comes to the end - the lack of a pagan perspective on Christ's existence and a staggering comparison of the work and events of Christ's life against the lives of mythological figures / deities such as Mithra and Dionysus. Then he talks about the chronology of the origins of Christianity and is a 'good' case, but not the one who took me away. If the director stuck with the facts and continued with them, this movie would be good. However, at this moment in the film, he breaks into a group of personally happy attacks on Mel Gibson's "Passion of Christ" and the Christian private school the director attended in his youth. During an interview with the old director (who during the presentation came to the conclusion that the director made false statements) I felt that the director was a child. He asked good questions, but, like the film itself, the interview broke into an attack on the rules of this private school, not on Christianity. All in all, if you are only interested in some information, watch the first 30 minutes and then turn them off.
