I have not seen him for more than twenty years. OJ was a bus driver, Arte Johnson was a travel guide, Lorenzo was a hijacker. Yes, Lorenzo looked at home like a villain, natural. I think I looked at him the most when I looked at OJ, which I saw Tovering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing, but also to see Arte Johnson. > And yes, it's a shifted plot. Reading other posts, I remember that it was a conspiracy to kidnap a rich girl, but then this priceless deal with the stamp appeared suddenly. If he appeared as a late film, I would probably have taken him to check it again, but I would not be nostalgic. Not everything is yet. It has even better films from the seventies, such as this, for checking.
