Why would any legitimate actor who read the script participate in this shit? My God, it's really embarrassing to even watch him. I can not imagine the shame that these people must feel they are part of. Also, it is obvious that there is some controversy over whether River Phoenik had a hand in the movie. He was ungrateful, but his role list (IMDB) is credited to him. BTV ... Rain is his sister for those who have asked. This film is proof that no matter how big you have. Owl ears do not make silk purses. I love Lorraine Bracco, but this is only sad, sad, sad ... Perhaps somebody will someday explain to me the reason for this type of film. There are no peculiar, entertaining, and even comic characteristics compared to bad ones.
