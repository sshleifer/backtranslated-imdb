I am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this film! Jack Frost was my introduction to movies produced and distributed by A-pic entertainment, and without exception, all that this company deals with is pure shit! First, and this is very important, never watch this movie soberly! Why would you? Unlike many other fun bad films, the one I feel was deliberately bad. I just can not figure out how the fake snowman, which is why he is always shown only briefly, the way he moves is the best! This film is Vaaaaaaaaaaaai better than Michael Keaton, a piece of shit, becuz that is made too good movie, and this version is bad as this one.
