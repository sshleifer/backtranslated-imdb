This movie sounded as if it was fun and interesting from the description. But for me it was a little lowered. It's very slow and difficult to follow and see what's happening. It seemed as if the director took individual pieces of the film and threw them into the air and put them together, regardless of the way they landed (definitely not in a series). Also, none of the consequences were recorded. I watched several different Korean films and I noticed that a good part is well made and requires some reflection on the work of the viewer, which differs from the typical Hollywood film. But this one confused me to the end. I watched the film the second and the third time and did not do anything for me. I still do not understand what the director tried to convey. To just show the typical world part of a person's life, I suppose he succeeded. But I asked for more. Needless to say, I can not recommend this film to anyone.
