Ricci's first two films were a lively, stylish party. Here, he attacks two recent classics? 'Ordinary Suspect' and 'Club of Fighters' ?? and still comes out empty-handed. Despite being repeated as a mystery (with sub-'Observe suspects'), "the greatest killer he ever pulled out was to convince you that you are" or whatever it was ... ) and an attempt to reverse the "Fight Club" about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations, the film struggles to retain interest in its other half. In the last third, you know that you are descending through a dead end, and it's boring slowly. Loopholes, chess, and game theory are all great subjects, but Ritchie goes too far on them and too many repeat to use the material. The only thing that keeps the movie (almost) visible is Ritchie's bold way with the scene and the dynamic camera Maurice-Jones. If Ritchie was keeping a satisfactory plan and subjected to more rigorous installation, there is no reason not to make another gangster pleasure. As such, the Revolver is a waste of time. Intolerance is not equal to the depth. If you want to see a great movie that does not have a logical meaning, but it makes it virtue (and, incidentally, which includes unexplained escape from the female), see 'Lost Highvai'.
