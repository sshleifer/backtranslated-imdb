This film has some fatal flaws in it, as someone could walk through the open back door of a highly secure medical institution incredible. Then this same person just goes to the object and enters the doctor's office, it's just bad writing or bad editing. A very highly predictable film. I'm not sure how this film was shot, except that it was filmed in Canada, and it's probably got a government grant. I must say that the person who played Aaron, Cori Monteith, did a good job. Unless you really are bored and there is nothing else to watch on television, then I'd say it will kill for some time, but otherwise, it's a movie that no actor would want on his resume.
