Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon is about a journalist who travels into a madman to write about the new technique he uses with his patients. However, the reporter soon learns that things are not what they look like, and asylum is run by patients, and doctors are in cages. First of all, some parts of the film are just boring and only make you fall asleep, and the interesting parts are interesting for the wrong reasons (a guy who thinks that chicken is, for example). I must admit that the story is actually quite good, but the film itself is bombarded. Music of the movie is really weird and like something you would hear in a crazy comedy, and yes, there's a scene that includes dancing chicken people, which pretty much led me to turn off the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! Estimated: R for violence and nudity.
