Vov. I thought this may have been unsuccessful, but it was even worse than I imagined! Sometimes I like to watch a good "auto-crash" movie: one that's so bad you can not look aside, because you want to see how bad it can get. This is really the only reason I could leave television - a morbid fascination. It was not that much acting, which was just central or somewhat worse than you would expect from this acting setting, but the premise and complication that you never needed to see light daylight. The scenario also causes sighing. As far as cinema is concerned, has anyone noticed that they used a curtain drain device, as in the old 50s ... but without irony? At first, I thought that jokes, but the movie is too seriously understood to have used this language. Do not even ask me about the result ... only the ultimate poem, Morcheeba. I suppose they wanted to leave people with something for $ 8 ... I'm glad to see them on TV !!!!! Just silly! I wonder if that's why Timothy Hutton recently had a problem finding a lot of work? I guess if you do not expect much, and you want to watch a mindless thriller, it would be better to spend the night on cutting nails on your feet, which is why it deserves 2.
