Screenwriter Lisa Lutz began writing a 21-year-old script in 1991. Is she even in business? If someone gave her another chance after this shit, she is for the happiest Prize of All. This film is bullshit without END. Did they make this writer move him a little bit? Seriously? I can write better shit in my sleep. OK, how many lines do I have to type? I do not understand it at all. I guess I'm a "unbeliever." I suppose I do not understand why there should be restrictions on what anyone has to say ... or odds? Seriously, I do not care if you have a sentence in one word .. or even one answer, I mean, come on? Thank you ... is this enough, finally? This film is worthless.
