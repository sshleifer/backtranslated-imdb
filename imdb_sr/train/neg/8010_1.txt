I'm very surprised by the positive comments, because the four of us saw us on one projection and we all went out. We personally thought it was painful to watch slowly and could not sit through the whole movie. And we really tried to stick with that. In particular, those in the group who really wanted to like them because of their personal experiences with the alienation of sexual orientation in the school years shown did not like or did not identify themselves. :( But, it's wonderful to see that this movie really gleamed with a lot of people here on the boards and reviewers. It's the beauty of subjective artistic film formats. :)
