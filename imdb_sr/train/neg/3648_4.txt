A couple without children (Brooke Adams, Jeff Haienga) goes to the doctor (James Karen) to try to get pregnant. It works, but Adams slowly becomes aware that something is wrong with the baby ... A pretty interesting idea is completely done by a bad letter - the basic idea is fine, but it becomes screaming predictably towards the end. I've seen every "tvist" coming. The direction is weak - there seems to be no idea how to record the basic scene. Production values ​​are - to be good - bad. Very loose. And, the upscale scenes are too embarrassing (I almost turned it off when the pregnant woman started to stab into the stomach) with poor special effects. The film completely disappears in the end when it becomes quite clear that they have no idea how to finish this movie. Make some good acting is tolerable. Adams, Haienga and Karen are good in their roles and they kept me watching, but that was because of that. This film was barely published in 1991 and is still unknown - it's easy to see why. I'm giving him 4.
