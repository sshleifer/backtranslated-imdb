What a brave fest. From all the parts of the nostalgia that Hollywood decided to recreate and update, this is by far one of the most dangerous. That was totally meaningless in the first place, and we really do not need a "modern" supplement. Regardless of the intolerance and sexism inherent in the system from the outset, so much progress made, socially, since the show led the whole point of the show (if it had ever) to be lost. NOT overweight?
