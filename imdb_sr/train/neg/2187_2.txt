I bought this movie on DVD so I could get an episode of Misteri Science Theater 3000. Luckily, Mike, Craw and Tom Servo can be watched because I did not film. Though there is a plot, a story you can follow, and a few actors who can act, there is nothing else. The film was so boring, I firmly confirmed that I will never see him again without Tom, Vrane and Mike. However, as shown above, it was better than the film that was present in the MST3K episode preceding it; Mitchell.
