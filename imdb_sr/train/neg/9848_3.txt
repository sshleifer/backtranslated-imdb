This film has some great noirish / neorealistic images, and tells a story that is refreshingly freed from the Hollywood sugar coating, which was possible only because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some of the scenes last too long (especially the wedding), and I discovered that excessive acting and unrealistic dialogue correspond more to scenes than to the silver screen. The dialogue was particularly confusing, and it seemed that the film continued to worsen. Most of the characters were either Americans from Italy or Italian immigrants who lived in New York in the 1920s and 30s, but their dialogue sounded like they were practicing lines for Shakespeare's game while mixing cement and laying bricks. I ended up laughing, not because the filmmakers wanted. I suppose that stiff poetry could defend itself by saying that the characters would speak Italian, and that the dialogue was a literal translation so that they really would speak. But it absolutely failed for me. Another line of dialogue made me laugh for another reason: the main character's son, born and raised in New York in the twenties of the twentieth century, suddenly picked up a wonderful lilting British accent. I just guess that this had something to do with the fact that the film was made in England. I give this film 'A' for effort and intent, but a much lower grade for execution.
