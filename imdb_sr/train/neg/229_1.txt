I caught yesterday at IFC, and I can not believe in positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought that these "ladies" were just? Kate says Jeda could be fired because she should be the pillar of the community, but quit for him! Then suddenly they decide they're in love? And she is so destroyed for his death, does not go to his funeral, and even less, tells his family of "good news"! Otherwise, how did the American become the head of a very real British school? Janine was to be expelled from power because of her unprofitable abuse of power, but nothing is happening! And she turns to fool the horse she's brought to the test! And the less talked about Molly, the better! As for guilt, Janina and Molly feel over Jedom, please! It's a damn mistake that he turned into murder! Where is the fault of the poor Gerald, to whom is he being vomited? If only I could do the same with the gods behind this "movie"!
