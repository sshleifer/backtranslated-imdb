Nicolas Roeg? He directed the classic supernatural thriller DON`T LOOK NEW, right? It's strange that the film was broadcast on BBC television over the weekend, and tonight it was running COLD HEAVEN without favoring what it has ever been. See that it's impossible not to compare the COLD SKY with DON`T LOOK NEW because they both have the same director and the same structure and for the first third of COLD HEAVEN I thought that they also had the same plot, except the dead husband, was replaced instead of a dead child, in fact, my mind was put on this film, which revolved around the widow widow who saw her late husband running around Venice carrying a red anorak. This does not happen, but roughly one-third of the times in the run-time has a huge plot, and despite the fact that it is a plot, it is not explained at any great depth. In fact, a little is explained in the COLD RARE that destroys the film. People referred to the rather poor production value of the COLD NEB and it's impossible not to notice them. If I did not differ, I would think that it was TVM, because it was made for a television feeling, all the way to the big big letters in the title. Roeg also tries to inject artistic pretensions through speech processes, but this does not help the movie again. You can not feel the feeling that Roeg should have put all his efforts into complications that are completely straight on the screen. Cheap production values, unmanaged direction and a really bizarre premise and scenario make for a bad movie
