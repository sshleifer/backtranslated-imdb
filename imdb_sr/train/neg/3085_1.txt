Description: Corni, totally stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and lame, it will ask you why even those unusually stupid people even spent two months or so spending a budget (I suppose this is ...) probably no more than $ 700 for this movie. It was hysterical to watch with or without the Mystery Science Theater. I give you the best advice in the world: Spare yourself, save your time, life and money, NO - I repeat, I DO NOT even think about whether you should see this movie. This film is so tattered that your face will become purple from a bitter boredom. If you have a single digit IK, then be my guest and watch this absolutely despised movie. Maybe you admire her. (As I've already said, if you have a single digit IK) With your 12 actors, a few dolls that you bought in garage sales, and of course cameras and music, i gaurentee will make you a bit more fun home video than this absolute Shit.
