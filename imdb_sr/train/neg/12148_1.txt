Honestly, who in the name of God gave the film 8.1? I guess those who created or acted in the movie were those who voted. Otherwise, this movie is bullshit! This film is nothing but an amateur, or perhaps a student film. I'm a fanatic in the movie, and I've seen terrible movies, but literally nothing was bought here. Story and acting were the worst I've ever seen. Requirements, including the use of airsoft guns with terrible special effects, where they are as bad as anything else. I'm a bad language in movies, but F-bomb is dropped about every third word and I think we could have a winner for the most use of F-bomb in any EVER movie. It seems that the film was also shot using cheap video cameras, not a real movie. I expect this to get amateur film awards shown only at public access stations across the country, but it does not belong to the DVD. Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. All I can say is that it was a terrible loss of free movie rental coupons. This is a valuable time that you will never return. Unfortunately for me, that time is lost, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, think about my warning.
