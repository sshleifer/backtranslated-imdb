Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... where to start?!? This film gives Manos - The fate of fate and war in the future race for their money as the worst movie ever made. This is fun to laugh, where Manos just looked at him painfully. Hobgoblin will end up in a time capsule somewhere as a perfect movie to describe the term: "80s Cheeze." The act (and I use this term freely) is horrible, Hobboblins are some of the worst puppets you'll ever see, and the battle for a garden tool must be seen to be believed. The movie was a perfect vehicle for MST3K, and this version is the only way to watch this mess. This film gives Mike and robots lots of ammunition to pull out some of the funniest lines they've ever made. If you try to watch this without the help of Mike and Bots ..... God help you!
