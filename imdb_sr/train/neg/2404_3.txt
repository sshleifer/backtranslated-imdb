Man, I was disappointed. 1) Adam Arkin is more malicious than Ross Geller's "Friend" 2) The great actor is lost (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita , Louis Nie) with this amateur scenario. 3) The film suffers from a terrible rhythm. He runs around in a confusing, confusing way. 4) The story does not make sense. Why wants to break the football arena? What about dumb violin music? None of this has been explained. 5) It's not even funny. It's like a bunch of accountants trying to make improvisations, saying, "Look for me! Ask me I'm funny!" This was a bad attempt to make another "Love for the first bite." I love movies Larry Cohen, but the man failed here. I could not wait for the loans to turn. Terribly disappointed.
