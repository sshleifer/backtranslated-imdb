Do not make a bone about it. There are many things in this movie. It's all cliche, not so funny, predictable, and illogical. Let's start from the beginning: signs. There's a boring, unsuccessful guy - who gave Stiller another impulse in a boring, unsuccessful belt - supposedly wild, but in reality fairly normal, a love interest - when Aniston plays well, but really did not have to do it - fat, nice friend, then a range of clich√©s: a boring stinking Australian guy, a safe Spanish guy, etc. Story: The beginning is a bit unusual, but then it enters the standard style of any movie, with every plan that can predict your average joke. The biggest problem was that the "development" of Styler's character really seemed to come from nothing - like your average school performance, the writers knew where it started and where it ended, but did not put enough stock in proper pronunciation of the middle part. Finally, the alleged "jokes" were nothing but a highly diluted version of standard humor; it was a regulated scene, sweaty fat people, etc. In conclusion, the simple fact about this movie is that learning the meaning of the word 'shart' is the only good thing. Hamburg has really split the dog here, and the sugar coating of Stiller and Aniston may have lured the spectators, but the taste that remained in the end was equally crowded. The final comment: This movie may have been horrible, but Aniston still chose a better movie between Friends and seasons than Kudrov's disgusting "Marcy X".
