This is perhaps the poorest example of an amateur propaganda ever made. Writers and producers should study German films of the 1930s and 1940s. They knew how to sell. Even the Soviet stupid leader, as a godly figure, is better done. Frustrating. The loss of faith, the return to church in the last second precisely at the time when Dad was "saved" by Hoover / God was not bad. Unfortunately, it seemed not to be melodramatic enough. A couple of foggy angel shots of angel Hoover, which were in the corner of the screen - radiate and nodded - would add a lot. The best aspect is that Hoover only saves the deserving family and children who "proved" their value. Unfortunately, the other poor homeless people are shown as cute and even good - but Hoover-God does not help them. A better approach would be to shoot ghosts to show the justice of their condition. Finally, bright and bright recovery scenes (after Hoover saved the country from depression) should have turned to the end. Then we could see how Hoover-God saved not only this deserving family, but all genuinely deserving. Amateur at best.
