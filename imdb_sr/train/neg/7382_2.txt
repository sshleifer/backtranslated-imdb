Let me say that I have always been a Steven Seagal fan and his films are usually great, but this is simply not the same. This, in my opinion, is very stupid. The biggest reason I do not like it is that it's very wrong, but it makes no sense to me. The acting is very bad, even Steven Seagal does not work well, the rest of the actors I see because they simply work on video films. She does not follow the true story, everything happens right now, so why does it make no sense. It does not have any action at all, and in order to make the action movie good, it usually takes action in it. Special effects are very bad and you can say they are fake. So, all in all, this has for the seagals the worst movie of all, so if you want to see Steven Seagal movie not rent this just pretend it does not exist. Just avoid this movie.
