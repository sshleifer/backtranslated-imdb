I believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war, to avoid idealism and to respect some rudimentary military principles. The star barely works first. The star is a Russian war film, I expected patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful poetry paintings, a lively rating, Slovenian cheekbones and cruel Germans. What I did not need was a naive love affair, unrealistic stupid war scenes and the abuse of a syrup soundtrack in a film that carefully avoided all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, Holocausts) just to end in passage, but offensive to our meaning for the history of the "liberation of Poland". Missed opportunity as a movie, but obviously not as propaganda.
