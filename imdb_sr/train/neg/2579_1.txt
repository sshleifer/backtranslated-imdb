I must say that I was a big fan of the series. The first three were great, and the others had their moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a shame because this was a great series and it just gets worse. I know they were made for DVD movies, but some efforts would be nice. No laughter, only a couple of good lines that will make a smile if it does. There are plenty of nudity and very hot chickens. But not sexy things, jokes really do not work. Add to everyone that this is a RASIST movie or as a racist movie that can be made without seeking to be called a racist. I am not one of those people who think that everything should be politically correct. But the display of minorities is very offensive. I would not waste time on this garbage. See the previous versions, they will make you laugh not to be sick.
