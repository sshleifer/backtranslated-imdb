Seriously, I'm for a romantic comedy and I'll get into Miss Congenialit easily as Goodfellas ... but this movie? It does not make any sense !!!! And I'm not even talking about the ready suspension of unbelief that makes no sense. Why does the family live in England? Or, at the very least, why there is no British accent? She is sure she is comfortable with her father and surprisingly forgave her for not being near the last two years. (On this subject, nobody ever makes much agreement that it has been so absent for so long). And what about the foolish clothes in a little girl? I will not even get into the fact that the escorts she paid falls in love with her - that could have been overcome by better filming the film. I'm just saying that the characters, the scenery and the plot are not sufficiently split to make even a slightly cohesive story. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is the consistent use of the most unreliable angles of the film on the nose Debora Messing - I would sue the filmmakers that I am on it! I mean, honestly, I am just for the women who are, but why, in the seven loyal years of seeing Villa and Grace, have I ever noticed that it is incredibly strange to her nose? Oh! Because these manufacturers are kind to her! This film, as well as my least favorite film ever, Armageddon, is to blame for filmmakers, not actors. I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better writer, director and producer. I'm just glad my friend borrowed my DVD, so I lost all my time. If there's a way to make a ZERO star look, I would do it.
