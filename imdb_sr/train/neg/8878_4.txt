Judi Hollidai won gold in 1950 with the film version of George Cukor's "Born Iesterdai", and from that moment on, her career consisted of trying to find enough good material to allow her to regain gold. Never happened. In the movie "That should happen to you" (otherwise I can not imagine the Blender title), Holliday does another variation on stupid blondes that may not be that stupid, but everything about this movie feels heated and half-hearted. Even Jack Lemon, in what I think is his first film role, can not collect enough energy to revive this recycled comedy. The audience knows that the film will end up practically from the very beginning, so it's mostly just waiting for the film to arrive. Perhaps if you are in love with Holliday you will enjoy it; otherwise I would not bother. Rating: C
