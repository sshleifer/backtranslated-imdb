I grew up watching the original Batman Animated series, and I'm a greedy collector of Batman's graphic novels. With the hero of the comic book as Batman icon, there are certain features that can not be changed. Creative freedoms are all good and good, but when they completely change their character, then it's too far. I bought one of the "The Batman" season in the hope that an additional bonus will be able to highlight the creator's reasons for this shov to be such a beast. In an interview on the film Batman, one of the artists or writers (I'm not sure) said: "We felt we should not hang out with Batman, but we can mix with the villains." And so they continued to turn the Joker into an unrelated little kid who begged for attention, Penguin in an anime, g. Freezes in a super-thief gem. Bob Kane turned to the grave. To sum up everything: I wish I had more hands to show this show FOUR THUMBS DOVN. It squeezes my score with 2 out of 10 simply because it uses Batman's name. Varner Bros. ... think about this! Please!
