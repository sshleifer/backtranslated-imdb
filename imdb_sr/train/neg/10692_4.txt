Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered a loss when she went to Italy, tired of Hollywood glamor treatment. She first suffered from the torture of a volcanic island in STROMBOLI, an artistic failure that would kill the career of a less resistant actress. And now EUROPA 51, another strenuous exercise in wet feelings. Neither this story does much to Aleksandra Knok, in yet another ungrateful role of her suffering and trying to comfort her after suicidal death. their son. At least this has better production values ​​and a more coherent scenario than STROMBOLY. Bergman is still attractive, but moves towards a matronical look as a woman of a rich society. She could never cope with the sudden loss of her son, despite the efforts of a kind male friend. "Sometimes I think I'm leaving the mind," she says to her husband. A significant statement in a movie that is completely without humor or grace, but it gives us a sense of where the story unfolds. Bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post-war Rome, but being a social worker with poor children does not improve her emotional health and hence the action worsens up. The overall effect of the movie is that it's not interesting enough to make a major star project like Bergman. The film loses its pace at half the story until Bergman gets more and more upset, and her husband doubts that he is being pushed twice. The story goes downhill, after she nurses a street walker through her terminal illness. The last string of complications is that her husband should put her in psychiatric asylum. Ingrid nobly suffers through all this (by compensating for the loss of a son), but it does not benefit. Not one of her best movements, mildly speaking. Note: If she wanted neo-realism with mental illness, she might be better off accepting the leading role in SNAKE PIT when she was offered. her director Anatol Litvak !! It would do more for her career than EUROPA 51. In short: Another gloomy sensuality of Rossellini and Bergman.
