Gee, what a shame this was! I can not understand what people find so terrible about Grudge. The director plays one trick (I must admit very good, which is revived very stylized) and then repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again. As a consequence, I was scared several times in the first quarter of the film, but when I knew the exercise, I practically fell asleep while Grudge was more and more predictable in minutes. To conclude, I can say that there are many better movies in the genre to begin, that the so-called predecessor "Ring" was much more terrible and that the purchase of the "Grudge" card was a waste of money.
