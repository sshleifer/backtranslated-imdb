She now moved to Northwestern America to start scratching, but her child still has a problem in her dedicated to her mother. In fact, it is so dedicated to killing anyone who could be seen as a threat to their relationship. Unfortunately, Mandi Schaeffer (like a daughter) kills more than people - delivers such a terrible performance that she also erases. from the film, although incoherent script, useless direction and disturbing music (check the saxophone when it first shows bikini clothes) do not help anyone; We need to find her sexy and scary, but she does not succeed in both cases. Almost totally unpleasant and not bad enough to be fun (not to mention the fact that Arkuette and Schaeffer do not really convince mother and daughter), they will all sympathize with Miss Arkuette and Jurgen Prochnov. This, and both (especially Rosanna) are the only healthy reasons that everyone can sit through this farrago. One of the production houses is called Kualiti International Films - not three hours of "love". , "Lies And Murder" (from two short productions), whether there is a credit "You have to joke".
