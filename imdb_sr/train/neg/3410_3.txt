Yes, this film has children going to the space camp and it starts well enough because children meet and learn ropes. Then they introduce Jinka, a robot that could not exist in 1986, because now they have nothing to do with this kind of artificial intelligence. Kid becomes a friend with a robot, and the robot returns the child's kindness by shooting him and a group of other children in this camp in an outer space with a very limited amount of oxygen and radio devices that have no signal to reach the universe. And this camp is not really fun because these kids are preparing for a real training, and the instructors overcome them because of an unsuccessful mission or not doing the right things. Relax, they're here for entertainment, not becoming astronauts, just give them the experience of a space flight, not a military camp. However, you can see Joakuin Phoenik in a pretty early role. So in the end, the movie that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinka and other factors that you could have, did the children fight with space aliens on top of everything that happened in a movie like it would be a movie to me a little more comfortable. Probably for a few others, who would still like to see Kate Capshaw's face destroyed by some strange super-strange creature.
