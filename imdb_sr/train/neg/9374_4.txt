This documentary is at its best when simply showing the offices of Ayurvedic healers and preparing for treatment. There is no denial of poverty in India and the despair of even their wealthy clients. However, as an argument for Ayurvedic medicine in general, this film has broken down. Although Indian clients mention they have "aleopathic" doctors, those doctors have not been interviewed, and we need to take unclear statements by their patients at a nominal value-- "the doctor said there was no drug," "the doctor said that cancer", etc., Well, "without medication" does not mean "no treatment", and what kind of cancer does the patient have? The film is the weakest when it shows Ayurvedic practice in America. This is obviously a stunning suggestion that possession of Vall Stretch can lead to stomach pain.
