Why do all Lifetime movies have such anemic titles? "Unexpected love" - ​​ooh, how provocative !! "I know a lot" would be better. The film is nothing special. Real people do not speak just as these characters do, and the situations are really exhausted. A flat woman who "turns" a lesbian looked more like a lesbian figure. If you want to watch two hot women kissing in a very discreet way, you can enjoy this. Although it seems that he was written by someone who does not really go out into the world to watch people. Why am I wasting time writing about it?
