If you've ever seen this movie, you'll know it is! If you are not, and want to see the classic BAD movie, I suggest you look at this movie, because it ranks with the worst. So, if you're really bored, go rent. If you want to know how it is, here's my little summary: Adam Sandler is committed to working on a huge ship with some MS Universe models and five other people. Adam does not like one traveler getting all the babies, and trying to take on a job with joking jokes. But wait! It only gets worse! You'll have to rent a movie yourself to see how badly it really is.
