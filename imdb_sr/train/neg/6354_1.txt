Voody Allen has lost the ability to write dialogues or characters that clearly distinguish one from the other. This is the case with Melinda and Melinda, where all the characters speak with Allen's generic pseudo-sophistication and have problems and points of view that can not be linked to anyone outside the radius of four blocks where Allen lives. They also share the same strange situation that they can afford multi-million dollar apartments in Manhattan, which seem to have been designed by professional decorators regardless of their financial situation or what they are doing for life. The only character that exists beyond this boring mind is Vill Ferrel as a mandatory Voody Allen surrogate. Although he does not delight himself as if he only does Voodoo Allen's impression (like Kenneth Branagh in the celebrity "Celebrity"), Ferrel does not have the charm or charisma that Voody had when he played the role in his best films. The final result is another in a series of self-inflicted bores of the once-great filmmaker who has traded for years with his former reputation.
