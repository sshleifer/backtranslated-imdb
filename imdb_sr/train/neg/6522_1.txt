This is not a commentary on the actual film, but on the RUSCICO DVD for North America. I do not know if there were different editions and updates, but the discs we rented had copyrights on them 2000, if that meant something. In any case, the mixing of sound on these DVDs was terrible. Levels that are often io-io-ed up-down; when the scene crossed the panorama on the battlefield, the orchestral band would shout so loud that I did not know what would blow first - my drum membrane or my speakers. When the time for dialogue came, the volume would usually fall to something barely audible. Occasionally, the orchestra and Foley-Vork would remain loud until the dialogue was set to a much lower level. My wife and I discovered that the only way to watch this movie from these DVDs was that one of us was holding a hand on the remote control to continually modulate the volume. And, as another user has already commented on, when we selected English audio, the dialogue continued to switch between Russian and English; and occasionally when the characters spoke in French on the original track, the synchronization was in Russian, so you are SOL if you do not understand. In the end, we gave up watching after the first disc. Before you deduct $ 50 + for this movie on a DVD for your own library, I would recommend from your heart to get a copy for renting to see if you really can enjoy this epic movie when you are burdened with such a bad sound, especially if you never Read the book and really want to understand the story.
