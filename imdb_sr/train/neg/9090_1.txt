Propaganda film for the Palestinian "cause". If you were expecting an impartial documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you will have to look elsewhere. If you are an antisemite (or just an anti-Zionist, there is nothing wrong with advocating the destruction of the country, right?) Or uncritically supporting Palestinian targets (eg Mass killings, the destruction of Israel) is a documentary for you. It should be a fun evening at universities all over the UK and the US. However, any informative and intellectually honest person would be outraged by the large number of lies shown in this video. I just hope that those who are not really aware of the situation are not ruined by this anti-Semitic dirt.
