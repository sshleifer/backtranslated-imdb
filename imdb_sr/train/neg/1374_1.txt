Man, this was hilarious. It should be under COMEDY. Or STUPID. It would seem that it's much easier to figure out which is a bunch of stink. Seriously? I want everyone who is connected with this film to undergo the current effect. For all who are thinking about watching this "movie", let's move on to several plots. Check. They are gone. Literally there is no complication. I think Casper Van Dien was bored, and he decided to record something with some random thing, and, miraculously, he somehow came to the video tape. This film is literally the worst film of all time. You do not believe me? Go look. Do it, man. Challenge. But be ready to dig your eyes. If you can go through this without blowing the cows, you are very strong and brave.
