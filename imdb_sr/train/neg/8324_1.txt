First of all, big actors need money ... Surgical scenes were funny ... and they must surely know that people with little knowledge of medicine will be completely absurd to understand this ... Anesthesiologists do not leave the room during heart transplantation. .. they do not do surgery in a small room without instruments, heart lung equipment and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... I can not concentrate on the story because of all stupid operational scenes ... without blood, no staff, and then a hero's doctor comes and takes over ... it's not a movie for adult thinking ... Also, the budget is a must be limited ... street scenes were fine, but when he was a technical advisor ... looks like a complete idiot directed ... Save your money and wait until the DVD and not rent it.
