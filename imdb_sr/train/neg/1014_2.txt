Timberlake's version almost certainly attacked the screen. Not everything was bad, I think the reporter's role was wrong for him. LL Cool J played the typical role of rapper, the toughest and worst boy. I do not think that the smile was broken in the whole film, even when it was suggested to his girlfriend. Morgan Freeman was mostly wearing the entire movie. He had some funny scenes that are the highlight of the movie. Kevin Spacei was not good or bad that he was just "out there". All in all, it's boring. Movie. bad plot. a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for the actors.
