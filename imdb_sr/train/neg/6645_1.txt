This guy has no idea about the movie. Okay, it seems that he made several interesting theater plays in his youth and about two acceptable films that had more success for political reasons, because they cheated on communist censorship. All this is very good, but carefully look at it: DOES NOT KNOW THE JOB! The scenes are unbalanced, without proper start, and with unordered content and full emptiness. He has nothing to say about the subject, so he overlapped with violence, nudity and the language of the gutter. How is it possible to maintain such a corrupt corpse that has never realized anything about cinema profession and art? Why do not you let him succumb?
