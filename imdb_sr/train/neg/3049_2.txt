Why such a generic name? Santa Claus??? So pale and unpredictable. Films that have previously tried to capture the festive spirit, and in particular "Santa Claus is winning the Martians", at least it was fun to watch because it was, and all the recordings used ... for some reason seemed to me happy. But this film only casts Christmas into the ass and turns the joy of all children. Santa living in space? His enemy is a devil named Pitch? Santa Claus receives help from Merlin Magician? How is this accidental? Well, since it was made in Mexico, some of you might understand the way in which the film was filmed. I had to admit that some of the effects were just wobbling at that time. It was a total group of insanity! Although, despite all the problems with the film, she still feels like a Christmas movie. Good is winning the evil, and Christmas is still playing part of our hearts of every good girl or boy in the world, or perhaps the universe, thanks to Santa Claus who captures the Martians .. obviously. So, I think you should try, even if it's one of the worst movies for the rest of all time ... although you should put a smile on your face every day.
