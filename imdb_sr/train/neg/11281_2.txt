I gave this movie an elevated 2-star rating because it personally appeared in minutes 42 and 43 of the ... movie on the side of the road in Russia. In this scene, the film director offered me an immortal line - "50 dollars ... you drink and talk", but I felt that my Polish colleague could speak with a more convincing Russian accent than I could, so I refused to take this talk about work. I was a bit old because this was my first film experience ... and who knows ... these lines could end up there with lines like "I'll be back" and "Totally honest my dear, I do not care me ". If I had spoken that line, my name would appear in the attachments of Rancid Aluminum as "Heavi 1" instead of Riszard Jankovsky. As time passes, I find myself happy that my name does not in any way associate with this film. Although I spent all day on the set, South Vales hot spot Barri Island, nobody could tell me what the real story is. The caterers and the lady of the wardrobe have agreed that it seems to have a lot of cursing and nudity ... things could certainly have been worse if I ended up naked in these horrible movies .... br /> Still ..... On the positive side .... In one interruption I talked to Rhis Ifans. I had no idea who he was, because Notting Hill had yet to be released, and not that he was Welsh. He made various inappropriate comments on what the terrible Barri Island cave has become since my childhood visit in the '70s and' 80s. Only when Keith Allen appeared, I realized that I am in quality production ........
