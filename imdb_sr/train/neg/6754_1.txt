The only reason I'm trying to comment on this movie is to save you 97 minutes of your life, and maybe your money. I took a chance. Within a few minutes of the inclusion I realized that I made a mistake. The entire video should be stored until winter, and then thrown to the nearest fire, where they could encounter more than their own. Unfortunately, this was supposed to be done before it made this garbage. Avoid this movie, if you see it in the shops and escape.
