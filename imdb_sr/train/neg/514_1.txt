This is one of the most interesting films ever made! It's almost like everyone involved in this project did not even try to make an attractive movie. This is nothing but a continuation of the tedious series of films that are trying to cash out the success of Smokey and Bandit, which I think is the best film of all of them. As for this scattering of film stocks, Burt Reinolds goes through the whole film, Jim Nabors is lost, other actors are not given much work, car racing is obviously filmed, humor is not inspired, and many scenes are boring and lifeless than they are staring at the wall two o'clock. "Stroker Ace" is simply a redundant film that has nothing unique or characteristic about it.
