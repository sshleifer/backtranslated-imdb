After the success of Part 4, the second sequel was a natural move. However, they should stop it before it started. Alice, who survived the fourth part, found pregnancy and Freddie seems to use her unborn child to come to her victims, which are of course Alisa's friends. A strange movie about the nightmare, very heavy on religious images and bad acting. Special effects are good, but the film itself is not.
