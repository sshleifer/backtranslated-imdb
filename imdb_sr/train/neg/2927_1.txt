Somewhere, there, there must be a list of all the worst gai movies of all time. Those who have longer camera shots of stars sitting and imaginatively staring at the universe, or those where they are unbearably focus on cat cat eating spaghetti. This picture of disease is the story of a boy and boy and they live and love and swim and stumble in caves, and one of them has a mother in depression, and the other does not have a mother and they talk, walk and swim, have sex and get drunk and then he breaks up and somebody goes to the hospital for eight days, then goes out, and there's a lot of quick rewinding forwards and backwards and has long imaginative shots of one of them looking into the universe or just sitting and doing nothing. I think that this is some kind of gymnastic technique of filming a movie or that the film is so bad that it must be filled with long, lost records, otherwise it would take about 14 minutes to rely on a story or story. Do not misunderstand me, this is about the 30th gay movie I've been watching over the past 6 months, and some of them (most of them) have been very formative, predictable and boring, but this is really a terrible loss. The best has now been " Beautiful Thing ". So, I watched this and after the first opening of the clip, which I kept and kept, I thought, "Oh, no, it will be a creative sonic moss." But I gave her a chance. and I watched it, and then when it was over, I threw the DVD into the trash, I apologize for not liking it and if it was, I'm sorry if I offend you.
