The premise, although not quite ridiculous, was definitely ridiculous. What should happen to the second meeting with Tritter was that Tritter simply lost. House hires some guy and de-physicalizes Tritter. In real life, Tritter would be recalled for harassment, episodes of a rectal thermometer would be exposed in court, which would give them a motive and opportunity, and lawyer hospitals would make minced meat from Tritter and a special department for which he worked. He would be in prison like anybody who was involved in harassing his house, Chase, Foreman, Cameron, Wilson and Cuddy. The lawsuit would bring House a delicious settlement, enough to supply it with Vicadin until his age. While Tritter would ride a taxi somewhere, trying to rehabilitate working well for people for two years before people fell to the fact that they had seen it all before.
