This film was basically Velvet Goldmine, if the five authors had entertained him and did so. Movie. The film lacks what Velvet Goldmine had to do with the good acting, writing, and in fact everything else. The film had some of the worst letters I've seen from Wild West West. It definitely should have been interesting. I know that vh 1 has become a host for his music shows. which are much better than all that would have been after the music episode, but it did not feel right on the face.
