I do not want to spend a lot of time on this, because, as far as I'm concerned, it's not really a movie to start, just a mishmish mish-mash of borrowed shots and an unpleasant amateur new shot made exclusively for the purpose of messing up the whole mess and calling it a sequel "Boogeiman ". Literally, 80% of this film was stolen from his superior predecessor, Boogeiman, a film that the writers of this garbage apparently did not even see because they could not even get the name of the original character Suzana Ljubavna (Laci) is that so. And in order to add insult to injury, the killer is invisible in the original footage and visible in the new footage, it seems to think that their audience is as stupid as they are. 0 out of 10 and I want IMDb's rating system to be such a low, most generous and obvious attempt to undo the human money I even saw, WARNING!
