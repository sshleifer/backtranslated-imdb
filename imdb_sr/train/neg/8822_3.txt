Depending on your personal state of mind, when you look at this, "Christmas Evil" can turn out to become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller, OR one of the most pathetic and least protected chronic sweets ever made. Personally, I am tempted to opt for this other, because I did not try to do any research at all, and I simply expected a cheesy and undemanding wound in the early 80's in the costume of the People of Santa Claus. Wrong! The film actually talks about a guy named Harry Stadling; who is obsessed with Christmas, works at the garbage plant and thinks his responsibility is to determine on Christmas Eve who deserves gifts and who deserves the punishment. Harry's questions began when Santa's witness was witness? His dad in the costume obviously ?? caressing the bare feet of his mother in a mild young age. After that, he developed into a social exile, much to the irritation of his younger brother, who is bound to break one day. I fully understand why some fans value this somewhat eccentric horror movie, but did it really have to be so boring? There are several long and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens. I can forgive the short duration of bloodyness and the unheard of bloodshed, but this film does not even enjoy a disturbing atmosphere or unexpectedly demental complications (with the exception of the finale, I must admit). Likewise, I would understand the concept more seriously if a crazy protagonist would focus on the fatal punishment of naughty children! He does not kill and exclusively kills adults who behave badly. How should you seriously grasp the rebellious and original Christmas thriller when Santa does not commit any poor child? It would make "Christmas Evil" a classic, but now it's just an unforgettable and poor piece of garbage.
