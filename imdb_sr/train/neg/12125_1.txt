Why do people who do not know what kind of time in the past were like to feel the need to try to define that time for others? Replace Voodstock with the Civil War and Apollo's landing on the moon by immersing Titanic and you have a realistic movie like this formulaic soap opera inhabited solely by waste. Is that what kids are too young to be allowed to go to Voodstock and who have not finished school? "I'll show these old houses, I'll bring out my movie and prove that you do not need to know about your topic still making money!" Yes, we already know that. One thing that was watching this movie was for me to take a little insight into thinking below the class. The next time I see a whore in a bar that looks like Diane Lane, I run to the other side. It is child abuse that parents who are not worth raising children. It's an abuse of the audience to simply wrap Voodstock and moonlight into a movie as if ipso facto meant film portrait in 1969.
