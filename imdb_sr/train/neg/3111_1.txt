I would rate this film minus 10, but unfortunately it was not offered. Why did not I go in the first five minutes of this movie I can not say. I should have gone with my instinct and I immediately left! A few people in our theater did it, and unfortunately I did not follow them. NO plot. Terrible acting! Even Robin Villiams was so disappointing that I might never see another movie in which he is. I like the tazer scene. Too bad that it did not shock the flesh in the senselessness of the plot. Someone has to insert the writer and director of this movie!
