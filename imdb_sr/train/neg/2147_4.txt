Original is a relaxing watch, with some really unforgettable animated sequences. Unfortunately, the sequel, although not the worst DTV-extensions, is completely lacking in the spark. The biggest disappointment is the lack of a story. Like Belle's Magical War, the characters are told through a series of vignettes. The magical world, though slightly better, nevertheless manages to make a mess in the story. Between the vignette, we see mice at work, and I personally think that the antiques of Jaka and Gus are the redeeming merits of this film. The first vignette is the best, about how Cinderella is used to being a princess. This is best, because here the mice were the funniest. The worst vignette, when Jak turns into a man, is sometimes cute, but has a lack of imagination. The last sweet vignette, when Anastasia fell in love, was sweet. The problem was that I could not imagine that Anastasia was friendly to Cinderella, as I considered it more mean than a half-sister. This was also astonished by the rather funny background of Lucifer who falls in love with PomPom. Random music was very pleasant for listening, but I hated songs, they were really uninspired and nothing like beautiful Tchaikovsky inspired the originals' melodies. The characters were the strongest development here. Cinderella, while still worried, lost sincerity and much of her charm from the original, even though she wears very nice clothes. Duke had some really funny moments, but they were not enough to save the film, as well as Prudence and the King. As I mentioned, the mice were redeeming the merits of the film, because they only contributed to the film. I must say that animation is colorful and above average, and the voice acting was surprisingly good. story. 4/10 for mice, acting, animation and some nice dresses. Bethani Coke
