This film has begun a very promising story about a director who loses sight and a blind woman who needs help. However, somewhere in the middle it seemed that script writers did not know where to go. One incredible event followed next (Russia must be very small because everyone is hitting one another). all the time), the motivation of a female leading character is understandable (why is it still followed after they left the ship? Why not try to borrow a mobile phone on a boat to invite someone?) were completely funny (was the story with the mother and the boy supposed to be funny? And what was the story with a younger sister?). Nevertheless, with all this arrogance, arbitrariness complicated, the film managed to be completely predictable. The harshest thing is that there were many potentials. As I said, the idea of ​​a movie was good, the characters and the scores were very nice and the actors were good. So, this could have been a good movie ... but it did not.
