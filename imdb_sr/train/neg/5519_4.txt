Okay, so the reviews for this movie just tell you that a rebellious young girl goes to live with her grandmother in the summer to correct her. This is not really the case! It's about a young, rebellious 17-year-old girl who reveals a secret and on her mother to believe if she's telling the truth or not. To be honest, I really enjoyed the concept of this movie. They had a really good plot and a really good theme of love / hate between mother and daughter. However, I did not enjoy watching the acting Lindsay Lohan. In reality, this movie would be GREAT if it had some other, perhaps better actresses. Charlie Rachel (Lohan) is a very sexually aggressive person and reminds us a little about the true Lindsay, so she takes away a lot from the movie. Still, I think if you put Lindsay aside, you will enjoy this movie. The place is pretty big (and sad).
