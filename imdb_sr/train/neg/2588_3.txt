Band Camp was terrible, The Naked Mile was a bit better, and this third on the DVD in the American Pie franchise looks just like the predecessor. Basically, Erik Stifler (John Vhite) separated from his girlfriend after losing his virginity, and now he and Mike 'Cooze' Coozeman (Jake Siegel) join Erik's cousin Steve Tallei in college. With the promise of many parties, plenty of alcohol and enough hot chickens in the Beta home, they only have fifty tasks listed on the list to become official privileged members. But the threat appears in the rival, GEK ("Geek") house, led by the hungry dumbbell (and sheep) Edgar (Tirone Savage) who offers bigger and better than what Beta has. To be resolved once, Beta and Gek enter the battle with forbidden for forty years Greek games to fight each other, and the loser is moving out. The last champion in the games, Noah Levenstein (the only regular Eugene Levi) is the leader of the show, who sees people taking off his brassiere, a gladiator duel floating on water, catches a frozen pig, a Russian roulette in his mouth with cartridges an old horse husband, a woman who was wearing and drinking a full alcohol drink (with vomiting, not disqualification). Everything comes to a sudden death, with a guy who is engaged in dancing a stripper, and they have to resist cumming, Beta House wins when Edgar finishes with a girl dressed like a sheep in his lap. Also played by Flopberin Christopher McDonald as Mr. Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashlei, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac as Bobbi, Christine Barger as Margie, Italia Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Pover as Denise, Andreja Punkris as Staci and Jordan Prentice as Rock. The amount of nudity is slightly increased, as did the roughness of the joke, and I could have assumed that it was rated as one star of five, but I like it. Adequately!
