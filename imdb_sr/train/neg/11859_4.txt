Well, it's better to plan to go through this amateur, gentle and flickr flickr about a middle-aged widow who has a little more in common with her young adult or an old teenager than she likes. Set in Tunisia, Mom is chatting about the apartment, gets ants, and decides, although reluctant (can not help himself), to costume and dance in a local cabaret. In the meantime, her daughter takes dance classes. The common denominator is a Tunisian drummer. This film is full of filling. I watched the DVD on the floor and read the subtitles, quickly forwarded through a lot of plain dance and short walks (they walked everywhere) and more walking and walking on the k4 just to get to this boring, insignificant, low-budget movie that somewhat attracted some pretty good critical praise. Imagine. (C-)
