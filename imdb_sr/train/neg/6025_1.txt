Left Behind is a kind of "we know what we know because we know" a film that Christians (and most of any naive person) need to help them feel like they "think" and "believe" (not "know"). right. But, at the same time, I feel bad for little guys, because this is not a well-made movie. This does not help ANY message. I work in a video, and I KNOW ONE reason why people went to see this movie because they were religious and thought it was. ANYONE in this country who thinks they know what will happen in the future is wrong, unless they think they know they do not know. I had enough (but only after I had too many) those people who are walking their nose in the air thinking that the film that plays a semi-talented TV actor means something above me. <br /> <br> Please, if you love yourself, you will stay away. I refuse to go into the details of this film (not because AI did not see it (because I did), B-it was too shocking for my atheist-self-management (because that was not), or CI really does not have anything to say bad about The reason ((no one who helped this film understand) is that I want to get this film out of my head, I want it made of my head, I want to watch ALL THIS WITH OPENED Mind from the head, I want a message that Kirk so proudly and coaching me at the end of the film from my head. IN MY HEAD BEFORE watching these films there, I'm sorry that someone in this world went to the theater to see this film about what might happen in the future (but will not) when they are they could give Seven Dollars Plus to any number of people, animals, or rainforests, so that they would not be able to "believe" in the fact that it was real, that they might have what it was LEFT BEHIND ZERO (outside ****)
