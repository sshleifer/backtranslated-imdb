Miss. The film was not good. It's humor that five-year-olds will not even laugh. I mean, of course, some parts were fun, but most of them did not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer) and should work on better movies. The film should be broadcast as the original Disney Channel movie, it's FREE. Nothing like a soundtrack remake the rock that will beautify your day. These songs are so good. Especially Alison and Amanda at Valking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter's, Beach Boi song, Fun Fun Fun. Movie. It's not worth your money, but it's a sound recording.
