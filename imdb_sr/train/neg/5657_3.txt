I am a big fan of Lon Chaney, but the screenplay of this movie simply failed me. The story jumps unusually (since I learned that the movie is missing part), and the characters appear and disappear with an irritating surprise. Some of the interlaces are too explainable (for example, "Why, you're no longer a child!" - shorten the image of a long, slow rhythm - "you are a woman!" Yes, we got it for the first time) but there are several sequences that speak for explanations that are never they do not appear. (Let's hear Luigi and his girlfriend's argument, please!) The act, which includes incestuous desires (figuratively, if not technically), disturbed it to the point that it was difficult to watch. According to the author, this issue has been treated as a problem, and the match between May and December has not been shown as the real and inescapable of some Mari Pickford movies (for example, "Daddi-Long-Legs"). Chanei gives a good performance, as usual, but I think he was better focused in the past - he has gone over several times here, IMHO. I enjoyed clowning sequences, and I was very impressed on the cascades. Loretta Young was charming, though stunningly young. The film has its moments, but for now it's my favorite Chanei picture.
