Miscasting is happening. Susannah Iorkke is a great young Jane Eire, and her performance is flawless. However, Edward Rochester should be 35 years old. Belokosi George C. Scott looks and behaves like arthritis. He squeals and whistles, disgusting and dark. He looks like a killer with an ax who sent his ax to harden; We are not surprised to keep a woman in prison! A great love story looks like a sado-masochistic nightmare. The novel has enough darkness, but Bronte's Rochester is relatively young, athletic, powerful and charming when he wants it. He has a good voice and voice, a good mind and conscience tries to quit unsuccessfully.
