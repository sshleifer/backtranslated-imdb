Personally I think this show seems pretty cheap. Some of the actors are terrible. They do too much and they look fake. I can always say that it will end in the first 10 minutes or less, because they make it so transparent. It's not well written either. I like to watch him laugh. You know the saying: "It's so bad that it's okay?" Well, this saying applies to this show. I also like to watch to see if I am right when I assume that all this will end. So far I've been right every time. It's like a little game I play. It's nice when you're bored and you feel like laughing at something.
