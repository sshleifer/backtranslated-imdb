I did not expect much from this film, but the boy, I did not expect the movie to be so bad. Chris Rock does not show the good work here, you can not get the feeling that his character is real, I think the movie would be a bit better if it's a drama or a romantic scene less of a movie and more / better humor was involved. The movie is as if the filmmakers had a bad hangover. In "making" they do not show any smile. This is a very bad movie! I gave her three out of ten for a few smiles he gave me, but I never laughed!
