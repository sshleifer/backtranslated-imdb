he had some nice poetic pieces, but he was actually only an artistic-farty throw-together without direction or resolution. how do these people go through the film school? Who gives them money to make this shit? it could have been a lot more, a fine major actor, and I always love Fairuza Balk, but come on, alt-rock metaphor only staring can not find anything tempting is just so tired, and that certainly does not do for good t movies. the director should go and live long and not return to the camera until there is really nothing to say. This is like a school of artistic creation of spaghetti-on-wall, but confronting a bunch of sincere paintings and I hope that hope of hope as hell in poetry appears. It can work if the director really has any vision, or has a brain that knows when it is in the presence of potential, but here is just a place to fill, without consequences. I felt lazy in the upcoming moments before it hit, and I shouted "lazy bastard" on the screen when the credits appeared.
