I just do not understand the great spaces of this episode - that Miranda is so extraordinary, and that there is something so ugly that makes you crazy. Somebody here said it might be a frequency of light waves or something more than ugly. Miranda is just a jerk. This episode is slow, inconsistent and too loud. I also do not understand why Colosseur is ambassador - why does the Federation not leave the damn Medusa? There is one part that I like when Kolos speaks through Spock about the loneliness of human experience. All in all, I love TOS and even the weakest, I'll always get involved. This episode - mmm, I would not buy it except for a used copy below $ 3.
