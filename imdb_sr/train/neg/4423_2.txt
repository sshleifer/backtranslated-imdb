Another of the many almost forgotten films that came out of the ranks of the thirties of the last century, who survived the magic of DVD. the twins who participated in the racketeering of the murder. One kills the victims (brokers involved in the scam) and asks the witnesses for the exact time, while the other is deaf and proven "innocent" because he could not talk to the witnesses. Naturally, where it decayed whether it was a congenital deafness, would not both be deaf? Oh well. Atvill works here pretty good job, acting deaf. Unfortunately, nobody here really can be worth it.
