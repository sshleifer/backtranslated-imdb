My name is Modesty is a low budget film that tells the story of the origin of Modesta Blaise. It's not that the movie is horrible, it's not what I expected or hoped for. Although I have been aware of the character of Modesty Blaise for years, I am not too familiar with comics or graphic novels, so I come to this film as something like an outsider. That may be the reason for my disappointment. I expected more action and more comedy. The film was led by dialogue. I guess I was looking for something with a little more campers value. As it is, My name is Modesty is a deadly serious movie. There are very few, if any, "light" moments. The act, at least from Alekandre Staden, is acceptable, but nothing special. As others commented, it seems to be too fragile to be completely convincing in the title role. What action scenes exist in My name is Modesty are one of the weakest films. I never bought an idea that this woman could handle a group of trained murderers. I really hope Kuentin Tarantino will make progress and make rumors with a huge budget film based on the character of Blaise Modesty. I am convinced that the concept has a lot of potential and I would be very pleased with this.
