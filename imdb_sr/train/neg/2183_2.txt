This film was very bad if you take it as a science fiction movie, as a horror or even as a comedy. The whole thing is funny. The film looks (and is) definitely inexpensive, the actors have no idea what the acting is, and the script clearly shows that it was shot with the recording. Obviously, the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary at all - it was even beautiful - and they thought they needed something more impressive; and they have failed (make-up is terrible even for the late 50's, quite fun). The film clearly shows why the career of director Joseph Greene as such and as a writer never came true; He was very bad in both of them. The same applies to actors who lead and support. Best Achievement "A Brain That Would Not Die" is its short duration.
