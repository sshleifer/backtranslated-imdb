This series is interesting to watch as a function of MST3K, but for today's audiences it's all. I was really surprised when I saw the year that was made in 1952. Considering the fact that this is the very fact, in my book it is solid (low?). Cars used do not look modern, look like things from the 30's. This is essentially Cody (salvation of a lonely world? Sheesh speaks of insults to all others, such as the army), in any case it is Codi in her ring nipple costume against Graber and Dalea two stupid ones who deal with pistols and casual pistols. Pretty poor by yourself, enjoy it. If you want to watch a really good series, see Flash Gordan, full of missiles that are attacking each other and good evil enemy, like a good woman, it does not have any of that. And Flash was made 15 or so years before this shit so you can relax it a bit. Something done in 1952, this bad, deserves 2. Nuff said. Give him 6 if you watch him as an episode of MST3K, these guys are having a good time with her; setting warts here, setting up there and I fly! And now, as an additional bonus, I bring you the song "Commander Codi Theme" originally sung by Joel and his two heroes Tom Servo and the Clover on the Love Satellite for the episode 8 The Enemi Planet: Singing at the beginning points) <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVO SINGING) YOUR VISION KOMANDANSKOG CODE ....
