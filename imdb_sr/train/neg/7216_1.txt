I love Westerne. I could watch them all day. "Good, Bad and Ugly" is my favorite time. I watched "Silverado" probably for the 8th time just the other day, because he was at CMT. However, this movie, Shiloh Falls is undoubtedly the worst western I've ever seen. The acting was terrible. They do not explain anything at the end of the mysterious compass thing. The only good part I can imagine is a pretty girl from a canteen. The very notable long breaks between the dialogue seemed intended only to make up for the time to be acceptable. This film was not even worth the new rent I paid in our local movie store. I felt like I was robbed and deserved a refund if there was such a thing. The only reason I ended up was that I hated not watching the movie to the end. I turned it off halfway because it was so bad. For director, please, do a better job if you choose to make others. This is a movie that has the potential to turn people to the West.
