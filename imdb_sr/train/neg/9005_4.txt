If Alien, Jurassic Park and countless other sci-fi horror films are your tea, add plenty of sugar and this will drop. The film begins in a joyful old England around 1100, and then jumps to today's California. Our hero Dean Cain is the new chief of security and a military adviser for a scientific-research laboratory underground. A Carver and pilot helicopter arrives with a major scientist and we'll soon find out it's a cloning lab and have something new to clone. Is it a Dinosaur or what? As with the above films, all hell is lost and our characters begin to pick up. Special effects on the Monster are pretty good for the movie "directly on the video", and Dean Cain does what he is paid for. But forget the rest of the group as we discover why we have never seen them before. Again, do not go with high expectations and you will be fine.
