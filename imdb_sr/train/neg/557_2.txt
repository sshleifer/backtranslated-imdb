It's hard to believe, after 14 years of waiting, we end up with this piece of film garbage. The original was a powerful, powerful thriller who achieved "cult" status and showed the visual art of the film directed by Paul Verhoeven. This film does not add anything, does not bring anything, and eventually ends up in a large box of failed sequences. The opening order could have begun an intriguing set of plot development using a highly talented and capable actor. Unfortunately, the 90-minute dissertation in Catherine Tramell's life was treated ... or it was Sharon Stone. Probably a copy of both. If desire and vision are a continuation of a sensually provocative sex mask like in "B.S.1", forget. You end up with a soft-porn boredom that eventually confirms the old saying that a woman can be more seductive in clothes than out of them. It is interesting to note that the beautiful Charlotte Rampling was chatting around in her life, through GEORGI GIRL in 1966, when Mrs. Stone was only 8 years old. She is a very talented actress and quite skillful in keeping her own games even here. If you are the true cinema fan, then you have to look at this movie and judge it using your own rating system. If this is not the case, you can wait for a DVD release in the "rated" version, the "non-asserted" version, the "collector" release, or the "ultimate" version, and we may be saturated with the news about the "Basic" Instinkt 3 for another 14 years at the moment, Mrs Stone will have 62 years and nobody will care.
