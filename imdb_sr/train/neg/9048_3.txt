Originally broadcast as an ABC movie of the week. This includes two young innocent female students who entered a prison camp in a small southern town. They are not allowed phone calls and nobody knows they are there. What follows is rape, torture, beating, humiliation and degradation, which leads to a very disturbing conclusion. The TV version was (for its time) gloomy. No nudity and beating were quite ghasty, but the overall sense of scarcity was worn by one. The unrated version is worse - there is plenty of nudity, violence is extreme, and in a particularly disgusting series, we see a paid female prisoner forced to take off while the Lesbian Guard is "used". IUCK! There is nothing wrong with exploitation films, but this crosses the edge. You have the feeling that filmmakers enjoy the torture and degradation of these poor women - everything is pushed into your face as if you should enjoy it. Useless ending does not help. I give it 3 because the acting is good - but it actually makes the movie harder to watch. Painful movie. Not recommended.
