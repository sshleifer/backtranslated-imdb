Everything was almost with slasher about 88, so it's time to squeeze those older movies. The brain is well done, the script reminded me of Videodrome, but then in a somewhat more sophisticated way, as was said earlier. The act can go through it. But it's the effect you're laughing about, the so-called brain is really a party and blood is never shown. The introductory sequence is what makes this movie worth looking at, the hallucinations are really nice and reminded me of the Nightmare on the Easter Street, I remember the phone coming alive ... Someone watching this movie, waiting for the next thing to happen. This is visible for all the freaks, because there are no ups and there is, as it is said, blood is not there either, but there is a nudity for perverts. I saw movies that were better than this, I just wanted to make it bloody ...
