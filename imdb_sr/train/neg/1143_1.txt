Even more than 20 years later, Ninja Mission stands out as the worst movie through which I managed to sit. The Scandanavian ninja quietly enters the scene, fired off their unusually noisy sub-machine guns by wild abandonment, and then quietly leave. Wow, how are we gonna find these invisible killers? Just follow the casings and smoke! Painful bad dialogue (or was it brilliant and only badly translated?), Was not an Asian in the field of view in the acting team, and an incredible total of 3 Asian crew. The action is ridiculous, the acting does not exist - then again, the ninja can not act! Save yourself - avoid watching at any cost!
