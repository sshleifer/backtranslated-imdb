Hunters are chasing what they think is a man through the woods, although the audience sees it as a jeweler. Hunters do not seem to understand this, because after shooting it, it looks normal when they cut their heads off. The man, Rich, has the opportunity to have sex with his sister (Stephanie Beaton) before even removing the bandages. After leaving the hospital, he discovers that his wife was mistaken. When a smoker sends clouds next to the amateur painting of the month (with a fake tree in the foreground), it turns into a waswolf! His torso grows, divides his shirt, and on his head grows a huge mock wreath with red lights in his eyes. His pants remain untouched. His mouth is cheeky, although some kind of robotics (or hidden hands) in his eyebrows give him a fatal look at the time. and they are pretty well done. Even pretty good banging of the head later in the movie. However, when a man falls from his height, a pretty bad doll performs a job. Rich has a friend of Siodmak, a kind of occult expert, and he accidentally stumbles on a little guy with a staff called Androse, who is also an expert. They're trying to help him a bit. The rich kill people who made him wrong. The police are investigating the killings and trying to hit Beaton, who does not care much for lesbian scenes so nothing comes of it. a combination of the most challenging game with the hands of Orlac and the wolfman, it's a bit fun. Available on your own, or in a box Scream Kueens Vol. 1.
