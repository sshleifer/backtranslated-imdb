I bought this (it was only $ 3, ok?) Under the title "Gray matter". Sherriff Roscoe's novelty in the non-DukesOfHazzard role made me intrigue. As other reviewers have warned, this is a rather boring story of a top secret government experiment that went upside down. And yes, there are plenty of recordings, especially houses with a swimming pool in front of it. Some of the characters and the interior are so unimaginable. I think that the managers are concerned that we can forget who is who, so that they will continue to return us by first displaying buildings outside the building. It's actually kind of funny. After a while, the pool image looks like an identification station logo, reminding us to watch "Grey Matter." I also enjoyed two attacking names. At one point, an angry interviewer pronounces someone in charge by calling it "Scientific b!". It's just an inadequate insult. A couple of scenes later a different entity releases a couple muttering about that "scientific b ** tard!" It just sounded very awkward. One day this film will disappear forever. For another decade, it will probably be impossible to find copies. Almost as if it had never happened. <br /> <br />
