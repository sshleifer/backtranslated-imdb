Hobbles ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was the master of this film. He had the glow to make a movie with actors who could not act. In addition, he chose to write a script based on a kind of bad sour journey that has become seriously wrong. Together, end up with a movie that shit more than a warehouse filled with suction cups and vacuum cleaners. This movie was very painful. The pain caused by the pain is equal to the pain caused by the cutting of the genitals with the spoon, followed by the entire wound covered with salt and hydrochloric acid.
