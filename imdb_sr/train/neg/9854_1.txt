This documentary (or I should say mockumentaries) is a perfect example of how funny people can be when they have full enthusiasm for something like that. Honestly, I hate cryptoscience. It's ignorance, it just destroys it. However, some positive effects were visual effects (the dragons were beautiful), but some of the information in this mockumentary was completely false, and this is really disappointing because it came from a scientist, which is why it deserves 1 10 , and not 0. An example of false information is the idea of ​​hydrogen: It is true that, according to Chemistra, hydrogen is produced in the stomach, but it is impossible to produce it in such proportions, so in that case, you need a good explanation of what really is happening in the dragon's dragon. There are many substances with hydrogen in nature, but it is not necessary for a loud animal to fly, and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing, so this is impossible. After all, there is something worse, the idea of ​​platinum: this element is harder to find than gold, and I can not explain how the dragons survive depending on it. It's ridiculous, they represent dragons as creatures with little chance of conquering the planet Earth, but of course at least explaining why they died out. Probably cryptologists call themselves scientists, but they are not. People like them say lies like in this documentary, and what's worse, some are buying them. But I do not think a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this. These fake scientists are wasting their time.
