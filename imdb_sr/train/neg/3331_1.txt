Crash into three beautiful women in California going to a festival (or something like that). All hotels are booked so they have to spend the night in a creepy old house. What they do not know is that there is a dreadful resident who loves to kill ... </ br>> Kidding. A boring, meaningless, totally stupid "horror" movie. Bach and her two friends are certainly beautiful, but the film itself is boring boring! Bach and her friends are not actresses - their faces are empty. Finally, "revelation" is ridiculously predictable and there is no blood or blood that keeps you on the go. There is some expected female nakedness, but this is not enough to preserve this. Bored, meaningless, and unknown (for good reason). 1 to the end.
