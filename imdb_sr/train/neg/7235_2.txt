Even Bob Hope, accompanied by a large number of actors, can not save this badly written attempted war comedy because his patented timing has little to do with what he could do. The action includes a Hollywood film star named Don Bolton (Hope) and his attempt to evade military service at the start of World War II, and then mistakenly committed to a confused attempt to denounce Colonel's daughter (Dorothy Lamour). Bolton's agent, starring Linne Overman, and his assistant, Eddie Bracken, are reporting to him, and three of them are involved in various escapades related to training sessions in Malibu hills in California. Paramount invested heavily in this effort, employing some of its top experts, but the direction of the generally trusted David Batler was frail, and this must be attributed to the lack of a comedy element in the script. A shift towards the end of the movie to create Bolton's heroism opportunity was still born with poor stunt work and camera action in evidence. Strange, Linne Overman gets the best lines, and this veteran lover of the mockery looks very good. Dorothy Lamour looks beautiful and loves to behave, and it's always a pleasure to see and hear Clarence Kolba, as her father, whose voice is unique on the screen or radio, but few can do it to save this movie, damn it. as with the error in the task script.
