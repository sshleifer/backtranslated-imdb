Given the people involved, it's hard to figure out why this film should be so confused and boring. Writer, David Vard, wrote an incredible caper movie "The Sting" two years later, Jane Fonda just won Oscars for Klute, and Donald Sutherland just did a great job in films like "Klute", "Run the Revolution Without" , and "Kelli's Heroes." Platerally, the film is a nice story, with a small group of rude robbers planning a big plunder. At the same time, the film wants to be a hip-satire, a series of comic book sketches that the NBC "Saturdai Night" could do well two years later. The bad result is that the shop makes comedy look awkward and forcing, and unconnected comedic pieces destroy any kind of uncertainty that a robbery might have. It's a literal film that is constantly breaking into itself, just as cars in cars in demolition scenes run into one another. Her "Iris Caine" should be a light version of her dramatic character Bree Daniels in "Klute". Jane Fonda always pretends to be a prostitute we're looking at. It is extremely terrible, because her performance in "Klutama" was excellent. It would be a good lesson for acting actors to perform two films together to show how the same actress in the same type of role can be great or pathetic. This suggests that the actors are good only from their writers and directors.
