Like many media experiments, this amateur effort contains semen of a very interesting social commentary. In 5 years or more since it was published, the premise has become less unpredictable to the real events in software development, and I think it's less bored than the previous commentator for that reason, I suppose ... The director is obviously a fan in Hitchcock, and that's a shame the film was not better performed, but in fact, it's almost a parody of pulp fiction, including a soundtrack screaming at us when we need to pay attention. Almost you can see signs of exclamation and big letters on the yellow page. I must admit that it was fun for all these reasons and more. Sometimes our blisters are less likely to offer us, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in deconstructing it for educational purposes. Oh yes - and although the stitches showed up and creaked a lot, my heart grew, and I hesitated to get up and take a break.
