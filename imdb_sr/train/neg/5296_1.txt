I am not a big fan of glides as a genre, but even with low-budget budgeting standards, this is really chrome. Even at the level of nudity-and-up, it's incredibly boring (there's one, the other, but that's all ... meh). Before the revolution in the home video, he might not even be theatrally published (though it may have been, after all, Plan 9 from the Universe * played in theaters). There is exactly one good (and competently delivered) line in the whole movie; I suppose they stole it from somewhere. The act is one of the worst I've ever seen. I mean, even Ed Vood had a couple of competent actors, and the rest was funny hammi, which can be fun to watch. In any case, most of his actors could pass as a written one. Here, those who do not read their lines as Indians in cigar stores sound like they listened to them phonetically. And this film has one difference: it succeeds in being poorly pushed for most of the film, and then it's funny to swim to the end. (Update: I had to extract the actress who plays the receptionist as Not that it is wooden, not that it is good, but it is certainly not wooden.) Even the worst trips are generally good for several puritanic meditations about their grotesque offensive, but with this, there is not even anything that could lead to moral anger. And you know the funniest thing? Apparently they expected to make a sequel! It's so bad and boring to become fascinating in a strange way. I sat surrounded by a large section of the video wondering why anyone would try to make it.
