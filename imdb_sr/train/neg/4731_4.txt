A semi-clinging attempt to bring Elvis Presley to a modern day, but despite the sexy small scene of the showers and sub-assemblies of the pseudo-Plaiboi magazine, Presley is surrounded by the same old shy clich√©s. Woman elects E.P. up on the beach, and then continue to take over his life - and it seems that he does not care! Dick Sargent is exhausted in the second sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudi Vallee (!) Are trying hard as Elvis's two bosses (he does, you see). Some of the songs are pretty good, especially "Almost in Love," but if you want to see a loose, hipper, updated Elvis's Sexual Comedy - look somewhere else. When Elvis and his fatal attraction enter the bed together, between them is actually a wooden board! Be Realistic. ** from the ****
