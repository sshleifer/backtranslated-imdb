I also saw this film at the New York Film Festival at the High Falls Film Festival and I have to say that I found it as a complete and terrible boredom. Although it was funny at some places, the only real laugh was that there seemed to be a real plot for the conversation and that the acting in some places was terrible and wooden, especially the "Beautiful Lady" and the voice of the narrator (whom I never heard) there's a lot to want. J.C.Mac, I thought, was the redeeming feature of this film, true action and sand and (from actors) the only real acting. I am confident with another actor and a stronger ruler at the direction, it could have been half a decent movie. Let's just hope they do not go to the general edition, or if you really want a copy, look at the cheap bin in Lidl.
