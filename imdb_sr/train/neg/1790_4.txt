This was initially a "sweet" movie, and then it became too sweet and contained the central songs, at best. easy to interpret. Can you imagine that young people today are trying to listen to this movie? Forget. Bing Crosby has some good lines here and is pretty like "Hank Martin". Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") was, in addition to good looks and beautiful, long red hair. It's a nice finishing film that feels well, and I can not knock it out. Perhaps this is worth renting, for historical purposes, or if you are a big fan of Crosby, but that's not so much at all.
