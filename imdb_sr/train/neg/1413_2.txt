I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an attractive, attractive and talented actress. I'm sure it would be a good movie for something to happen in him. Nothing works. It's short (less than 90 minutes). It was too long for 75 minutes. After an hour of frustration, I scanned the remaining 20 minutes. Faster. Freeman plays the actor - who has not worked long - exploring the part he could play, as a billing officer at a supermarket. He visits the supermarket where he works. Nothing happens. He decided to take him home and go to Arba, Target, car wash. Nothing happens. They talk about their lives. Nothing happens. Never. I do not understand. But I do not even get Bill Murray "Lost In Translation" and "Broken Flovers". If you love those movies, you may like this. Many people find movies such as this capricious, charming, or - for the reason they avoid me - they find the dialogue fascinating. The usual device in movies of this type is to have a long lasting silence after the actor delivers a line that should be meaningful. We know it's meaningful because it's followed by two minutes on the screen. I'm sorry, I must be a philistine. I do not understand. For me, these kinds of movies are not funny, charming or provoking thoughts. They're just boring. Why? Because there is no comedy. No drama. No tension. No laughs. No tension. No action. Nothing to watch. In short, none of the things I go to the movies. They can be boring free. I see strange / weird characters in real life. I'm going to Target, and fast food restaurants, and car washing. These elements do not produce a movie, even if the stars do these things. I'm paying you to have fun. If you are crazy about Morgan Frimen and you like to hear him scream about nothing, have fun. If you want to bring Paz Vega, you can watch it and listen to it. But nothing is happening, I promise. Totally snoozefest.
