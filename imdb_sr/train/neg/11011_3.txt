A series of painlessly insensitive sketches that seem to last forever and forever. Not like mind-numbingly horrible as they say "Freddy Got Fingered" or "Lost Reality", but that in no way is the authorization in any way, sense or form. He has the worst clown rhyming ever. Most of all if it is not offensive to anyone, but for the happiest or politically correct. It also has the worst song EVER EVER recorded on the movie, THE BEST ARNOLD EVER OPERATION (not just the worst in the movie, literally the worst EVER). I have no idea why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan, or Slash would play in this (the reasons why I first looked at this). The only thing that was fun was Dickman. In conclusion, I would not recommend this film to ANIONE, but people who make their mission in life to get this at the bottom 250 on this site are pathetic. Make something noticeable with you, people who live. In addition, if it is true that the Scenological Church hates it, it can not be all bad. My Rating: D
