This film did not have ... everything: story, acting, surprise, genius and soul. For fifteen minutes, I looked at the screen saying: "How could all these guys get together and be considered friends (even without a girlfriend)?" For fifteen more minutes, I prayed for as much as Amanda Peet. When a bad movie calmly pronounces an ugly head, candy is a beautiful consolation. But there was not much! Cheated on all fronts!
