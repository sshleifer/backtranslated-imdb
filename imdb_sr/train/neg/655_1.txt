I went into this with my hopes, twenty minutes in the movie I could no longer be disappointed. Despite the fact that I thought this would be another terrible bad remake, I kept my hopes high so maybe ... it might just be someone who managed this well. Unfortunately, Prom Night is at the same level of quality as the recent remake in April, a bad script, a bad direction, a bulky actor and a general bad horror. From the beginning to the end it's boring, repetitive and worth about a dozen eye pins. We've seen it all before and we've seen it done a million times better than this. If you go to Prom Night in the theater (I say I'll wait for DVD or PPV), make sure the audience laughs, because they will laugh. Laughter is not in the movie spots that should be funny, they are in response to the key "exciting" moments in the movie that are so badly made you feel like watching the latest version of Scari Movie. Seriously, was this supposed to be a remake or a hoax? The filmmakers have missed this sign so much that a large number of audiences in the theater I attended came out halfway through the film. What in retrospect, I would like to do it myself. I did not, I had to bother myself and stick with it in the hope that it would be better. Needless to say it is not. Scenes of "horror" are a joke, not even so much because of the acting, but because of the regime, scenarios, "special effects" and the camera. The film seems to seem to have consumed the entire fortune to produce it, but it still came out of a micro-budget movie. Halfway, I was expecting to see labels on shops on some of the props, and I always thought I'd spot a porn star somewhere. This film is awesome OK, if this is a future of high budget horror then the horror genre is doomed to failure.
