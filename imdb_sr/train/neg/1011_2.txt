LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dilan McDermott. Kevin Spacei. John Heard. Cari Elves. Roslin Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - Wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And he's a star? I should know better than to rent EDISON FORCE. In fact, I knew better. But at the moment of absolute weakness, I rented this STV. When you have great names like Freeman and Spacei in STV, you know that this is one of two things: indie or a dog. Like in a sat-on-shelf. What did this do? And for good reason. The act as such includes the detachment of the corrupt policemen of the killer a la MAGNUM FORCE, and the "journalist" of Timberlake is the only brave enough to reveal them. He is the target of his efforts - or maybe I should say for his terrible action. I turned it off after one of the bad guys was killed through his forehead and still had a premeditation to turn to his shooter and smile before he collapsed. Just terrible. The real effort on how this flick is bad to look at Freeman on the front page and during a movie dealing with an unbridled beard looks like nothing like a rogue. You just know that the director did not have control. Freeman is obviously in the hunt.
