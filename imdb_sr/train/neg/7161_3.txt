A young American is visiting her Irish roots and defending himself from a witty friend who is at large. It sounds intriguing, but after an interesting start, I lost myself and spent most of my time wondering where it is going. It seems that the film is shaking in two directions - are we seeing the suffering of an Irish-American woman struggling with alcohol problems or watching a real horror movie about an evil witch that comes back from the past? It seems the director can not decide. It seems that the two of them do not gel and in the end you do not get anywhere. This could be much better done, and the story seems to have receded to the end. It was boring and disappointing.
