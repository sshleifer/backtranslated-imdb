This movie had to be one of the worst I've ever seen on DVD !!! The story could click on whether the film has more resources and writers that would shorten the nonsense and painful scenes that I am very alert to parents .... But the story is like a relaxed cannon. If there was such a thing as driving through a film maker - this would come out of it. He reminded me of many quick films that were published in the sixties, poor writing scenarios and recording. The only reasonable characters in the whole film were the bartender and the bartender. The rest of the film could easily be made by high school children. I give this film a grade of 1 because it's really terrible and I left the entire family with the feeling of being deceived. My advice - Do not look!
