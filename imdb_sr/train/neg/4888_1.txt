Nick Millard, nicknamed Nick Phillips, was supposed to go well enough when, 10 years before the release of this terrible waste of time and effort, "Criminalli Insane" was made. The fact that the original "Criminal Craze" lasted less than an hour was supposed to make it into the fact that it probably pulled this story out for everything that would get out of it ... but instead decided to use TON images from the original in this, and even to the point of recycling the original credit line of opening! Unfortunately, the return of fast aging Priscilla Alden did not save this. The few original recordings in this movie seem to have been captured using a rented handheld camcorder! If this film cost more than $ 100, I would be very surprised and would be just as surprised if something came close to that amount! Avoid this and look at the original!
