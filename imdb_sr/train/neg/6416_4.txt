SOME NON-SPOILER SPOILERS Why do people, when they are disoriented or sick or scared at a club, cut in the middle of a packed dance floor on the way to the bathroom? Who would hide under the bed in the right mind if someone broke into their room? How often do you knock on the door of an alien and when they do not respond immediately, you open the door, enter, you hear a few healthy ones, and then you start to walk through their belongings? If you are being persecuted by someone you just found to be a killer, what would you do? Quietly hide and hide under a wooden platform or between metal tools? Run, quietly, of course, to the old old stable or other vibrant structure? I could speak about almost every thriller that came out in the last few years, but since this is the "Return" page, obviously I'm talking about "Return". I saw it for free because I'm working in the cinema and I'm making the point of showing all the "scary" films. I thought this was tolerable ... except for clich√©s. Sarah Michelle Gellar really was gray and looks like "Huh?" through most of the movie. The details of the action are slowly published as the movie progresses and it's almost enough to be interesting, except that there was not enough explanation as it moved on and so I almost lost it to the last 2/3. <Br /> If you are a fan of the trilera, it's worth a look at it at least once. If there's nothing better in the theater and you really want to watch a movie, eh, I suppose it's worth the map for the matinee. If you thought the trailer made it look like an interesting movie, you can not wait ... wait.
