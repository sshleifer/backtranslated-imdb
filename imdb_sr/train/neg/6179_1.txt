This film is the second worst movie I've ever seen (the first being the Ghost Rider). There is absolutely no complication, climax, conflict, or any other major detail needed to show the story. This 'film' is essentially just another excuse for Toby Keith to show his male side and, 'the stubborn who really is.' I totally lost my time watching this movie. The best part should be the completion of the loan. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would cut off the thumbs and threw them on the manufacturers. Whoever gave Tobi Keith the chance to play a feature film in his healthy mind, is obviously on the same mental level as he did. In conclusion, do not waste your time watching this movie, but it's possible that it's the only thing you're complaining about.
