It was time to play this movie on DVD. I know some say that VB is in a hurry to publish this film because of The Dreamgirls. But, how can you hurry to publish the movie that was in your catalog since 1976. I am very disappointed with the DVD release of this movie, with no special function, no 5.1 DD sound. Come to SB, you can do much better than this. The quality of sound and images on this movie needs serious help. Seem VB has not devoted so much time and attention to this film because it's a black film and my sale is fine. They could save a CD that by the way the dose does not have all the songs that have the original CD. Would you recommend this DVD for purchase. Yes, it's a classic movie. But SB should add some more special features. Make notes from other group films, The Five Heatbeats, or The Temptation, you can only see the performance, and the sound on both of them is much, much, much better than this DVD.
