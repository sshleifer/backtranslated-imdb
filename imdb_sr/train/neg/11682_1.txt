Now, is not it? Taking into account the good work of Danzel, Clive and Jodie, the film has never turned into something more than horrible films that have died / looted. Yes, a couple of jokes, there are absolutely no unpredictable turns, to be honest, the only unpredictable moments are there because the director and editor have made some stupid mistakes, it's a shame for them and a waste of time for us. If someone can tell me why, for God's sake, they dug a hole in that safe, who is Rebecca and how they knew, for good reason, that diamonds were in a particular cell, it could make me day, but Spike looks to us to take us too many things in this for almost, and we do not raise our eyebrows when something looks stupid ... his only one more movie studio contract is relaxing and enjoying ...
