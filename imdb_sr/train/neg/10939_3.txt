This movie has some of the worst performances I've ever seen! Some scenes are original like nails that come through the floor. This nail trap catches those bad guys. The rest of the film degrades while you go. I can not believe this film is not in the bottom of 100 movies of all time. Also, I can not believe there are extensions! The next film I want to watch is R.O.T.O.R. Is R.O.T.O.R really worse than that? <br /> <br />
