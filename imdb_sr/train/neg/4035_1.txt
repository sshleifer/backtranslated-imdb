I hate to be raining on a parade (even a small one), but from the first scene, you can say that this movie will be absolutely bullshit. It really is a pity, as I myself, as Martin Freeman and Danni Dier. I was intrigued to join together in the film, but to my anxiety, they did not even have a scene together !! I think I have to repeat this - The two main actors (who stand side by side on billboards and DVD covers) did not have one scene together !! They did not talk to each other and never appeared on the screen at the same time. I almost summarize this bad excuse for the film. Fake advertisement. Dialogue was painful, every character in the film was unreal and non-human. The scenarios were rather unpleasant, the action was shit, the jokes were slim, Freeman tried too hard to be funny (and played a poor Tim from the office), nobody was nice, and worst of all, some characters were so embarrassed that me almost led to turning off, as I could not watch, or to listen to them more. Even Danni Dier could not put in some humor and charm, but he blessed it, he tried. What a waste of time. How could anyone evaluate this film as "Ten Star" is above me. Ten Stars? Seriously? Come on .... I will not even give out some of the top ten stars, as the ten stars mean that the film is perfect. This film was far from perfect, almost the opposite, which means it was almost completely difficult. Watch if you want, but if you've seen lots of movies, and watched lots of great movies, your review will probably be similar to mine. 1/10
