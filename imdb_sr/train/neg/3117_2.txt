My husband is a big fan of Robin Williams. I love him too, but in general I found it necessary to "stick to what works best" and focus on comic roles. My thoughts have been confirmed by this film. I was completely boring throughout the film. The story was predictable. I realize she is inspired by a true story. But, I suppose there might have been some uncertainty or intrigue, even while the truth was kept in the story. No character was well developed. It was a story about the main character and his partner. This relationship could be further explored. However, it would be more important to have a deeper study of the mother of the "boy". Her psychological profile would be interesting. She obviously has a long history that was not touched, except in the most perfect way. If my husband was not such a big fan of Villiams, we would have left for 20 minutes. It's a pity I can not get 20 or 2 hours ago.
