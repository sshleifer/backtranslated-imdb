Crush's worst thing was not that she behaved pretty badly, or that the action was practically non-existent, and it was not even so bad that the camera could have been better. No, the worst part of this movie is that there are a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you in the hope of coming more. But in the end, it's too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin music and inexpensive scenes with tears of 40+ women who cry and throat and talk about babies and marriage - then do not miss it. And I'm not really thrilled to see the above things in the movie, and as a result I had a pretty awful time. A few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest. Judgment: 4/10. I am guilty of losing time. <br /> <br />
