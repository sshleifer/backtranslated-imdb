This film failed to investigate the humanity of animals that left me in an empty feeling. I was not convinced that Dr. D really had a compelling reason to give up big purchases to help your furry friends. While Babe (the original) accented the trend of large budget hits focusing on the human virtues of animals compared to their colleagues, all the animals in this film were nothing more than comic caricatures that would be pleasing in the grinder meat (even more if one can understand their meaningless banging). Without the foolish behavior of Eddie Murphy, this movie would be a flop.
