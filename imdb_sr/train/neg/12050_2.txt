I read a few positive comments about this film and I was really surprised at how horrible it was. Situated as a kind of crossing between the story of AIDS and some kind of "Spirit" / "Blithe Spirit" story, this movie can not always do what it wants to be. Simon and Mark are a gay couple who has an "open" relationship - Simon is able to have anonymous (though sure) sex on the side when he wants to. Mark is HIV + and he and Simon no longer have sexual life. When Mark dies, Simon - who is accustomed to shutting down his emotions after his father rejected him a few years ago - is trying to erase his memory and just continue to be bored. It was not that his behavior before Martha's death was much different. But Mark returns in a ghostly form and returns to him various attempts, while Simon opens up and acknowledges his real feelings. Unfortunately, Simon is so selfish SOB, it's impossible to feel the empathy towards him most of the movie. By the time she needs to be more compassionate, it's too late to worry. Mark, on the other hand, follows the steps of Demi Moore from "Ghost", crying abundantly throughout the film. After Mark returns, a bizarre switch appears. Suddenly we got some chromatic humor attempts, and la TV show "Bevitched". But it does not last long. Once Simon's emotional health is concerned, the whole thing becomes all the cat, with amateur attempts to twitch on your hearts. Finale, with a gilded angelic boy-boy who leads a tainted mark in the sky while being punished, shaken Simon majestically by goodbye, is just amazing, mostly because he is not deliberately funny.
