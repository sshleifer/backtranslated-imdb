Really, really bad movie. A psychotic person is fleeing from asylum. Three years later he kills a professor of sociology, the end of the scene. One semester yesterday later (hey, that's what the cover card said) a new professor of sociology is at school. He's dating another professor of sociology who works there and begins to meet with another professor. It's boring to students, as we are. There are a large number of titles showing how much time has passed. The scenes are quite short and in other places cut off to different characters, which leads to little progression of any kind. Many scenes include characters who walk and speak, sit and talk, and serve a little purpose. Despite the passing of time, many characters always wear the same clothes. Sometimes the blurred passage of time means when we see the body for the second time, we wonder: how long was that body there? And also, at least one of the dead people seems to have not been missed by others. and the other by cutting the forehead. Is his knife poisoned or something? The cover of the video box has a cheerleader: there is no movie in the movie. On the back cover there is a photo of someone in the matura and a dress that threatens a group of women in the bedroom. The central redhead in the photo is in the movie, but nobody ever wears such clothes, and there is no such scene. The killer is strictly one to one.
