I read the story of John Everingham many years ago at Reader's Digest, and I remember thinking about what a great movie would be like. And it would probably have happened that Michael Landon never got him. As far as I'm concerned, Landon was one of the worst actors on earth, and his artwork passed over the top, similar to his massacre in a series of books "Small House" is evidence. The acting, in the absence of a better word, is terrible, the scenario is messy, and has more close plans than Landon's cat than should be allowed. House On The Prairie "reflects the books on which it is based. It's just another vehicle that shows Landon's terrible hair.
