Dear me. Where do I start? Dad is not even close enough to be a daddy's girlfriend. The first 5 minutes of the film lie on the camera. The favorite exclamation in this film is "Jesus Christ !!!". Zombies are agile, stupid, and few are. Motives are completely incomprehensible and there is no narration. People "run" to their destination in jeeps at 3 miles. The world seems to continue normally, but that should be the end of days. Breasts appear on the chest. Normally such an approach would provide some redemption, but the rest of the film actually made me uninterested in the chest or future of mankind. There is a dog without reason and a thin, orange blood that turns the stomach. General and his phrase "Close f ** k up!" is the only buying function. As for the rest, I sincerely hope to hear that they have done a decent thing and have been killed.
