Underground Comedy is perhaps one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I should have known that it would be bad when the phrase "Guaranteed insulting" was written in the box ... which means that filmmakers will focus more on getting you out than smiling. This film is an amateur gang of childish sketches, bad characters and bad jokes ... from the pathetic Bat-Man sketches to the painfully unfortunate sketch of Arnold Shvollenpecker, they are simply not ridiculous. A few sketches that are a little funny are a bit and far - seeing Michel Clark Duncan play a gay virgin, for example - but even they go too long and become ruined by the Vince Offer of Incompetence in Comedy. Hold an underground comedy movie underground ... bury it!
