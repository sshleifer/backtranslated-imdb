This is an absolutely horrible movie. First of all, this guy is from the media. I suppose he made a career of playing super dad. It was fine for the first time when he tried to scare his son pretending to be a monster ... but then 10 minutes later they did it again! And so it goes, this movie is moving in unbearable real time. At one point, I started filming a few days later, until he reminded me that the story is only the next day ... in the early afternoon! I'm not sure who should be in real life. First, they were presented as some Manhattan couple who grew up and had a child. They drive an old Blue Volvo. These guys stopped driving Volvos a few decades ago. They drive Prius today. But in 2002, I'm sure they have not driven Volvos yet. Okay, then there's Vendigo. The "Mysterious Indian" gives the boy a small magical Vendigo statue and tells him about his powerful magic. Come on ... are we still doing ancient Indian mysteries. Just to take him home, they cross over every Indian statue in their tourist trap in New York City. American Indians are shown in a way that can not be seen for decades in this movie! Oh, and around Wendigo. It is not really the cause of horror. He does not kill Dad's father, which is the most terrible thing in the movie ... he was just killed by a simple peasant with a kiwi and a powerful rifle. Vendigo just comes out late in the movie to revenge the guy who killed his father ... oh, but wait, it seemed that Vendigo was somehow angry at his father, maybe because he killed a deer ... and then Vendigo must have been happy Dad was killed ... but ... And so it goes ... offensive, boring and senseless. There is no reason to watch this movie at all.
