"Godzilla vs King Ghidorah" is a perfect example of how a great idea can be destroyed by pathetic topics like pseudo-patriotism. Here, travelers from the future are trying to ruin Japan, replacing the local hero Godzilla with his monster puppies, the triangular golden dragon of King Gidorah. They are decaying, but eventually Godzilla fights Ghidora. The battles between the two savages are very cool, but the film plot is full of holes and everything about "Japan is great" is really stupid. The creators of this film did not even threaten the admiration of Japan's enemies, which made them stupid big blond boys, who were easily surpassed by smart Japanese people. The good thing is that in the end Godzilla and King Ghidorah almost destroyed Japan and they are ridiculous enemies in one (actually two) spectacular fighting. But until this battle, the film was boring and pathetic.
