I had doubts that the film would be bad. I'm Duke's fan. Have three years of TV series on DVD. I was right. He took the family to see her. I really wanted to see a general jump again and some of the scenes for a hunt were good. But, to summarize, the film was a discouraged version of the TV show. Jessica Simpson was miserable. Although I can honestly say that Daisy's original clothes were equally exposed, the interpretation of Daisy for Jessica Simpson was simply terrible. Both Sorrel Booke and Denver Piles have to roll in their graves. Do not waste money. If you are an old tried and true Dukes fan like me and my three kids will be very disappointed.
