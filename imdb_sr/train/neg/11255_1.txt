In a word, this film was boring. He missed her life and spark. The big problem is with two tracks. Jude Leo and Gwineth Paltrow did not have any chemistry. He was boring and boring. Visual images were interesting but did not improve the scene. If nothing else, the images are more likely to separate the audience from what's happening on the screen. None of the action sequences was real, and therefore, the movie failed to create any real drama or sense of danger. better director. I was thinking in the film, you know, this movie would make Harrison Ford Captain Ski, Karen Allen was Polly, and Steven Spielberg was the director. Ignite critical praise for this movie. I think critics praise the film because they want * to like him and want to succeed, even though they do not succeed at so many different levels.
