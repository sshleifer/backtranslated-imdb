Very bad film, mostly because of a bad story, but also a bad behavior in the case of Robert Dovna Jr., and the irrational behavior of many characters. If you are someone who likes to shut off your mind and simply watch a movie because of your creativity or acting criteria, then this movie might be appealing to you. I can not do it personally with drama, and I think it's too embarrassing. Especially annoys me when the main character, who should be an intelligent person, always acts as a kit of imbecile. In this film, if the main character behaved in the way a person behaves in such situations, there would be no film. , played by Kenneth Branagh, leaves the party and takes place on the girl, Mallori Doss, played by Embeth Davidtz, screaming that her car was stolen. They stand around in a tropical rainstorm while riding to accept a ride home. She tells him about her strange father who belongs to some strange sect and works crazy things. When they reach her worn hut in the poorer part of the city, they notice that her car is approaching. And the lights in the house are on fire, and some objects in the house are broken. ieah!). Also, the father is weird, the house is wreck - everything was to tell Magruder, "hey, this is too weird for me, I'm out of here!" But not Magruder, he sleeps with her, and then, motivated by his story and sex, takes the case of attempts to make her father do it. All screaming! - a lawyer who was on his flight, arrived late in the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before (the fact that all women in the office were informed). Magruder in some of his cases harassed the police so that when he went to the police claiming, with sufficient evidence that the father was terrorizing them, the police ignored him. at all - not likely! It's unlikely.
