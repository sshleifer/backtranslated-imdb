So, what is the big mess to make INDIAN JONES when you have an actor who played a fictitious type from adventure stories that do not want to get on the adventure? Whoever wrote the script for JAKE SPEED is probably fired, but for any reason, this movie is largely lacking in excitement! This does not mean that there is no action, but look at the dark side of the image. It does not have to look like INDIANA JONES or other action adventures that contained cliffs and narrow runs, and JAKE SPEED was promoted in this way using smart propaganda so I and a few others would be interested in it! Besides, I've never heard of a guy, so who needs his attention?
