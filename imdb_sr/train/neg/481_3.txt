Every time a film is so short-sighted in its desire to present a certain end or position that it just does not bother the real story, it's irritating. These are types of films that have a first or a rounded view, and the story is simply set up. For this reason, we often talk about "jumping through hoops" as it turns around, vainly trying to advance to a predetermined ending in a logical way. Just jump through hoops, it's a three-ring circus. It's so funny, so poorly imagined, so dishonorable that, if you are prone to loud speech on the screen, you will wear a pretty tremendous thing before it passes. septic tank is a woman who chooses between family and profession. Since everything is so terribly confused, it will end up being insulting to people of any opinion. So, in the end, there is no sense in the story, the topic becomes unimportant and, as is often the case with bad scenarios, the act does not save anything.
