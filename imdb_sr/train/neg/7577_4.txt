This is just appealing to fans of "bad movie" entertainment. For students of the pop culture culture of the 1970s, it is more valuable: fashion, furniture, attitudes and that great "female lib" moment in the early 1970s, when it was still fresh and a novel for an independent, independent woman that existed < Superchick (Joice Jillson) had a cash prize if she upset her career (after all, she was a stewardess, but a waitress at 30,000 feet - which is true for men), She slept with more men, she could protect herself and other (karate) and is not related to anything. This is a type of emancipated woman who has frightened the juices of anti-feminists, those retrograde idiots who believe that no woman is complete without a husband. Sexy stewardesses were a powerful archetype late in the 1960s through the 1970s, (and even the "The Partridge Famili", I remember that swinging bachelors Ruben Kinkeyd constantly connected the stewardesses) and from This point of view, this stupid movie is an important pre-AIDS capsule, free love, female lib, swinging Seventies. The plot, however, is terrible. And for those cave people in the audience, there are few naked breasts to be watched.
