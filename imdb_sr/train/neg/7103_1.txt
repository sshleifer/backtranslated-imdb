This is the best way to describe this film that focuses on a newly-created couple who move into a house that is being harassed by the first wife of a wife who died under mysterious circumstances. It sounds good and good, but what's going on is a watch of pure boredom. In fact, one of the funny things in this movie is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises to anyone who dies of a free suit from fear. Believe me, no one has ever accepted them in this offer, unless someone is afraid of plastic skulls, peacocks, strange gardens and doorbells. And music is the worst, it consists of a constant music tube that sounds like it's playing in some sixth grade. And you will understand the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really need to ask what people in this film meant. Someone dies as he runs and hits his head, and the police are never invited to investigate. Yes, in the end, this is a slow pace (which is really bad considering that the movie is just over an hour), a boring little story, easily understood by an average person. Obviously, none of the characters in this film was an average person.
