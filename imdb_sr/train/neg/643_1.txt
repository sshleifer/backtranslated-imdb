I'm a big fan of Largo Vinch TV series. This film was a pain for me. I had to move quickly to avoid falling asleep. It was boring! How can someone destroy that title so much? The story was the only good thing. The actors were sh.t. They can not live that role. The main actor (Tom ...) is zero. See other roles of this actor. The battle scenes were incredible boring, and not traceable, somehow they did not follow the situation. Like the other reviewer, he said that a low-budget movie with bad actors. The French can not do the right thing with big movies, such as Alien 4. That was a bit, after Alien 1,2,3.
