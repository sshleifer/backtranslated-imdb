This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day. A rich upper class English woman plans, floats and manipulates everyone around her for her own pleasure. She uses her privileged position to engage in secret activities of highly anti-social types. There is an intelligent shift in the sexual role, because her activities prove her to be more daring and bravest than most male characters. But, of course, there is a tall, dark, and handsome stranger to retain love interest, and this evil did not lag behind in meeting the real man. every other character makes extreme incalculable extreme, but those who are thirsty for a romantic will ignore this.
