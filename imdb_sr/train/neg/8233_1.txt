This was probably the worst movie ever, seriously. In fact, I could have done better, not even properly set up. It's like this film had a $ 5 budget and left the change. Do not look at it. I did not even get to this film, I had to turn it off. I gave this 1/10, because it was hilarious how the producer of this film wanted to be a horror movie, but actually turned into a really bad comedy. Basically, a bunch of girls crashed into the car, smashed headlights, and the car owner went after them. A little I saw was a woman with a gun that ordered girls to take off their clothes, what the hell? It must be some sort of a syrus pornographic film.
