Discoveri Channel / Animal Planet must be ashamed. This fantasy is made after the model "Valking vith Dinosuars". Although this is 100% fantasy, it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way. Even mixing fantasy dragons with T-rivers and extinct dinosaurs. In addition to being shown on an educational channel instead of saying Sci-Fi, this concert is given a fact of factual authenticity. The very broadcast is about 7.5 / 10 away from entertainment. But the way it is presented I have to give it 1/10. Do not get me wrong. I have no fantasy problems, but the way they put this is wrong. I can really see small children and laymen who believe they have found the dragon and that this is real. I also think that this weakens the big series of "Dinosaur Walking" because now you have to see with the mind how fantasy is on this mini-series.
