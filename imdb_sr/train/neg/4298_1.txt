Incredibly confused, disgusting and extremely funny thriller ("horses, my God, horses!"). Sometimes it's creepy, but it has one of the worst scenarios ever written for a horror movie. See how in the last 10 minutes all "magic" do exactly what is needed for "resolution". Bland performs leading, typically eccentric Richard Linch. Video transmission is a real hack job, cutting the scene in half and making the film more difficult to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.
