Here again is Diane Lane's movie where she cheated on her husband. Is that the only role he knows plays? This time was set in 1969 and she cheats on her husband with a blouse. I'm not surprised because this is so predictable. Then her husband is angry and throws milk. I would not be surprised if she too would sleep with milk. I would not be surprised that she also slept with ice cream, because this is a very boring film. Then, after throwing milk, she says she is sorry and again sees a man with a blouse. Ghost. Then as she did it with him, her son was stabbed. My mom always told me not to throw stones at the nest of the axis. These little mom had no time to tell him, she was too busy with a blouse man.
