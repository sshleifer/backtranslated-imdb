Recording / translating in this movie is really hilarious and provides the only fun in this otherwise boring and performed zombie. I did not laugh so much in my life as I just looked at Zombie 3 (and I've seen some bad bad dubbing in my life, believe me). Seriously, filmmakers could re-edit this film and publish it as a comedy and earn millions of dollars. That's so funny. But ... If falling from the couch in laughing at dubling in Fulci's zombie movie is not your cup of tea, then avoid this at all costs.
