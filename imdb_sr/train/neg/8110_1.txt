I think Phillip Kaufman read the version of Kundera's novel, and then started to make this film. Okay, of course it will not have a blow to the original. Kundera's novels are great for his manipulation of the narrative concept, his ability to enter and exit the story he builds. This movie does not even try! One sequence of the dreams of Teresa, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, has been reworked and makes no sense. Also, even this may be a less important thing, Daniel Dai-Levis looks like Ben Stiller in this (I know it's not a real appeal, but hey). Perfect example of Hollywood study of fine literature.
