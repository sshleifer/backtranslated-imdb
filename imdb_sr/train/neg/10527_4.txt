I discovered this film with a seller selling OOPs. And this is surely OOP. A year after Ecorcist, she returned to work with this film, but what was all new was that Blair's career never broke out, she never became a mega star. This is one of the reasons why many of her films are OOPs. She gives a good performance in this movie. It's a rejection that parents do not recognize and have no friends. Played at the age of 15 playing a girl of 14 years, it's funny. The film is also known for the scene of rape in the showers, when they put the broom innocent. It's cut out in most of the editions, why, I do not know, it's not about blood, okay, Blair is naked, but nothing is showing up, there's no T & A, so nothing insults people. But the film is slow, extremely slow. It's not normal for me, but I almost felt I was asleep. It's just that the 14-year-old becomes a rebel against society, but there is no blood flow, there are no bloodstains. Why this is categorized into horror is still a miracle for me. If you are a Blair fan, buy it if you find it otherwise.
