This gets two because I liked it as a kid, but it became so superfluous that I just started to hate it ... I can not give a descriptive review because it would be to repeat one thing for another, probably I would not say nothing that everyone else did not said. The only other thing about this show is that it's pretty nasty, with a kid with tea that is a twisted nanny to the nonsense that runs around and around. I have a cousin who loves this show and he is the strangest and dumbest person I've ever met. This emission should be pulled out of the air. It's always the same thing over and over again ... They have to set up better shows about Nick. I'm really tired of things like this.
