This is one of those horrible, B-films that can not be played near the theater. Women run around dressed in scarce clothes "Bunny", an extremely fat woman is the burden of many jokes without taste and everyone works in a dirty old man's restaurant, who has a strange son (Jim Hanks, who of course Tom's brother) whom a man wants to "lay" . Hanks is actually good, but this film does not go anywhere and makes no sense. A man must wonder why he was made at all? However, because of Hank's performance and a few fun moments (but no more than a few), she got a stellar "2" of 10. I think I was good.
