Plot = Melissa is a new girl in town, has fifteen years and her birthday comes in a week. Since Melissa is beautiful, every boy in the city wants to connect with her, but a few who manage to capture her interest mysteriously dies. Dana Kimmel on Friday 13th pt 3 was in her, which is not the real reason to hurry and see the movie. When I started watching it, I realized that "Sveet Sikteen" is not really a good slasher, it's really boring and boring and it just does not go anywhere. After more than an hour, there were only three murders and the story did not develop in any way. From the 80's, the movie sometimes has too much darkness. The acting is nevertheless pretty good and Melissa's character is easy to sympathize with him, although she is a complete slut. The only thing that was interested in me was Melissa, which was amazing and Dana Kimmel, who is really sweet and sweet in this movie. I do not recommend it to Slasher fans.
