Two old friends are sent to Japan to get the results of a genetic survey that contains a video tape that was stamped by black ninjas at the beginning of the film. First, they just have to learn something ninja skills, because "only ninja can beat ninja." Sakura killers are trying to be a nice ninja-flick, but it goes badly. The whole movie is so empty and predictable that it is difficult to say something good about it: The same plot is seen in different variations ten times before, the characters are too short drawn, the direction is boring and the script does not offer anything surprising, even in the final scene, which has in itself reduced the value of the film (trash). Even the ninja-flick-fan of the 80's, who understands the aesthetics of trash films, find it hard to find this movie even barely pleasant. It simply does not offer the viewer anything new, either in visual or in a complication. Shurikens are thrown and katana is swinging, but it is not enough to keep the direction of the film that was supposed to be and repeat similar combat scenes, even the most stubborn viewer after the first 30 minutes. It is difficult to recommend to anyone. Even the clumsy performance of Franco Neron in the film "Enter the Ninja" is behind the American ninja of the killer Sakura. Even in the visual level movie there are no balls and a waste of time is an attempt to find great fighting scenes in this movie: There are no. All in all, one of the most influential ninja-shifts I've ever seen. He does not even care about his curiosity. Believe me this. Â½ from 10.
