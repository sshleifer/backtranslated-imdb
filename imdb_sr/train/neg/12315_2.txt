OK I am not an American, but in my humble Scottish thinking, Steve Martin did not, he was never, and he will never be a funny man as long as our posters fall into the south. Phil Silvers as sergeant Bilko was a ridiculous man, undoubtedly for skilful writers and directors and all other talented team figures in the series that perfectly contributed to one of the funniest comedies that America ever produced. How anyone could have the courage to even try to replicate the figure of Fil Silvers is beyond me. To agree on things, the exercise was repeated in Martin's failed attempt to be the Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau, another unsuccessful attempt, in my opinion, to spark an unexpected career. Some of your associates say that "Steve Martin puts his mark on the character", I would say "balderdash", his portraits will be long forgotten when those from Silvers and Sellars are kept for generations to come
