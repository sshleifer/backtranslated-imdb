Steven Feinberg, who played a proctologist and was one of the film's writers, died at the beginning of 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, last year, when he told me that he wrote in Hollywood for years earlier, working mostly on TV promotions. He asked me not to see 'Tunnel Vision', but it was too late, I already saw him! I actually saw him years ago when he was released. Then I did not think it was such a bad movie. However, looking at it as an adult, my opinion was somewhat different. That it's a little deterrent, as well as dated. Steve admitted that it was not a good movie. He said that he was just a little proud of the sketch of "Proctologist".
