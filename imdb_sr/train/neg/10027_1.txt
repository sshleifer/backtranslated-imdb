The action in this film surpasses Sunni Bhai in Gadar. Akshai Kumar possesses superstars Leonid in 300, Neo in Matrix together with Spiderman and Superman. It's hilarious. Except for the typical comedy Akshai Kumar and Anil Kapoor, I see nothing positive in this film. The story looks like the writer told his ten-year-old son to write. The film is so unrealistic that Anil Kapoors's feature-length shooting with the shotgun is the smallest mistake of the director. Except for director Tashan who will make this film, there is no other Tashan. I'm sorry I spend my money on this movie and I would not recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is the least I can give to IMDb or I would give zero.
