Stupid Griswalds win the main prize for the TV "pig in the hook" and they all go together to Europe where they manage to cause one stupid catastrophe for another. Of all the ridiculous, infertile sequences that flow in money, he won. Harold Ramis's 1983 film was below the average of an accident where the unsuitable family went to the nightmare "Vacation" across America. This time, Amy Heckerling ("Look Who's Talking") is leading what turned out to be a catastrophic "comedy" that will irritate you more than it will make you laugh. Hughes' script (with Rob Clane) is terrible and you wonder why they loved Chevi Chase and Beverly D'Angelo worried about such a deadlock project, as even Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca made sense reject an offer. Even almighty Michael Palin is not able to raise the process to any level that could be called entertaining. Still, however unthinkable, "European Vacation" was successful enough to secure the second continuation! Certainly it can not be as intolerable as this one. You know, I still have not seen a national lamp display that has been worth the hassle. <br /> <br /> Monday, December 26, 1994 - T.V.
