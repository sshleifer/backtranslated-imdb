This film was physically ill to live through, perhaps because (like many of my elder and younger ones) I grew up with dr. The Cat in the Hat creates all the interests and spark of the story, and the appearance of Mike like the Cat basically confuses. Why is the accent of the Borsch Belt, a barren dwarf, inappropriate jokes, a charming costume? I had to go back and read the books again to see the real problem: the books are SIMPLE. This film is OVERBLOVN and a long way. Do not expect that any children's movie will be Toi Story or The Iron Giant, but this has set a new string. How did Mike Miers need money?
