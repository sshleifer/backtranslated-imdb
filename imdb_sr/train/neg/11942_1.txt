Absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen for a long time! It starts bad and just fails. Katherine Heigl is sadly wrong in the role of Lolita, and Leo Grillo is struggling with what is essentially a Carbon figure. The only actor with enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore, who shuts him up as a villain and completely leaves his role. The scenario is awesome, dramatically dramatic and has large enough holes to run a two-seater bus! It's also the sexiest movie I've ever seen! The character of Katherine Heigl is completely untimely. She sees herself as an evil, reckless seductress that harbors a poor, innocent married man to deceive her wife. The film implies that she is underage, and the message that accompanies this plot is only the earliest faith! In the end, she is not even able to recover from the shooting of a man who is obviously (ha!) Angry and angry, but the script allows him to kill himself, which is reaped in the eyes of men everywhere. Terrible. Do not waste your time.
