This film has such a small class compared to strangers in the train or even by accidental encounter, which, despite the similarity of similarity, I would not feel right in comparison with any of them. The sign of Ian Butler appeared as such a stupid stupidity. It was too hard for the writer and director to continue watching. I do not enjoy many life films, but I feel compelled to look one by one in the interest of promoting harmony at home. I often quietly sigh, but this film led me to protest loudly, get up and leave the room and walk around the house by mummy to myself, before I returned to my favorite armchair to torture myself more.
