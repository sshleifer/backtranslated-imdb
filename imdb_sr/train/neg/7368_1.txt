I had an accident to spend Â£ 10 buying a new movie on the DVD: Attack Force. Now I can usually suspend my watching watching movies like this one. The soldering of the salt and a little beer on a dark evening on the sofa watching the late night to shoot it is perfect for an alpha male like me. I bought this movie thinking that I would see great martial arts and shoot them. I am hell. He was old and faint, the plot was pointless even by SS standards, and in order to break it all, Segal's acting (as it was at the beginning) was extremely bad. Such a terrible fact that half of his voice was called by a man who sounded NISHA like him. The SS can no longer behave (the disputed point) of the crew who were so scary in their jobs that they could not properly record the sound. The voice will shift back and forth between Mr Vhisper Segala and a man who makes voices for Honda commercials! Land is not wise, because most action movies work with the same premise as this one, nothing new. A common combination of characters that will die terribly as cannon fodder and stereotyped bad guys waiting to blow up. Flu. Totally garbage. 1/10 <br /> <br /> This is a public health warning.
