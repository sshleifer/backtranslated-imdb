Jamie Fokk is my favorite comedian. However, I feel that I sold out to get my first big budget role. Fokk follows steps like Chris Tucker, Martin Lavrence and Dave Chapple, who all saw their talents lost from stereotypical producers who think that black men who make a lot of crimes are a ridiculous concept (See: Monei Talks, Blue Streak). I laughed a lot of times and I approve all these comedians to continue listening to hilarious roles, but I would like to see these guys coming out of the movie Marlon Vajans in Requiem in a dream. Or in vibrant colors, Tommy Davidson and Damon Vaians are starting to feature in Spica Lee's Bamboozled Satire.
