I remember seeing a movie in the summer of '78. Years with my parents, and at that time I was pretty good. Of course, then I was seven years old then. Immediately before the release of Jackson films, my wife and I rented this movie because we never saw it and I felt nostalgic. Ralph Bakshi was left with no money around the middle of the animation in this film, and he was forced to drastically stop this production. Since this film was made primarily by rotoscopy, the animation technique for people in the budget, it says something. Much of this film is animation only in the weakest sense of the word. There are some scenes that are obviously just people standing in front of the screen, with some animation effects that overwhelm them. Due to budget constraints, the film - already the compression of the "Ring Association" and the "Two Towers" section - is even further reduced. What you get is something like a movie version of Cliff Notes from books. Not everything is bad, but the animation brings the heat I've found in Jackson's films. It's good to imagine how it could have been with decent funding. This film is also worth the attention because it had a continuation that never came. A few years later, a half-hour TV-special film was broadcast, which was supposed to circle. All I'm saying is that it was a musical.
