Many critics regard him as one of the greatest stinkers of all time (certainly the greatest stinker of career by director Brian De Palme). when he and his mistress Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) were involved in the escape. His story is described by another self-reliant guy, reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Villis). Well, as I said in my summary ... </ br> What would this film be? It seems to combine comedy, drama and satiety, but definitely does not contribute much. It is undermined by unimaginably disgusting, one-dimensional characters that you would never want to have dissatisfaction with encountering real life. I'm not a big fan of the novel (I started reading it once, but I could not finish it because I did not like it), but it's obvious to me that those who enjoy the novel regard this film as a complete travesty. I've never been seen so many talented actors tend to give a movie below average, something similar to quality and fail. What a loss. The problems begin with the casting of the fine guy Tom Hanks into a role that obviously should have been insensitive. And the role of Peter Falla in the novel was the role of the British. Bruce Villis is bad, he acted poorly. What was the thinking there? By the way, even Morgan Freeman can not escape from the film while his dignity is intact, because he is obliged to surrender a poor, difficult lecture on 'jurisdiction' after the climax. /> This movie turns into an absurd farce. I loved a set of talents; for that I will give him four out of ten, but I'm sure some people will say that a much better movie could have been made from original material.
