Why did I spend my money on this last Sundance day? I want a refund ... Can I get my $ 16 back? While watching this film, I waited for something to happen, nothing happened. The only way I even knew what it was supposed to be was reading the action, which was not actually a movie. why the director zoomed in with his handsome camera and then reduced it? It was not very artistic. Why did the director show Lulu to let his nails for fifteen minutes? Why did the actors try to speak, they sounded like they read? Or is it the point? I felt like Phantom Love did not have a story at all, and to be honest, I felt like my friends with rest had much more fun value than this movie.
