Sadly, the sad sight is really Munster's Revenge. Munsters returned the last time (Fred Givnne got a huge salary to return to the role of Hermann Munster) in this film made for TV on a pair of waxed replicas of Dede and Herman who robots "terrorized" the city as a preparation for the robbery of a hidden mummy at the exhibition. With the police on their heels, two older television icons are trying to find out who actually stands behind the crimes in order to clean up their names. We see them dressing as waitresses (a smaller peak in the film), the grandfather turns into a bat with a fixed wire several times (one time even flying to Transylvania, and Herman somehow invokes his frequent flyer miles), and an annoying cousin "Fantom" constantly sings and breaks glass ad nausium! What is most urgent is difficult to determine: whether Givnne (especially) and Al Levis seem so exhausted in every scene and so indifferent to the material. Whether they are hockey robotic costumes that have an insight into the value of school production. Maybe it's a funny scenario. Sid Caesar is crazy, mostly incomprehensible. Or maybe it's something that has brought me joy and nice memories as a child who is treated with the super-fashion of K-Mart fashion. In any case, the result is extremely disappointing and stupid even for Munster standards. As for the rest of the acting team, Ivonne De Carlo is adequate in most empty roles (although she shows more d√©collet than usual for her wife's years and experiences). K. C. Martel makes ever so rude Eddie Munster. Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings as Phantom looks and acts and speaks in a more absurd way. The movie has a real cheap feeling even for a movie made for TV.
