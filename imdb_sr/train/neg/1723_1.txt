Man, what a scam this was! Not because it was not good (because I did not expect any of it), but because I was seduced by a sleeve of DVD that paraded in ignorance with its "stars" like Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Of course, their names did not appear in films to open the movie, and even less in the rest of the movie !! As it turns out, the only movie that connects these three actors is equally unclear LAS VEGAS LADI (1975) ?? but what has to do with the CRATER LAKE MONSTER was anyone speculating? Still, after I paid $ 1.50 for hire and I was in any mood in a monster movie, I chose to watch a movie no matter what, and, stunk! Apart from the fact that he had an unnamed actor and anonymous crew, the unquenchable amateur air was visible from miles away, and the most I could do was laugh with JAVS-like claims, and deliberately, on the resilient foolishness of the two moronic laymen-the owner of boats that often confront each other with an imaginary local sheriff. Just a creature ?? plesiosaur tj. half dinosaur / half fish ?? is imperfectly realized (naturally) but, as was the case with GIANT CLAV (1957), which I also saw, this did not bother the filmmakers because they say it as much as they can, especially during the second half of the film!
