I will take care of the action Alice, who survived the previous sequel of the Nightmare series, found deadly dreams of Freddie Krueger, starting again. This time, the murder of the killer is striking through the sleepy mind of Alisa's unborn child. His intention is to "be born again" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice relieve her ghost in time to save her son? This movie began very well as we see that Alice dreams that Amanda Kruger stuck in the room and was raped by 100 Manics, and then rushed to the hospital, but then she was no longer pregnant, but Amanda reborn Freddie . . Alice and Dan are the only two people who returned from the 4th film and then got some new friends, shortly before Freddie began to kill again, I was the first dead in a row, not as good as other deaths or dreams. Freddie did not even think that Scari was in this movie, the nightmare was just boring, they were neither intimidating nor creepy. /> Film performance was fine for the 5th film in the series, but generally I think this film was really boring. (Not yet the worst movie in the series, Freddy Dead is the worst) 4/10
