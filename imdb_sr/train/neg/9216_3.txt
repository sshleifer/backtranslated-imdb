Hoo boi, this was a real trial to pass. In the case of a DVD, Tom Hanks's mug is plastered and that's the only reason anyone would buy it. It looks about forty in a box, however, the film was made in 1982, so he still has his friends from the group Bos, and of course it is about forty pounds lighter. The action refers to Dungeons and Dragons like the game played by Hanks and his three friends and Hanks ends up thinking that the whole thing is real. Chris Makepeace is a kid genius named Jai Jai and the best thing in the movie is to carry a set of funny hats. Ooh, look, he has a yellow hardhat with a cuddle! He is now dressed as a pilot of World War I! This was a really terrible film, but in a bad way. A bunch of veterinarians appears mostly as parents of children. There's Anne (I'm Honey Vest, hell!) Francis and Louise Sorel, which looks hot. Murrai Hamilton, Mayor of Javs, has an unlucky act as a policeman. Wendy Crewson, is a love interest for Hanks and some blond guy I never saw before or after. There is some syrup music there and there is absolutely no tension or feeling of danger or excitement. There is a monster that only Hanks can see because, you know, it's crazy. The monster plays the late, the great Kevin Peter Hall, he celebrated Predator. My friend took this from a garbage dump at MallVart and advised me to throw him in the garbage without looking at him at all, so I naturally had to see if it was just as bad. Was. The previous night, I watched Apollo 13, and after that the film was a little shocked. Do yourself a favor and leave it in your can. Oh, yes, after Hanks nearly jumped from one of the towers of the World Trade Center for his misconceptions, he goes home to recover and visits his friends. Hanks' mother, drunk Vera Miles, says she is now moving nicely, but when they get down to the lake to visit him in his tennis equipment, he's crazy than ever. The end
