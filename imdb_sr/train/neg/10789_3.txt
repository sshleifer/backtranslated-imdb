If you expect a lot to see in the Alt覺oklara bathroom, as promised in the label line, you will be very disappointed when you see that the film does not consist solely of the populist style of Alt覺oklara in connection with the most famous topics such as sex, marriage and cheating. For many nudity, which seems to emerge from nowhere and has nothing to do with any story, it is proven that Alt覺oklar unsuccessfully "tried something new," as he quoted. It seems that many sexual jokes show that Alt覺oklar fell to the famous saying "sex sale". I was hoping to see a very good story told by a very good narration technique. However, in the end, I found myself sitting 90 minutes and watching Altioklar's experimental work still focused on popularism.
