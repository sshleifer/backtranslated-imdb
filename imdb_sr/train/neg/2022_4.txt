Man, this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books. Frankly, from the beginning I realized that it was too slow and unattractive. I was constantly waiting for a little vapor, but that never happened. This film is overrated. Shakespeare, with English King James, never liked me, so it could only be me. In the first half of the film there is a fair number of the latter, as Ronald Colman plays the role of Othelle. Good sides of the film include - thanks to the revamped press - some decent Cinema and young, lean and attractive Sheli Winter. All in all, this is simply too boring, too many repetitions in some scenes to be viewed again. In addition, we all know that most actors are accidental, but they have been praised by Hollivood to demonstrate here in this story.
