Dukes of Hazzard are quite a achievement? a $ 53 million movie burning from any episode of a 25-year TV show. The action is sufficiently helpful, but a foolish party can rarely be found and casting is quite cruel: Johnny Knokville is more of a passenger than a protagonist, M.C. Gainey's sheriff Roscoe is an irrepressible nonsense, Enos bored Michael Weston, apparently an ideal actress Villie Nelson, who seems to be waiting for Burt Reinolds, stuck in a purgatory where he is condemned to re-live his old films. It's an interesting choice for Boss Hogg, but he has a good moment with hackers and a $ 100 bill. Do you know that the film is in trouble when Seann Villiam Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most screening screen? But worse than scenario or casting is the hopeless direction of Jaia Chandrasekhar: apparently born without the concept of a comedian, incapable of doing much more than the basic two-shot and apparently I do not know how to shoot in a car, let alone a couple of decent Stunts in the movie, it seems that he is determined to undermine the film of all signs of life before materializing. There are several neat postmodern moments about the Confederate flag and Daisy's stereotyped roles in each episode, but no movie that fights you for the days when Hal Needham directed such things (and bad) can be a good thing.
