Do not expect much from this movie. In many ways this film resembles a film Doris Dan played in 1956, the title, Julie. In this film, Doris, who was the stewardess, stewardess, at that time, dropped the craft after her husband was beaten, played by Louis Jordan fired at the captain. She worked much better, more convincing than Kim Ojah, who took control of 747 and managed to land without help from the control tower. I know a little about 747 aircraft, and I myself was a stewardess. As I said, do not expect much from this film, it's done on a cheap budget. Manufacturers had to cheaply use an aircraft with the name of the airline on it. Oceanic is one name that has been used by several films. The only writing on this plane was the name of the company that made the plane.
