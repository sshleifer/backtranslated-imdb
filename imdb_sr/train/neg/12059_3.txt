The 80's were not very nice to the former star Charles Charles Bronson. Beginning in 1982, "Death Vish II" and ending with this really terrible film from '89, Bronson's screenwriters seemed to be trying to move each other in progressive rudeness. "D.V. II" left little imagination in the account of rape and suicide of Bronson's daughter of character (rape and murder of his housewife is also shown in disgusting details). "10 am to midnight" was the movie that dislodged the head and made you swallow later. Nothing can be used. Other films such as "The Evil People Do" and the remaining "Death Vish" films from this period were shot down between the line of the high camp and the high bar, with their serious displays of brutality and revenge. I'm not sure whether the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) have the opportunity to show a tired look, the older Bronson elderly citizen who destroys punks that are young enough to be his grandchildren or what, but poor production (and terrible scripts) these films usually destroyed what a little energy they generated. The "kinite" - the last of these films - is pretty well made, but it really takes a cake in the film misery. In this film Bronson: sodomizes the perverse John; forced the pimp to eat his Rolek clock; allows a prisoner to be raped by another prisoner; he creates incredible xenophobic remarks, among other things, that I have forgotten. A rape of a young Japanese girl was also shown (fortunately, it was out of the screen, although well implicated). What did people think when they filmed this movie? What did Bronson think when he decided to destroy his career with these terrible movies? For anyone who is interested in his best films, take a look at most of the films he filmed in the 60's and 70's as a "Mechanic", "Death Wish", "From Up to Three", "Once in the West", "Red Sun "," Great Escape "," Magnificent Seven "," Rider in the Rain ", etc., etc.
