... and yet, we were told, there was an hour and 20 minutes left. Why, oh, why there was no editor that would tell the writer / director that he was a snake, a snake, a snake? It is obvious that the writer / director has already made short films; as briefly, this would be fine. However, the lack of dialogue starts to grow after twenty minutes. Lack of much music. Background noise (speech, traffic, and especially omnipresent helicopter) become very old. But the worst failure is in the story. It's a little bit farther than a short one. After an hour we saw variations of the same scene over and over again. I almost screamed on the screen: "We understand it, we get it !!!!!" It was amazing that after that we left the theater, we could take home, watch Daili Shov and parts of Colbert's report, prepare for the bed and know that the audience was still trapped in the cinema. It's not enough to enjoy your vision. You need to give enough audience to share your vision.
