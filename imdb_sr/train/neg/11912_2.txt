The story behind this movie is very interesting, and the plot is not so bad ... but the details: writing, directing, continuity, pacing, action sequence, acrobatics and the use of CG are all cheaper and spoil the movie. br /> First, action sequences. Everyone is pretty unimaginable. The majority consists in someone standing up and shooting, not trying to escape, fight, escape, or anything else, even though he has all the time in the world. Sequences look flawless for something that was made in 2004. The CG has very nice animated effects, but they look cheap because of the way they are used. Pacing: Everything is going too fast. For example, "Elle" is trained to fight for a few hours, and back-flips can work from the start, etc. Why is it so acrobatic? None of this is explained in the movie. Like Lilith, she should not be able to return the flips - she might not have, because she had wings. Also, we have sequences like a woman who has run a car, and gets up and just flies into an abandoned room with a sink and a mirror, and then snap into the throat, all for no reason, without any spectator to really care that he just hit the car (and then I felt the secondary effects of another, explosive car) ... "Are you okay?" she asks the driver, "Yes, I'm fine," she says, bloody and disheartened. All I watched was because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting ... but in the end, bad execution made me want to do anything else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, even that movie with vampires where Jackie Chan was a comic relief, because they managed to suspend my infidelity, but that just made me wake up the director, and give the writer a good conversation.
