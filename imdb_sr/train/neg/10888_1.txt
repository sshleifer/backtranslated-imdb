This film is absolutely horrible. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story almost does not exist, characters are full of stereotypes, and Special-FKS just laughs at you. The only significant thing in this movie is the hosting of rapper Kulia as a kind of policeman. If this film should have been a comedy, I did not quite understand it. If you want to watch this movie: please first get drunk, then prepare for some good laugh ... especially when the first Special-FKS appears on the screen. But if you love trash movies cheaply: this movie is for you unavoidable.
