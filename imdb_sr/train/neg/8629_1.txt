Dear Richard, I know we all loved you at Home Improvement with Tim Allen. But seriously, do you have nothing else to do but the poor buddies for Air Bud? I thought that Tim might have had little or no role to play, or even become his personal assistant. I know it does seem ironic, but the payouts are much more useful. Everyone would see you around the Team and think about "Time to Tool". They would even have more roles with Bob Villa. Instead, it appears for 10 minutes with a Golden Retriever and a smile. I know there were not many scenarios, but you could add it. I mean, come on. The team owes you. But seriously, this film does nothing for Air Bud line. On the contrary, fake puppies in speech are stubier than they see dogs. The original was better. And you, g. Richard Karn, you know more than anyone. This is "F" movie.
