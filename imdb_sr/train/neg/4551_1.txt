I have to admit that I do not keep a lot of Nev Age mumbo jumbo. When people "exchange energy," I always wonder how much kJ is actually exchanged and how it can contribute to solving the problems of global warming. When energy is "imposed", I always wonder how they managed to violate the laws of entropy and still do not have the Nobel Prizes. When people feel how much their instinct allows them to move smoothly through the complexity of life, I wonder how they can not do a simple thing like finding a train station. But again, this is not the first cavity film and most of them I find perfectly acceptable and fun. If this was the case with "The Celestine Prophets," I would not burn this movie, but unfortunately it was not. It seems that every actor is bored of his head and is not able to understand what he should actually do at the site. This results in many "Ah-s" and "Oh-s", as I tend to talk about quantum physics with someone who actually knows what he's talking about and pretends to understand. The direction is also uninspired. You can expect something more than the type of "What Dreams Can Come", but hey, I suppose he's well paid for the job and adopted the New York taxi driver's attitude: "It's your money, my friend ..." only one who seems to be Jurgen Prochnov is entertaining. Not only does he have a job, he is one of the few actors in this film who may have a few wise cracks in this eternal and terribly boring Nev Age conversation. This movie is similar to movie dates for dinner, when you find out that your date is actually a terrible boredom that seems unable to shut down. At one point it seems that words are converted into small ping pong balls that are constantly thrown into your head until it hurts. If you want to have a good time and choose between this film and putting safety pins in your eyelids, take my advice: choose this one else.
