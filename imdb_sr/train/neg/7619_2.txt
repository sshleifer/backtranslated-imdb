As a fan of the Misteri Science Theater 3000, I can withstand any movie image that I can impose, but there is no reason to do so. It's rated "Super Action" in Blockbuster Video section and give Dreaded "Restricted Vieving Sticker" I suppose these are the only methods that Robert Napton's film director (HA!) could use to get at least 4.50 out of one a person who does not doubt. Shame on you is Robert Napton! You are ashamed that you used these poor Mexican actors that you probably promised to be great in American cinema. You are a shame! There is not a single moment in this film that contains even the smallest action. Have you used bales on these people? Oh, look, they have rave in the field! Like all six of them. And is not it the Asian in the background? Why is it always the day? Why did it take 1/2 of a movie to show anything ... and more importantly, why did we look at the other half? PS: You owe me 4.50.
