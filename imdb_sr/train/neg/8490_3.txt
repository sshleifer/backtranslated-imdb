This was a good try, but it's too pretentious and boring to rise above the low budget look. The use of virtual sets almost works, but at some points it fails. They have used the small budget well. I just want to talk and make most of the acting better. There are many parts in which you see what they were targeting and it would be great if they really hit those labels but they were not. A confusing and incredible story. Bad DVD transfer too. I do not need much to watch a movie in one sitting. I had to turn this off. It was too boring. I can do slower movies. But just make them attractive in some aspect. Visual, story, acting, etc. This was lacking in all departments, so never had a great experience. Perhaps the next attempt to make the movie will be better.
