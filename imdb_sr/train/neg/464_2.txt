This film is by no means ridiculous; he tries to be ridiculous with a humorous humor, which is so dry and boring that the film is only 2 hours of torture. Throughout the whole film I was thinking about one thing, "When will this end". One thing you have to give them is that they have very few funny moments, and that is why I gave it two stars. It is notorious and uses almost every old blond joke in the book, even those that were not funny for the first time. Basically, it's a movie that disparages blondes and records the whole reputation of blue jokes. All in all, this movie is a bad bland humor. Look, that's so bad.
