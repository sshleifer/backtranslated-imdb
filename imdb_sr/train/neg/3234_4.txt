So, how do you rate a movie like this one at all? Does it have film value at all? It's a movie that's trying to get as close to the snuff as possible. Basically, the entire movie is just a bunch of people who are tormenting a young girl. It's not very attractive and, on top of that, it's not so realistic. It is obvious that the film tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible. However, the film is too fake for it to function as intended. Slapping and hitting is soft and fake, as well as sounds. They often just hit the floor, not the girl, obviously. Also, the way the girl answers all the troubles is pretty loud. I think this was real, it would surely scream. However, in this case there is more mourning than screaming. The movie is obviously a small budget and it's an attempt to achieve something shocking and realistic, as well as original and challenging, with very limited resources. I do not really think this film made a big impact even though it was at the time it was published, although it had to do something good, since after this it was issued a total of six sequels. The fans of the shock and the ups will most likely be disappointed with this film, although there are still some fetish people who will get a kick from this movie. 4/10
