ANDI HARDI MEETS DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth (ninth) film of the series and shows the direction in which it inevitably started. The characters ANDI HARDI (Mickei Roonei) and JUDGE HARDY (Levis Stone) were front and center. The rest of the actors went only for an hour and collected checks. The series would rise again to this occasion and had its moments, but there was a fatal fall. Levis Stone continued to show the character JUDGE HARDI throughout the series in a nice way. The rest of the actors would be professional, even less and less. On the other hand, Mickei Roonei would continue his character as if he had no learning curve. ANDI's reaction to every situation was naive and incredible. Even after he returned as a veteran in the service of World War II in LOVING DEATH ANDI HARDI (1946), his reaction to any "tea hot" was the same, minor. In this film is clearly shown. ANDI enters several incredible situations that would be solved by simple explanation. This screen capture device was known as 'idiotic plotting'. A tool for developing a badly written script. Perhaps he is guilty of Mickey Rooney and then the director and writers. Most likely, George B. Seitz directed one too, and a more robust hand is needed to control the excesses of Rooneys. To see our review of the entire series, go to IOU'RE ONLI IOUNG ONCE (1937).
