If you see this party listed in your TV guide, AVOID AS A PLAGUE !!! Start describing how this movie is bad! There is only one funny scene (a memory-erasing scene), but even one that has only .001 on a smile guy (out of 1000). Whoever wrote this party should be banned from writing another film of his entire life.
