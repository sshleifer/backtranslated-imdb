This Hamlet was made for one of the boring MST3000 episodes ever. I am not a fan of Shakespeare, but I do not believe that he ever intended his works to be so slow and shiny. It is also one of the hardest films that can be found, because there are so many Hamlets. As I said, although this is pretty boring. In black and white, pacing is slow and has a minimal scene. Actors are all called so it does not help. This is one MST 3000 that I can not look at in one sitting, because the way the guy who plays Hamlet says his lines can sleep everyone.
