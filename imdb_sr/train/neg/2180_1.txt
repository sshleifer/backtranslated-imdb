Where to start, it's so wrong and terrible in this movie. I'm not sure where to start. Okay, two puppies who wrote this crapper. Joseph Green and Rek Carlton, they could not invent their own so-called minds for the first time. I suppose they have divided the difference, so the main title is BRAIN that would not die, but the end screen says HEAD that will not die. Nothing knows anything about the medical profession. After all doctors take oaths to "do no harm". Killing a woman for head transplantation would be considered "harmful". Plus, something called blood and tissue. Rejection would mean death for Jan in the pan. Plus who keeps the monster for patch work. Which medical school was graduated from Bill, FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITIES? Old FU, or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster did not have a name that drove me. Plus, brilliant surgeon doctor Bill Cortner does not know how to keep a patient under sedatives? It's all a catastrophe of the movie, it's incredibly stupid and invisible, except for MST3K. I give her THANKSGIVING TURKEY.
