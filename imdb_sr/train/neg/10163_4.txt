When I reflect on the discovery that the main character in "Bubble" comes at the end of the movies, I recalled the last years of "Machinist" with Christian Bale. The only difference between these two films is the literary physical weight of the characters. Underestimated, but quite a realistic view of life in a small town. The title is the reason for thinking. Maybe we, the audience, are those who are in "Bubble", because they have not given us any payouts in films that are thin for 90 minutes. Audiences' responses were often complacent and condemned, clearly indicating how many people can be separated from seeing any human thread in such strange characters. These characters are those people call people who return George V. back to work for the second term. legs to get out as soon as the role of the loan. This film has its merits and deserves attention for what it does not say.
