I have two big objections to this film. 1. That my local store has leased what is very clear soft pornography in the category of "uncertainty". (If I knew what it was, I would not be wasting my time to rent it. Yes, this film is a soft core of pornography.) 2. The title has nothing to do with the film. Nobody in this film does anything that would be deviant or obsessive, let alone a combination of these two things. For some reason I watched the movie long enough to find out number two on this list. Man, I'm sorry about that. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistake. This film is worthless at almost every level.
