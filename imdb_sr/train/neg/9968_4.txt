As a former teacher (!) I must admit that through the multitude of scenes - although I continued to look to the end. I wonder why?! (Bored, maybe?) :-) The initial opening scenes came to me as incredible mouse-mice and not focused. And the plot, although there were some good ideas - for example, teachers for relief - were not concentrated enough in any direction for the development of three-dimensional development. <br /> <br /> None of the g. moments. As for the young Mr. Macchia, does he thus speak in any * film? On the side of the plot and the acting complaints, only the hairstyles were nostalgic (if it was a painful) journey. <br /> <br />
