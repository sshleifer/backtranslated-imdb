This is the most depressing film I've ever seen. I first saw him as a child, so even thinking about it really disturbs me. I know it was at a time when life was difficult and I know that these people were poor and that the crops were vital. Yes, I have all that. What's hard for me is that I can not remember a single light moment in the whole movie. Maybe it was true, I do not know. I am completely sure that the acting was top-notch, and the direction and quality of the recording, etc. He was wonderful and I know that every movie can not have a happy ending, but as a family movie, it's terrible for me. I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to have fun with the movie. I can not emphasize enough how this film influenced me as a child. I've talked about it recently and all the sad memories have come back. I think it would have been until the touchless reach of Prozac.
