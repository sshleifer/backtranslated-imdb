What the "noise" does not succeed is to indicate us to understand its character. Tim Robbins plays the obsessive New Yorker who can no longer deal with the city's intrusive sounds, especially car alarms. It's a strange idea for a movie that has so many creative credibility as Death Vish. It's smart at the points; especially the scene in which our hero tries to read Hagel: "I'm too stupid to figure this out." He reads confusedly and revises the paragraph, we read it and we do not understand it. Only then is the car alarm extinguished. Through the film, the alarm and city noise are constantly being mixed. Nevertheless, everything does little to help us understand our hero, who allows all of this to ruin his marriage and draw attention to plots instead of digging deeper into his personality. The production of the film itself is too unconscious to notice its own problems with sound, poor mounting and visible bum microphones. No, "Noise" is not very bad. Villiam Hurt is at least painted. At least the end does not fall. All in all, this leads to a logistics point, which you probably did not think. At least not. Although all in all, ninety minutes, it could not have been completed earlier. The story receded and seemed to be lost as soon as it started. This is another of the films you can see at the film festival, but they will probably not be bought for distribution. Check on the DVD if you are really in favor of someone involved in the project. Otherwise skip it.
