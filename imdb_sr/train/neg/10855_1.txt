This is certainly a comedy I will not forget for a while. I would not try to comment on this movie at all: it's so small that nobody would watch it, but as it happens, it's kind of popular in p2p networks like Kazaa, so this saaad production must be exposed to what it is. Well, of course, this is not a comedy; Instead, it was conceived as a horror film - "Intentional" was the key word here. The scenario is a completely inconsistent and unbalanced mess, special effects are only special in that they are especially pathetic, and as for the acting, well, let's just say that this was my graduation game in elementary school, my teachers of course I understand that this film with a very low budget and that in these cases it is necessary to reduce their expectations, especially as far as things like special effects are concerned. Also, although I am a big fan of the horror genre, I am aware that these films are rarely places to search for interesting scripts and top-notch actions. But still. B-films often have some of the features that can compensate for the lack of resources, such as humor. The only laugh in Cradle to Fear lies in ridiculous performances. If you can find humor in it - and I could do it for the first 20 minutes or so, gradually catch up after that - then it will be the only thing that a movie can offer. Oh, it's two or three pairs of breasts. Voohoo, how exciting is it. As for the story, it does not even try to convey anything: victims or use drugs and / or are involved in serious crimes. Lesson: Beware of inferior boys and girls, because one day you will be ready to pay for what you have done. all in all, a little sex, a lot of drugs, but absolutely zero rock'n roll. . Or maybe I would not: deserve 1 for the correct writing of actors' titles. I mean, that's something, is not it?
