This movie is too skeletal. It's a fairly low-budget film (I hope!) It justifies it, but the lack of a decent actor and accentuated action hurts him too much. Phillips is quite convincing in his role as a tearful son of a well-off family who is looking for himself (although his family ... er ... well, a little too white ...), but the rest of the plaster is caught for straws. Every moment that has the potential is destroyed by an excessive melodrama, and there is also a way * too sub-plot (which is an obvious sign of a lack of action. They should have filled them ...) I would not recommend this movie to anyone not even a hard-core Phillips fan , or who has absolutely nothing to do. 4/10.
