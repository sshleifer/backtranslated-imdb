This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. When a man says he wants to have the super power he can enjoy in his mouth, I think that the film is in the domain of children's 14-year-old male fantasies. The scene of the bedroom was above the top and reduced the intimate moment in the farce of biological functions similar to the passing of gas to the public. From the first every second scene there was a discussion about how a little sex got, how long it went since they got something, when their next sexual relationship would be and with whom it would be. Moreover, dialogue and acting were very poor and very forced, they did not feel, and they fulfilled their lack of content with humorous sexual scenes. This could be really funny, because the concept is really interesting, but here it's badly done. Please do not even think of taking anyone under the age of 16 if you have to see him.
