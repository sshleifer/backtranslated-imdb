In fact, it never was. I'm not sure why Billy Cristal wanted to make a humorous comedy from the 1940s. What a gap is breaking! None of these people are approaching Cari Grant, Spencer Traciu, Katherine Hepburn, etc. Writing is trivial. The hacked plot is sharp and obvious. Chemistry between leading figures does not exist. Interestingly, Julia Roberts thinks that the reincarnation of a great star from the "golden age of Hollywood" is whenever it can be. It's an effect that is trying and failing to achieve once again with Richard Gere in Runaway Bride.
