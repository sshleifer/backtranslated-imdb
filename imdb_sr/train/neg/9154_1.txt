THE. VORST. MOVIE. EVER. MADE. After watching this allegedly gay movie, I suppose someone was hiding a brain that was damaged by a semi-blind neo-Nazi and forced him to make the worst gai film ever, all in an attempt to attack gay culture. I had to stop the movie and invite a friend to come only so that I have someone to blur when I stopped the movie from shock, and the anger of such a pure nonsense will be unbelievable. On top of everything terrible writing and acting and an illogical and stupid plot, just a bad movie. A dog with a handicam attached to the tail could have been better off. Seriously, after reading a few positive reviews of this film, I guess the writer must have half a dozen IMDb accounts. Anyone who says that this movie is even visible as anything other than a joke, is a liar or hard to pay to say it.
