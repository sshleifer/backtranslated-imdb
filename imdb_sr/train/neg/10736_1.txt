The film begins with an intriguing scene, three people drink and talk in the bar. They all make a little unheard of stories. As the film unfolds, it turns out that the worst story is true. However, in addition, the film is not interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene in which the main secret is revealed. This discovery takes place only halfway through the film and frankly, there is not much left to be seen. For the rest of the time, the director is kept in a godly abandoned Russian village full of poor and creepy old women. Of course, these are fascinating and somewhat shocking images, but admiration takes place too long, sacrificing every possible development of a plot or a character. I found this film as another example of a bad or lazy creation of a film, where instead of trying to make an interesting story, filmmakers concentrate on strangely fascinating images and through several almost unconnected stories (the case - a trader's story with flesh) leave the viewer to grasp all the chances and goals. On the surface there is an artistic look, but in this case it is nothing more than a lack of talent.
