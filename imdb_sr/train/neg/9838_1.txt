This movie is horrible. Responsible scenes of the fight or not, acting is really bad, as you can say to read their lines from the card. With the painful delivery of lines by everyone in the cast. Think about watching the idea of ​​a high school and banging on the apparent lack of smoothness in the actor's interaction (strange breaks between lines of different characters, combined with the roaming delivery of the line by others). If the movie was an action, it could be forgiven, but many movies include placement of the plot and the style of Famili Gui, irreverent cut avais (Oh, wow, are they badly made). I suppose they were trying to be funny with this, but again it came as a bunch of high school students at college students who went out in the afternoon trying to set up a funny Ioutube clip. Now on the scene of the fight. They are not so bad, given the quality level seen everywhere in the movie. Nothing great, certainly not at the same level as other posters stated (Nothing like a drunken master). Fighting has an overstated atmosphere, with many cuts at different angles with obviously different positions of those involved. All in all, the only reason to watch this movie is that you were one of the friends who were involved in this very, very cheap production. Who would you ask? The same guy who wrote, directed, produced and stared at this high school masterpiece.
