This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The acting is bad and the story is almost incomprehensible. Do you like light vessels or any boats for this thing are irrelevant. As far as special effects are concerned, there is no film. The entire film crew was probably on a boat in rough seas, and not in the studio, and when some of the men were "stabbed" (if you can even call it), their reactions are completely unreal. The weapon is quieter than the silent. How this film can have two awards, seriously questions the human mind. Well that's about it. This review is probably more fun to read than to film. If someone thinks about watching or buying him, I would seriously advise you against this for obvious reasons. I said it includes the spoiler. If the fact is that some people are stabbed and the gun is fired, it's a reward game. I guess that's because they're the only good parts of the movie.
