I bought this DVD without previous references, but the names of John Huston, Rookel Velch, Mae Vesta and Farrah Favcett on his covers. I found the Brazilian title very strange, but I decided to watch how I expect to see a funny comedy, perhaps like "Swatch". However, the story without meaning is horrible and difficult to describe. Miron Breckinridge (Rek Reed) was subjected to an operation to change sex in Copenhagen and returned to Hollywood saying that she would be Mira Breckinridge (Rakuel Velch) and to own half of her uncle Buck Loner (John Huston). During the day, Mira and her alter-ego Miron were ruined by a young couple at her uncle's academy with kinky sex. At some point, the messy scenario is so confused that I believe that the entire story was just the journey of Miron caused by an accident. Unfortunately, the beauty of Rakuel Velch and Farrah Favcett are not enough to keep this film. My voice is three. Title (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher Ate Certo Ponto" ("Man and woman up to a certain moment")
