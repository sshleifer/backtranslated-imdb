From what she meant? Vhoopi Goldberg plays a cops in the future who associate with a dinosaur who speaks (!) In the case of a crime involving a lunatic who wants to start another ice age. The strangeness that is right on the tape is embarrassing and ridiculous, a high concept in search of oneself. Obviously, it was the work of love for his writer-director, Jonathan Betuel (who was also one of the producers); Unfortunately, the end results are anemic, charity. Goldberg's presence on the screen can often cause good will and laughter, no matter how bad the script is, but here it is drowning and you can see frivolous results. NO STARS from ****
