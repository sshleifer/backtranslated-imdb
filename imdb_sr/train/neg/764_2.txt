It seems that the screenplay for this Columbo movie has been withdrawn from the 1980s soap. Deep-character movies are great, but only if characters are tempting. And in this movie, the only thing that was tempting was my desire to change the channel. The evil one's dialogue sounds like it was written by a romantic novelist. Great Lieutenant Columbo himself is not even close to his famous, sympathetic, self-congested, crushed self; and the victim of a bride / kidnapping is a crying, one-dimensional girl in distress (afraid of the scarlet scalp who held it trembling in the hands of her kidnappers - come on! I could throw a scalpel out of his hand and kick him in what you know for 2 seconds). In any sense of reality, this character would at least try to fight or repay. And when we talk about reality ... the story revolves around the abduction that the police are working and solving. Police?? Give me a break. Everyone knows that the FBI takes every case of abduction. This was NO Columbo, just a shallow and completely predictable crime drama with our famous lieutenant Columbo, written and enlarged to 2 hours.
