This movie is bad. I'm not just thinking of 'bad' as in; "Oh the script was bad," or; "The act in that scene was bad" ... I think bad, because in somebody it should be considered criminally responsible for putting this immovable pile of steam raw materials on the public. I will not even enrich it with the explanation (Plot?) If I can call it like that. I can only imagine another opportunity for some 40 years of watching movies that I found the need to breathe my spleen on the movie. I mean, after all, nobody is going to make a bad movie, right? Well, yes. They seem to have ... and the culprit is the writer / director of Ulli Lommel. But the worst of all is that Blockbusters actually rent this to their customers! Be warned. Leave this shit where it belongs. Stuck on the shelf, collecting dust.
