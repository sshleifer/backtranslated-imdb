Early film directed by D.V. Griffith; there is a magnificently happy king (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but, wait! When the king leaves the scene, his queen makes music with the palace Minstrel (Henri B. Valthall). When the king reveals lovers, he decides to bring a terrible vengeance to the type of Edgar Allen Poe. It's hard to believe that lovers can not hear the plot against them; although actors try to look alternately noisy (lovers) and silent (cement mixers). The sets make the "Sealed Room" look very stagnant. The performances are fine, and the story is easy to follow. *** Sealed Room (9/2/09) D.V. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henri B. Valthall, Marion Leonard
