If you've seen the previous films and plays by Rodney Dangerfield, you will recognize a few jokes made in this strange piece of shit. Written like sitcoms, this movie fails to hit any kind of nice chord, from the self-helpdog doctor Molly Shannon to 'I'm fat, and that's funny' by John Linette. The five women themselves are kind enough, and if this is done as a pilot for a series of action adventures, it may have succeeded. Instead, he is released as a male fantasy trying to be politically incorrect.
