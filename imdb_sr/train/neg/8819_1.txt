this is no doubt the worst idiotically horrible piece I've ever seen. In this story about movies some guy is crazy and dresses like Santa Claus and kills people for having seen her mother give her father an oral sex while being dressed as a grandfather clause. THAT IS WHY HAS BEEN AWARDED? Is it just me or is it the worst reason that someone is crazy like EVER? and that's not the only thing. I'm serious when I say Nothing to Do in This Dummy Move. Nothing until 1 hour and 15 minutes did not pass. There is a whole frigina scene in which his pretty bearded bearded beard. That's FRIGGIN MINUTE LONG. WHO HELL WANT TO SEE YES? However, I have to say that I finished the film's end to laugh. so if you see this movie on TV or something comes back in an hour and 20 minutes just to watch the worst ending in the entire film history. And I'm serious about it. It's not even good that it's bad, it's boring, it's idiotic, it seemed to me that I wanted to break the vcr. It's just not worth your time and I'm sure every other review mentioned this, but the actress who played the mother at Home Improvement was in this movie a fraction of a second. YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT WAS THIS FILM? I WAS THE SUPREME IMPROVING FOR SIXTH SIXTH AMONG, ONE FAMILY VIEWS ONE.
