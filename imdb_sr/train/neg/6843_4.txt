A rather interesting exploitation of the black and white film by David F. Friedman. The main actress Stacey Valker is great and unusually attractive. It looks like a disturbed Rene Zellweger with a bad hairstyle. This girl made only two of these films and then returned to Texas. Music is terrible. One of her guys is Sam Melville (from THE ROOKIES) using a different name. The best line in the movie by Tony - "Do you put me on a doll? chicks put me on. Good B / V cinema by Las Vegas Kovacs (EASI RIDER & TARGETS and many others). Good locals (cool pool, which is also used in DEFILERS) A strange ending, but a fitting 4 out of 10. Best Stacey Valker performance.
