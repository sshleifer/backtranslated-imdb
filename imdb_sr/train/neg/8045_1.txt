I'm so confused. What is this film about in the world? What was the motivation of the killer? He acted quite angry, but I still did not understand why. Nothing in this movie made any sense. He had a zero depth. Or less than zero. I think it would be a hill. Or a bunch. Of crap. The acting was terrible. When I asked for a few actors in this film, they were in very few things that I heard, and that was no surprise. I can not decide whether to embarrass them because of the embarrassment of being so bad in the movie, or to feel that they would never again be offered another acting work. Starting. . . NOW! Really, however, do not waste time with this. There is so little substance that there is nothing even to be washed out there. It was undoubtedly one of the worst jerks - NO, one of the worst moves BILE WHAT KIND, I've ever had an accident to watch, and I've seen enough.
