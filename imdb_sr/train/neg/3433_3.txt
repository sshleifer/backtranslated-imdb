It's such a weird movie, you can call it terrible, or if you're sitting with friends can give you a killer laugh-athon. Strangely comes to mind again and again. Shoot amateur, it seemed worse and more dire, maybe no one. Special effects are ridiculous, but the music that follows the flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit. See if you have time to kill. But do not try to take it seriously. It should be a confession to 'Porno holokaustu'. Since I did not see him, I can respectfully say that it is so bad. It should have been given 1/10, but it smiled me well or two, so I get 3. Excessively worse, the only thing on which someone worked. Keep moving further if you're nasty, more blood than laughs. I wonder if the producers laughed?
