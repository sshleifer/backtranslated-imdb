And how it turned me into production, it amazes me. The main character is disgusting with a show that's not funny at all. I can not stand a character. He's a stupid donkey who has nothing to offer. This is the worst cartoon that appeared in the last 10 years without jokes. The stories are poorly written and executed. Jokes are as bad as those of Disney's Sweet Life of Zack and Cody. I could no longer dislike this show, it's terrible and I should have canceled it. Even the theme song is bad. The title, which is even worse. As if this show was written by a couple of 15-year-olds who based their character on themselves and think that they are hot things when they are really just arrogant and insufficient. creativity and humor. Johnny Test, go far and fast!
