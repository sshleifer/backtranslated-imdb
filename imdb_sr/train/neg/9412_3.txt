The film was screened at the Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival in 2007. I did not expect the film to choose for me. I actually love movies that need time to develop, movies that allow characters to develop and let the story flow. Silence is good. But this film was just slow. Credits have to go to two main players. There was a feeling of tension between them as two completely different nations, really unapproachable, in a very inconvenient way. There were unpleasant moments and sorrows as we learned more about them. I liked the environment and the way it was shot. She was claustrophobic and monochromatic and added the intimacy of the film and intensified the strangeness of the characters. Just do not understand the end. What is the point of everything?
