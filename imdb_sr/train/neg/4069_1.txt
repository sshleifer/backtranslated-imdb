Dear God! (which comes from an atheist), this "movie" is bad! Auditors have already said a lot (those who rated this piece 3 and below) to which I completely agree, I just want to add a few things: Among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive products, they were chopped by an ax, briskly by force, that his bits were torn off - the former boy was suffering from the most difficult torment, and he had to listen to the infinite and pointless party of the girl at the kitchen table (as we did, but at least we have the power of the mute button). The director cut off the dots - and the endless graveyard and reverse scene, our suffering would be over after 30 minutes. The only things that made this movie at least are feasible are Emily Haack tits (one point). Forget it. Do not buy it. do not waste your time. and your common sense. my brain was so burnt after I watched this. I feel the urgent need to watch (and suffer) the "Scrapbook" right now.
