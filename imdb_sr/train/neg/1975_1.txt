To be completely honest, I did not see so many Western movies, but I've seen enough to know what's good. This is by far the worst western on the planet today. First black people in the wild west? Come on! Who ever thought that it might have been cold from the film on the wall everyone would love, it was small, not no, completely retarded! Asian fish speaks perfectly English? If the environment is west, Asia is not where you go. Finally, the evil gay fish was too much, the film was just bullshit from the beginning. Now do not misunderstand me. the worst presentation of the black people I've ever seen!
