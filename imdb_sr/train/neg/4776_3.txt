I had to write a review of this film after I read another comment saying that this is the best movie of Sidney Pojater. Poitier has just returned from a break in the movie acting for more than a decade and is obviously creaking here. 11 of his films are mentioned in Wikipedia and they do not include it. 5 of his films are on the AFI list of 100 best inspirational films, again, not including this. Berenger and Poitier, a ruby ​​and a city troupe went on search for dangerous psychopaths before crossing the border to Canada. Some of the comedy attempts in this film obviously fail, and Berenger and Poitier's attachment were fragile and embarrassing (it was not helped by a gentle scenario). Kirstie Allei (as a host) was underutilized and virtually ignored when she was on the screen. An attempt was made to tense, for example, when you should try to guess which of the five men on a fishing trip is the killer (they are all typical villains). I understand that this is a whole appeal to most fans there. I assumed who it was and I did not really work. If you are a Berenger fan, watch Sniper (1993), you can even see Billy Zane as he is struggling. It's much better. All in all, I would give Shoot to Kill 3/10. It did not bother, and it's too easy for me.
