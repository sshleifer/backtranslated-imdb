Ð’. Somerset Maugham's Human Bondage is a classic English language. If so, much of it lacked the movie version. The attractiveness of Phillip (Leslie Howard) to Mildred (Bette Davis) is so inexplicable that the script would look like a rewriting relationship after the cessation of a relationship from the point of view of a man. As a family lawyer I have heard many such accounts; a man is shown to be noble and always right, and a woman is hellish, who has no other goal than to use a man. Indeed, unless someone wants to laugh at the social assumptions of the film director, this is an unpleasant movie to watch. Phillip even leaves Mildred when she brings a baby of indefinable paternity, but the real thing comes when Phillip allows Mildred - an angry and now suspicious reason - the free movement of his apartment, with predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive about five years of her life, but that period did not happen. In fact, she looks like the character Jane Jane until the end of the movie, which will play thirty years later. I notice that Howard's character is always impeccably dressed and well-groomed. He tells me that Phillip is curious for the middle class. Someone could not get away from a woman with a Cockney Accent course fast enough. Filip is a pupil for most of the films; such a person would be more convinced that he was younger, and he had a disheveled appearance that speaks of low income and low self-esteem, which often accompanies the status of a student - English Raskolnikov, as he wants. And it evenly allowed Mildred a little charm.
