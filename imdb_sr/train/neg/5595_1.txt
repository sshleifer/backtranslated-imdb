Wow ... OK. So, after I read this little quarrel, I decided to watch this movie for myself. This film is HORRIBLE. I stopped watching him. I recommend cleaning the cabin instead of watching this movie, you will be more scared / entertained. It's a small budget with bad behavior. Whoever gives the film 10s I'm by no means connected to any other reviewer. Simply put, this movie is not worth watching. > Very, very bad movie.
