Good-natured film about Sonja Horovitz (Renee Zellveger), wife of dedicated Talmud scholar Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). who is deeply unhappy. Mendel's brother Sender (Christopher Eccleston) sees this and hires her to work in a field where she is already a jewelry expert. He also starts an affair with her, and then when he spends time with a Puerto Rican artist, he throws and betrays the family, which turns it off. There is also a sub-page in which Sonya's dead brother talks to her, and is apparently in the form of a magical beggar, but why is not clear. Many things are not clear, unfortunately, including what happens to Sonya, why she tells Rebbe that she has a fire, and maybe she is not from God, and what it means, and what the magical beggar says it means. To some extent, the story touches on the position of women in the ultra-orthodox community, but Sonja is not really free. Nor is the idea of ​​redemption from the love of a man of another race very well thought out. The title comes from the biblical definition of the good woman's value, yet it is the bastard Sender quoted by Sonja. Zellweger is struggling with this work; it should have been a Jew from the middle of the west, and sometimes its accent is flat, and sometimes it is on the characteristic sounds of Brooklyn. She is in the best condition when she is tough and takes responsibility, but in the end, the movie is messy.
