Very bad movie. Very, very, very bad movie. It's rare, but definitely not worth hunting. This Italian fork does not make much sense for most of the time, and the rest does not make sense. "Aligator" is not convincing at all, and many sub-parcels do not go anywhere. If it's in a local video, you might want to watch it if you're a fan of a monster movie, but it's not worth hunting.
