Dr. Seuss would now be angry if he was alive. The cat in the hat shows how film production can take a classic story and turn it into a foolish pile of nonsense. Mike Miers is like a notorious Cat in a hat, a big mistake! Miers proves he can not play in this movie. He acted like a scarred girl with a thousand tricks in his sleeve. The children in this film are fine, somewhere between rows of boring and boring. The story is just like the original with a few adjustments and like most movies based on other stories, never adjust the original story! Bringing evil on neighbor Kuin was a bad idea. He's a stupid criminal who never gets in his life. This film is like a stripped-out comic from the newspaper if you think about it. The film surely looks sticky! Of course there are funny adult jokes like feline cuts of his tail, and the censor goes out before he says the wrong word, slightly funny. At least Grinch had the courage, and the movie was actually good! This film is a caricature piece of beam with bright colors and a bad central part. Is Mike Miers even in this movie? And more, fish. What about that stupid fish! The first time you see him, he's real fish. Next time you see him, he's all animated and storytelling. But it looks like an animated piece of rubber dough! This film is a total wreck. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised he even had a good joke like a water joke in a water park, that was good. So, please, if you have a choice, watch Grincha instead of this mess.
