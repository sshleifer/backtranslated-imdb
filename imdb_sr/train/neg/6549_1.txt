It's not that I want to be evil, but this film has made me very surprised. Throughout the film, I was like ... what is it about? I do not get animation at all. Probably this film will be suitable only for those who belong to the 80's. During the film, a group of people came out. After the film, many people said, "That's it?" Frankly speaking, I can not believe that this film was awarded the best children's film prize. If you are considering watching this movie, I recommend that you do not do this. You'll regret it. I'm not kidding. You'll discover that you just waste time and money from you and watch it.
