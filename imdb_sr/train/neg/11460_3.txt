Pretty funny piece that tries to show that they are smart Orcs, but in the meantime (and quite unconscious ones), makes the audience feel stupid by making the most funny movie. Richard Harris plays Quinta. I'm sorry, that's wrong, he plays captain Nolan, a fisherman who catches sharks for life, but he's attracted to a big catch and trying to catch the killer. When catching a female killer goes wrong (do not ask), this is a friend (do not ask) goes to the rampage (do not ask) and STALKING begins Captain Nolan (Do not Ask). Soon, captain Nolan realizes they have something in common (do not ask). Pretty incredible movie work here. I have to tell you that the beginning (with the sound of whales and nothing else) is quite obsessed, and the final credits (with the most beautiful song) are quite entertaining.
