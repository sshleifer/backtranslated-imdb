While others can claim that, in view of other Bilal's works, he will better understand this film, he collapses in a great way. It does not stand alone. The action is a confusion that confuses the symbolism of the substance. Here's an idea that starts with a particular story. Then symbolize the symbolism around it. We start with two different narratives, this woman who turns to a man in some way, "god" who for some reason is judged, but gets another final sweep on Earth, and that mysterious Ivan's figure that seems to be developing a kind of "resort" "" beyond the city limits Why? None of these questions were answered, but do we care, no. There is no development that would like to empathize any character in the story, closest to Jill, and even then the development at best, noticeable. Unfortunately, the film engages as a whole visually impre ivnom (which it is), but at the expense of motivational development. I would like to overwrite this from someone who might be a little distance itself from the material and not have to feel that each image must be in the picture.
