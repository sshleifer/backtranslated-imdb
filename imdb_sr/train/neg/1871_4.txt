Despite luxurious production numbers and beautiful costumes, this movie is a tiny job. The kill-mystery plan is just a means to launch music numbers, but this often leads to a standstill, except that it is not heavily involved. Although obviously a lot of money is spent on them, the numbers are poorly placed and poorly photographed. Obviously this is a pre-code movie because girls often wear very little clothes and there is even a song that sings marijuana! All performances are one note, although it's nice to see Carla Brisson in a musical, but when Victor McLaglen, as police lieutenant, jumps into the circle one time in the pursuit of traces, you may want to throw a towel or least in advance to the next number. It's a shame that the sponsors were trapped in a movie on his issue!
