Definitely one of Eddie Murphi's smaller films about ridiculous man is this nonsense about a kidnapping mystic child, three hundred-year-old dragons and "chosen ones". in the introductory song is said to be "the best man in the world". In search of lost and missing children, a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Levis) comes to him, who tells him that he is "chosen", and that his destiny is to find and save the "Golden Child". Because if a child died, compassion would die with him, because he is the carrier of compassion. If all of this hocus experimental garbage is not destroyed for you now, surely it will once be a movie begins. Just say that the action is disgusting and destroys the entire film. It should have been another means for Murphy's egoistic brand of humor (comedy is not that good for you), the film fails at many levels. Even Charles Dance as evil Sardo Numspa can not do much for the procedure. Very stupid and disappointing. Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
