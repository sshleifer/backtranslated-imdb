Competition for the worst Varner Bros Kai Francis movie is stiff. I've seen only eight of them, but Comet Broadvai is the worst so far. It's best that it's short. Oh, and Orri-Kelli dresses (of course) are fine. James Wong Hoa's cinema was not. Kai Francis seems to be a thick face and far less attractive than he normally does. Minna Gombell, which I do not know, is good as a half-hard "Burlesque" dancer (she looked more like a fashion show than a burlesque). The final shot - Kai Francis and her child (when the kid learned that Kai Francis was her mother? Did I fall asleep?) Walking along the cliff trail to the prison colored by the foggy outlines of the sound fall is beyond the absolutely funny. The whole film is so inexpensive, so incredible and so carefree to feel infected by acid cynicism by everyone who did it: Varner Bros throws garbage on puppets who do not know, in Varner Bros.'s cynical assessment of them, to get garbage.
