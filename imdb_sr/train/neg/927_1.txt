I mean, indeed, how would Charles Band, Full Moon's head, release a total stinking ball, such as DEMONICUS. I do not think it should ever get a green light. The story is repetitive, the characters are weak at best, Tiranus does not have a real story, and he's a bad guy. Then the writer or director leaves his way for a bad end. It's a very bad ending, Demonicus rises. The last survivors escaped from the deadly cave, then Chimera's image is reviving, I could add and persecute it cheaply. Then as the house went ala FUNHOUSE. A statue that was destroyed several centuries ago reappears for no reason just to crash on it. I mean, that makes no sense. What the hell did Charles think he allowed to make this vomit a lot, with four different film companies that were so desperate for movies. They could ask me, I had better ideas than DEMONICUS. THANKSGIVING TURKEY.
