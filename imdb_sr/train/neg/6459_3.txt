Such big actors are so disappointing. Marlon Brando plays a terrible character, the movie is not ridiculous at all, the subconscious message can be seen "It's DAMN CRAP !!!", "SUZI SE TO TO BADLI !!", "BUDITE TV KROZ PROZOR", and soon. It's simply disgusting and boring. In addition to the stupid plot, the sense of humor, there is something else. The way the rooms are decorated, colors. I'm sick, it's all so colorful that it can cause epilepsy. I usually do not care about the decoration in the film, but this from "Free Monei" made me angry. Avoid at all costs! "Free money" - probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland, and Brand, but the viewer gets nothing! A man watches him at the price of common sense.
