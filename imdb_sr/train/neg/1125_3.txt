I went to the school with Jeremy Earl, so I heard about this movie, I really do not know if he was at all in the theater. I do not remember the name. I've seen it, it's like one of those after school specialties. The acting is fine, it's not big. The action was poor and the lines were pretty rough. So, the only comment I can give to this movie is "Eh". I borrowed a movie from Jeremy, if I was in a rented movie, this is the one I would go through and after I watch it I would not recommend it to anyone's secondary school age. I also noticed that many times when urban children are portrayed, the slang is over-aged or just obsolete. Many times I think that's what makes their characters incredible.
