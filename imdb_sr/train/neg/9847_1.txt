Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratchera (ha, ha), a pirate ship chef who assumes the role of the captain after he killed the previous one. Although he was a witness of buried treasure, he begins to lose his memory and the map of the goods he gets becomes empty. So Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (do you post an ad for it?) And help guide the way to the treasure. It's clever that someone could fund this absurd film. Former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medaka as director, and taking into account Medaka's talents in the ruling class, you can probably guess who had Milligan in the director's chair from the grainy, poorly lit scenes. Peter Boile appears briefly in the first 10 minutes of the film as a captain of a convicted pirate. He is probably very grateful that Mladi Frankenstein was published the same year when he was shot and preserved, so he can keep this from his summary. Franciosa looks like a lovely Pover-back-Scratcher, but he and the Seller look pretty desperate, even the Makeup Makeup and hair looks pretty scary. They had to know that this film was bombarded even while they were shooting it. With such lines, I can understand every possible discomfort: PIERRE: (you'll be hanged soon) You will pay for this. SKRATCHER: No, I won. t. I'll do it for free. And that's one of the good jokes. It is amazing for me that a large part of the fertile material of the sellers is still in the vaults, but that was available on VHS more than 15 years ago! How would anyone get to the plate and issue well-received UK TV shows "A Shov Called Fred" in the lead role of Sellers, Milligan, and directed by Richard Lester?
