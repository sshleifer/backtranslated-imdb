I have always been thrilled with dramatic periods, an art form in which the BBC has progressed in the past. This presentation of "Bayron" was incredible. Incredibly bad! The script was horrible, the acting was not inspired, and all the characters were terribly distasteful. Looks like Biron was "crazy and dangerous to know," and that the heart of the lady was all vigorous. Not in this production. Here appeared as an unusual jump-up little jet instead of a feminine female hero and a Greek fight for independence. It was said that Biron was ashamed. This portrait of a man was just limping. I watched for two and a half hours waiting for something to come to life. It's not floating or blinking. It was extremely boring, if not boring, from beginning to end. Bearing in mind that nobody would be better for Bard Avon, I also believe that Biron's poetry is too honored and my mind should be thrown to the back burner, and this dramatization of his life should be treated on the same the way. I think the BBC lost its nous with this.
