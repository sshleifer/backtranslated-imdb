Joyce Reynolds looks like an adult for the role of Janey, a sixteen-year-old girl in a small town in America, who fights for her visiting soldier and throws himself on the cover of the magazine Life. ) all in the same week! A non-stop barracks of wise men, murders, bullshit speeches, and worthless pieces of work, such as Janie's younger sister who bribes family members, Hattie McDaniel (as a maid) is constantly trampling on drunken moments, Jani's mother dealing with the Red Cross, and Jani's father trying to write an editorial about the problems with today's teenagers (such as parents, conceited, without sex Edward Arnold and rude, cunning Ann Harding make a little probable couple, even for 1944; he seems incapable of helping a child imagine much less raising two ). Nominated for the Oscar Award (!) For the installation of Owen Marks, Varner Bros.. he followed it in 1946 with "Janie Gets Married". Reynolds probably grew up with his colleagues by then - replaced by Joan Leslie. * 1/2 of ****
