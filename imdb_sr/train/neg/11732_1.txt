The IMDb guidelines state that you must report if your comments contain 'spoilers'. Well, this whole movie is something like a spoiler ... a warning story that glorifies against what is being warned, a story of a lost youth that does not know where to go. > <br /> I just saw it at the tribal film festival. this film was not only bad, it was very bad. The acting is inconsistent, the characters are mostly clich√© offers with little depth, and farnesworth's performance was particularly bad. From patron accent to the meaningless line of plots to extraordinary "graphic" elements to repeated dialogue and scripts ... she sucked out a big one. I think he was looking for some kind of sharper, up-to-date 'chef cowboy' by touching 'naturally born murderers', but not where they are more sensitive to characters than formerly and where as shocking (beyond some fraternal levels) as ladders. More than anything, someone really needed A) to edit the scenario (there are some things that can be built and clearly dealt with) with a valuable subject ... if it's an attempt.) B) edit the movie. If it were reduced to a core, it could be transient. I would go below 1 if I could ... as maybe zero Kelvin.
