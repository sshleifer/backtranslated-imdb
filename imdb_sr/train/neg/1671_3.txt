I saw this on the market at Cannes Film Festival. It's a real cheap product - nothing wrong with it, but you have to make up for it with a little bit of sex or both or both. Think Larri Cohen. Sean Young is an interesting actor - well-made for producers to connect. All the crew's hands shake it around! Ha ha - but I want people who did this - at least not pretentious.
