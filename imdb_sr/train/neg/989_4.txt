Okay, I found out about this movie and I looked at how I read almost all the reviews and it was difficult to discuss whether I should look or not. Before I watched the movie I was emotionally weird on it. I was so unsure that I would watch this and be upset for a long time. That's why I decided to take a chance and watch it and here's what I thought: The start started to me well. It seemed to move in a decent direction. I went past the rape scene and I could not figure out why people were so upset or annoying about the movie. Do not misunderstand me that the rape scene was just as sad and scary, but it did not bother me at a dramatic moment. Then when the middle came, I realized the boring things that were happening. There were 5 minutes of recording nothing but people who were walking around talking or not showing anything! One thing is to have a shot in which a person shows some sort of emotion, but this film did not have that. He had about three of these pointless scenes, where you see the main character Maia seem to get out of control, but that did not show that it is right to make me accelerate. Then, when she entered the hardcore parties, it was not that boring, but still a bit boring. Oh, and as a reminder, Rosario Davson still did a great job. It goes fine so that finally after an hour of nonsense to the middle, Maya draws attention to revenge. It was disturbing. I did not feel bad for him or for anything he deserved, but the whole scene was really disturbing and I just felt like it was after that. I can not tell you whether to watch or not watch this movie because its ... I do not know that I can not even find a word to sum up. But if you decide to watch it, do not be insensitive.
