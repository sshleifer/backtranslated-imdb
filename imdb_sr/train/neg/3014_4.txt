I recently watched the Manufactured Landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival. I was attracted to the movie as a photographer, because I am familiar and I love Burtinsky's work. Although I believe that the film is doing a good job, I could not help but feel that it was made as a complete thought on the photos and later the popular book Burtinski. Obviously, one of the reasons for this is the widespread use of photographs showing zoom and containers. Although this is a good effect when used economically, I felt that 75% of the film was just a photo from the book Burtinski (which I already own). It's probably an exaggeration, but that's how I felt. If you own a book or are familiar with his work, you might want to skip this book.
