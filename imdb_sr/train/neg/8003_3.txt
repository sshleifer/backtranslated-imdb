Do not be fooled, as I've been in the 'great' reviews quoted on a DVD box. "Wild party.", "Seriously frightening freak." And, worst of all, "ON PARA WITH JAVS." This film is none of the above. Usually I do not bother writing bad reviews for movies, but I can not believe that this rest rests on comfortable 7 on the IMDb. It does not deserve it. After the opening of the daily attack of monsters created by, what else, chemicals thrown by lazy scientists, this film goes absolutely nowhere and goes there. Basically and incredibly, the girl is caught by the monsters (I will give them points for a good design of the creature, but this is not a VETA creation), and her half-comic family spends an hour and a half searching for it ... in the sewers around the Han River. Their searches lack any uncertainty - again, someone called it parallel with Javs - and when found, you realize that all this was pretty meaningless. In addition, much of the film is dedicated to the government quarantine that culminates in a funny scene in which a man spat in the groove in front of the crowded bus station. Blech. This was bad. I'm not kidding. You want to see a rotten movie about a monster? Rent Deep Rising. At least you will save 30 minutes of your life.
