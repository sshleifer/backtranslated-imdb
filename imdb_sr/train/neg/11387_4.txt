Medellin is an incredible place to live, work and learn. I was there twice and I never heard anything about guerrilla activities, paramilitary forces that took tourists as hostages, or anything like that. There is "invisible police", but it is not * a big brother's system. The police have enough, so they are visible in everyday life, but do not bother someone without good reasons. La Sierra is an interesting documentary in which young people in the film essentially become his characters. Film directors carefully cut the line of plots among the daily actions of the inhabitants of Sierra, and when the "figure" dies, there is a true pathos. It is hard, however, to imagine that three young members of the Block Metro, a gang that terrorized La Sierra before the Colombian government began to restructure the country. La Sierra is not an accurate view of life in Colombia; Of course, there are things that need to be cautious, such as petty crime, but when it is thought that paging is happening in "modern" cities like London, New York or Tokyo, Colombia does not look any different. The Colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show the world that once the war-ravaged country has progressed more than ever.
