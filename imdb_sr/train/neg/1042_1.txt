First of all, write the script on the napkin. Who needs more than that? After all, we're not a Hollywood movie. Then come to amateur actors. It will be good for a festival hyper. After all, who needs people who have been grinding their craft for years? Then rent a cameraman who does not know how to get started. You see, if it's well lit up, it will not look "real" and people from the festival will not like it. Who needs professional photography? Then rent a 10-year-old who never held the camera to be your operator. This will give your movie a completely amateur touch that will make festival skaters mistaken for "reality" and guarantee that even though you will empty the seat of real people, critics and a small section of the audience that over-intellectualizes screaming "genius" because they will not believe it's just an amateur a clock. When you do it, buy a ticket for the Bad Movie Festival, or Sundance. What a sad waste.
