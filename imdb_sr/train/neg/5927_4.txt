I am a very non-politically correct guy, so when I say a sexist, I really think she has reduced the lead of the female guest, Dr. Miranda Jones, who was Diana Muldar. in spite of all her alleged brutality and self-control, to nothing more than inside, but the big, jealous unreasonable babies You've been getting complicated by the time, after her technical assistant Marvik, also a discarded lover, turned back when he tried to kill Meduzan, Ambassador Kolos, from a jealous angry, but he first saw it. (You think he could simply walk into a closed room and reposition the box, too easily) took the company into a non-floating space in front of the galaxy before the boys could subdue it. Well, the ship was stuck in limbo, at that moment they could go to the good ladies and contact a doctor. "Spock must make the mind connect with Medusa so that we can get home. I mean, like a beetch, do you want to stay on board until our supplies are gone and die?" But the lady in the real Star Trek fashion is jealous monsters that whine and whine when the idea is revealed, even when her Medusa idol told her to shut up and go with them. So the chip from the inattention messed up with the merged Spock, which led him to forget to put his visor, which made Spock go crazy. Kirk, naturally, realized what a total blow he was, and embarrassed him to repair Spock with his superior telepathic powers. Of course, in the end, Our Lady and Medusa are leaving and everything is forgiven. You almost want the chairman of Galactica Galaxy Galactica to throw a witch from the air chamber for his destructive trick. But in Star Trek, women are permitted to be completely unreasonable and cruel, but at the same time allegedly there is sexual equality. That's what I mean by sexist.
