I'm sorry for everyone, I know this should be an "artistic" movie, but wow, they had to surrender weapons on the screen so that people could blow their brains and not watch. Although the design of the scene and the direction of photography is excellent, this story is too painful to watch. The absence of a soundtrack was brutal. Shooting was too long. How long can you see two people sitting and talking? Especially when the dialogue complains about two people. It was really hard for me to go through this movie. The performances were great, but how many of those dark, gloomy, non-inspiring things can you take? The only thing I liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dance scene. Otherwise, this was Bergman's eating. And I'm not his fan. I think everyone who says he's enjoyed 1/2 hour from this is, well, lying.
