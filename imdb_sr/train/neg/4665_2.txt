I really wanted to love a book with pillows. Intriguing story, interesting contours of characters, Evan Macgregor in extreme magnificent sense. Unfortunately, every minute I hated him. Greenavai fell in love with the presentation of the film singularly, not for the benefit of the film. I will not even get into the stupidity of Vivian Vu. You've been neglected by a story with 4 billion teenagers and a calligraphy rolling at the bottom of the screen and showing the lyrics of the music that plays. He seems to have lost sight of the presentation of the real story and the development of the plot, and he was embroiled in foo-foo decorations that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like portraying John Singer Sargeant in the sharp Hallmark framework that says "GRANDMA LOVE ME!" This movie looks like a victim of the ego director, instead of what could have been - disturbing and scary beautifully. In the hands of another director (Jeunet - Coppola?), It could have been a masterpiece. In the hands of Greenavai, it is best to surrender to fine arts classes that also take it too seriously.
