Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to go into the middle of the film, but I resisted. I do not know what Ridley Scott intended, but I learned that women in the army became stupid as men. They learned to spit, insult and fight in battle, and that is the loss of time (in my opinion). And, in any case, what the hell was that final scene in Libya? Are they still fighting Gaddafi or is it easy for everyone to believe that Islamic people are always dangerous?
