On the poster it says: "At birth he was given 6 years to live ... At age 34 he goes on a journey of life." Amy is an Israelite born in America, who has been diagnosed with a muscular dystrophy disease at the age of one year. At age 34, after the love of his 22-year-old caregiver failed, he decided to come to the United States to face a doctor who said he would only have 6 years of age. He wanted to show the doctor that he was still alive and had a weight of 39 pounds. Why? Your assumption is as good as mine, even I have seen this movie. It is obviously brave to live when everything is able to move his left index finger, but why there is so much anger towards the doctor. who diagnosed his illness 34 years ago? His doctor just told his mother that based on the history of the disease, people with his disease will not live long. What does it appear on old doctors? Why is tracking this old doctor in the United States the journey of his life? There are so many things that we might be interested in for Amy's life: how can he make those animations by the movement of just one finger? How can he go through everyday life while totally dependent on others? How did he bring out his doctor's life? How does he deal emotionally when other people watch him look at a strange creature? The film did not tell us anything. Instead, the filmmaker got a van and set the road to show Ami at the old doctor's door to show him he was still alive. I thought it was a joke.
