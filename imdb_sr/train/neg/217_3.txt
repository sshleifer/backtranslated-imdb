This is a film that relies solely on a somewhat controversial picture of incest and lesbianism to be noticeable. That's it. high school students, but the subject is intended for an adult audience. It's a gutless and shallow film. It could be a better way if he had a story and more drama. Ah, and, on top of this, one more thing: why are internal monologues so overly used? It seems so cheap. All in all, a shameful movie for Romanian cinema, as well as for a mature audience trying it. please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can not act!
