absoluteli trash. I loved Night of Witches and since then Johnny was in the spiral down. This is around the pit. We'll get John. Pro-lifers are terrifying! you do not have to make a shitty movie that devours me to hell to "tell" me. Looks like John did not have much work to do with this. on his merits, he does not seem to have written this trash. There are countless times when the camera just sits and waits for the actors to look stupid or to say something stupid. I like a long cut. A bad bad carpenter does not know how to apply it. must merged with Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago. Please, John, stop making a fool of yourself and bore me to death!
