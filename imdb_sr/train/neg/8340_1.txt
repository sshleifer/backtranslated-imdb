One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was so boring that I turned it off halfway to watch the news. When I turned it on again, I fell asleep. The film begins with a dream, it continues with sleep and ends with a dream. Then there are several more dreams in between. Come on, what should I be interested in that? The film must have reason to be interesting. The moment you feel that the movie is just a dream, when any sensible film movie turns off. Have you ever insisted on telling your dreams and what it means to them? That's it! Absolutely terrible.
