Two days after I saw this thing, I'm still in agony for seeing it. It's so bad, you have to ask yourself, so that anyone can write this bug, and even less let it be free to the general public. Stilted acting, a leading man who seems to be walking in a dream, and Alison Eastwood is ashamed. The action points to a low budget film, which means it's painfully bad. The plot? Well, if you were 6, then you could write this movie. Simplified, idealistic and simple.
