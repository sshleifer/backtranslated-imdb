It's not a bad, but not so great movie about robbery. Kirk Douglas was recently released from jail who, after refusing a bid from the mafia, decided to withdraw his job. He recruited circus gymnast Giuliana Gemma. Maihem ensues. Douglas and Gemma are soon in search of a mobster Roman Puppo and entangled in a really stupid love triangle with Douglas's infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo maintains the pace of fast movement and there is at least one great and creative automobile move that includes Puppo & Gemmu. Although Italian production, most of the recordings seem to have been made in Germany. Douglas is fine, not only to kill him in Giallo. A striking Bolkan gives a great performance. Music is made by Ennio Morricone, and cinema is by Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Vertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
