One of the lame wedding movies you'll see. He is too enthusiastic about his time period so he is outdated before he hit the cinema. Ethnic stereotypes are like jokes Henny Ioungman, except that they are not ridiculous here. Molly Ringwald, what else is to be said. I give you an indication of nonsense, it destroys a $ 10,000 wedding dress, because "It's just not gonna be me," it does in this cloth, with ribbons and puts a hat on top, and everyone smiles at her flour, and does not return her neck to her. And his actress, see how much Alli Sheedi is heavy. Vheeeev!
