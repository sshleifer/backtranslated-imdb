This so-called bitch is just a badly made remake for a better version of Dangerous Liasons. Plots are identical to most scenarios. I loved the book on which it was based, and I liked the first movie, but I will not even bother with the third film. A senseless joke between the two main characters in the sign was completely predictable and unoriginal, and ... I can not emphasize how bad the film was. If you do not want to take my word for it, just watch, and you'll see what I mean. If you read a review saying that 'If you like the first, you'll like the other', the only reason it's because it's the same movie! Although the plot is not even good. They took so many lines from the first movie, it's hard to tell which movie you're watching.
