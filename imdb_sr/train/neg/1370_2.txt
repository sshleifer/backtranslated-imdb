**** WARNING: here are spoilers **** Why am I spending my hurriedly flying years watching the trash like this? This film is an impressive collection of clich√©s, bad writing, poorer directing, and then we have not yet come to acting. And of course, you can foresee the whole story from the beginning to the end. Heroes Expert is fighting against stupid, corrupt and incompetent supporters. An avalanche is extinguished, burying all the heroes who somehow manage to get out alive despite going through all kinds of danger from the jumper. The corrupt partner who caused the whole thing is fried alive with his money to pay off. The second avalanche is heroically rejected by the adventurous experiment of the outlaw. In the end, it turns out that the evil followers have a heart. An upset teenager falls into the hands of her tiny stepmother after she saved her. Etc., etc., etc., etc., on and on it goes. Actually, there is no reason to warn a spoiler. Probably you could plan an entire plot if I give you the basic ingredients. At least most of the time I was not too broad, what I expected was to continue. And then we did not talk about factual mistakes. I agree with the previous commentary that even though there are some features that can be used even for a bad movie. It would be hard to find anything in this. I guess I gave 2 out of 10 for some nice scenes of landscapes, but that's it. It's been a while since the film was taken away, but this was certainly there.
