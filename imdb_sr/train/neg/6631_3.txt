Ram Gopal Verma proved to be a very innovative and competent director. He did the remake / processing of Kuma with Sarkar, and he managed terribly. Lolita also made it Nishabad. Sholai was a movie that repeatedly told him that he inspired him most. Unfortunately, he managed to make a disappointing and finally boring remake. The act ranged from decent to very good, and Amitabh Bachchan was as convenient as criminal Babban. The songs were terrible and forgetful. The song Mehbooba Mehbooba came out as the second music video. The worst part was the pace, and the dialogues - that they forgot. Watching the movie in the theater, I found myself waiting for a break, and then for the end. Some viewers were wise not to wait, and they were seen walking all the way to the film. In the end, one of the worst films ever made by Ram Gopal Verma.
