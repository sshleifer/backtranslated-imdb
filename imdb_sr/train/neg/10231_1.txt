To be honest, I was quite irritated that on the basis of the brilliant comments attributed to Steven Smith, I spent nearly two hours on his debut offer. Did his friends write everything? The action is climbing, the music is irritating and more used, the script is simply horrible, and the actors (except the gardens) are at best central. I think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker, but say it is brilliant when it's not certain that he will only encourage him to repeat the same mistakes, i.e. Yes, it's his first film, low budget, etc. - I realized, but it's also there for members of the public to buy it and it's just not up to zero.
