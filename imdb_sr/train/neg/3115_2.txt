I rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time I felt comfortable. The night listener is, without a doubt, one of the deepest films I've ever seen. Nothing was happening in this movie, which has ever been - I did not care for a single figure, I did not have the whole story about a mysterious guy, it did not care how it ended ... nothing. No comedy, no action, no excitement, no tension, nothing. The most important things (without spoilers - nothing to break): a man climbing out of the window, a dog barking in front of the hotel room, a car that goes through a rough land and a truck that scratches a horn. I really enjoyed "One Hour Photo" and I was hoping for a similar spooky role from Villiams, but unfortunately, she was very low. It's disappointing that I'm sure there's a good movie out there - the idea was interesting and I needed to feel sympathy for the characters, but it just did not work for me. I may have given him 1/10, but this result is reserved for the remake of the producer
