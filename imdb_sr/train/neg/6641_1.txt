I saw this movie twice. I can not believe that Pintilie made such a fantastic movie. I am also a film / theater director and I know what I'm talking about. It's no longer Romania, but I see that events are happening in the same period with the September 11 incident. No story, no complications, nothing. No conclusion, message, anything deep, nothing hidden. Just empty images. What most Romanians do not know, this film is for French spectators, not for us. They really believe that this is a reality in Romania. And for teens. Pintilie should stop filming movies. I do not know if we can call it a movie, maybe horror :) And we wonder why we have such a picture in Europe. It was a reality, but it's no longer. My good friend from the Brithish Embassy said: "You have no idea how long the Romanians walked from Ceausescu."
