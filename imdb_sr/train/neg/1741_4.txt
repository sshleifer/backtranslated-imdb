The Priiadarshan / Paresh Raval combination was golden with similar HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA, so I went to the film (in the Indian multiplex) with great hopes, especially after great promotions. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL, this film was a great disappointment. As others commented, the premise of the film, which had already been stagnating for the beginning, just expanded without any development. or additional layering. After a while, you just want the film to end up so you can go home (if I were looking at it at home, it would be much easier to reduce the losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is at best average, and John Abraham should not try to do comedy again. The comedy aspects of the film were quite weekly. I only remember that I laugh like a double film. There was definitely no funny belly that consumed me at HERA PHERI or even to a lesser extent in AVARA PAAGAL DEEVAN. Paresh Raval had several of his expected classic moments, but all in all, because his role and character did not give much room for growth, he did not much influence this film. Neha Dhupia, which only appears in the movie, it was fun to watch while on the screen. And some of the songs are fun. Special opening and closing of the songs ADA and KISS ME BABI. Otherwise, it would only be better to transfer this film.
