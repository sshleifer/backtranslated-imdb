You must admire Brad Sikes, even if you do not want it specifically, a man who throws out a budget horror after a horrifying budget for less than enthusiastic receipts. But he continues to do the same thing. It's even a half-hearted compliment than surrounding his films from the Blood Camp reluctantly and I'm guilty just like everyone else. Brad normally succeeds in inserting something interesting into a mix, a neat idea, a silly character, whatever, but without the means to take him further from the basic level, he rely on the audience to shorten his chance and appreciate what and what might be . Joe Haggerty gives a witty and very funny performance like Ebenezer Jackson and the merit of Sikes that he can feel this strange turn to act within the film. There is a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.
