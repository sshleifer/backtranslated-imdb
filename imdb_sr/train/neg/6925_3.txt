I feel much less generous with this film than the rest. The display of lunatics in this century always works with them so they are as bizarre as they are of different types. Their fools are so out of place that they are completely fictitious. Everybody is Napoleon or some other historical figure; or are fascinated with chickens. They are on the market or beat one another. As if the scriptwriter had said, what can I compensate them, without the feeling of madness or even mental illness? Look at the wonderful human portrait in the movie "Flies above the cuckoo's nest" where the diseases are convincing and real. I once worked in a state hospital. I did not see any of these guys. They are too clever and calculate to make them alive.
