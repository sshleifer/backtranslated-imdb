It's hard to call a grudge horor movie. At best, I jumped a bit out of surprise in a few moments. If you forget the (unsuccessful) dimension and look at the other side of the film, it is again disappointed. The acting is fine, but not great. The story can be a bit interesting at the beginning, while you are trying to get what's happening. But in the end it is understood that there is not much to be understood. "Scari" elements are sometimes added to the scenario for no reason ... So ... (yawning) Watch this movie if you have nothing more interesting to do, such as cutting carrots or watching the clouds.
