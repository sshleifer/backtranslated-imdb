There are so many stupid things about this movie that I can not say but a few: BOGART's character: 1. His name? Whack McCord (too easy, so I'll leave him on it. Boy, it makes Humphrey sound good.) 2. His long, curly hair and stupid bottoms. 3. His black Bart gets along with the ostrug! 4. You are not sure which lip gloss shimmer worn, but it's not too flattering. , Too. 2. A man swallowed a hat in the whole movie! Could not they find a hat to suit him? Even MALO? !!?! 3. His pants are too tight. 4. Too many times smoke from your pistol, if you know what I mean, and I think you have it. By changing the rhythm to see them in the western, do yourself a favor and forget that thought. Even horses watch how it spreads! (That is, when they do not look bored.) In all honesty, I admit that Westernizes are the weakest favorite movie genre, but I've still seen much, much better than this. Br /> At the level of comedy, or as a high camp, The Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, watch the audience. Therefore, look at this only if: a) you must see every western there b) that you are TRUE Cagnei or Bogie completist c) any of the above comments addresses you. Voah ?? ..
