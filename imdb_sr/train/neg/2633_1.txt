I watched the movie story in the theater more than once and I was excited. It looked like a classic action thriller like those of the 1990s. He also reminded me of escape movies, hunting cats and mice between Douglas and Sutherland. However, The Sentinel is the most incurable action thriller of all time. As I see, many people say this is like a TV movie. Not really. First, there are many better TV films in this genre. Second, TV films can be very fun sometimes, but this movie is just the opposite of having a good time. It is not stylistic at all visually and most importantly, the tone of the film is irresistible. This is not an action movie, there are two action scenes that consist of hijacking and conflict. They are also not a big action scene, but it's even worse that these action scenes are very uncomfortable like the whole movie. The love relationship between Douglas and Bassinger was very unnecessary. In addition, the plot of the assassination of the president is also the most stark story in this genre, but they insist on it. And this is not a movie about cats and mice as it should be. Although Douglas is now very old, he still has the potential to star in an action thriller. In the film, Michael Douglas can not be like Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is the wrong choice, because you feel like watching Jack Bauer and somehow, his character is one of the reasons why the film as a TV movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice, of course it's too passive right in this movie, because actress is soap opera . My film was not even fun for a second, so I could not stop it.
