Oh God. I was so disappointed that this film was just a robber of the Japanese Ring. Well, I guess the US made their own version, but at least it was the real remake. So, so sad. I really enjoy watching movies from the Philippines and I know that some great things can come out of such a small country, so I can not believe that this has to happen. Claudine and Chris are so great names there, surprised that they will be associated with plagiarism. To all movie creators in the Philippines: You do not have to descend to earn money. There are many movie lovers who watch movies that the Filipinos print and enjoy in them!
