Think about completing Grudge 2 with the following: - A man who repeatedly says the word Sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar is cut down - and a creepy mirror> OH AND THE UNDERWATER SEA .. .iai ... <br /> <br /> is not a good movie ... I seriously did not enjoy. The poster for the movie is also very wrong and I found it just to suck people to watch it ... I can not believe I left. Save your time and money ... go watch All III ... a movie in which you feel from writing you feel as if effort is being made ... Im Mike and Im out
