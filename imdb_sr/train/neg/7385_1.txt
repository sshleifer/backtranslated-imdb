The film is boring, characters and scenarios are unrealistic, incredible, action is hilarious. This movie is a big mess. It looks as though action action music is the most impressive trick. Or the voice was renamed Mr. McGregor or Steven too sang, and that changed his voice. There is too much dialogue in this film, and it is extremely bad acting in the name of everyone. The film is a great sleep therapy. The fight is ridiculous. The effect of changing the shape of the eye on the evil drug designers was decent. The main criminal was a joke and his character was poorly developed. The chief criminal was used to explain the story through the examination; he would only throw random plots into the (spoiler) "CTKS (his designer drug) will be in the plumbing", which is never considered in the conclusion or even mentioned again in the film. This film is recommended to pass.
