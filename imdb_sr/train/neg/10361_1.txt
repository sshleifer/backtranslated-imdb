This failure of ABC directly on television does not give absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel A Vrinkle in Time. Madeleine L'Engle brought children and adults into the magical, fantastic and original world as no other author before her. This novel, the first in her 'Quartet of Time', is a wonderful view of life, the universe and the only time. However, every child or adolescent easily understands. Her unwavering morale prevails throughout the book. This film adaptation can be seen only as a sculpture of Mrs. L'Engle's artwork. Frankly, what did they think? The effects seem cheap and funny, the plot is grim and uneven, the dialogue is incredible, and almost every magical characteristic of the novel is lost. This was a terrible attempt to bring this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that one day an intelligent, worthy director (Guillermo del Toro, David Iates, Alfonso Cuaron) will make another attempt to bring this book to the screen and realize what she really is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can be compared only with boring, false and cheap motel art, which has no basis and does not affect the audience.
