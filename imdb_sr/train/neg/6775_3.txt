I was very pleased to find this film at the local video library - Cari Grant in a comedy posted by the service, director Stanley Donen, which he does not like now? It's a movie that asks me two things - when everyone involved (including some well-known names) realized that they have a turtle on their hands, and what's the worst part of it among the many controversial aspects? I'm still thinking about the first one, but my voice for this other one goes into a wrapped story, in front of a complex, sometimes pretentious letter, an uncertain tone, a lack of consistent and well-developed characterization, and a lack of relationship between characters. You must add a very uneven response to criticism, but it is understandable that the actors have fought these things and that they seemed insufficiently trained. Very often they can hardly reach their lines fast enough. Cari Grant tries to show her usual charming and urban personality, but sometimes looks uncomfortable and staccato in his delivery. I must say that I was relieved when the initial suggestions that his character will be paired with the inexpressibly vulgar Jane Mansfield disappear with the appearance of Suzi Parker. What about the movie? - for me primarily the beauty of Parker who also acts with restraint and dignity as Grace Kelly. Generally speaking, the film is beautiful. Marine characters are very smart in their uniforms - however, you really have to wonder in the terrible black Fu Manchu bows that donate to their luxury hotel suite. Even Grant can not look elegant in her. Returning to the credit side, Rai Valston is doing a praiseworthy job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing pre-Hogan's Hero Verner Klemperer without an assumed German accent!
