Bridges of Madison County are a better version of this story. I felt that the ending of this film was not treated as carefully as in the original English film. This film is very indianised, if you are a very sensitive person who cries in a movie when a hero dies in the end, you will love this movie. not as an end. But in its entirety, it is a fairly good subject that is well used for Indian conditions. Tabu was as good as a caring wife and mother. They all behaved well.
