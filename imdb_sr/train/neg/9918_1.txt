Another flag of British cinema was shaking. The right garbage offered here. I can not understand (and I am the British) why this is at the top of the patriotic stupidity ever made. Eight years have been marking you since the Second World War has actually ended! Other commentators here noted editing and apparently flawless use of archive footage. This is extremely poorly observed. Archival footage is abundant. The airplane model waves from wires in "action scenes" like many dragons of children in the wind. The usual sequence of map rooms tattoo a movie to attract us to the whole event in Malta. Guinness must have the worst performance ever. The shocking scenes of the fight for the return of dogs are ridiculous. Havkins bored us all in a card room. Ealing made great movies. This is obviously not one of them. They should have kept away from such incurable rot!
