I'll start by saying that I can not cross over. I picked it up on a rainy day from ValMart as well as other reviewers on this site. I thought there was no way I would regret it for my purchase. Did I make a mistake or what? Now, who approved this project? They must be forced to watch this movie over and over again for the rest of the eternity. It's the only suitable punishment I can think of having published something so bad. Recording reminds me of the films I used for class projects on the great old VHS camera. The acting is not much better. I think the only difference is that there are several coolants. Iai, who cares ... Shecki Moskovitz is an ignorant, and a comedian of ships is an even bigger loser. That's roughly what I understood. All in all, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I have it on a DVD and I've given it to many associates to watch. Each one comes back and laughs and says, "Wow, I did not think I'd ever say I turned off Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes ...." <br /> <br />
