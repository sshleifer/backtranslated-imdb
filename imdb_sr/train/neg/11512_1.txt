*** WARNING! SPOILERS CONTAINED HEREIN! *** This is a semi-autobiographical view of what might have happened to Madonna if he ever got stranded on an abandoned island. Madonna has absolutely no challenge in this role and she shows it. She's just Madonna playing Madonna, and she can not even get right. I know what you're saying, you say, "How do you know Madonna really is, you never met her!" True, I'm not, but we all remember "Truth or Destiny", right? I know Kevin Costner works. You think that in 2002, Madonna could learn something, in one way or another, from the "crossover" ladies that broke through the film industry. For God's sake, did not Madonna see Glitter? Mariah Carey has shown the film world HOW TO LEARN !!! Mariah throws Madonna's assful ass onto the curb in beauty, talent, presence of the screen, charisma, characterization. Everything we see from this insight into the world of Madonna is that it is the only one in it. If there is one thing that can be said about Madonna, it is that it is consistent. When she was a favorite of MTV, she set the world of fashion for 20 years. Now, in the film, she has set women's roles in the film and society for another 20 years, glamorizing all the most boring, terrifying, repulsive, disgusting qualities women regarded as imprisoned in themselves, the qualities that were so desperately trying to prove that they did not really possess. *** Here are the players !!! DO NOT READ ANY THAN IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW ... *** Here's one good thing I'll say about this movie, and I was really impressed with it. They did not go to "Hollivood Ending" - a living Madonna character. In a typical, happy Hollywood ending, Madonna's character would die on the island, and her long, oppressed, beaten husband would be free to finally settle down with a good, decent woman, a woman who would be completely opposite. his late wife, and they both live happily ever after. But in this utterly depressing conclusion, she is saved, and once again, this poor sacrifice of her husband is again obsessed with the demon of a woman, and his life will again become living hell. *** HERE COMPLETE SPOILER ***
