This movie did not grow old. Perhaps this is just the impact and skillful characterization, acting and directing that we saw in The Sopranos, but I first looked at Prizie's honor, on DVD, alone. it had to be quite different with the audience 24 years ago, but I have to say, I was just horrified at the end. Not only because of violence, but also from the very idea that this will somehow be a satisfying end. should it be set up? All cars looked like they were from the 1960s, and the World Trade Center towers (completed in 1973) were clearly visible on many city scenes. just an idea that a traveler can travel along the coast to the shore with a knife on his person. In the mid-1980s, get to know late: only you can live.
