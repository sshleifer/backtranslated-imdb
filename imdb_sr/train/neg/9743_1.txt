In that line begins a silly, boring British sci-fi movie. Big Voreli from "The Devil's Doll" builds a machine for teleportation only to Blanchard, bearded by a man who has something for butterfly and people with large eyebrows, cut off his finances. When his experiment collapses, a good doctor finds out that Lembach, a man who controls all grants in the world, will stay in London for several days. She tries to project into Blanchard's house with the help of her beautiful assistant in the lab, Sheile. Needless to say that something goes wrong and he turns looking like a rat. The rest of the film is dedicated to the doctor of good orange hair walking around London shocking people with a mutated hand and diaper on the face. There are more murders, some modest work on paper, and finally, the doctor disappears where rats face doctors. Luckily, nobody decided to make a sequel.
