What is most striking about this semi-musical set in the 1920s in Berlin is wonderful cinema and editing. This is the top line from First National in these departments. The story is slightly appealing and similar to the scenes of Miller's other two films (SUNNI, SALLI) in which a working girl is romanced by a wealthy boy with family disapproval, complications and final slander. All four music numbers are compressed at the beginning of the movie, and we go on a long stretch without any further musical lust. Miller sings parts I THINK OF BABI and re-publishes ZATO VAS. There are also NO WINDOWS AND MUCH NOT FIRST. Miller is very attractive and beautiful here, pretty much reminiscent of Irene Dunne in the way and delivery. She does not sadly dance because that's her forte. SALLI remains her best film, with the latter being the second and quite poor SUNNI very inferior drug. Her life was tragically interrupted by a sinus infection before hospitals and antibiotics prevented such tragedies. Worth visiting these films, but see Ziegfeld's best star of the twenties.
