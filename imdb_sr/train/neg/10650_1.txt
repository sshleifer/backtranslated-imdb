This film is no doubt the worst horror film I've ever seen. And that's a lot of talk, given that I've seen such stinkers as Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane and Bloodi Murder (which is the second moment). However, I love bad horor movies, and as you can say from my username, this really stinks. Sometimes there is nothing more fun than a badly made slipper. As for the film, the introductory scene in which a woman bakes in a booth seems to have no effect on the film, especially since the film does not tell you that the event took place 2 years before the rest of the film. The play is non-existent, and most of the camera shots are women's surfaces that are collected in the spandex. The policeman was the strangest actor with a stone face I've ever seen. The best / worst part of this film, however, must be a murder weapon. A huge safety pin?! What did they think? Who is the killer? Unhappy "Huggies" employee? I would have to give this film an overall zero, but I would be damned if I did not have an explosion and watched it
