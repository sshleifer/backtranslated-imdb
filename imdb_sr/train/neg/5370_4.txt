Razon is a horrible movie! It's so simple. Apparently they tried to make a movie to show life in a reel. As Zappa did many years ago. Unfortunately, there are no good young actors in Denmark. Leon are still a very young girl in the "krummernes Jul", and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. She plays a few souls in the film several times and it destroys the movie! Although I consider it to be a movie you should see. I do not agree that young people behave like this, but I think it can show how this can end if you release a child. It is also important to support Danish movies and new companies such as "Film Folk"! Not because it's a great movie, but because it's a movie that deals with important topics. I also think that it is important to emphasize that there are some violent scenes in it, and in fact in these scenes, Laura is best acting. - as the place where the gun is held!
