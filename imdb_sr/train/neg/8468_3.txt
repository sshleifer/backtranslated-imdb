"They are among us" is at best a bad science fiction. The middle actor kills this movie. Holes for plots are numerous. Aliens who somehow came to Earth on a meteor and hide among us for more than 100 years, but they need a plastic surgeon to make them human. In their extraterrestrial form it is allegedly found exoskeletons (why they need plastic surgery), but when you see them have teeth and nails. The hero's father "disappeared" after the Blue Book project was closed, but allegedly a F-16 pilot. Both on and on. If you want to see a movie about an alien invasion, select "Bodyguards Invasion" and see how this works.
