I should say - it's stink! Just look if you are suffering from insomnia. There are many landscapes that chew it and sting, but not much that is happening This movie. There is no uncertainty, no deep, shocking secrets revealed, no real threat to the well-being of heroin. Few disagreements, mild picking up of votes - that's pretty much. Secrets are nothing that can happen to anyone - the last "secret" discovered in the movie is completely predictable by that moment. The action, such as the one, revolves around a young woman called Vera (Meg Tilli), who is an artist who is engaged to paint a series of wall panels in a huge dance hall in a spacious villa by very, very rich, older widows and a growing relationship between mother and daughter. the older woman craves for her. It turns out that the daughter of an older woman, Cassandra, is dead. You can pretty much fit the rest of the pieces. Even the scene with the mysterious man who threatens our heroine is not progressing to the point where you really are afraid of her security after perhaps perhaps a second or two. Why he was still hanging for years after Cassandra's death is a good question. There is also the question of the fact that in this large palace there is only one servant, a faithful butler who does everything - cooking, cleaning, serving meals, answering the door, etc. All but the obvious locking of the door - since it would be the only explanation that one of the characters only enters the room in which Faith is. There is nothing that would allow you to catch your chair and lean forward on the edge of your seat, because there is no "montage" tension in this movie - just pale, pathetic discoveries that are occasionally ejected. <br /> <br />
