This film does not show us anything original. Any idea or (action) scene can be found in many films that have been previously published. Extraordinary Nick here is completely clear. Even Vill Patton is calm and evil, not even good. Mr. Duvall is ok, but he has a very small part. Like Angelina, so how can we determine her new celebrity star? All in all, there are too many signs, so nobody and nothing is particularly detailed. This makes the film easy to forget. It's a pity, is not it?
