This is a personal film for Peter Bogdanovich. He based it on his life, but he changed things to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives find beautiful models and have no problems getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire singer of a movie than a detective, is not it? This whole film was written by Peter, and it shows how he is without contact with real people. You should write what you know, and he did it. And it leaves the audience bored, confused and jealous, as far as it is concerned. This is a messenger for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was killed immediately after the shooting. But Patti Hanson, who, in real life, married Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is much better and has a much larger share. In fact, Straten's part seemed forced; added. It does not have much to do with the story, which is quite complicated to begin with. All in all, every character in this movie is someone with whom few people can connect, unless you are a millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating socializing. This happens when you are out of touch. You're entertaining your friends with jokes, and everything else.
