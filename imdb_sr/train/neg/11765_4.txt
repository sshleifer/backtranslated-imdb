You know what you get when you buy a Hallmark card. Slow, banal verse that will be $ 3.99, thank you very much. You also get the same with Hallmark. Here we are ninety-year old Ernie Borgnine who comes out of retirement to tell us that, in fact, he is not dead as we thought. Poor Ernie, he's a poor soul who married Ethel Merman a few years ago and the marriage lasted for several weeks. In this film, Ernie first jumps up and shows her grandfather who binds to his long-lost grandson. We've already seen that. You may enjoy this movie, but do not say that you have not been warned.
