This film is just known as one of the most terrible examples of propaganda ever produced. The persistent equation of the Jews with the disease is simply pathological, and even worse it almost becomes probable for short seconds through its pure repetition. The fact that something rude works this way, even briefly, is a subject lesson in itself. You need to have a strong stomach and firmly stick to yourself to live it, and I would not recommend that you try if you do not have a good reason.
