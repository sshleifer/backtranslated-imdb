I'm a big fan of war movies. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, Last Samurai and Gladiator. And after watching Mongol, which is absolutely terrible, and which I strongly recommend, I had great expectations from the film Sergei Bodrov. But it was terrible, horrible, even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. The whole movie I waited for something exciting to happen, but it was not, then at least I expected a great epic battle in the end, but even that was a big disappointment, just by accident running around, waving swords ... There are so many good warfare movies, this one is not one of them.
