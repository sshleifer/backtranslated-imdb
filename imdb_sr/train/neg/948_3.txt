I tried to watch this show several times, but for the show called "Ta '70 -ti", I do not find much but few hairstyles and occasional references to a disc that actually invokes the seventies - the decade I grew up in. Of the episodes I've seen, most complications and jokes can be set up at any time. Remove the newspaper (allegedly) that is set in the seventies, and the show is neither interesting nor funny. If you are looking for a performance that is more successful than the young people in America in the '70s, in my humble opinion, you can not do anything better than The Vonder Iears.
