"Gray matter" AKA "Machine for the brain", but video people thought better; on the screen it says 1972, but IMDb says 1977; It's such a movie. The government has some sort of overriding interest in this brain project that has been compiled by four people - which turned out to be, in fact, a philosopher, an angry priest, a crafty veteran and a patriot who aborted him - to sit in a room that is diminishing with a computer that can read their terrible secrets of thought. In the end, the government takes the laboratory by force and everyone dies. This is a movie that is incompetent in every important way; MI with *** has better production values ​​than this. I was interested, just to see what these exploiters are exactly who the filmmakers thought they were doing, dealing with the drama of a four-in-one character. The answer: a way of how science is inferior to God. Thanks a lot. It's like opening Kinder eggs and getting the 30th fucking puzzle. The priest plays James "Roscoe P. Coltrane" Best, philosopher Gerald "Republican Simon" McRanei. Also, with very, very, very long, transient recording in large quantities, it moves almost as slowly as the Liberal Convention.
