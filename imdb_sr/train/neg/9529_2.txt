This cult film from 1977 has two crazy lesbians (Sandra Locke and Colleen Camp) appearing in the home of wealthy socialist Dr. George Manning (Seimour Cassel), hoping to help find a residence they can not find. But these two have other plans in mind, when they find out that George's wife is out of town, they eventually take control of their place of residence, tying George, killing a delivery man while destroying a place in one evening. A bizarre and disturbing film, but the two of them receive a reward only in the same bizarre way as the film ends. Most will either not like him or will be in this funny movie after about 30 minutes. In any case, some even consider this a cult classic. Larry Dodson
