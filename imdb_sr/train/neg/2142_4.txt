If you are younger than 6 or 7 years old, you will really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she is watching. As an adult, I can not stand it! I'm all ready to continue ... when they have a decent story. But this is not near the standard. Please forgive me for sending what is, after all, a children's movie, but when you have to pass through it almost every day when your kids who love him so understand why. My daughter would watch this movie over and over again on the same day if we allow her. I gave this film 4 out of 10 purely because of the fact that my youngest party is having fun.
