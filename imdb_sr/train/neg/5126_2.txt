I rented this film because I was hoping that the whole family would enjoy it. Although the movie is suitable for the family, my family did not enjoy it because it gives a wrong view of God. If you obey God and follow Him, you will not be guaranteed success. Your football team will not always win. You will not magically get better grades. Infertility is not always cured. You will not always get a raise. Sometimes you will be stuck with the old car. God does not exist to satisfy every our gir. On the contrary, we are created to celebrate Him. Sometimes we celebrate it the most when things look bad for us. Living is Christ; The gain is to die.
