I admire "Kissing on the Mouth" because of my sincerity? pubic hair and masturbation, especially from the leader / director Joe Svanberg. They were not afraid to show the truth of everyday "private" phenomena. Unfortunately, the film belongs to the 'Brown Hare' domain, although with a slightly more developed curtain of jealousy. Yes, it reflects the 'rabbit' with lots of things that do not happen, or is too much movie footage focused (or honestly irrelevant) to absolutely nothing? feet, hands, or genitals. Again, unfortunately, I see why this film is published and why people rent out: true life scenes of sex and full of frontal (equal, both male and female) nudity. In addition, it was a total waste of time. We quickly learn about post-college-male-female roommates, in which a man has obvious feelings for a woman who sees him as a friend, while constantly having sex with his ex-boyfriend. In addition, we are susceptible to the daily events of our boring lives: she works for her parents; she works on an extremely uninteresting project of sexual awareness on her computer. In order for all of this to work, the dialogue must be interesting and real. They do not even work and it's bored to watch someone drive an hour, i.e. 'Brown bunny'. The only actor to stand out is Kate Vinterich, and even she does some questionable acting. (DVD extra with her in front of the microphone is actually worth watching / listening.) Again I admire the filmmakers, especially Svanberg, who forbade it all and did not fear to reveal it or get used to the shower, but the whole film is falling. There are narratives that do not fit into scenes, too boring everyday events, and unconvincing behaviors you're wondering about, except for the factors of soft pornography, why you hire this.
