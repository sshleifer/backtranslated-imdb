From the beginning, you know how this movie will end. So full of cliches, your typical NRA member will not even love this movie. I'm giving 2 out of 10, just because of the acting of Villiam Benton. I can not believe that people voted 6+ for this movie. It is so biased towards a 'point of view' (one thief ...). People are not born poorly. They are not born well either. They were born with a clean plate. It's society, parents and education that makes them what they are. And if they turn the wrong way down somewhere, there will definitely not be an American criminal system that will get them back on track! In any case, avoid this film as a plague. I bet you have better things about your time than spending it on this shit. <br /> <br />
