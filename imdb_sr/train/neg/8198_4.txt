Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: Is it me or any movie that starts in Roswell, Nev-Mecico sucks. Take the Alien mixed with the Thing, blended with Contact, blended with all the things On the Beach, Andromeda Strain, the Raiders of the Lost Ark classroom and throwing into the Little Star Gate for Lifting. The derivative does not start to describe this film either. Of course, without the original plot, multiplying up and sex? Nope up is blinking and you miss him an affair, and sex is all snooping. (James Spader causally mentions that he needs a shower and a cute Leslie Stefanson asks him to join him.) He is rejected. AGGH!) In fact, if the movie ever needed a shower scene to revive things this is it. I mean, if you're going to have incredibly handsome women in white swimwear costing a research base in Antarctica, why not go to the breakout. With about 30 seconds of real excitement in the whole movie, Alien Hunter is an incredible serious and slow departure for the sci-fi adventure. He needed a much better turn to revive himself, and on the other hand, Alien is a terrible clich√© skill, and there is virtually no time for the screen for someone who shares half the title. I also inquired during a review of what is happening with corn kids in the cosmic motif. (Note that from Jason on Friday the 13th glory, Pinhead of Hellraiser and Leprechaun all traveled to the universe to kill the nubile teenagers, why not the corn field?) The characters in the cornfield were like Logan's Runs supplements and only waiting for the trees to live and attack them. It would, however, be exciting and obviously against the vows of these films. The acting is generally good because Spader resumes its role as Stargate, while Stefanson and Janine Eser represent the latest Antarctic beach. John Linch still read the whole script and act like a crazy bad guy before the story could tell him. Alien Hunter is a disappointing derivative that makes me fight for the right Corn Kids in Space movie.
