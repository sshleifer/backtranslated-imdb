This is not a good movie. The acting is incredibly stiff and unpredictable. The movie does not seem to know whether it's a real horrible approach or to get into the camp and kitsch route. I've never seen the first movie, but this one is not on my own merits, there are several unconvincing complications, and the viewer has never been aware of the importance of the leading female vampire. It's not worth the effort
