The spirit of a murdered high school geek animates a scarecrow that refreshes everyone. This film has really troubled me. He has a marvelous monster, has some good budget effects, a little atmosphere, but manages to combine good things with the bad. Halfway I started to accelerate and then go through the chapter on the DVD. The problems with this movie are many. First, the actors have about thirty, and yet they have to be in high school. You can not believe in anything from the beginning. The scarecrow, while it looks great, is nothing more than that. He says stupid lines and moves in a way that is more designed to be ridiculous than frightening. Is this a comedy or horror movie? This is a problem that goes beyond the dialog box and is set. It seems that every clich√© is more wider than a sincere horror film. Somehow I expected that the film was made for a very narrow audience, horror fans who want to mock the genre, rather than accept it. Despite the beautiful monster, this is a movie to be avoided. Even if you pick it up in a cheap bucket for less than five dollars, you pay too much. Avoid.
