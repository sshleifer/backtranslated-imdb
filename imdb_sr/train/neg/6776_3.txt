I wanted to love this movie. How can I not? Cari Grant, Jaine Mansfield, Stanlei Donen; all the icons in your own way. However, the wreck of the train that Suzy Parker had destroyed had been a whole experience for me. Her acting was so terrible that I sat there with an open fork, not believing with my own eyes or ears. I hardly managed to go through one look, it's so horrible in this. Cari? Beautiful and in a fine dramatic form. Jaine? Divan, dear and obviously has the ball. The support set is fine, and the city of San Francisco is caught in its stunning, retro elegance. Then you see Suzie Parker trying to speak her lines with a wooden, deadly, senselessness that simply defies belief. Who told this creature that it could work? OI VEI, people.
