I saw his film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I'm a student at the University of Michigan, so I know something about the film. A Crispin Glover movie is unheard of. He basically exploits mentally impaired. Not only is the Shirley Temple anti-Christ (which I admit to be a little funny) says mentally disturbed to be killed, but there is an obsession with killing slugs. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​being in love with one of his actors who are, like all of them, mentally challenged. PETA and human rights should be everywhere. It's not a 'counter-culture', as Crispin said at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, it's exploitation.
