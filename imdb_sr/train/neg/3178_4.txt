With such movies you know that you will get common ghost jokes. Eva as a ghost is pretty fun. And other actors do well. This is the direction and the missing story. It could have been ignored that jokes worked better. The only problem is that there is not much joke. Of course, I laughed a few times. In addition to the parakeet who spoke, there was no trace of creativity in the film. The guilty director does not use the premise in full potential. Eva certainly has a comic skill to show more but has not got the chance to do it. All in all, this film is ideal for Sunday afternoon. In addition, it can be completely skipped.
