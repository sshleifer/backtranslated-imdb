This film was a bit confusing at first. I usually love Gina Phillips, but what I have to say was a bad choice, just like she worked on Ring Around the Rosie, and that was not a good movie. Jeepers Creepers was much better. Anyway, Faie Dunavai was good. She totally attacked me and, in the end, it was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cassi (Phillips) who came to the funeral of her twin sisters. She stays in the house with her sister, and Grandma (Danavai) lives with her aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Danube) is the victim of her relationship to stay alive and, as long as she wants to live, she can not die. Even if Jennifer tries to kill her, what she's trying to do. The ravens have a strange part in it. When relationships sleep, the ravens eat organs so that they can not sleep. But they are. In fact, it's all crazy and Marie Ellen will never die and her relationships will be buried, but not dead, c / b, they must suffer forever, so Marie Ellen can stay alive. Yes, I hope this helps. If not, excuse me. I love you.
