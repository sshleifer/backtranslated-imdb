Hard guys, sexy women, a lot of cursing, and an unbelievable monster rising from the depth of the polluted lake. You think the "Monster" would be fun ... but it's not, really. However, Tony Eislei and John Carradine act in my book, which makes it worthwhile at least once. In an interview with Fangoria in 1987, Eislei recalled that Herbert Strock directed most of the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford - who only directed footage with his children Andre and Glenn (featuring characters named Andrea and Glen, especially inventive craft ) - got full credit. Considering how much the end result was terrible, Strock was probably happy that he was not assigned! The "Monster" has the look and feel of a television movie in the mid to late seventies, which is why I like to leave it often in the background. As a party, it falls on the face, but as a reminder of another age and disappearance of the type of film, it is very effective. The only thing missing is a drive for the car.
