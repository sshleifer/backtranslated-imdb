I never read the book "Boring in Time". To be honest, after watching a movie, do I really want to? Well, I should not watch this movie and I'll start with it. Then I will say that the TV movie is quite forgetful. Do you know why I say that? Because I forgot what's happening in it. I told you it's forgotten. To be honest, no TV film will ever be better than Merlin. How to describe a TV movie? I've never written a review before. Well, I'm just going to say they usually have some celebrity figures. Borrow in time includes only one. Alfred Voodoo (Or Voodwood, I'm not sure), Oscar winner. The film has sirens special effects, a mildly interesting plot, scenes that make you go "VTF". The film is incredibly bad and makes you go "VTF". What did I expect? It's a TV movie. They are usually not good. Like this one. Boring in time is a waste of time and a great waste of time. Above all, you will most likely forget about it when it's over. Well, maybe not another when it's over. But in a few minutes. Borrow in time: * / ****
