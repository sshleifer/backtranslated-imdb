The end of the game started well, least of all about the place better. It seemed to me that things were happening only for the action to take place, for example, a reporter who was initially very curious, intelligent man, halfway through something really stupid and out of character, there is no reason to do so, the next scene it would not make sense without her. The whole story could be told in about 30 minutes, would make an average TV political drama Brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. It's very careful, but James Voods does a wonderful job with regard to the end. The end of the game was frankly one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... and that's something I said, I saw Gigli.
