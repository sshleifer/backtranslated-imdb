Schlocke's 70 horror movies ... I have to love them. Unlike today's boring sliders, these specialties of K-tel actually make something scary and do not resort to a tired formula. This is the B film about filming B film ... went terribly wrong. Faith Domergue (The Island) plays Queen of Movie B, who makes a film about a series of horrific murders that hit the family in their home. Her boyfriend / director, who watches and acts as a Gordon Jump, records it on the site and on a strict schedule. Ko-star Ken Doll reveals a book of Tibetan poems to work in the script to add "realism". Unfortunately, "realism" is something they could have without it. John Carradine, who has long since quit the search for the 17th gland (The Unnearthli), now pronounces a modest existence as a guard estate. He deals with his everyday work, but he seems to always face the director. The horror is slowly evolving; dead cat here, John Carradine enters the grave there, finally culminates with seven, seven murders. (At least there is a truth in advertising.) It is only sad that the ghost did not realize that the film was made above it. How sad Faith knew that those damn Tibetan tricks would really work? Face it, you just can not go around dragging Satan's coat and expect him to lift it. Sterne says you do an autopsy in the house of Seven corpses.
