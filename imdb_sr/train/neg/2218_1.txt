I admit that my 2006 review, almost 30 years after the film was filmed and at the time of its conception, may have been a great horror / thriller movie. Starting from Night of Night of Night of Night in 1968, a six-year-old Michael committed the brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister. Michael is committed to the mental institution and 15 years later flees and returns to his hometown in order to kill him again. From this point it is clear that the film will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is very predictable. The beginning of each scene is easily predictable in the way it ends, while music for every scene containing Michael (killer) is completely the same throughout the film, thus warning the viewer of the possible events that will follow. For horror / trilera enthusiasts, there is a sharp lack of blood / bloodyness compared to modern films, although I am not related to the amount shown at this time of the day. Maybe a happier medium was found. From half an hour in the movie, no scene is unexpected. The horror / thriller movie is quite typical of this era and thus has no impact on modern day enthusiasts. Positive for the film is its long lasting camera shot and dark lighting that creates scary recordings. atmosphere. Another positive sign would be the character of Michael's doctor, who gives indications of probability where the story could lead. However, it is clear that the star, in Jamie-Lee Curtis, in childhood in her acting career and thus does not provide a truly frightened central victim. It's hard for me to rate this movie as it was in my day, but from other horror / thriller movies. In the 80's and, to a lesser extent, in the 1990s, it's far from truly a great movie about the horror / thriller. I suggest you move on and find a classic from the '80s. Cheers!
