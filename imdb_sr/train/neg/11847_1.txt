I'm bored of how bad this movie is. As a paste from Hollywood artists in the early 20th century, it sets a new low - even the The Moderns past or (sigh). period. However, the intentions and results were similar. First there is a terrible casting: Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN? Sorry? Peter, did you owe him something? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons ?? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? Holy gloom, these people do not even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they allegedly portray. and the rest of Bogdonovitch's paintings were not much better. I guess rubbing against Welles & Hitch and Ford has long since lost. Still, it's good for TCM hosting.
