Buford's Beach Bunnies gives bad name B-movie T & A films. As a fan of this genre, I was stunned to discover that it was a little trying to exploit the talents of young actors. I am particularly referring to the marked lack of nudity and simulated sexual scenes. What is the next generation of sad teenage boys watching this on television that is late at night?
