Between 1937 and 1939, Tventieth Centuri-Fok recorded a ton of g. Moto films. However, towards the end of the series, it was obvious that the studio "jumped on the shark", so to speak. This phrase indicates that the TV show has passed its premiere, and responsible executives have decided to empower Shaw by fundamentally changing the formula. For example, with "The Brady Bunch" they presented the boring "Cousin Oliver", and with "Famili Ties" they presented a freak that grew up six years in just one season! With Moto movies, they skipped sharks by introducing a comic relief as they thought these intelligent films had to be reworked. In the previous film, Varren Himer played the boring wrestler. And in this film appears the figure Archibald Featherstone. Featherstone could only be one of the most admirable examples of comical equalization, because you hoped that someone (preferably Moto) would kill him just to be silent! Although he should have worked for the famous Scottish Jard, he shows all the intelligence and capability of a sharp tail in the brain. Over and over again, his scenes were rough and unnecessary, and Peter Lorre just looks sick while standing there watching this stupid "action". It's so bad that it really destroys what could have been one of the better Moto films for its smart complication. The motto, now more international cop than the amoral character that originally was, is available to protect the precious object of theft. In a big turn, a few thieves attempt to steal the crown independently of each other. All in all, the movie can be watched, but there is enough evidence that the Moto Series should end here. With the advent of World War II, films could not survive much longer, because a nice Japanese leader would simply not be accepted in the US or in allied countries.
