I saw this film on the pre-election projection at the Guild Guilders Theater at Beverly Hills. As far as I remember, film producers and directors were present, probably to react to our reactions. It should have been a horror movie. If the audience was not scared, it seems to be filmmakers. They put off the release for more than a year. From curiosity I saw him again to see if he would cut it again; as far as I can say, they are not. It was the same bad movie, only a year older. Almost qualifies as "so bad, it's good," but it's slow and boring.
