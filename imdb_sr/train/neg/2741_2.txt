Spoiler !! I love Branagh, I love Helen Bonham-Carter, I loved them together in "Mari Shelley's Frankenstein" - but OVO - I can understand the desire of the actor to stretch, to avoid the romantic stereotype. Well, yes, but really - what it was written about, Bonham-Carter's clothing was chic, and the occasional accelerated "mighty" order could have been a clip from the Beatles movie, or old Rovan and Martin Laugh-In. I never understood the point - other commentators say that Branag's character was a dreamer. I never felt it. He was a loser, not very bright, and certainly not expensive. The business of disguising bank robbers was just sick to watch. Certainly not fun. Bonham-Carter's realistic (one assumed) attempt such as realistic speech was more difficult to understand than the first 15 minutes of the Lancashire accent in "Full Monty." The poetic ending, with him high on the hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his plane, was too much orchestrated. Was there a chorus of angels or just a soundtrack? Come back to the classic or something with a spine and a bow. Donate this to PBS. <br /> <br />
