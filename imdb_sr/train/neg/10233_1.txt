When thinking about captivity, many words come to mind. Among them are: uninteresting, unofficial, insensitive, non-expressive, inaccessible and unusual. I used to hate those mid-to-late-90s movies that basically were Scream's Ripples, but these new Sav knock-offs start to make your movies look like a classic. They continue to encourage the same demographics that those other films have been so successful in that, but now they add a new level of degeneration that consists of twelve to fourteen year old girls who aim to feel like they are hardcore and hip. br /> This film is the burden of boring shit! What the hell happened to Larry Cohen? His name was not related to anything good since 1993! Still, I was still surprised to see that it had anything to do with something bad! Was anyone surprised when the love of film was one of the psychopaths? Did anyone know when they first saw him? Only someone who has never seen another movie before in his life!
