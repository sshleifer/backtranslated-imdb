I still have not read the novel Shirley Jackson, something I intended to do for a while. I'm sure it must be more terrible than this movie. I remember how I jumped once when I watched it, although I can not remember the scene. Special effects are great and I watched it on a DVD, but I'm sure it was a great sight in the theater. After the first few special effects, I waited for the story to develop. I consider that this film must at least be based on a classic novel, so a good story should be there, but it is not. I was suppressed to look at the beautiful character of Catherine Zeta-Jones throughout the film, because there was nothing that could be seen. Lily Talor had such a shit. I did not like one thing, something about fierce people. Also, the guy from this film reminded me of cartoon Dudley DoRight with his voice and face. I could not even treat the characters at all. Kigon, and Liam Neeson did a great job trying to get through this movie with some sort of acting. Half to three quarters of the way I just dated to go to see campers Friday 13th or Scream Kueenish movie! At least there is some sort of fun value. If there are no stories there, at least they fill them with bloody death or attractive females. This had nothing. <br /> <br />
