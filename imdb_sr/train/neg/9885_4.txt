He only gets a third paycheck (behind Arthur Treacher and Virginia Field), but this was David Niven's first acting role and he is charmingly dumb as stupid Bertie Vooster of P. G. Vodehouse, a master (just by name) for Jeeves, who is the most inaccessible to the servant. As an adaptation, it looks more like a diluted 39 steps than a true Vodehousian trip. And that's bad, because the interaction between Treacher & Niven is not far from the mark. Unfortunately, the 'B' movie mysterious tropics and forced comedy become tiring even in a short 57 minutes. The following year (STEP LIVELI, JEEVES) was even more marked without Bertie in sight and Jeeves (of all people!) Who were forced to act.
