Poor shop (although good for B-movie), good scenes of fast fighting, at most 5 out of 10. But something has always bothered me about this film: how does Mariska Hargitai never speak? In the television version, she shares several intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, even a kiss in the garden. However, in a regular (video) version, most of its scenes are cut out and never talk. It bother me because it not only pulls out the female (although clich√©) look at the film, it also makes the final shot creepy. This film would be better off keeping her scenes, because in those scenarios, at least, there is a personality, one that lowers what Speakman says.
