What about the Americans and their descent with religious gobbled-gook? Thinking that this is the best-selling novel is incredible, but to take it as a movie, you really need a good acting and script that brings it. In this case, all good actors went to heaven and we stayed with Kirk Cameron as a CNN journalist (!) Who is trying to find out why many people simply disappeared. Oh yeah, there is a temptation of the evil world conspiracy and hunger, or something like that. The good news is that it works so cheap, and with such a meaningless dialogue, that it has pure entertainment value in all its unintended laughter. It is not recommended for anyone who has a 3-digit IK.
