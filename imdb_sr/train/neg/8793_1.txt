For those who decide to watch this movie and read these reviews for insight, I first offer you these four words: Do not waste your time! "Chungking Express" was skillfully shot, quick-hitting and looked like it was entirely imagined by someone who was standing in line at Hong Kong Burger King. I can not remember that I've ever watched a movie with a range of such one-dimensional characters that were trying to break through the script of this earthly one! It is an absurd attempt to philosophically funny dialogue (a man enters his submerged flat and offers an astonishing discovery that "tears can be dried with tissue, but water needs time to clear"). The same figure was also seen in a deep, meaningful relationship with its towels, soap, stuffy animals, dirty laundry, etc. And if that's not enough to vomit you into popcorn, we've heard the old California Dreaming show by Mamas and Papas, which has repeatedly overtaken the soundtrack over a very long string. Kuentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his Rolling Thunder Productions company, although I can not understand in my life why a man with his talent would be tortured. He is known to have noticed: "I'm happy I love film so much." However, many of us hope that they will concentrate on making their audience happy with more valuable discoveries in the future.
