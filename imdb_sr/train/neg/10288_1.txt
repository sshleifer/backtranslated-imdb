First of all I want to say that I love this show !!! But this episode ... this episode provokes the entire show. I do not know what they tried to achieve this episode, but they successfully made the episode VORST throughout the series. There is no story, everything is chaotic and jokes ... are shit. The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game. .... For example, "how they look like patching" by creating so stupid "earlier on ..." ... it's simply embarrassing. It's clear that the writers are working from ideas and it's really bad.
