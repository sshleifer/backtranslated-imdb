A very poor effort that does not offer anything to anyone except the hardcore fan Stanley Tucci, who is trying but can not save the poor structure, dialogue, direction or talent of our leading man. The only trick that this story about a naive new dealer for an alarm company has, is its unusual characters. But without a real background, such characters are meaningless. Nothing can be seen, keep moving ... <br /> <br />
