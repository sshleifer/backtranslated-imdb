It happened with Assault on Prescient 13 in 2005, it happened with The Lost Bois in 2008 and now it happened with another classic from Vargames 80's ... :( Why, oh why, oh, why Hollivood will never learn ? by themselves ... They can not be rearranged ... They are shit .... We all hate them ....! Those of you who have not seen the original 1983 version with Matthev Broderick & Alli Sheedi, go rent / buy now .... Hardware can look outdated, special effects are not new millennia, but still beating hands ...: For those of us who lived 80's when j The hacking was sexy, the Internet was something mysterious and your drives came as an 8-inch floppy, and now we have the wisdom to avoid this movie as a thermonuclear war! </ br>> Never before was "good chess game" better option.
