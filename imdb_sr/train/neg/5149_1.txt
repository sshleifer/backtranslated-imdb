This film is about a woman rape victim / comic book writer from New York who decides to run away from this terrible big city glamor and move into a dirty, small town where she finds refuge in a wide trailer on the ground much in the middle of the 12th and nowhere. The citizens are mentally ill, but she invited crazy people to her trailer. The disturbing fact is that she has the ability to do the right thing to put in dangerous circumstances after dangerous circumstances. DB Sveeneia was at best a high school. He is one of those sweet young actors with a sweet smile. Unfortunately, the career was not good, and the mother was right. The previous commentator who stated that the acting was "so real", I agree. Actually, it was not an act. The two main characters are truly pathetic, weak and incapable of making mature, healthy decisions. In short, this movie is shit like no one else, renting it to laugh at him. The real crime scene? A terrible wooden lining in a trailer - enough to convince the murder. And finally, she is an artist / writer, so she could not afford a double-width trailer and something other than the sunny Chevy Chevette for love for God!
