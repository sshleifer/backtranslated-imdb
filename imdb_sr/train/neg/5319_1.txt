A recipe for one of the worst movies of all time: a villain who seems to have fled from the VVF has a terrible target with a gun that has inconsistent effects (the first guy to shoot, catch fire, but when he kills someone they just disappear) and takes time for pet deer. Then you got unfavorable characters, students of 30 years, a poor attempt to end a surprise and much more. Avoid at all costs.
