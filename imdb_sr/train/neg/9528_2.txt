There is much talk about torture today. That's all this. It's a good person who makes a bad decision. Because of his kindness, he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. Since then, he has attacked him. I do not know at what time you are doing something about it. There somewhere there is a woman and a child; he has great feelings of guilt and fear. But it took a few moments to work. The movie seems to be a joke. I suppose, after Manson's killings, we had a small fixation on the similar ones. Still, why would someone make such a movie? What kind of complaint does it have, except sadism? The conclusion is completely unsatisfactory, but this could have been remedied by an obvious turning point. Oh well. Another hour and a half of my life.
