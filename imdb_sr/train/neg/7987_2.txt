I'm sure this is one of those "VOAH!" attraction in 1982 when Epcot was opened, but now it's just nonsense. The film's message is clich√©. The circular vision is disoriented. And this terrible song in the end is a grid. And I really want to install the seats. After so much walking, all you want is to sit for a few minutes. And when you hear that there is a movie that seems to sound pretty glamorous! Have fun while you're sitting, right? VRONG! Stand there for 18+ minutes leaning against a short fence. Disney's should make the newer Maelstrom an attraction to revive things and replace this boring movie. It's NOT FUN. Skip. In fact, skip Canada until you eat there. Go directly to the United Kingdom.
