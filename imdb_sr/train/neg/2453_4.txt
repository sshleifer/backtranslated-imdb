Perhaps I gave this film a higher rating before the outbreak of Peter Jackson's trilogy, but by looking at the two of them there is simply no comparison. The speed of this movie has rushed, many important scenes from the book have been omitted, and the development of character is small. Animation is a strange mix of traditional cartoon cartoons and live action scenes that are painted, which I found disturbing. And what's most disappointing in this movie is that it breaks in the middle of a story and it's never finished. There are some good points - the battles are exciting to watch, and the dialogue follows the book to a large extent on the letter. Look at this if you are in a hurry and you can not spend 10 hours watching a new trilogy. But if you have not read the book, you'll probably be confused, because in this version, it's a lot lacking. 4 of 10
