A terrific Ramon movie. Your worse than the average comedic format from the 1970s / 80s, when cool kids took over the school with some imaginative plan. This movie is horrible. The action consists of a girl who enjoys Ramones and a school that tries to fight against their repressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something like Vild Zero played by Guitar Wolf if you like a fun B movie. Terrible acting, horrible writing, terrible complicity with the seal of Ramones approval, which probably prompted a bit of money, and they said that on this film. It's the only logical thing I can imagine because this film blows.
