This is the only worst movie I've ever seen. I can not say how bad it is. I sincerely wanted to kill myself several times through this terrible experience just to have the pain. I recommend instead of watching this movie, swimming in acid, and then you will at least recognize a part of the pain without all the scars. I had such great expectations when I read the DVD Case, and when he initially added that Jesus followed them, I was so excited ... then I eventually wanted to kill myself. I mean twenty-three minutes of getting to know the most disadvantageous characters in the history of the film. Monkeys could better sort this garbage. At least they would throw feces and blur some of the trash. It would be better if he did not see any horror. It was not that I did not get jokes, but that they were not only not ridiculous, but they repeated like twenty times. Obviously, something is not funny if you do not see it as a million times. Under no circumstances do you see this. People estimate that Manos' hands are the fate of the worst world film. And I saw it and I agree that it's bad ... but ALAS is just the second worst. The "busy bus" is far worse. It deserves every kind of rude language, but I can not write it so I just imagine that I swore to the crowd.
