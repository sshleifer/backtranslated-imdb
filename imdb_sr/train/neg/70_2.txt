This film never reached the theater in our area, and when it became available on DVD, I was one of the first to rent it. I had to listen to critics once and forward this. Despite the excellent cast of actors, the film was very disappointing. Now I see why he went directly to the video. I thought I could have some value with Bloom, Ledger, and Rush. Everybody did a wonderful job in the past. The film was slow and never withdrew. I did not manage to develop much empathy for the characters and I had to fight against the urge to make quick progress only to come to an end. I do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it only for the needs of the "Eye Candy". It will not satisfy even that.
