Somebody told me this is one of the best adult movies so far. Since then I have discredited everything that this individual told me after I saw this film. It's horrible. Without going into long descriptions of different scenes, take my word for it, scenes of sex are at best unattractive. Jenna in normal street clothes initially was the peak of the film (she looks good), but from there it's all downhill.
