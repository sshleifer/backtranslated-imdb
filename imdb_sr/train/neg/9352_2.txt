You can often say that the film did not fall out as you would do with the narrator. This film features this device. Richard Jobson is not completely satisfied with writing direct and even funding some of these films, adding his credits by reading excerpts from his own semi-autobiographical writing which, combined with some pretty editing, manages to smooth out what is a boring depressing story he misinterprets for an authentic house. Kevin McKidd is a good result. Everyone else is fine. Budget constraints meant that all the scenes were shot in the daylight, although most of them are obviously intended to be at night, although you know that serious alcoholics mostly work during the day, so this is added to me by the Most Funny Part of This The movie is a waitress who fails to endure a day in the 20 years that she has been running between her performances - an extreme version of McKidd's problem going from 18 to 30, not changing more than her clothes. Bless.
