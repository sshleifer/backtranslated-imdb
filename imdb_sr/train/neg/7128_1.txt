I'm a stupid person for renting DVD REDLINE. Chicago Pictures, which made this stupid film, never paid the Palisades Media Group to buy web ads on various automotive locations, including mines that have a 16K ALEX rating. They took me to work and now I came out with $ 16,000 and they lost a lot of their personal time (Peter's relationship to Palisades Media) who know who you are! Please do not rent or buy a movie !!! It's bullshit and people behind him are ripoff artists. REDLINE has a bunch of losers and poor actors! This film is a joke
