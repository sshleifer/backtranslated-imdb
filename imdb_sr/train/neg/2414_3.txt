I accidentally noticed this film on the shelf under "new releases" and found the idea of ​​hip-hop zombie film that it was too interesting to miss. So it was charged on a box, and I thought: "What a great idea!" In addition, there is also the sign "Welcome to Oakland". How could I resist? Unfortunately, the hip-hop part lasted until the theme opened. No hip-hop music or hip-hop cultures did not have much roles in the movie. Since I lived in Oakland, I know that there are many wishes for hip-hop artists, so the low budget of this film was not an excuse not to have appropriate music. Any number of artists struggling would jump on the opportunity to contribute to this film. Why Kuiroz Brothers did not take advantage of this advantage is beyond me. When the film began to roll, it was a completely typical zombie movie with an actor team that was exactly so black and Latin. You might think it could lead to an unusual slope of the film ... but it's not. In some ways, the vision of the "urban culture" of Kuiroz brothers is reduced to shooting from cars and throwing F-bombs into every line of the movie. The quick use of the word "fuck" is probably the most significant feature of this movie; there were single lines that contained the word three or four times, and none of the lines contained it at least once. I was not at all angry with the cursing in the movie, but the feeling was that it was the result of a lack of ideas by writers (also Kuiroz brothers), and the scenario was mostly very bad. br /> Film was generally a disappointment. It would be interesting to see the true "urban culture" of zombies, but "Hood of the Dead Dead" is not delivered to this account. The characters in the movie could also be white or Eskimo or anything else. The film did not have a special taste. It's just another young, low-budget soundtrack with bad acting, bad writing, amateur direction, mild cinema, cheap soundtrack, and nothing to recommend.
