Memoirs of a geisha is a beautifully filmed film, there is no doubt about it. And acting is generally great, at least in terms of how it shows the characters how they are scripted. However, so many details are small and big are just _vrong_ that I just feel too full to enjoy. A small detail that characterizes the kind of lack of sensibility is one scene (this does not spoil anything) where Mameha rings the bell hanging on the door of the house where Saiuri lives, in the snowy winter day. The ringing bell is fuurin, or the bell in the wind - just left to hang outside the house in Japan in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes did not have bells on the door - they just opened the door and announced themselves. (You may think this is such a trivial detail, but I would equate this with a film made about America where the Christmas wreath is at the door in July, and no one thinks about it) on the completely wrong haircuts given to the cat and gay, which is unclear pan-Asian / Chinese / kung-fu-ish, and nothing like the real thing. I think that this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture that they are trying to portray really comes up in the views and views of people and situations. So, I assume that the less you know about Japanese culture and the world of geisha and maik in Kyoto (what is "Miyako"), I suppose you will enjoy it more. I honestly think this movie could be much better ... as it is, it's just another Hollywood version of "Exotic Japan".
