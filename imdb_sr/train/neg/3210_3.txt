There is actually no way to go around the bushes saying this, Ladi Death: A film that's just a shit. In addition to the fact that the main character is a well-endowed blonde moving around the Hell in a leather bikini with occasional graphic violence, it seems that the film was made with the 1980s cartoon-minded filmmaking based on the line of action figures. I am a bad guy even speaking as Skeletor vannabe, has a compulsory incompetent companion and lives in a lair that looks like it was made by the villain of the old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon film. Just do not expect any humor except for the sometimes envious bad dialogue. On other occasions she feels like an anime story better adapted to hentai, but no sex, no tweaks (thanks to goodness!) And very little sexual attraction, this despite the physical appearance of the title character. Simply, there is no adult material, if you do not count the half-hero of heroin and bloody death. Basically, what we have here is the feature-length episode of She-Ra, the princess of power, but with skimpier clothes and worse.
