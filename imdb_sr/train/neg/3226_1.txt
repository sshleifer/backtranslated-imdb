With this film we have reached the peak of incredibility. Basically, Dinosaurs come to this ship managed by a strange old fart called Neveies (which I needed after I watched this movie). Apparently, Neveies hear the desires of children everywhere and decides that they should satisfy the children's desire that Dinosaurs be brought into the modern age to be seen by all because of shameless exploitation. Dinosaurs eat these things that make them smarter (It's a shame that the screenwriters did not have it). By the way, does it seem strange that from all the children's desires in the world, Neveies approves of the desire to bring dinosaurs to modern times? Why not meet the wishes of children to stop hunger? Disease? War? I mean, come on! Does Neveies have nothing better than all that power that you have? Finally, when Dinosaurs arrive in modern times, they begin to sing, dance and destroy desolation (essentially what can be seen on a bad LSD trip, I mean where else could you see T-Rek playing golf and jumping on a balloon Spider-Man?). They end up in a circus, and Neveies Brother Screwies (???) makes the kids who have made friends with dinosaurs sign an empty contract. Why? Why would the children sign an empty contract ??? Screwies say that if the dinosaurs take a little ... "Brain-Drain" to let the kids. Dinosaurs, instead of tearing up the evil Screvei limbs from their limbs, surrender and agree to his conditions. What?! This is stupid! They could only endanger him, force him to give up his contract, eat it, and then go with the children. I think filmmakers have tried to show that violence is bad, which is a controversial point where dinosaurs finally escape and a string of crows embrace Screveies and obviously eat it completely. Oh yeah, it's not at all violent! We went back without meaning, it's not fun, it's stupid, stupid, poorly written and contains some of the biggest holes ever made for the movie. Even for a children's movie ... this is bad.
