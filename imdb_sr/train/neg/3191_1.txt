There are films that are horrible, and there are also movies that are so horrible to be considered long forgotten and invisible. Also, a lot of violence and bad things (not just raw things, you know what I mean) also contribute to the mix. What is the result of bad films with such rude content? Why, "Final Justice", of course! Remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the star of this movie, and they were shot by Joel and Bots at the "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Now that Mike took Joel's place on the satellite of love (but with the same bots), the trio had to mock the second MST3K film Joe Don Baker, "Final Justice". Of course, much of the naughty things I mentioned were removed for a television show, but still, I want to watch that episode (and "Mitchell") because Joe Don "hates the most"? Why, nothing but "Mysterious Scientific Theater 3000!" P.S. If you have Big Lots nearby, check this action for the uncut strip! LOL It happened to another user!
