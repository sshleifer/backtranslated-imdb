I am generally more willing to be open to the Roma commies than many, but it simply was not a good try. It has nothing to do with comparing with the British original - they have not seen, and I doubt that I will. It has a lot to do with the twisting complication, the lack of chemistry between tracks and the incredible performance of the alleged male lead (Jimmy Fallon). Fallon walk on the screen wearing clothes and hairstyles of 15 years and acting ten years younger than that. He should be the teacher you see, and of course it is well known that school districts all over the world like to hire individuals less mature than the children they suggest. The character is so extreme upset and irrational that I doubt that some actor could make it nice, but old reliable things like John Kuzak or Adam Sandler might have been able to try it out. Not Falon, who is neither funny nor an actor, but he seems to think it's both. Not once throughout the film you do not believe Fallon in his role, or you believe there is a way in which these two men would or should have been together. At the end of the film there is a scene in which Barrimore (who was cute as usual, but could not take this person - it's hard to have romance with one person) tells Fallon that it's all over, that too much happened, and she's moving on the. And instead of feeling bad about the scene, or sorry about Fallon, you're actively cheering - she finally does what she was supposed to do a few months ago. But, of course, the mechanics of the plot will not allow it to be the end (the end that could actually give a statement from this mess), and instead, we see a rational career that throws it all away to follow this childish idiot and encourage his deceptions. Of course, it meant it was rotten and satisfying, but it actually made me even worse than anything else.
