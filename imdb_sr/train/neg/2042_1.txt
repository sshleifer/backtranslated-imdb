Zodiac Killer. 1 of 10. The worst thing ever. There's really no worse behavior ever. David Hess (Last House on the left side ... not the one from the seventies. Find out it is really good) is the worst of the crowd (Pretty strong competition, but he is astoundingly godly-horrible.) One would be hard pressed to find a home- a film with such an accidental presence of the camera. The film actually creaks up to an incredibly painful downtime when it's on the screen. It's not that the film actually has some of the features that Mr. Hess could do to them. It's shot with a home camera and it's pretty old in appearance, complete with a supplied microphone. No post production. Come on, there must be a five-year-old computer that could clean this picture. Insert images of bizarre autopsy images and take off the aircraft carrier and this is a visually concealed image. The images of the autopsy are inserted in the way that Italian Cannibal Films insert these killings of animals in real life. And the navy shots should be some kind of antiwar statement (because we know all the bloodthirsty maniacs join the navy) What in the world does the Lion Gate do to liberate this garbage? That would embarrass Throm. The plot is about the Zodiac killer (last seen in Dirty Harry, not the one from the 1970s. Find out this is really good.) Someone will be shot in the stomach in LA, and police officers assume that the Zodiac killer is back? Uh huh. What can you expect from a movie that does not know that DSM IV is a book that is not a psychiatric disorder and where does the relationship of a young killer of an older man resemble a relationship with a congressional party and a closed congressman? That eighty hairstyles and production values ​​meet with the subdivision of Nambla. Sign me up.
