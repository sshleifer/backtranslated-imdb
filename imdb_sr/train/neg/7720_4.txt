There are not enough gay-themed movies and there are not enough films to come out. Each is a welcome addition to the genre. Although the production values ​​are high (the film looks good), Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks really good in a pair of jeans) this is bad. It's a piece of the period: gay life under the oppressive regime (East Berlin, 1989) life that looks 40 years behind the West. In a way we see our history; what could have been like gays in the 1940s and 1950s here (it often reminded me of Last Ekite to Brooklin: The book is not a movie). from Ingmar Bergman. It's so messy. I wonder if the director did not hack at random. Yes, it is a miracle that this was taken and published before the wall collapsed and that life behind the 'Curtain' was difficult for gay people. A good director could show all this without interrupting the audience. A good director would make me mark this as one of the great movies that come, not as one of the failures.
