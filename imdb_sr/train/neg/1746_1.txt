Probably the worst movie from Bollivood I saw. No line for parcel. Very little character development. Full of nonsense and senseless humor. The whole film was chaotic and without direction. There was no proper ending of the story. The airport was recorded at the mall. The same story is over and chewed again until you want to say, "Please, just keep up with it !!" Even the song and dance were meaningless and poorly choreographed. The only good thing in this movie is that it was all around you ... but then most Bollywood movies have this anyway these days. Btv I'm not from Indian background <br /> 2/10
