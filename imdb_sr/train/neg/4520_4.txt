Irwin Allen was great. All his TV shows had an excellent pilot, or the first episode. the rest was essentially disconnected from his other shows. Several episodes of the Swiss family Robinson were discarded from his old TV shows. One episode of the Swiss family is identical to the episode of "The Earth of the Giants" when a member of the party needs a surgery of the bowel. The fair was a high budget and too expensive to continue. Irwin lost touch with TV shows after the sixties. The acting is strong with Martin Milner. The children's stars came from this performance, such as Villie Ames and Helen Hunt. One bright spot is when Irvine Alen includes his scene of a catastrophe such as Typhoon and volcanic eruption called the "Master of Disaster"
