Some have praised Atlantis: The Lost Empire as a Disney Adventure for Adults. I do not think so - at least not for adult thinking. This script suggests the beginning as a live action movie that has hit someone as a type of shit that you can no longer sell to adults. The "full staff" of many older adventure films was done much earlier (I think Dirty Dozen), but - Atlantis - is one of the worst films in this motif. The characters are weak. Even the background that each member shows is at best inconvenient. A doctor of medicine, a medical man, whose father always wanted sons, if we had not seen them before, we saw boring combinations. The story of how one companion, Winnie, played by Don Novel (Fr. Guido Sarducci), left the flower shops to demolish completely inconvenient. Just the main character, Milo Thatch, a young Atlantis academician expressed by Michael J. Fok, has a depth for him. Milo's quest for Atlantis continues with that of his grandfather who raised him. The introductory scene shows much younger Miloja, who shifts to his knees, while his grandfather puts his head on his head. And while the characters were at best thin, the best part about Atlantis was the talent of voice. Commander Rourke does not lose anything that James Garner has expressed. Although Rourke is a fairly military type, Garner shows his ability to breathe life into characters simply by his delivery. Garner's vocal performance is the highlight. I'm sorry to say that the king of dying Leonardo Nimoi is nothing more than compulsory. In addition, Don Novello as a demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also known for one or two well-made, ridiculous lines - but I always loved my father Guido Sarduci, in any case. Also well done was Computer Animation. Animation of the background, that is. Character animation does nothing if it does not make straight characters. Except for landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is not much to impress. The plot was the worst. Some say they are truncated or banal. I'm not sure about that. Any useful plot can be turned into something new with proper treatment. Shakespeare often went from a famous story and complicated, and was only known for putting a new layer of color. So, treatment is a matter. I - Atlantis - obviously it does not. I can not start to enter all of the logical gaps without the spoiler section. The plot was bad. The bridges of the plot crack like a rope, and the ending makes no sense. Adding to this, the script and animation are filled with boring mischief. ** SPOILERS ** Right at the beginning when Milo reveals that the Riley or Celtic symbols are incorrectly transliterated and the "coast of Ireland" should read "the coast of Iceland", we begin to we have problems. Script writers should know that the British are taking for Eire or Eireann as "Ireland" and completely ignore the older Latin term Hibernia. But more than that, they must know about the Viking conspiracy to call the Green Island of Greenland and Greenland. By making it a matter of mistranslated "letters", the writers condemned the request for a run-time version of the English and post-Roman dates on the letter. Since Atlantis was to sink into its underwater cave. And with no visible traces and less technology than Milo had, the inscription made it much less reliable. The shepherd's diary could not have been written before sinking Atlantis, or you would not know anything about a cave or crystal. lies "in the king's eye". It must have been written after sinking, but without the technology that Milo's expedition had, as, say, anyone from the leviathan. How can he know more about anything after that? And why would that be written in the Atlantic? Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However, clairvoyance and astral travel do not require writing in the Atlantic. So it must be some kind of automatic writing. Since no one else in Atlantis can read, the ghosts of crystal-colored messages must surface. That would make more sense. But it could also be explained in the film: Milo could discover that this power was called his entire life - appeared in dreams, etc. That was to be explored in the film. Atlantis simply would not be able to understand modern languages. No one expects the original Indo-people to speak in Europe, more than the Romans would understand that it was difficult "c" or their day became French "ch" (pronounced as "sh", not less!) The current Atlantis were alive before cataclysm - when they could obviously * read it, and now they are not able to read what they used to do or to operate similar machines. Mass illiteracy points to a key disadvantage in the film. It seems that nothing has happened to this culture. It seems suspended in the air until Milo can save him. Although life does not appear to be a constant struggle for survival, nobody wants to write poetry or write novels, and maybe it is a combination of Atlantic school system that goes downhill to the end and the lack of good fiction that led to Atlantis falling into Illness. Kida can apologize for not knowing how to read or manage the machinery if she was so young when the cataclysm of stupidity started - but EVERY of that ** hardly trains her father for Deification !! Kashakim's stupidity almost wiped its people from existence by hand. He killed a bunch of cataclysms, stopped the progress (he was not much killed here, but he monitored a massive slide in culture and progress) until someone could take a crystal to kill anyone if they were not first cooked in the lava because the Giant Robots were not there to protect them . Light blue currents were supposed to break Kashakim's likeness, when Kida tried to merge a picture of a father in the circle of the great kings of Atlantis! Although Milo was the only one who could read the Atlantic, Rourke and others knew enough to look at the book of nonsense and found a page on the crystal - which he knew was a crystal, not some stylized astrological or " Phase If Milo's grandfather told Rourke about this, it still does not explain how Rourke suffered from Milo's reading as a part of the book. The plotting of the page - which was full of ears in Rourke's hand, although Milo did not find it no sign of a strange page in the book, obviously - it was just there that he turned the viewer to "not o is wrong. "Unless the word" crystal "in Milo's head triggers an alert that someone will try to steal it, Milo would not suspect anything. It's just a thick front shadow." Double Cross "The crew was not a character change, but we found out that Vinnie, Sveet, Audrei and Cookie had been working with Rourke from the beginning, but" heart change "was falling, which was a change and it should have been better motivated. they had nothing to start. It's a little puzzling that the lava runs across the dome, rather than filling the rest of the area in which we see the sequence of. It's fluent; it will not run over the protective dome until it fills up all the lower spaces. Completion WINTER! - and it makes no sense other than to calm political correctness. After renewing the energy source, Atlantis is no longer a weak force to be lazy. Huge robotic guards and celestial lightning shooting cycles indicate that they have less fear than we could. Technology is superior to ours, and definitely to the beginning of the 20th century. In the end, Milo should teach the Atlanteans to read, for what? The idea is to leave a small, peaceful, suicidal culture, not to send it to a hyperdrive. ** FINAL SPOILERS ** Perhaps, the knack of the lost world and the setting at the turn of the century should give me the indication that this is a more honorable release of pulp. The flaws I found in the film agree with that idea. But I'm not sure why I would pay to see thin characters and plan holes just because they had many novels. And pulp stories are part of the "shit that can no longer be sold to adults." We have become a bit more sophisticated and our cellulose has also to grow. The Raiders of the Lost Ark did not lose any sense and escaped so bad. 4 out of 10 - the movie is pleasing, but while thinking about complication, everything is lower.
