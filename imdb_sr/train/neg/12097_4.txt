I did not really hope much when I went to see this. After Mst3king with JasonKs with some friends, however, I was hoping for a similar experience. Unfortunately, the movie has become too serious. Do I care about Jason's problems? I'm sorry. There are films from the legion Ft13 that cover it. At the end of the day, he's a serial killer of the undead, I just will not be so cute. Freddie was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with hallucinations and what was not, but unfortunately, there was little and far between and to the end of the movie, it turned into a bad episode of the death of celebrities ... it's just not funny. <br /> <br />
