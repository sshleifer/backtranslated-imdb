It hurts me to write such a sharp review, but by not doing it, I simply encourage these people. First, just because the film is made on a small budget does not make it automatically good or expensive. In fact, in this case, the small budget is probably the only achievement of the films in that it prevented large sums of money from spreading on one leg of a horse with bullshit. Have you ever seen comedy in the theater? Have you ever heard people laugh and think "what are you dickens"? Even these tweaks did not laugh. Things became so bad by the middle of the time my cat took its first bath. This is not a movie, these are children ... there are no monkeys who make pictures that leave you like moving to France. I have to go, the clown is at my door .............
