I was very disappointed with this film. I expected more than Thelma and Louise of a female crime movie. Instead, women who escaped from prison did not have a sense of loyalty. These were extremely vulgar packages of hyenas, who beat each other, duplicated each other, and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the film. Instead of being spasmodic thieves, who held together to plan an escape and found a hidden stock of money, the women who escaped were too selfish and wicked to long believe each other. These women were not liberated in a positive sense. They just ended up as a bunch of free cannons, incapable of respecting themselves or each other. If you like women's movies in the '70s, skip this bomb and watch The Tekas Tekas Dinamite Chase, starring Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
