Lorne Michaels proves once again that there is absolutely no work in film production. I would think that after such ghastly movements "Superstar", "Night in Rokburi" and "Coneheads", they start to get the idea that maybe it does not know what it is about when it comes to the film (and many would say that he does not know what he is doing when it comes to television). Trying to make feature films from skis that came out of their welcome for the third time, this was done at the SNL. . It's a shame to see a talented guy who is lost in a movie that is awkward after an unhappy situation, and all this covers a terribly bad song and dance scene. Every laugh will be because the film is so bad, not because it's ridiculous. Oh, well, at least we can be grateful that there are many other tired SNL characters who will never record movies about them. It's a shame that this one made a big screen.
