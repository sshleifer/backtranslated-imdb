Once again, like Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds, the TV series turns into a full-length movie and is being destroyed for hundreds of people who watched. Basically, Vojvodina cousins, Luke (Johnny Knokville) and Bo (Seann Villiam Scott) in the Hazzard district, spend a lot of time riding very quickly at General Lee. But they have to unite and prevent their family farm being destroyed along with almost the entire city by nasty Jefferson Davis, the "head" of Hogg (Razzie nominated Burt Reinolds) to make room for a large coal mine. They get help on the way from their sexy cousin Daisi (Razzie nominated Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Villie Nelson), while Rosco P. Coltrane (Lost's M.C. Also starring Joe Don Baker as Governor Jim Applevhite, Jack Polick as deputy Cletus Hogg, David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Veston as deputy Enos Strate and Linda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason which I gave the film to another star because of several impressive cars, and of course the beautiful body of Simpson (I admit that her legs are not completely Catherine Bach, but nevertheless!), but apart from being pretty bored, she is nominated for Razzies for Vorst Picture, worst director for Jai Chandrasekhar , the worst remake or sequel, the worst couple for Simpson and her "Daisy Dukes" and the worst scenario. Pretty poor!
