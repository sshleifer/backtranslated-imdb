This sad little movie has little resemblance to the revival of Broadway in 1971, which was such a nostalgic hit. Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove directed this revival, he remodeled the book extensively. I have the feeling that this scriptwriter also changed the original version of 1925. I played 'innocent philanderer' Jimmy Smith on the 1974 scene, and I thought this $ 1 DVD would bring back memories. No chance. Even the expected enjoyment of watching "Topper" Roland Iounga playing "my" part was a great disappointment. Three songs from the pieces remain, and they are doing very badly. Even a classic duet, "Tea for Two", works as a virtual solo. Many famous faces in this fiasco from 1940 are not really proud, and the star, Anna Neagle, is just ashamed. When I feel a gypsy wearing a dollar, I know that the film must be bad. The other commentator mentioned the version of Doris Dai, which is actually called "Tea For Tvo", and it's about the stage play (original, of course), so those who are looking for the true "No No Nanette" can find a more recognizable version there.
