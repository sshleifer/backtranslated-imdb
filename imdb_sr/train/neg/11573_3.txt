Last night I came to the review before I decided which TV film would be placed in front of me, and those I found found that this film seemed inevitable. How I'm in mischief! First, it is necessary to emphasize that this is a very large daily housewife. The performances are wooden, each sentence is an 'touchy' attempt in the way the housewives and bad soap operas are always found, and is based on this predictable and well-thought-out premise that men (especially soldiers) are essentially violent and incompassionate. The whole film talks about the 'drama' that appears in moments when male characters threaten to develop another dimension. If it sounds to you tolerable (or even pleasant), then be warned. The German accent of Linde Hamilton, although quite good, hampers painfully - like her face, for some reason. Other performances are no doubt a permanent source of disgrace for their perpetrators, with painfully thin and obvious characteristics that are in order. There are little surprises, but watch out for the endless supply of food and drinks "Monti Pithoneskue" that is miraculously appearing from the backpack of hungry soldiers! I did not expect action, but I was hoping to be pretty or textured or emotionally charged. What I got was a particularly bad Christmas story about a "good mood" that will have an intelligent audience that breaks into all of this. Consider under the following circumstances: 1: Nothing else is on it. 2: You are a fan of a predictable 'housewife who takes men and wins' TV films. 3: The only way to grasp the true story is when Hollivood turns into a feature film. 4: Imbibed enough enough for your emotions to easily stir up unsophisticated narratives.
