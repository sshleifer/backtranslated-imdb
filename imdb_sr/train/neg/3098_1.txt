As Rico Sloan was allowed to make five films, it's harder to believe from a cold fusion. This film is absolutely criminal. Before I watched this movie, I thought Manos: The Fate of Destiny was the worst piece of shit I've ever seen, but even if Manos moves so slowly that you can fall asleep, saving your eyes from pain that will suffer. The greatest tragedy of this film is that the old man who keeps Hobbobline "locked" comes to the final scene. The time I spent watching this movie was the absolute loss of my life.
