"Domino Principle" is, without a doubt, one of the worst trillers ever made. It's hard to imagine a complicated plot and you will want to raise your hands in frustration half way through and scream "I quit !!!" Kramer has ever encountered this mess, only has to be summarized by their wages. I hope that they have well spent their money.
