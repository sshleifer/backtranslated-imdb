Russell Hopton acted in many films until his death in 1945. Frankie Darro sometimes had the abrasive presence of the screen, but in that he played a good child. Apparently he was very popular on the "house" track - he made so many movies. This is played by the son of an old oil rig who is convinced he will soon strike oil. J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) is trying to persuade an old man to sell out because he knows that oil will be hit at any time. Geologist, Henry, comes to the scene and helps Father Fishtail. He also assures "Fishtail" to go to school regularly. Henry has an eye on Sinti, a beautiful teacher. This was the last film by Gloria Shee - she began her career as Olive Shea in Glorifiing the American Girl (1929). Fishtail's dad was killed when the platform was sabotaged and Henry was determined to bring Anderson and his friends to justice. When Henry is abducted, Anderson tries to persuade Fishtail to sell its oil lease. Everything finishes well with oil and "Fishtail" goes to military school. It's OK for a rainy day.
