Let me be quite clear about this film. I did not watch this movie because of complications, I watched it for sexual scenes. In view of this, this film is so damn horrible to turn around between pure joy that I see the pious body of Traci (Mandi Schaffer) and pull out the eyeballs for the catastrophe of complications. in the first scene of the movie, I already had fun ... you see a woman who pictures something by the lake, in pure bliss and tranquil, then a beautiful girl approaches and asks if she can paint next to her. When both of them finished, they showed each other what they did ... and the woman drew WINDOWS, WHEN CONTRIBUTING WITH INFRONT LAKES. What would be the interference? And in the second scene, Traci killed the lover of her teacher by smashing it with a rod for sails, and then floating, and none of the city police once suspected it. I mean HELLOOOOO? Mandi did not wear a glove? IT'S PRINTERS AT THE RING ON ALL YOUR DAMN BOAT !! After that, the worst, when Mandi is nearby, there is a "cold" sound effect that sounds like a cat in a hiss fit. It's also a real disadvantage that Rosanna Arquette is in this movie. I'm really sorry that she had to act in this super-low budget without soft pornography. The same goes for Jurgen Prochnova, who also has an accident to play in this movie. All in all, 2/10.
