One of those "coming" movies that should have nostalgia for adults and a promise for children. This film does not exist. It's a bad excuse for Silvie Kristel's body to be duplicated with stupid Eric Brawne. To make things worse, the movie is either dumb or stupid when trying to be fun, sexy or dramatic. You laugh awkwardly because we need to believe that a teenager will leave alone with a buried dead woman in his yard. Think about why a woman known for Emmanuelle needs a double body. As the film was going on, I began to imagine a private lesson hybrid and the Little Miss Millions that Silvia Kristel gave Jennifer Love Hevitt as Howard Hesseman makes us nostalgic for VKRP. Watch this for you to laugh at the stupidity of other people, or for the performance by Ed Beglei Jr., or wondering how Silvia Kristel would look like Jennifer Love Hevitt. But I can give you an idea of ​​your lesson, stay away from the movies that stun Silviu Kristel who is not Emmanuelle.
