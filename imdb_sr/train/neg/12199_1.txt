- My sister and I are watching this movie now. We have a laughing deaf. Can you imagine the covers on the cover of the nomination for Oscar? - First, the musician has about 4-5 different music styles ... and music is not synchronized with the scenes and moves of the character ... --- The main character of Silvester does not fit there. Looks like Mexican Tarzan. ---- Russian soldiers are all besides Russian faces :-) ----- ok, main points: 1st plane called charter colored in black ... 2. What is the idea when Rambo goes to jump off the plane but gets stuck? rope mik 3. a Girl? The best scene is when she dies. He means a lot to him. has known her for years? he cries after her, ... about my God Samurai 4. how much arrow does it have? is his arrow arrow always full of arrows? I did not notice the scene where it was collected - but I saw a scene where the arrow remains in the head of Vietnamese soldering - it is very important 5. how much rocket can hold a helicopter ??? (real) I saw 4th but Rambos hit about 20 of them. 6. Main part. what Russian Special Forces helicopters are operating in Vietnam ????????? after war? 7. The first scene when he entered the Vietnam camp ... His first idea was to free the shelter that stands on the tree in the open space, what idea, but again: 1. With a knife, can iron wire be cut? maybe only in Vietnam? 2nd mortar - to kill one running man? My God, the Americans really have to learn about weapons! you know how much it takes to calibrate a mortar (I think the writer watched a lot of World War II films)
