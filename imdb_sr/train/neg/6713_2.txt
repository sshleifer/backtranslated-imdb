But this film was boring. The historical part was good, but the musical part was not. Not a single song I did not care about and no sound listening to. If Cute Jesus "should have been a comic relief, it would never succeed." If John Adams should have been disgusting and boring, the rest they were trying to get him into every scene. <br /> <br> /> Hancock and Jefferson were the only viable characters in the whole movie. The context was interesting enough, but insufficient to overcome the lack of music in the musical. Do not you need to sing songs after a musical, except a few chips , nothing was worth the breath.
