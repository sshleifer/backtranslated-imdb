I should have known that I was in trouble with Casper Van Diem as the main character. The words can not describe, nor do they make this movie horrible. But let me try to describe it: horrible acting, horrible dialogue, troubled situations and through all this you get the feeling of feeding you the beliefs and propaganda of the Trinity Broadcasting Network. It's a bad attempt to show Hollivood that the movie can be fun and have a deep, religious message. They lost their misery. That was obviously the worst movie I've ever seen for a long time.
