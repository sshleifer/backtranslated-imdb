It simply takes away the breath in its horror - you really must see it! Depending on your perspective, Dylan Valsh is either a rescuer or a problem here: since he is the only one on the screen who can really get his peak out of something similar to natural cadences and folds, or destroys a film pointing to flaws of all others, or saves it by providing a context for their horror. I bow down later look-- thanks to him, working as a high comedy. He is a 7-meter dwarf basketball player, his set of skills are not applied in this context, and his discombobulation is delicious. The real treat is, however, Mrs. Eastwood, whose inability to speak in plain English is so much that she is actually guggling, expecting to find out that she is a Russian beauty who phonetically pronounced her lines, without understanding their meaning. But no: she's just an American with no talent that will leave you to laugh at every line she's dropping. If she knew what the lines meant, she must remain an open question.
