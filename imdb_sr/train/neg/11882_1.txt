I walked a few times on the shelf, watching countless huge positive quotes (with little names) on the front and wondering if I was missing something. One evening he was on one of the movie channels, and I got involved. Nothing missed me. I must admit that I was just looking at the first 30 minutes. Perhaps the movie then becomes a golden comedy. Given the slowness, speed and total lack of laughter in the first 30, I seriously doubt it. Main character begins film in style "I do not know how to start my movie". , with a long, tedious monologue of how he does not want to be sad. It's not funny. It's not even funny. Others commented on the "San Francisco"; ok, a little smile when it first says. Then he moves him to the ground, laughing the camera as if it were the most fun thing ever written. Get over yourself. In fact, I think that talking with the camera was the reason why I immediately realized the film. Do not assume that you are familiar with the audience. Knowledge is exhausted, and respect. From here in essence you have a fat guy who speaks in a very feminine manner about his boring life as a pace. I did not know he was a Jew; it is the discrediting of Jewish comedians to call it "Jewish humor". It's just stupid humor. Just because you are a Jew, does not mean you have a sense of comedy. VASP, Spalding Grai, works better than self-analytic humor of this type, so obviously it's not ethnicity. If it's one of the parts I've seen radio, maybe I'm stuck. But some people who talk about how much he likes the names of the women he works with, and then lists them for five minutes, does not make a great movie. This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of "Office Space". Do not allow yourself to become a victim of targeted marketing. Just say "Haiku tunnel".
