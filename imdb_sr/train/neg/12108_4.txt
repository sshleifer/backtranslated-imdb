I just had to write that liner, but it really is. I love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry I've seen in recent years. I have praise for all involved in most aspects, except for the most important scenarios. It's a bad story about a petty criminal. No fine acting or black-and-white film can compensate for a complete lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I hear that he will make another movie about the general. My advice is not to waste your time.
