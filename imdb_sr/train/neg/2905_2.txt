The expectations for me were too high when I went to watch this film, after all I thought Steve Carell could not have gone wrong with great movies like Anchorman, The 40 Iear-Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine. Boy, I was wrong. I begin with what's right with this film: at certain moments, Steve Carelle is allowed to be Steve Carell. There are a few moments in the movie that made me laugh, and it's almost entirely due to the given space for swing to do my thing. He is undoubtedly a talented individual, and the damage is that he signed for what turned out to be, in my opinion, a total wreck in the train. What has become terribly wrong. The film starts with Dan Burns, a widower with three girls who is considered for a columnist for counseling at the national level. Preparing your girlfriend for a family gathering, where his extended relatives gather for some time. The family is at the top of the list of things that make this horrible movie. No family is behaving like this. Almost as if they were transferred from Pleasantville or left Beaver. They are the caricature of what we think is the family when we are 7. It reaches a point where it becomes unpleasant and simply frustrating. Touching football, cross-country competition, family bowling, and talent performances are NOT HOW HAPPY PEOPLE HAVE. She's almost sick. Another big mistake is the woman Carell should fall for. Observing in the first scene with Steve Carrell, you look at the victim of a stroke trying to be rehabilitated. What I think should be unique and originally in this woman comes as slightly retarded. So I think this film is taking place on another planet. I left the theater wondering what I just saw. After further thinking, I do not think there was much.
