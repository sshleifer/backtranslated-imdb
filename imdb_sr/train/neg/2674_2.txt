Someone had a great idea: let Misti Mundae do his, R-rated version of Lara Croft - releasing two pistols not only in scarce clothes, but also in toples. That was really a great idea. The problem is that people who have had it can not come up with any kind of scenario or budget to support it. So, we get a "movie" that barely reaches the average length by repeatedly reproducing many of its parts (often in a slow motion), and is obviously shot entirely in the garage. The complaint of Misti Mundae is still obvious: she is incredibly cute and has the natural beauty of a girlfriend. However, her two female stars here, with whom she shares a long lesbian scene, are not even close to her league. If "Mummi Raider" is presented as an Ioutube video, I would rate it more, but as a "movie" for DVD consumption can not get more than 1/2 * of 4.
