This film does not promote children to be more beautiful and have better attitudes, as it should be a family film, and this would not be considered a family anyway because there are some things that children should not see. It's not the best ABC Famili movie if you ask me. If there were less sexual topics in the movie, it might be better. Hollywood does nothing to make the film better by adding sexual situations. There really is no reason for them. At least this is a TV movie. I would not like to spend my money on this rubbish by renting. If you have other things than watching this movie, continue with them.
