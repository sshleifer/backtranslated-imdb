This film is so bad that you almost feel polluted. In fact, there is a strong sense of relief when it is over, a relief that you can now return to the tape in the revamp, and RUSH will return this to the video rental store before it contaminates the rest of your video collection. I was joking when we rented it to look like a movie in which Willyam Hurt will "make a phone call" to his performance. I thought it would not work hard. But, behold, in a number of scenes in this movie, Bill Hurt is actually ON THE PHONE! Our realization of this irony was the only satisfaction we took from this confusing confusion. Cinematography and editing are blurred and confused, the story is chaotic, and the soundtrack is barely audible. There is a very small similarity to "Falling", but this film had a boldly disturbing story, great writing and acting, and appealing music. "Contaminated man" is just a broken old European tourist trap, and watching is driving a strange path in an unknown country in which you do not speak the tongue in an incessant rain immediately after dark while the windshield holds fog. Do you have a picture? Do not do this.
