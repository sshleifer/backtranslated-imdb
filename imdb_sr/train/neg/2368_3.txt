All right, this is stupid, they say they do not make another movie from the nightmare, that this is "the last one" ... And what are they doing? They continue to make another, not the next (part7) BAD, but why they play us. In any case, this film did not make any sense - what ever happened, it was extremely boring, the characters were very dimensional, Freddie was another joker, which is very stupid for such a good series. worse than Part 2 and 5. I did not get a movie, his stupid story in the 3rd, meaningless! I hated this movie so much that I still remember all the parts I did not like that was basically the whole movie. This is so different from the previous ones, trying, and trying, but he tried the hardest, and got it back on the face. Again there were any scenes of death, although they were different, they had great time. How did they go this far? Did they not see that they made the biggest mistakes in parts 2 and 5, and yet did they do it? /> I gave a nightmare on the Sixth (6) 3 out of 10. <BR> <BR> GOOD MEAT FILM: He had a potential with complication. Bad point of the movie: Terrible acting / absence of death / Too hilarious to be classified as horror / very confusing.
