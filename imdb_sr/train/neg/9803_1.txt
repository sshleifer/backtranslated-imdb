Pover Rangers is definitely the worst television show and completely funny plastic toy line in US history. There is absolutely nothing fun about this completely horrible TV show. This is simply the worst broadcast ever made, with horrible actors, dressing in more colored sweaters of spandex that seem completely funny. The owners of this show should be ashamed, because there is no point in this nonsense. Today's children should try to watch better shows such as movie stories about toys instead of this garbage.
