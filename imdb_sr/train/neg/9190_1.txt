This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. I've seen some pretty horrible movies in my time, but they're taking a cake, no, wait, I mean the whole damn baker. It's so bad to believe that the word that describes the way you feel after seeing this crime has not yet been created. Please, just do yourself a favor, if you ever need to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that boring purple dinosaur Barney, then multiply this thirty times and you will still get only a small part of the horror that you could buy for. In short, I suppose you can actually call it a horror movie, but only if you're willing to be meaningless about the worst behavior and the utterly meaningless story. Real Rating, -10 Odd
