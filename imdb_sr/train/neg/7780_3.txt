I could barely hold myself to shrug my head or just turn off this shit, but I decided to throw it out of my head just because something might happen. This is the work of the writer / producer / director / special fk, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make a statement about environmental damage when making a monster film. He wanted it anyway. What turned out to be a lot of acting, either a little hammy or just earthly and without much credit, and scenes that appear to be repetitive as the ATTAKS monster in the rivers (oh, and what a luck, the woman just happens to be naked in it. even though there has already been a TEMPLE!) This is just a pointless thing, but I suppose it's not too harmful; It is not at all disgusting and once or twice we get a semi-interesting look at the Brazilian "culture" (which is the father walking with the city with his herd or other parts of the illusion "hey, this is NOT America!"). But whatever the director may have hoped to play in throwing Mitchum or Carradine, this, at best, collapsed and, in the worst, painful banal and stupid dialogue. It does not help if we finally get a good look at the monster and there is a "action", and it is stupidly set up with just a humorous appeal. I would usually be sorry for the director who had a lot of trouble completing a certain picture - in this case, it should have been a large part of the mid-1970s - but with Monster or Monster or whatever it is called ... nah. > If you accidentally get a double feature of Elvira DVD (poor print quality with poor quality) with Blue Sunshine, be sure to skip this. Unless, of course, you are not Elvira dead and you can not help yourself to hear her sweet comment; Personally, I prefer Joel or Mike Nelson with robots from the Mystery Science Theater on this baked turkey.
