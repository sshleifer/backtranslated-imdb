This is not a good movie. Too intimidated in the parts and the story was below the pair. 3D was fine, but not great. I almost fell asleep in this movie. The story is about 3 young frogs who want to have an adventure and follow it. The guys are missing, I really do not care about these characters and I feel that there is nothing to get an adult interested in. Picard this is not. I would like to see more special 3D effects. I also want to see more flair than flying mom constantly: "The Lord of the Flies."
