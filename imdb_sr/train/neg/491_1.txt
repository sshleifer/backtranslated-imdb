As others have noticed, this film is criminally inaccurate in the depiction of the artist's life, and I was very angry and offended ... by transforming her rape into a tragic love affair, the implication that her rapist was responsible for 'awakening her talent' with her complete By neglecting her work, in the way she turned her into a sex object, on and on, you get an idea. Also, I find it worrying that people who are not familiar with Gentileschi see this film and go with such an impression about it.
