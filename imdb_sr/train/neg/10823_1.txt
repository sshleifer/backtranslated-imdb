I do not like to use the word "horrible" to describe any work in a movie that is spent a lot of time, effort, talent and money in its creation, but Zefferelli's attempt to adapt the novel "Jane Eire" to Charlotte Bronte is a total waste of time. The scenario lacks the fineness and power, everything is explained to the viewer in uncertain terms, leaving little imagination. The main actors are sadly wrong, obviously engaged for the names of the stars, and the musical result is dripping and dull. Charlotte Gainsbourg and Villiam Hurt do not have any chemistry at all. She is like a wet noodle, worse than Joan Fontaine, who at least was capable of little emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion. And Villiam Hurt plays the entire movie on one ton and that tone is flat and devoid of energy. Of course, fuzzy and rude scripts do not help any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any breath of life to this movie. to sweeten the scenes in which she would be best left out. There is no mystery around the story of Rochester's first wife. The role of the future woman Elle MacPhearson as a Barbie doll is an empty code. Fiona Shav, a very great actress, is completely lost as Jane's aunt, Ms. Reed. She'd be better off than Mrs. Fairfax. Only Amanda Root, like Jane's beloved teacher, appeals to every authentic sympathy or conviction. I saw this version of 'Jane Eire' after watching Robert Young for British television, shot in 1997, starring Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. No comparison. Young's vital, romantic, and deeply moving version is like an explosive new one compared to Zefferelli's wet scurvy. things on this website. I'm wondering how many people love Zefferelli's Iorkshire picture book. All I can say about this movie is that the house is beautiful and that the cinema is vividly colored, except that it is a complete nonsense.
