This is not a mistake by Michael Madsen, he was barely in it. This film was terrible. If you want to laugh and get bored, watch this movie. The words can not describe how idiotic it is. Sorry, Michael. The camera was dark. All other actors are unknown. When you watch it, it looks like soft pornography, but without nudity or heated scenes. This movie had a sexual appeal, because it's an underground S & M killer. The acting was bad, except for the parts of Michael Madsen. He looked as if he wanted to laugh. I hope he's well paid for this bad movie. It's something I would not be proud of. It's not even the B cable for cable, it's more like F and it should never be displayed.
