This is mostly the first Jason Scott Lee film I've ever seen. I speak quite a lot, because I also saw a soldier, in which he plays a bad guy ... but from what I've heard, this is not considered Jason Scott Lee's film. That, however, is. And if it's any indication of the quality of such films, I will not see any of the others. Lee basically passes as a martial arts artist ... as a leader, he is terrible. Every few minutes of the film struggles with random characters without a name, probably because the script writer could not understand how to otherwise extend the film to the minimum time needed for the feature film. Zlikovac is the only character with even a hint of personality, and apart from the fact that he is credibly crazy, he hardly seems like a criminal. Most of the movies are essentially Lee to hunt a criminal through time ... or maybe the other way around. I can not say with certainty ... and I definitely would not be looking back again to make sure. The effects are not completely terrible ... but it's close. The title comes from a popular idea of ​​using a time machine to kill Hitler. In a way, the film also entices this interesting idea. The action is too complicated for its own good. Pacing is bad. I can not remember one positive thing for this movie ... I really can not. It's simply too formulated and meaningless. If I only had a machine in time, I could go back and stop this movie ever being made ... no, it does not matter. I just hope that several fragile minds are exposed to this as much as possible. Listen to negative reviewers. Avoid this party. I recommend this to Lee fans, and to no one else. If you are looking for a quality movie ... well, that's not it. That's for sure. 1/10
