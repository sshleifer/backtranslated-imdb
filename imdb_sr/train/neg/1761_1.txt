First, I realize that the "1" rating is reserved for the worst of the worst. This film gets it from me because, as one reviewer points out, it's not bad in a self-conscious, superior way that would allow him to have some comical or cult value. Simply miss your seal on each account. ** Contains possible spoilers ** The dialog is completely dishonest. Continuity is so thought of as painful. Daniel just ends the story of his lost love, and the last word dancers of flamenco begin. The fake shock of what it's called (see? I do not even remember the name of her character, let alone the name of an actress who is forgotten) when her husband (Baldwin) first says that her friend is bad. Cars and motorcycles did everything they needed. A vegetable car flew. Cars collide one to another. Motorcycles go down the stairs. People are almost affected, but unusual, no one is. Oh, so ... except for the guy who was stabbed several times, he obviously stumbled across the pavement with a knife wound, and the car that was approaching obviously did not notice it there. Hmmm. It becomes more and more amazing for me that such films can be made. There are so many pressures in the film industry to make money, you would think that someone in Hollywood thought that you should watch good movies. Now there is a new idea. My proposal: do not watch this movie. Do not rent DVD. Do not look at the cable. There are many other things that you can do and you will feel more satisfied.
