What a long, exhausted, senseless film. I am sure that this film is beautiful in terms of history, but as the party goes, it simply does not make a mark. Ralph Fiennes was in some fantastic films, an English patient, Schindler's list, but this was so relaxed. It seemed that it was not going anywhere, its character at the beginning was so shallow and tense, that it amazed me that his "sister" would ever be interested. Do not bother to rent this movie, but buy yourself a copy of an English patient.
