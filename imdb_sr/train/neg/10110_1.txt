This film was by far the worst movie I ever saw in my life. I'm not kidding. It was badly done and the actors could not act. It was the loss of my time and money. It looked like a movie that we were my friends and I could compose myself. The film's case is definitely disguised. Nothing in the movie looks like a zombie on the front of the case. It seems that the director or makeup just under some eyes put a black eye on the eye and called them zombies. Credits at the beginning of the film take almost 20 minutes of film. What credit viewing was the best part of the movie. It was a really horrible movie and I could not believe how difficult it was. The scenes jumped from one thing to another, and sometimes they were like "what's going on?" The sound was horrible, and the footage of the action seemed like a couple joked about making a fake battle scene. it's because it shows that it's truly terrible. I wish I'd seen him before I rented him.
