Interestingly, these are the eyes and mouth of Rene Russa - not Buddy Gorilla - who appear as the focus of "Buddy", the production of Jim Henson Pictures through Zoetrope Francis Ford Coppola. Somehow, the countless big plans of Russe's face slid into post-production phases, and it literally fills the screen so many times that the poor monkeys are upstaged. An inadvertently fun, true story adapted to the memoirs of Gertrude Trudy by Davies Lint about a rich doctoral woman who transforms her villa into a pet care and wildlife manager. The film goes beyond good intentions ... positively dripping with serious sincerity. The film never shines with the kind of "family film" magic it needed, and for too long, people and animals seem to be highly programmed (nothing is really felt here). About ten minutes, two chimps are messed up in Russ's kitchen and begin to throw a butter knife back and forth (missing the head of Alan Cumming a few inches); however, no eyebrows have been raised because everything is fun in one day. However, when the adult gorilla Buddi goes mad during a storm, the policemen are called - and everyone stares at Buddha through the window while he breaks the furniture in the living room. Furniture should be the least worry in this incredible failure. But at least we know that Rousseau was in good hands: whenever Caroline Thompson needs a good shot, she gives Rene another extreme close-up plan. I wonder what is the lipstick budget in this picture? ** from the ****
