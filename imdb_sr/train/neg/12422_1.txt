I rented this film to see what could be a bloody, non-stop action movie, and I got this overly sentimental and super low-cost action drama with a low budget that makes Kickboker look like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and how Lou saves Reba from the gook, he is shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever. Vietnamese scenes are filmed in the yard, I swear! Lou is now damaged by the brain and Reb and he lives together and own a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is convinced he is fighting in a cage for money, and Reb goes to murder to get him back. There are no good fighting scenes, the blows are two inches away from the person. Personality characters change in seconds. One type is bad and in the next scene it's good. The acting is terrible, and music is an overly sentimental song by Frank Stallone that will make you sick. I hated this movie.
