This film is a waste of time and money. For an hour and a half, I continued to wait for it to get better and it never was. It was slow motion, the action jumped around, it was not scary or interesting, and in fact there was never anything. Loans during the introduction were long and drawn, essentially similar to the rest of the film (long and drawn). Numerous parts of the shop did not make sense. Several times during the film, I thought that I might have "zoned" for the incompatibility of the plot, however, my companion had the same problem and assured me that I did not "make money" out of boredom, but it was really a movie. In fact, I have never published a film about a movie before and for years I've been actively looking for IMDb movies. The fact that I took the time to write something needs to talk about how bad this movie is and do not need to waste your time and money on it.
