Talk about your spending money ... I'm just wondering why Michael would be playing such a party in the movie. Michael is a great actor especially in a movie where a man dies of cancer. That was wonderful. while he's filmed for his son to see him when he grows up. Michael is such a talented actor ... so why did he do this? I watched him and thought he was really stupid ... I think at one point in their career they have fucking movies ... especially "The Skueeze" I did not realize it was at all, and I feel that his best performance in "Pacific Heights" " , his character really attacked me .. and I really enjoyed the "Multiplicity" ... ..and one was so hilarious !!! and was Perfect for the role of "Batman" .. and somehow I liked "Night Shift" and I I like "Johnny Dangerousli" too .. too bad some of them end up doing bad movies .. like this was ...
