What starts out as a pretty smart farce about a somewhat suspicious security company is almost instantly turning into an unintelligible and completely absurd mystery of murder. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci are trying to weaken this train, but some things are simply not humanly possible. What, for example, causes Gale suddenly to turn into a sweet mother's figure in a drunk in the home of Tommy's parents? Why would Heinrich, although he surely slept, want to destroy the job he dedicated his life to, looting and possibly killing his customers? Why does seemingly reasonable Tommy believe that Heinrich can be a killer (based almost exclusively on sleep), and even if it is convincing, why not go to the police? And why did not Gale activate the alarm when she returned home, especially after she had violated Hovie's exclusion? Of course, all these events are necessary for conspiracy (and I use the term very, very loose) to develop. And this could be forgiven if it resulted in even the smallest comedy. But all, from Hovie's description of his date of rape, to the misidentification of the coroner from Galea, to the final "joke" about Gale and Hugh who are still dead, is more and more pathetic and unhealthy than anything else. I checked the box indicating that my comments contained "spoilers", but there is nothing that I or anyone else could do to ruin this thing that already stinks into the sky.
