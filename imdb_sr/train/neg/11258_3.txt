I said this in other reviews, without a story, you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want, but no one will be damned. The director seems to have a great eye for the 30th art deco (which I love), and I think the idea of ​​using all digital wallpapers and such could indeed be a wave of the future in filmmaking. However, it's obvious that the director was so interested in the digital display of his film, he forgot to shoot many scenes that would immensely help this amazingly thin film. (SPOILER) For loud crying, they forgot to have a bad guy in this thing! OK, they have one, but he's been dead for 20 years until the moment the movie is played. Conran misses a sense when he has a bad guy. As for the action, let's see, Captain Ski (Lv) drops one robot, two or three wings with wings (before Dek (Ribisi) says he stops shooting them!), And a couple of robots. , but mostly spend his time looking for a flight and attracting others to fight for his battles. Paltrow like Polly or Peggy or Punk or anything that is completely lost in this movie (the reviewer who comments on her and the legal lack of chemistry is right) and I was a little bit troubled when I saw repeated footage at the top of her camera Showing Her ONLY TWO A BACKGROUND OF THE LEFT, both of which later late in the film, one unusual, one quite ridiculous, although I saw him from the age of 70. Nobody but Lewis and Paltrow has any significant time on the screen, and this is the real defect of the film. Audiences do not identify themselves with robots, they need a hero to get caught and visible, disgusting criminal who hates. Without it, plus a good appealing story, Montenegro will not help the world.
