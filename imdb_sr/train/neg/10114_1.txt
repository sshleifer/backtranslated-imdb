This is one of the worst movies ever. I love siren movies, but this is simply terrible. Where are the pictures in the movie that are on the box? I think that more money was spent on illustrations of a DVD box than on the entire movie. Why would a company issue a DVD that is so concealed? I feel like an idiot for renting this movie solely on the base. As much as I've been researching IMDb, I should have done a little research and make a list before visiting a local video rental store. I have no one to blame except myself. I want my money and time back. Do not watch this movie. Even if your curiosity motivates you, put the umbrella cocktail in your eyes instead. It will be much more pleasant. You are warned!
