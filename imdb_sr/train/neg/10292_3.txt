He has his credit; Morvern Callar is both merit and disappointment. It's so enigmatic, so original. Is this her way of dealing with the pain of a lost one that makes her so distant and unconnected? Or did she call her a revolutionary as a critic? I personally would call it dysfunctional. Morvern is completely separated. Delaying her boyfriend, without thinking about informing her family or the money she had given her for a proper funeral, she selfishly sped up on her way to Spain. It looks like it was so deprived of human barbaric greed. The only element that allows the audience to see the human side is her close friend with whom she goes on vacation. Though in the end her friend is thrown out and Morvern has nothing to do with humanity. Maybe she killed herself. Despite being able to make Spain look gloomy and gentle, such as the United Kingdom, the director's recordings were great, the lighting and colors made the film visually stunning. It's really a shame that the movie does not have anything to hold interest in it. It's a little more than 90 minutes, but it feels much longer. They help make Morvern look interesting to attract your attention, but do not do anything with her just to distance you from getting to a point where you do not care about characters or movies.
