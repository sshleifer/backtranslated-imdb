Well, since I see part 1 to 3, I can honestly say that they NEVER had to participate in part 4. I mean, parts 1 to 3 kept a strong vibration on the Damion plot, but without it in this case it's simply not the same. Of course, by the end of the third part I was a little tired of continuing the story, but it was a good ending at the end of the third. Again there was no reason for part 4. Even if it was possible they did a much better job than I had to sit down, lol. It's been an hour and my life, I'll never see it again.
