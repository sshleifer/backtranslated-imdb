I hate that this movie has absolutely no creative contribution. I know that they are going for realism, but to be honest, I just do not want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see everyday life, I will live. Tell me an interesting story and we'll talk. I can deal with low productive values, I'm hell for a low-value gum, but at least I work in some good ideas. The direction only goes to catching the camcorder and a little walk around, but it's obvious that I need to dig it because it makes things more realistic. Hitchcock said that drama was essentially life with exhausted boring parts. I can only conclude that this is not a drama, but a long blow. We see Rosetta going to some place, Rosetta doing the baking, Rosetta eating a waffle, Rosetta carrying bags away, Rosetta returning home, Rosetta walking somewhere ... she just is not fun. There is no deeper meaning. I'm so bored that I started looking for some thoughts about life in this movie, but it's just plain realism, the most priced quality in the business. I suppose I should love this, but come on, there's nothing there.
