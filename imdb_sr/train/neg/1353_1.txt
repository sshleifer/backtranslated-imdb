What is that? is a mish-porridge of bizarre recurring motives (snails, Shirlei Temple, swastikas, and openly racist music, among others) without any narration or development of plans or characters. The whole thing has impressed me as a self-conscious "freak", and I'm not just thinking of unusual decisions about throwing. He has a feeling of a bad trip, far above the level of drug use that can be attributed to Hunter S. Thompson or Villiamu S. Burroughs. The only film I can compare to is Eraserhead (my second least favorite movie of all time), which was deliberately much more depressing, but I still found out what it is? completely wasting my time. One thing is to suck me into the internal functioning of another's mind - even someone else's chemically changed consciousness - but quite another that I simply throw strange visual effects on me just because of strangeness.
