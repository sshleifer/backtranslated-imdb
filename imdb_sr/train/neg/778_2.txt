What has Ireland ever done to film distributors to try to present the country in such a hateful way? This film begins as an example for film students in Irish cinema clichés: stiff priests, spit before handling, city cattle market, cycling through rural meadows to the background of folk music. Soon, however, it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the Big Dad of Irish Clichés - religious conflicts. This refers to a Protestant woman who wants to decide where her Catholic child was educated, which would seem to be reasonably desirable, but not to the villagers with the 50th county with whom she must live. Instead of sending them to a Catholic school, she decides to go and go to Belfast, then to Scotland, where a few more clichés are recruited. While she is there, her father (who looks as spooky as George Lucas) and the family are returning home to the boycott, which seems very nasty. I will not give up, not because I think people should look at this movie, but because it's not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is the central character: we should sympathize with her, but in the end, we urge her to get her life. Villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be resisted, but the traumatization of your children seems to be an inappropriate way to do it. In addition, it assumes a burden that reluctantly starts when it attempts to draw analogy to the current peace process in Northern Ireland: its lawyer says her "must set preconditions" for her return. The film is allegedly based on a true story, but these are topics that dealt with a lot more imaginatively, and with less resort to cluttered clichés, in the past.
