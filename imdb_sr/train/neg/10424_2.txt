I need to love this movie. The acting is very good and Barbara Stanvick is great, but the film always seemed very banal. The film makes working-class people low and cheap. The fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that her daughter does not rise above her has always made me somewhat uncomfortable. Barbara Stanvick, as a mother, adores her daughter, but her daughter renounces her mothers who love to find happiness with her well-deserved family of fathers. I wonder how many others who have seen this movie feel this way about it. Again, the acting was very good and worth watching. I do not like the story. only personal preferences
