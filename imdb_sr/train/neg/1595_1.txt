The movie seemed to be appealing for the new Pokemon Celebi type. But the plot, of course, was out and had no interest in other films. It was a waste of money and time. The same banal humor and clich√© bad guys. The film was not helpful if you wanted to make Pokemon known. The film should not be better connected with anime such as Dragonballz, Digimon or Iu-Gi-Oh. The drawing and settings are not raised to the original anime level. It's a shame even to talk about this movie. I bet Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the result of the film and give up Pokemon. Digimon is more anime and does not fall close to Pokemon. The second film comes out at the end of 2002.
