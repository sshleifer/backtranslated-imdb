Watching "Speak Easily" is painful for Buster Keaton fans. Seeing such a phenomenal writer, actor, comic book, director and stuntman who is subjected to this humiliating spectacle is like seeing a Picasso used as a droplet cloth, or perhaps more like seeing the best Camembert adorned with whey crude and refined in Cheez -Bhiz. Keaton is poorly portrayed as Professor Post, whose exaggerated vocabulary is the only thing that prevents him from saying, "Tell me about the rabbits, George." (Post would say something like, "Kindly inform me of the status of small mammals in the family of Leporidae of the Order of Lagomorph, kind gentleman, whom I believe primarily addresses the" George "epithet.) When Keaton created His Characters, they can be situately unconscious, but they were not stupid, they were quick studies and became the masters of their worlds, not with Post, who never stops stumbling and murmurs and who has no control over his fate than the one who had the Titanic.And while Keaton's original characters they had charming naivety and n Vincity, Post encounters such deep sexual retardation that, if he ever becomes physically excited, he puts a bag on the ice and sought medical assistance. There are a few small moments, such as Keaton's attempts to free the Theme Todd vampire or his suggestion of suitable clothing For Greek dance, but it's not worth enduring the whole If you want to watch them. If you are a fan of bad movies, get drunk and watch "Speak Easy" with friends, and la "Misteri Science Theater 3000". But in addition, hold on to silent words. Let them be 100% of what Buster Keaton is remembering.
