I just hope that no classicist / ancient historian saw Cleopatra, or, if so, that they understood it as a laugh. The film is terribly inaccurate, even more ridiculous than the "Gladiator" (at least it's a well-written script whose historical errors are articulated and well-suited to the story). The most prominent is Octavius, Caesar's heir, in the Senate before the assassination of Caesar: at the age of 19! In addition, acting is central. Timothy Dalton has more than James Bond's insinuation in him when he says: "Caesar, Julius Caesar." Billy Zane is funny, Marc Antoni. And Leonor Varela is trying to be a seductor Pharaoh (who in real life was not at all handsome), but turns out to be incredible. is not true!
