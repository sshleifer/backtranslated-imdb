The film, written and directed by Neil Ioung, "Greendale" is just over 87 minutes of music video set for docile or similar works by songwriters. Instead of dialogue, the film rely exclusively on Young's verses, which are very filled with sociopolitical comments, to tell the "story" while the actors act on the scene. in the picture, the effect is equivalent to Ioung who raises some of his home movies and publishes them for public consumption. Although allegedly there is a "story" that goes through the film, we really have no idea what is happening due to the largely unexpected appearance of the film, the lack of dialogue and the amateur incompetence of acting. All we get in eighty-seven minutes is a bunch of outdated hippies that quietly walk through a coherent narrative while the Young Singles songs endlessly play on a soundtrack. The whole thing turns into a strenuous exercise in self-reliance. "Greendale" gives a Hollywood movie with a bad budget that makes a bad name.
