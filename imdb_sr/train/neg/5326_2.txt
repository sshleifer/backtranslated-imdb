"Smithereens" is a kind of worthless film that only hangs among cable channels that occupy space as a cheesy novel in a public library. A worthless little thing and the first effort for Seidelman's central director, the film is full of bad acting, bad sound, poor camera performance and poor quality in all aspects of the film. Many better movies never come to the market and why jank flicks like this work and never seem to leave one of the greatest life mysteries. (D-)
