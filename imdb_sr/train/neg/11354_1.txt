Yeah, I also suffered hundreds of children's movies in the past, I think it's one of the worst I've ever seen. 1) I return to this time of the day and I have to explain to my children that Russia is not a "bad guy". Also, scoffing on Russian names such as "Poopchev" is inappropriate. 2) The birthday present of the grandfather of the fly contained a quasi-sexist joke in which he implied that men drink beer and women talk on the phone. Two other flies also unnecessarily use the word "shit" twice. 3) The whole film greatly degrades stereotypes and propaganda from 1950, which I thought we, as a nation, are proud of having risen above. All in all, it's just rough, poorly animated, worse written and it's not worth wasting time to review.
