Together you get 5 writers, each writing a different story with a different genre, and then you try to make one movie out of it. It's action, adventure, science fiction, western, mess. I'm sorry, but this movie absolutely stinks. 4.5 gives it a very high rating. That said, films like this make me think that I can write movies, and I can barely write.
