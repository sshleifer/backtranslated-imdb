Wow! I was shocked when I found out that it was a small world and that we were all interlinked. What a loss of 88 minutes. John Day described him better in one sentence. "No man is an island." The act was not bad. The children gave her everything they had, but sometimes the thread became so thin that I could not track it, and the only real "hero" in the movie ended up in prison after being tortured by a maid. I do not know. I just do not understand. Oh well.
