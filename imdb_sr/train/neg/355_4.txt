Just Cause is one of those movies that at first glance make you wonder why it was so difficult when it came out - nothing special, but sufficiently competent and with great support from Ed Harris. Then you hit the last third and everything starts getting duller until you get a killer with a flashlight attached to his forehead, which threatens to fill the wife of Sean Conneri (typically upbringing and infallible Kate Capshaw) and a small (very young Scarlet Johannsen) in the barista alligator goat. The kind of movie that is best seen on the plane, and even then only once.
