The disappointing end of the season that started so well ... Ecodus Part 2 and other noteworthy episodes were among the best on TV in any series, where it was pretty bad. I'm not sure if it was an episode that was disappointing, but the siren guitarist music that followed the final sequence was ridiculous and would be more at home in the original series. Almost as if corporate executives did not like the end of a low key and wanted it to jazz. They broke everything and spoiled everything. We hope this is not a trend for the future. However, at least we have seen the return of a particular person, even a bit bizarre and tritely done.
