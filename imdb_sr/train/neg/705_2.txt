There is so little fantastic Anne Rice's book that what makes no sense here. Some of the characters - intense and surprising characters - do not consent to the screen at all, and those who do this have turned down to the point that there is no reason for their existence. Where is the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where is the affair between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose ever appear, since her story has never been explained? Where is the rape and redemption of Marie, whose greatest attribute (and fall) is that it can pass for the white - and her marriage to Richard? Why is the film ending with Marcel's beating in the hands of his father? We do not know anything about Aglae except that she is a bitch who hates her husband; Why does not any background explain this hatred? In terms of performance, there is no one that is better than central, although this is probably due to a bad scenario. The best thing is that the actor plays Richard - but Richard is not on the screen enough to save the movie. The worst is Jasmine Gui like Dolly Rose, but again, it all comes down to the fact that the actress has nothing to do with what she has to do. All in all, this is just terrible. I thought it would have been impossible for any film that Anne Rice had turned into a book to be worse than EXIT-EDEN, but the HOLY WITCH would make this mess a critical hit. How is it that Rice is such a whore that will allow her best works to become such garbage on the screen?
