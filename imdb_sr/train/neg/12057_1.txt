Charles Bronson continued his decline in the 1980s with what could have been his worst film in a decade, if not ever. In it he plays a detective who goes in search of a pimp who has kidnapped an Asian girl and is currently selling to the biggest bidder. It's a shameful attempt at action and probably the most depressing film ever made. Many people believe that Death Vish Bronson's sequels are the worst movies. The Death Vish sequels were not great films, but in most cases they were competently made and watched. The Kinki, however, are completely dumbed by a thriller who is interrupted by malicious racism and child abuse. It is truly a possible movie and is getting worse by the fact that it is trying to preach the "law and justice" mentality, which is too exaggerated to really say something. Indeed, the film begins with a minor sex interrupted by Bronson, and then analli raped by a pedophile with a dildo. Theater in Chicago I watched this only as he breathed the discomfort of this scene, only to shudder with the clumsiness of the pimp who raped a girl in this movie. It makes no sense other than to exploit and actually the film is not well written enough to rise above the exploitation level and deliver something that would function. Bronson looks more into things, but it's obvious that it's too disgusting to be rescued. I want to emphasize that I think Charles Bronson is the greatest actor ever, but this effort is ultimately his worst. Action sequences are also bad. 1/2 * of 4- (Terrible)
