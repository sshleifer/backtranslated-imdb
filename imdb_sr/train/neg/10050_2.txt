Much disappointment with writer Hamm and director Dante. Their previous co-operation with Homecoming in the first season was distorted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways. This bad handling with an intriguing premise left me confused. The assumption of a "payoff" showing generic aliens that extracts something from the brain of infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfactory and did not explain anything. If the purpose of the story was an extraterrestrial "cleansing" of the planet of human infection, why did they do so in such a free, sadistic and misogynistic way? Why do not you simply release Stiven King's completely deadly "Stoy" virus instead of masculine flesh-eating men? I kept hoping that the episode would improve as I continued to watch, but it became even more pretentious and meaningless. The religious subtext was simply forced, but it was clear that Sam Hamm had to think that giving weight was deep. I like a lot of both Dante's and Ham's work, but this was simply invisible.
