1957 (yes, that is the exact date) J. Arthur Rank Productions with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hide Wit; That must be a smash of comedy, is not it? Oh, that's terrible. It's a movie that looks at people as shocked when they see a small alligator. Music is cast, in the most appropriate way, it is forgotten. Jeannie Carson is a lively dancer and competent singer. But what did she do in this movie? Diana Dors is also here, providing so bold recordings for use in reviews. Her acting level is not bad, but she's in the movie to give someone a call. Well, there must be something other than sighing during this film. The film is now sold to VHS by people on e-Bai. Respect the cost and waste of time. Comedy without laughter. Musical without an unforgettable song or dance.
