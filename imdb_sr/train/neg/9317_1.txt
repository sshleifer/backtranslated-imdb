I bought this from Blockbusters for 99p. The guy behind the counter said the reason was so cheap because the disc was scratched to sh * t, but did not mention that the reason was so cheap because the film was a bad effort that was tougher than Paris Hilton in a home video hotel room. Talking about home videos, from when it was fair play to let them go like movies - I mean, films that used to hire actors, technicians and scriptwriters, and so on - no more - just bring up your friends and ideas about the weekend temple , enrich the production with a £ 8 budget, and find someone to fall down the stairs with the Casio Keyboard (sound pad) - then slap it on the shelves, for some bad juice (me) to take home a lonely desperation. But here is the clincher - I accelerated most of this and threw it to the side, ready for the hammer ... until the next night, watching Darren Dai horor 'Hellbreed' (£ ​​1.99 to take home and stay safe from him). different Blockbuster). Now this film has made 'Grim Veekend' as an Ecorcist, so I returned the Grim Veekend back to compensate for some of the moments mentioned on the beautiful IMDb plates, which the viewers claimed to be hilarious. Of course, once I overwhelmed my suffering, pain and horror, realizing that Grim Veekend was the last piece on the toast, I could enjoy, enjoy and enjoy funny things. And there are many things. Check the boards. Then check the movement. Hell, maybe it's worth it. AVVVVV CRAP!
