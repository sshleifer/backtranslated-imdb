She says a girl named Susan Montford wrote and directed this "movie". No wonder she has no other credits for her name for writing or directing. She made a serious professional mistake in choosing this career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium. The fundamental thing is wrong in this movie, except for his funny story about a woman running away from four poor bully, there is an obvious and complete lack of LOGIC ** After leaving shopping center, approaching her four robbers as they surround him. Tell me, which woman would aggressively kill a potential attacker while being surrounded, and insult them verbally? I do not think after the attack has already begun, because of course it is quite normal for someone to return. But she pushed this guy up and raised him to a higher level. No woman would do that if she 1) does not have a weapon, 2) she is confident that she knows that the reserve is very close and that she is relatively safe from harm, or 3) that the attackers are so young and weak that it is certain that Pretty sure she can take them. None of this was applied in this situation, so it only acted as someone who asked to be raped or robbed. And by the way, when the guard approached, like USKORO when he came to the distance of watching Kim Basinger, why not immediately run to him for help, or scream? ** When it is removed after the guard is shot in the head, he is driven to an abandoned part of the city and is being demolished. She had a good three-minute lead to the pursuers, instead of simply running on foot in the diagonal direction behind the houses and climbing the fences and continuing, pulling out her Red Toolbok and starting to slip on the hood. I understand that she was trying to fix her car, but she was supposed to run away. (I did not even think it was a chronological summary of the movie, because I hate the people who do it in their reviews, but it happened that every major sequence of this movie has something so stupidly stupid that I have to comment on it . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why would she wear a loud, Red Toolbok? This key scene is so rich in the subtle tone of the complete failure of the dramatic effect I have to break When asked to open the box, she was at first opposed as if she was planning to somehow push one of the robbers away to open it out of anger after she had not opened it, in the same way that she someone in an action movie might have a device that the enemy requires of a person touching / pushing / opening / manipulating, and when that hero refuses to open it, the enemy catches the device, only in order for the device to automatically distribute chemicals or kill it in his face was unconscious, which was all the time a hero's plan a. This seems to be what they tried to do with Kim Basinger, as she dramatically opens a toolbox and quickly pulls out VRENCH and sends one of the bullys, and somehow gets away from him and three other bully. ** Throughout the rest of the movie, basically what you see is this suburban woman who sneaks around the woods while wearing Red Toolbok, taking various tools that are used as a weapon for KILL HER ATTACKERS. <br /> <** When she was running, how did she eventually return BACK where they were robbers? I think it was a scene in which this radio played loudly in honor of a dead guy. She kind of got into them when I thought she moved away from them. Finally, the whole of this premise is so weak because the whole reason why it was persecuted in the first place because it was from the robber prospects, she was the witness of the killings that they had committed against the security officer before, so they thought they had to kill. How funny. As one of the thugs said, they could just leave the city and return to the city from which they were riding, but no one except her saw them, and she probably did not get a registration plate. Even if these opportunities do not work for their benefit, how does he raise a hell and hunt someone to kill them by improving the chances of getting out of the original murder?
