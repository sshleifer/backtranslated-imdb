First of all, I am not a big fan of modern Turkish cinema, because it is the usual way to create success in the office kicking under the waist. This film is nothing more than an artistic masterpiece dealing with taboos, as indicated by the director and marketing advertisements. In my opinion, the sole purpose of this film is to make money by touching sensitive morale (in fact, this is generally considered taboo in the home country). However, the acting is almost perfect. In fact, most actors have a theater background and are trying to make up for what Altioklar did not have; talenat! All members of the acting team were perfectly integrated into their roles and well-qualified for the job, even those less experienced. (As Janset) At least, Altioklar deserves a little word of gratitude, just because he knows how to choose actors. In addition, he is just a media monkey who assumes that he is a director with artistic talent. Come on, art is not something that consists only of dealing with naked / semi-wollen women. And just because the media boast, no director turns out to be a turning point in the history of Turkish cinema. Just close your ears and something really artistic, I'm eagerly awaiting applause for your next work. I hope this time you will be able to achieve an artistic approach. In short; Professionals> Good acting, hot women (I'm just kidding!) :) Cons> Every single thing, except the acting team
