You know when you're on a bus and someone decides to tell you your life story, and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want is to slap a fool and go? I had a similar sensation as I watched this movie. Okay, I actually decided to go and see Aprile, and I knew about the taste of Nanni Moretti to make myself and the only star from Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this latest show from his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti all the shamans. Caro Diario was ridiculous, unusual, and at least several other characters managed to get the word on the edges. In April, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to dialogue so that everything you hear is an hour and a half is a tall sound that is about how his politics is best, or what is a strange piece of popular culture tickling his fan at the moment. He also finds time to remove movies he does not like, something I thought was reserved for losers like me. You must be in a position like his, you would think that he would try to make something about the film a little more intelligent than this. By making a real movie, perhaps with some ideas and a decent structure, or perhaps one that is not completely dominated by his boring voice. And when he started chatting with his newborn baby, I just wanted to go and be in the company of a normal, possibly not self-obsessed film director with a strange tendency for sticky music. The next time someone you do not know tries to tell you your life story, give me a slap. Each blow will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism.
