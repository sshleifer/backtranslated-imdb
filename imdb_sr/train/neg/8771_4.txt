Okay, I was bored and I decided to watch this movie. But I think that the main thing that brought this movie down is that it was recorded for an hour, then it's essentially the same hour repeated 4 times. It consists of: 1. Hull gathering and discussion of the plan of attack, 2. Flashbacks on male wives 3. Access of long-distance marsh soldiers 4. Men run uphill and shoot, usually the first to be hit in the head then three more men who are saved. 5. Defeat the enemy and invite the base to tell about success 6. Men return to their wife and sing songs of 10 minutes. It was a basic film, and that same sequence of events happened about 4 or 5 times. and every time she returns to women, she would show it to a man, then to his wife and to him. There were about 10 or more men who would have a flashback, so it took a lot of time. In addition, people could not kill their enemies except with bayonets or grenades. I loved music and there was a lot of action, although the action was repetitive. All in all, I probably would not see it again, but it was not too scary.
