In 1967, a certain director had no idea of ​​the galaxy, far or near. He was trying to complete the movie titled THKS, etc. This brief revised history of George. I'm sorry that she only has the kindness to defend her. This is just an advertising promo for directors, actors, and so on. al. It has a small intrinsic artistic value. It's a brochure. George's leader is very good, as is the Leia character, and Dars character. Everything else is a mere commercial slag. What a waste. Still, I suppose the job was done. The rest of the film is just hitting water to kill time. just a brochure.
