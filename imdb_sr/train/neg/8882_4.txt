Calling a film about a mutilated spirit that is refreshing beyond the grave and lifeless would be too ironic, but this is an undeniably incomprehensible combination of GASLIGHT (1939 and 1944) through LES DIABOLIKUES (1954); while still visible by itself, it is so clich√©ped to cause a sneer instead of intentional winters. However, due to the terrible difficulties in which the British film industry found itself in the late seventies, even a central scenario such as this one was able to attract the 10 names of the stars - Cliff Robertson (as a wretched husband), Jean Simmons (in the title role) Jenni Agutter (as a half-sister of Robertson's artist), Simon Vard (as a ridiculous driver), Ron Moody (as an unfortunate doctor), Michael Jaiston (as Robertson's business partner), Judi Geeson (as Simmons) best friend and Jaiston's wife) (as a housewife), David Tomlinson (as a notary who reads Simmons's will), and, surprisingly, Jack Varner (as a tomb sculptor) - although most of them actually have nothing, I'm sorry to say!
