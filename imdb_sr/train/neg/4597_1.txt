After I endured this inaccurate film, I admit that this is a more modern story about the story than the previous version. However, it is so inaccurate and done is so politically correct that it made me angry after watching. Dave Crockett was very badly presented by Billy Bob, whom I thought would probably be better played than Sam Houston, given the love of both men in speaking. I think that the self-absorbed Dennis Kuaid (the real Texan) would be the perfect Crockett and would definitely feed on his starving sense of self-esteem. As a Texan and a true believer in Texas thinking, I feel that Davey Crockett was an essentially Texan, even though he was not born here. Our unofficial motto is "Not a Bargain" if it's a fact "made for Crockett. And that last scene in Alam where Croquet last survived must be the biggest insult that Davey Crockett ever made. It's funny even to suggest that this great man and experienced fighter would allow himself to be alive. Three different witness reports killed him in the bodies of dozens or more dead Mexican soldiers after an undoubtedly fierce battle of hand in hand. Finally, the lame ends with a film that allegedly portrays the Battle of San Jacinto as a joint battle of 600 Texans against 700 Mexican soldiers, when in fact there were close to 1,500 well-trained Mexican lines. Every schoolboy in Texas who devotes attention to his first Texas history knows that the battle has surprised the Mexican army during the siege and that the Mexican army was so confused that it could not form rows and escaped because they were not trained to fight the border with the hand.
