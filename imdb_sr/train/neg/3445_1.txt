When young Kevin presents his dead uncle's boat, he invites five of his friends to a trip to the island of Catalina for the weekend. While traveling, drinking alcohol, having sex and playing, each of them tells his biggest fear. Later, Kevin drowned in the open sea, the engine stopped, and chased them and killed their biggest inner fear. Yesterday, my wife, son, daughter and three friends joined to watch "Haunted Boat" on DVD. With less than 30 minutes of running, the group gave up watching this messy and boring an amateur piece of shit, and we decided to watch another movie. Later, I decided to watch the rest of this movie so I could see how badly it would be, and it would be better for me to go to sleep.The confused story has horrible cinema and cameras, and an actor who probably learns to be actors and actresses, and finally this film seems to be a bad project a terrible and pretentious scenario shows a funny turning in the end, it's actually a complete mess that made me do not understand what it is about. Was the girl crazy and traveled alone in the boat, imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends? Is it true, is their friend again at the very end of her madness? My voice is one. Title (Brazil): "Viagem Para a Morte" ("The Way to Death")
