I'm totally disappointing why Godard is so seriously understood - and One Plus One is a great example of his incompetence both as filmmakers and as "intellectual" polemicists. It is hard to admit that Godard really believed that Marxist and Maoist bantam. Anyone who has half the brain could develop the bankruptcy of these 'isams' and how many people have destroyed it and continued to destroy it, even while Godard supported their films. As a director, ask yourself: would you have boring voices that would read boring political dialogues in your audience, and then, when you could not think of anything else, move another voice to the first voice, lose your listeners after 100 words Anyway? Great, Jean-Luc! Regarding Godard who insists on filming with Rolling Stones: of course it is; is not it? It was the only guarantee that such a blatant garbage could be seen in the first place: the genius of Stones was eclipsed without the talent and the ghastly political idiot who was released from the camera. The bookshop scene was not worthy even of the worst theater, and it was an insult to the intelligence of even young children who were accustomed to playing in it - as can be easily seen. Exposing by allowing friendly critics to say that all this foolish shit was a satire on mainstream filmmaking is nothing but a sure departure that offers to those who clearly see Godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience. Ironically, Godard's former great friend, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, made the best movie ever, and Godard made the worst with Le Mepris! By the way, Godard did not choose Stones' trail of sympathy with the devil. It was incidentally the track they were working on when the film began recording at the Barnes Olympic Games.
