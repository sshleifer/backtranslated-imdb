I'm afraid you will discover that the vast majority of people who rate this movie are very Christian. I'm not. If you are looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this film. If you're looking for a good general movie, I'm afraid you'll have to go somewhere else. I was angry at the characters and their illogical behavior. The premise of the film is that teaching has to be without learning that it is Jesus, which is the basis of morality, wrong. One scene shows the protagonist telling the boy that it is wrong to steal, and then the character continues to say that Jesus taught this. I think it is offensive: should we believe that you "do not steal" from Jesus? I suppose he wrote the Ten Commandments? And the theft was acceptable before that? I rented a movie from Netflika. I should have understood the nature of the movie from the commentary. Oh well.
