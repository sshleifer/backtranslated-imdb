I really did not like this movie ... mostly because of the main characters! They are immature, selfish and selfish people. They hurt EVERYly around them playing their stupid game. Visual effects were good, but what good are they if there are no characters you are linking or stories that are interesting. Should I be happy when these two psychopaths finally end their love for each other? After I watched this movie I thought "This should be the first hit from France?" ........ <br /> * *> <br /> As for the end: GOOD RIDDANCE! They both deserve each other! <br /> <br />
