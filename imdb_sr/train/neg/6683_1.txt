I'm glad people in the IMDb were able to decipher the genre of this film falling. I had the suspicion that this was an attempt to be a comedy, but since it seems to be a dark and solemn melodrama, I was not sure. For the comedy, even the smallest undertaking in the field of humor is incredibly deprived - all the way to the ridiculous "screw" of the ending, which confirms what the ultimate loss of time is actually the entire film. It's hard to describe how amateur THE HAZING is really. Has anyone involved in this movie ever had an idea of ​​what they should do? It's actually worth watching, so you can watch the screen in a dark disbelief how terrible it is.
