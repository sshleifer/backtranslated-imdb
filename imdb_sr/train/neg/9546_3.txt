If you thought the original of 83 was bad, try this modern masterpiece. How could it be worse that you ask? Well ... at least at the first you had Alli Sheedi jogging in a sports bra. In addition to updated graphics, modern themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a sexy new voice for Riplei, unfortunately, it's the same sad tired story. Anyone who saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line in the story is going. And for anyone who has not seen the first ... and feel happy that you only watched him once. Maybe in 23 years Hollivood will try again.
