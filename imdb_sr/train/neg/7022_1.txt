In over 70 years of watching movies, this must be one of the worst comedies ever made. Mel Brooks, Mike Meiers and several others have made very bad comedies, but this is the absolute bottom of the bora. . Diane Keaton, which I usually love, must have badly taken her paycheck. She desperately needs to re-learn her craft. Dak Shepard (I do not know who he is), needs a better director, to show him how to act. Liv Tyler is also not in his role. Mike White needs to find another person, he did the same person several times too. Ken Howard began several years ago as the first actor, was also not as good as it used to be. There is nothing decent I can say about this attempt to film comedy. Ratings: * (of 4) points 25 (of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
