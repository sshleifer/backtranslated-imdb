I do not understand positive comments about this movie. It's cheap and nasty at all levels and I can not understand how it's ever been made. Karicature characters abound - Sue's disorder, alcoholic, layman, Irish father is the best example. No character is sympathetic - except, briefly, for Sue's Asian boy, but even he turns out to be capable of domestic violence! As far as desperate they were unattractive, I have no idea why either Rita and / or Sue would leap onto an impeccable reptile like Bob - but since they do, why would I expect to worry about what will happen to them? Many reviews constantly talk about how "realistic" it is. If that's true, it's sad thinking about society, but there's no reason to put it on the movie. I did not really like the film at all.
