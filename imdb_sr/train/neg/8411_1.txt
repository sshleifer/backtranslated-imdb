We were expecting something great when we went to see this bomb. It's basically a Broadway movie. Music is terribly terrible. There is no unforgettable song in the movie - have you heard some hits from this movie? You will not, because there are none. Some of the music numbers go so long that I got up to go to the toilet and get a pop corn and it was still going when I came back! Good songs were good - but they were bad. The pace is slow, the horrible development of character. The management praised her for singing, but it sounded like she screamed every song - it was almost impossible to stand. This film NICHTA does not offer anyone except the Broadway enthusiasts. This is no doubt the most watched movie I've ever seen in my life. Complete waist of time and money. There is nothing unforgettable in this film except Danny Glover - who was not on the screen and whose character was not sufficiently developed. Get a video and agree - this movie was a expensive, processed, polished dog.
