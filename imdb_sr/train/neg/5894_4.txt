How long will the centuries pass until the Japanese-Asian horror films leave the long-suffering spiritual woman? However, they managed to rip "Ringu" a million times, and often worked well - which only shows that originality is not so demanding in the horror genre (or I'm very uncritical and easy to pray?). However, this time I felt a little restless, a bit boring. It's not a bad movie, but it's at least half an hour longer than it should be, with an absurd length of 110 minutes. Compared to many other Japanese horror films, OMC lacks the atmosphere and excitement. Plus, the end is confusing: it makes no sense. As for the ringing tone: Miike could have thought of a melody more effective than a small thing that can be forgotten. Although he played dozens of times, I can not even remember it - it was so terrible. Speaking of Miike, for him, this is something that is a commercial venture, so if anyone thinks they could get the perversion of the "Beat K" or "Audition" type, they spend their time.
