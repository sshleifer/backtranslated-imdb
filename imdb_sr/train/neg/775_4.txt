John Candi. Should we say more? He is the main reason you should look at this movie. Most people do not realize that he was talented as an actor. The witness that he crossed the poor man into a poor jerk. Just a simple (subtle) change of face and we go. There are many great bits and lots of really stupid bits in this movie. The best moments for me are KUNG FU In the scene, as well as the great moment when John (in trance) goes on stage and talks about how much he likes his girlfriend - that's how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend. I'm sure reading this maybe you think this line sounded really rough. That's it, but it's also very funny, mostly because John Chandie is doing this part. The story is pretty silly, and Eugene Levi and Joe Flaherty (both SCTV alumni with Candi) are not enough to do the movie. Levi has his moments, he shoots a wedding in the end (I mean Rod Serling) and a great scene when talking with his mother over the phone. All in all, a good movie if you had a hard day and you have to put your brains to nonsense. I give this 4 out of 10.
