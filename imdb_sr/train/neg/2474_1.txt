While I was watching this movie, I thought, OK, at any moment it will be fine ... I made a mistake. The real best part of this movie was when it was over. Complete waste of 92 minutes. All seriousness alongside the best part was when Vendigo finally came in, and you actually could not see it so well. And the tail was very stupid. There were too many sections in the movie where you thought something would happen, but that was descent. The worst thing is that there was more talk about Vendigo, then there was Wendigo. In order for the creature to be so bad, you definitely would not be able to say it in this movie.
