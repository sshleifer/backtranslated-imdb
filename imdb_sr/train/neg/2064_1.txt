Oh God. While Chevi Chase and the band in the SNL are setting new highs with sketch shov format, it does not work at all levels. Fortunately, Chevi is not at all in this and can not be blamed for this ultimate move. It's serious, very bad. Although it was supposed to be a political commentary on the United States at the time of its publication (1974), it still remains neither funny nor acutely observed. The sketches are too long and every satirical influence they may have had lost because they all draw to the point of complete boredom. This is attributed to Chevi's film debut and I'm glad to say that everything he did after that was repaired. Avoid even if you are curious.
