The effect achieved in this story of a psychiatrist who interferes with the fraudsters is so pointed that I must assume that this was the desired intention. The sets are artificial and I never felt like watching a movie at some point. The actors seemed to read their lines only, and they did not respond to each other. Although the film has elements of early film noir (except in color), the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a parody of that genre. I did not like it, at least I expected an attractive story. I'm usually pretty slow on the story when it comes to stories with complications, but you could see what was coming here in the first fifteen minutes. By the time, "Gee, I forgot $ 80,000," I thought this was really funny. For a psychiatrist with a proven experience, depending on gambling, he does not believe in such stupid behavior. If at any stage she acted like a normal intelligent person, the whole story would be disintegrated. This wooden production left me cold.
