I watched this movie a long time ago (about 10 years ago) and then I liked it. I remembered that day and decided to look at him again. The second time was not pleasant. The acting is 'so, so', the action is illogical, unreasonable and predictable. Acting ... I'm sure those actresses have not played these characters. Action ... there's no way those women might get out of the first robbery much less than the other. (foreign note: Why TT did not realize that even if she had come with a pile of money for the day of the court, they asked where she got it and would not have a logical answer! Ding, Ding ... we have a thief!). Terribly stereotyped by black women to basically say that the only way black women can 'win the system' or get a huge amount of money to steal it rather than using their intelligence or other resources. He plays too much on b / c sympathies, everyone dies in the end (Jada bar), but it's not sad (you think they were so stupid, they deserved to die). You just do not care about character unless you are a shallow person. I can not believe this film is larger than number 5.
