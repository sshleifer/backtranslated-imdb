This movie makes no sense, there are holes for plots that are large enough to carry huge NIPD vehicles. The characters do not behave in any acceptable way. I'll put my comments on the chat forum, but save time and money, this is stupid. I can not stand when Hollivood spends millions of dollars on flash equipment and uses fan-mounting and cool music, and does not bother to have a complicated plot, even at the basics. But, it's nice to see Denzel V. which prevails over Man, who comes in 3 flavors, Jodi Foster, Mayor of Bloomberg and cap. Von Trapp. It's even a cute little kid with a video game that's good.
