I thought this was a very miserable, unimaginable version of the famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles and gave their characters some kind of personality; but the whole thing was forced and mechanical. The beginning could have been much more involved; maybe they start shooting, then they go back to repeat how they got there or things like that. I felt as though each scene was routinely predictable and marked, as a very bad TV soap. I really liked this movie and hoped for something much better. The only thing I can say in its favor is that she won the Mick Jagger version, but not much.
