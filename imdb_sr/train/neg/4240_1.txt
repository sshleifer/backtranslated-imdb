As we all know, Hollivood enjoys changing history for our enjoyment, and 44 minutes is one of those hollywood films. For example, bank robbers never returned to the bank when they started shooting at LAPD, but in the film we see they are coming back twice! Another example is the number of LAPD police officers killed at the end of the film, which is far from true! But, of course, Hollywood must have a good bloody ending so that they add a little more blood and intestines. Some events have been combined and many of the leading actors have played several different people, but that's what Hollywood always did, why complain? I suppose the only sad part is that I watched one-hour documentary about Hollywood shooting on North Hollywood that was far better than this!
