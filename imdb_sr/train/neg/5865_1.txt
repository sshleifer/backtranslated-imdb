I can not say bad enough about this train wreck. It's one of the few movies I've ever tried to get out of. To begin with, it was a bad premise, the first pregnant man, but then they tried to do it like a scoundrel. What did they bruise all those real pregnant men ??? This was the worst movie I ever saw. If he had enough votes, he would be at the bottom of the 100th IMDB. If it was possible to give her a zero, I would still feel that I gave him too much credit.
