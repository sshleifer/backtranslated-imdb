and his clerk. they just killed American Pie. The first three were absolutely hysterical, but these and others were terrible. I mean, the story is about two fraternal colleges that fight each other for their homes, I mean the talk of a weak conspiracy, the first three dealt with growing up, changing and marriage, which are all valuable points of development in human society. New Stifler is the biggest joke, I know it's a tough attempt to compare with Steven Stifler, but without a cigar. I'm giving this movie 3 because there are 2-3 funny pieces in the movie. The best character in this movie is, of course, Jim's Dad, I do not know why he keeps on continuing to work this badly developed films.
