Synopsis: When his wife, journalist, kidnapped and replaced with dual android, Eric Phillips secret agent finds and discovers an arms dealer plan to create an army of invincible androids to kill world leaders. /> I did not expect much when I first saw this sequel to Richard Pepin's low-budget sci-fi / action hybrid "Ciber Tracker". This film was nothing special, not to mention the obvious ripping of "Terminator" and "RoboCop". This sequel is the same as before, with the full sequence of action that opens the movie. There are a lot of explosions, heavy shootings and a huge number of bodies, as well as some martial arts movements allowed by the star of the film, Don "The Dragon" Vilson. The whole movie looks like a series of action scenes related to the minimal complication. On the acting front, Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a person's transplantation.
