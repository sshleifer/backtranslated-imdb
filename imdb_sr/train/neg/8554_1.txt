The film, in all likelihood, was made in 1930 and published in 1931. I suppose that speech images had great difficulty in switching from a quiet time. Still, this plot of Zane Gray seems to be very weak. Also, Garry Cooper probably just learned to act. The result is something that would not be acceptable today. For 1931, maybe. It is not acceptable in 2004. Some of the actors showed up well. Unfortunately, the Indians always get a short end in those early Westins. They lived on earth long before the white man came, but according to the distorted history, they had no right to defend themselves.
