It's incredible to see how Nikhil Advani manages to attract people to the theater until the day of his release. I mean ... look at the actors here, the promotion is wonderful, enough good songs and trailers are fine. Because of this, the house is full on the first day, but only when people go and watch the movie realize that there is no way for them to get their money back. The house is full of the first day, the film came out next week. This film, inspired by "Love Things" is what they say, he failed to deal with the entire cast. They tried to put big stars, but they ended up failing to even estimate the average effect of any. Stories are hollow and cheesy, so the audience can not be connected to any of them. This is a great disappointment for those who love the big stars or for him Nikhil Advani after the great success of 'Kal Ho Na Ho'.
