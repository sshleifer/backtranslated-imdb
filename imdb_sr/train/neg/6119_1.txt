A muscular monkey man in the jungle of Africa is hunting an opportunist team of expedition; the handsome daughter of the team leader first found him. The numerous version of Tarzan's story has a good production, but it is crippled by the weakest direction of the film I've ever seen. John Derek is deprived of inspiration beyond the raw slow-motion action footage and looks at Bo Derek's wife. There's so much talent behind the camera as Ed Vood. Trying to have sexuality in a language, Dereki lacks fine, quick timing and taste. They have the feeling of self-parody and the abandonment of the blade (they throw attention to the wind), but after a promising opening, everything goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (who may have had balls in his mouth all the time) plays a major role, but plays the third violin for the ego of John Derek and Bo Derek's sense of self-confidence. * from the ****
