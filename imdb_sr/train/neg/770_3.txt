Foreigner Jack (Matthev Lillard) arrives at the studio of antique maker Vincent D'Onofrio and tells his ambitious fugitive and poison specialist Jamie (Valeria Golino) that Jack's brother is. Jamie does not buy his story, dominates Jack and binds him in a chair. When Mak arrives, Jack proposes $ 100,000 for anyone to protect him in the negotiations of the antiquity of "Spanish judges" with a rich and dangerous gatherer. Mak calls his stupid acquaintance Pieca (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with her retarded girlfriend who believes she is from Mars to compile a backup team. However, Jack goes over the collectors, then intrigues Jack, Jamie and Piece. Low budget "Spanish judges" is a film with a reasonable scenario with a terrible conclusion that a good cast is lost. Valeria Golino is astoundingly beautiful, but together with good actor Vincent D'Onofri, they are not able to save a stupid story. Furthermore, the scenes that should be ridiculous, unfortunately, do not work, but they are actually funny and not funny. My voice is three. Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All for Money")
