Even if you subscribe to the free-trading policy of this movie, it's still the same tedious note, which is repeated and repeated. Clink clink clink. Even if you can accept a peroxidic hair preacher who advocates returning to the first principles, Reverend Billy is pretty hard to see as a serious figure. Reverend clown is a guy who wakes up every morning without any aspiration than to see his face on TV before he returns to bed that night. He has a nice wife, I have to admit, but it takes more tonnes than to save this gloomy confusion of the film. Endless driving by bus is the worst part - with progress shown - can you guess - the color that moves across the map. Avv, you guessed. Oh, it's good that it's short. Is that the only good thing I can say? Hmmmm. Yes, I'm scared.
