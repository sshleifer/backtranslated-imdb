The film was terrible. The theater was dead with silence, because everyone was confused about seeing such garbage there. I think someone gave Jet Li a lobotomy and forced him to carry out a script with a dialogue written by a five-year-old. Fighting skills are 'ok', but when placed next to the movies Jackie Chan and "The Matrix" you better see them.
