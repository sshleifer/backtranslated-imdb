This performance is terrible. How did George want the death of his mother? This performance is terrible. Parents are obviously terrible and children should be taken to the service for children. The daughter is a witch with a b, and the son is just a full brat. George is not funny, especially when he speaks his own loud and disgusting brand Spanglish. Ernie is a loser, but at least I smiled a few times, but mostly because of how poor he was. George's mother, Benny, in a terrible, overwhelming character. Of course, her husband left her, but how can anyone laugh at the way George treated her as a baby, that's beyond me. It's not even so big! I moved away from the characters because they were too terrible and I should write for hours and I, frankly, do not care enough. I just want to tell everyone who looks at this and wonder if they want to watch this show, that this show is an incredible excuse for the sitcom, and it's not worth your time. starts 2, because the woman is extremely attractive.
