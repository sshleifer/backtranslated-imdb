The second renaissance, the first part, will show how the machines first rebelled against people. Everything starts from one case, in which machines claim to have the right to life, while people say that the robot is something they own and that they can do whatever they want. > Though it is an interesting premise, the story becomes really silly from that moment with (violent!) Riots between robots and humanity. Somehow, it does not look right, as the other reviewer points out, it's all a little too clever. . Regarding the Second Part of the Renaissance, I would say it's too violent and too stupid. 4/10.
