First, I bought it in a videotape. Second: I looked at him. Third: It was boring. Fourth: It was not funny. Fifth: Most antiquities were poor. And the last, but not the least: It's not just a bad movie, it's a total fiasco. I am a great fan of Adam Sandler in spite of this disappointing and forgotten movie. I'm sorry it was his first film. Even if you are a big admirer of Adam Sandler, do not try to watch this movie. Instead, just take a video, board the yacht and throw it into the sea.
