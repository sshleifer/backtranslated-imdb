This film still hides me to the bones. This film was not just as bad as in a low-budget, bad behavior, etc. Although it was certainly all that. The problem with this movie is what it seemed to deliberately trying to annoy the viewer, and that with great success. What I want to know is if it should be a horror movie? I mean, this is definitely terrifying, but not in the way that horror films should be. I could see that the first segment is trying to be horror and failure, but what the hell is another segment? It's just boring. The third segment is like watching an art student film, which is incredibly enough that makes it the least painful segment. The crime is that this film is not lower at the bottom 100, so get your votes (1/10) in people !! I know that some people gave good reviews, but, well, they lie in a sadistic attempt to deceive you. Believe me, it's impossible to love this movie. The only benefit of this film is an incredible life-prolonging effect: it looks like you've been watching this movie for years after only the first half an hour.
