After spending just a few hours watching this and for 80% of that time in complete disbelief, I can give this garbage a reward for the Turkish years without any problems. To say that the plot was incredible is some great underestimation. To be honest, I lost my words to describe this ultimate move. Not only are the characters totally and completely without any sort of originality (this kind of thing is done a lot better in dozens of 'serial killers'), but the acting was terrible. For those who pay to see this, I hope you get your money back, for those who are paid for it, I hope you will return your money. Believe me, there are many new releases that are much, much better. Go see.
