"Sleepwalkers" is the first film Stephen King wrote the script. In view of this, and the excellent Santo & Johnny song they used as a theme of the film, they would expect strange and ultimately fulfilling the viewing experience. Unfortunately, this is not what you will get. The point is, they probably could have been a good movie. The beginning is intriguing, with its small, city-centered atmosphere. But something strange happens about 20 minutes in the movie. The film becomes ridiculous without obvious reason! From that moment on the entire atmosphere of the Sleepwalkers was ruined. after I put a pen in my cop's ear?!? But do not misunderstand me, humor does not have any quality. I just rented it again to see if I was wrong for the first time, given the originality of the action, but I was right. Man, what a waste. I can not believe they got the rights to the Santo & Johnny song. I gave this 2.
