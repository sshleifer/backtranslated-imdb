I remember when it was in cinemas, the reviews said it was terrible. Well, I did not think it was so bad. It was fun and there was a lot of humor about the families around the holiday. Ben Affleck is a rich man who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. He goes to visit the house where he grew up and arranges for a family loan for Christmas. I really liked the scene of a lawyer signing a contract. That was funny. So, he says a stupid family request and even writes scripts for reading. Of course, the family has a hot daughter for love interest. And he finds out that holidays are not so bad. Also, the entire work of doo-dah was funny, especially when they replaced the first with a black man, and the girls' parents did not say anything about it. And the parts in which doo-dah hit his "supermodel". FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was worth checking if you caught it on the cable.
