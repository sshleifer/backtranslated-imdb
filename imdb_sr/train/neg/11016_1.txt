Imagine the worst sketches of Saturdai Night Live and Mad TV in a 90-minute movie. Now, imagine that all humor in these bad sketches has been removed and replaced with glupost. Now imagine something 50 times worse. Understand? The vision you just had would look like the most fun thing ever. UCM is the only worst movie I've ever seen. There were some cheap laughs ... very few. But it was miserable. Even if the intention of the film was lame, she was too poor to be ridiculous. The only reason I'm not angry about losing time watching this is someone else I know. He spent his money. Vince's offer has not written or directed anything else and is not a surprise why.
