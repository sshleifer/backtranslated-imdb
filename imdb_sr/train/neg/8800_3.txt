The collection of deleted scenes and alternatives is downloaded, edited together with an additional voice to appear after the first event. A pretty good idea, but the deleted scans stay on the floor of the cutting room for a reason and this is additional evidence. Since it's not as funny as "Anchorman," and we really face it. THAT film is not exactly a comedy of gold, so you get a "movie" worse than one that is moderately funny. In my eyes, STILL puts one or two notches above "Kick and Screaming", or "Bevitched". Cross your fingers that "The Vedding Crashers" is back in the old school form (no intent to play) My Rating: D
