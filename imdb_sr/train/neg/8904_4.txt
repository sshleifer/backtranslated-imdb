I personally liked the "Prophecy" of 1995. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and although the film was not flawless, it was a creepy and very original movie, Horror / Fantasy, which he enjoyed immensely. This inferior extension of 1998 is still worth watching, but mostly thanks to Valken. Voken is one of the greatest actors, in my opinion, and he is again remarkable in the role of the archangel Gabriel, who plays for the second time here. Once again, the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to the ground. Gabriel returns to prevent the birth of a child, that is, the child of angel Daniael (Russel Wong) and human wife Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could once be a decisive factor in the heavenly war ... As I said above, Christopher Valken is once again great as Gabriel. In addition to Gabriel, "Prophecy II" unfortunately includes a bunch of terribly boring characters. The character Valerie was sufficiently boring, and Danaiel made me even more annoying. But the biggest pain in his ass was, however, the image of Asia (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who would not shut up. However, Valken's performance is not the only quality of the film. The whole film is quite dull and well-recorded in dark colors, which contributes much to the atmosphere. Gabriel's resurrection scene in the beginning is also quite impressive, and one of the best moments in any movie "Prophecy". "Prophecy II" is still the weakest of the three films "Prophecy" with Woken. Definitely Christopher Valken-shov, fun, but nothing more than that.
