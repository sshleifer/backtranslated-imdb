In 1692, Salem, a fake childish lie on the participation of slaves in sorceress, sent the entire community into a mess. The costume drama in which actresses Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurrai is not congested, although it is not a painstaking display of contagious hysteria. Working on three writers (Valter Ferris, Durvard Grimstead and Bradley King), the story elements are quite interesting (especially from Hollivood in 1937), but to anyone who has since read Arthur Miller's "The Crucible", who hacked the melodrama shown here will not be tolerated long. The biggest problem with the image can be in casting: Colbert and MacMurrai are unapproved couple of lovers hurt by witch hunts, MacMurrai is too contemporary in this area. * 1/2 of ****
