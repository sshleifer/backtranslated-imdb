I went to see him in the hope that some good old-fashioned Alice Entertainment. When I realized that I would not get it, I watched him for a pretty well made film (in terms of shooting, and that ... that was it). except that it has good movie quality, since I watched movies wholeheartedly, there was nothing good in that movie. He killed 42. Why did Tveedle Dee and Dum play Mudler and Scully? Serisouli, who can answer that question? Who can answer anything horrible about this film for me. I agree with the one who said that it was just one big long joke for the staff. It looked like it was. Poor Mr.Carroll. I'm sorry that someone did it in his wonderful stories.
