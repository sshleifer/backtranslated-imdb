Pretty good movie, but it's not a true story. Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a fake liar, murder and was never discovered as guilty. The State of New Jersey did not simply go for the third time because it's been 20 years. Carter won the 1976 offer: "Pass the lie test and go free". He did not take it. This film should never have been filmed, but money is being discussed. Many people unjustly spend their lives in prison and undoubtedly more black than white people. Why choose a false story? Jens
