This was a movie I could not wait for! So I finally got it and I was pretty disappointed. To begin with, the film so little talked about New York, just a bunch of confusing footage of buildings, streets, bridges and cafes. Really does not remain focused on New York's magic. The film is set within this movie. I know it's a remake, but it's not a French remake! In any case, here you will notice elements that remind you of French movies, such as long and messy scenes, with little or no talk and of course everyone loves the French style! The story follows many lives (too much for my taste) and they seem to be related in some way. I feel as if there were no devotion to the characters as it was on the stories. The film was too short to cover every destiny of each fate. So we can see about 30 people in about 5 minutes each. And you have your 120 minutes here! If you love active dialogue scenes and things this is not a movie for you! I give him 4 just because I love New York and I love casting!
