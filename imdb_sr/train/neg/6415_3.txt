This was by far the worst movie I ever saw in my life. She was slow, boring, not scary, not funny, not dramatic, not fun. Sarah Michelle Gellar was up to her old book of empty expressions of fear and shock. She could not sell her character or anyone else in the picture. For those who thought Grudge was "okay," then do not go see this unless you get the pleasure of losing your time and your life. By the way, I watched this movie for free, so I do not want it to be found as a rant of a guy who lost $ 8 on a terrible movie. He was free, he was still sucked, I hated him. Avoid.
