Due to the strike of the Writers' Union from 1988, they had to record this episode in 3 days. It's quite a lot of shit, which consists of re-cropping + glued clips from Season 2 and described by his writer Maurice Hurley as "terrible, just awesome." Why manufacturers could not just wait to record something decent who knows. I guess that due to the strike, the production was left without money and could only publish a flashback episode, or Roddenberry was too sick at that time to put a veto on this half-shot. This episode marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) in the series.
