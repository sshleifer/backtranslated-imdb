This British-Spanish co-production with the stars looks great, which you can see. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and everyone is terribly scratched, so bad it looks like the buildings are talking to one another. Few films suffer from pan and scanning, as it seems, director Robert Parrish was so in love with the widescreen process that he suddenly used both sides of the screen, neglecting the environment. Another user comments that at the beginning we see that all the inhabitants of the church are massacred; not in the copies I have. There are some sudden cuts of peasants shooting from rifles, a Mexican officer is killed, Shav and Landau glory, and that's it. We never find out why Shav has become a priest (if he is), we never reveal what is happening to Don Carlos (Savalas), although I doubt he was called by him in Kojak because his departure seems arbitrary. And there is a strange flashback sequence where Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) dances around in a half-cylinder and a bad suit in the tradition of an old English music hall until 1960. hit BATTLE OF NEV ORLEANS, and does not sang Johnny Horton here I've never heard lyrics before. On the plus side, the location is a great, immense old ruin with Escher's stairs that lead us nowhere, some fine landscape-chewing from Robert Shaw, and the good performances of Stevens, Landau, Lettier and Telli Savalas as Telli Savalas. I did not really like this movie, but I did not really see it. Then I will look for a widescreen version and make my decision.
