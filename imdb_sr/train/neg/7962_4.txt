The followers have a nasty habit of being disappointing, and the best I can give you is that it maintains that old tradition. These three stories are nothing better than anyone from the original Creepshop. Far from the triumph, the wooden idol is reviving to revenge the bandits who killed its owners. The second story is about a monster on a lake that looks like nothing more than a floating crowd, so you wonder how anyone could scare it. The third story involves Stephen King's driver as a truck driver, but in addition, it's a pretty unimaginable story of a victim of a road accident that comes back from the dead for a person who has broken it. Instead, look at the original Creepshop, or if you have already done so, please be happy with it.
