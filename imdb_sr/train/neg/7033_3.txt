Black Candles is a pretty mess of confusion by the same director who brought us "Vampires" and much later, "Rest in Pieces," among others. I just note the ones I've seen. In any case, we have a couple who lead love and then a voodoo doll is located somewhere near the needle, and then it pierces, and the man is overturned. I'm not sure whether it was good for any of them at that moment. Quickly forward to the place where the nurse of a man came to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will, or something in that sense, and of course all the others except her are in something that happens as worship of the devil. It's really hard to tell who is in the moments of the film and sometimes confuses it. In order to spice up, however, there is a simulated scene of bestiality (I hope it is simulated) with black goat, it will surely be the satisfaction of the audience. Ugh. Sometimes this is called "Rosemari's Babi", minus the baby, because a housewife always gives her a woman herbal tea, and the place stinks to any unpleasant Satanic plants that are these, as it always gets in mind. However, herbs are not the only thing that falls on this movie. It seems that the end is back in the beginning, and many viewers might wonder where they were in the middle part. It's not unacceptable, it's just not good, and I suppose it all depends on what you like to watch in movies, and there was not much that would do a lot for me. 3 of 10
