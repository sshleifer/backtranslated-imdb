The original movie, Man From Dreams River, is one of the best I've ever seen, almost perfect. A story of lady and rogue in two senses - a rich girl / a poor boy and an ability against a blood line. Continuing, however, is not only an impeccable attempt to exploit the good name of the originals, but also a funny, overwhelmed Disneied mess that is best summarized as "Rambo happiness of a black stallion". Without the Black Chalet Charm. A young hero returns from a three-year absence, and suddenly Superman is on a horse; in the original, good movie, he was real and convincing, but unfortunately he was reduced to the caricature below. I was barely disappointed in the film, and sometimes it made me very angry - they hardly missed the clich√©s. Nervous manipulation of the audience - do the heads of the study think that all you have to do with an audience that loves horses is to put nice horses in front of them in order to be happy? Disorder of the movie.
