Wow ... what can I say ... First IMDb says it was at the end of the 60's ... which means that Carlito would be very close to going to jail, he came out of 75 and said he was in jail for 5 years. They used a bunch of actors and a story that made no sense. Only one actor, Guzman, returns, and plays a completely different person. Why did he end up with him and this Puerto Rican fish? Vheres Gale? He said that he had been in love with her before. Vheres Kleinfeld? He said he knew him forever ... He would have thought he was in this. And if this makes sense, where are Roko and the black guy in the first one? All this was just stupid ... This is an insult to Pacino and the first movie.
