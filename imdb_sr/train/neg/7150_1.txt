After I looked at the review, I felt that this film would be a good advance in relation to that fast and furious series. So, I already expected that he would miss the story, but at least this time it will not be burdened with a bunch of helpless civilians with farts. Unfortunately, I made a mistake. If you can only imagine a fast and furious movie with a worse story than it is certainly this movie is for you. No, I would not take a baseball stick to the walnuts as others said). Not only did the story not exist, but the action was shit. I guess the director thought they could throw a bunch of females and exotic cars, then call them a movie. For example, there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nose button and his Lamborghini fly in the air and flies through the SLR's McLaren to win. And after Eddie Griffin entered a quarrel with one of his "girls" (Imus's comment would work in this case), the girl wants to retreat and get out of the PLANET and of course work in the middle of the dessert. After this beautiful scene I could no longer stand. So, I just saw half of this monstrosity. This is the first movie I've ever released. After that, I had to stop a drink from killing all of my corrupted brain cells. I gave him 1 because 0 is not an option. You better go to the local car show and stop on the road on the way home. I will keep all viewers in my prayers.
