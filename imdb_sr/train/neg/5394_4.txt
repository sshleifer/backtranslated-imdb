I am versed with Shakespeare's modern adaptations when the director can not decide whether to use the original or to update it. If it uses the original words in an updated setting, it is especially difficult if it is set in the 20th or 21st century, although it can function in the styles of the period, for example, It could work with the settings of the 30s, only that there was much less song and dance and much more than Shakespeare's text. Unfortunately, it simply ends up as quite trivial, although a very pleasant shov. Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree that he is too old to play one of the pupils, but more importantly, he is so experienced a shaky actor who, despite all his efforts to be just another student, his acting power is constantly present. Of course, the King was supposed to play - there is no problem for a mature student of the King surrounded by younger students. Instead, we had a pleasing but non-limiting actor for the King, that is, an unobtrusive so-called King without royal attributes. The amount of song and dance, which I found boring despite beautiful songs and pleasant dancing, unfortunately meant that the great Shakespearean dialogue had to drastically decrease. So it ends with trivial and gentle clothes, and it was very boring, including comical bandages, and I was glad when it was finished. Branagh did not do Shakespeare's justice in this production. However, Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, absolutely brilliant as an older couple.
