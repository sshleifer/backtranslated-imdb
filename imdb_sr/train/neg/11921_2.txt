I can summarize this film using 20 words or less. Too foreseeable for a story with the potential to be ridiculous, but instead falls on the face. You see, 19 words, however, I did not completely shuffle this movie with just one star, but I decided to raise it up to two stars because of the fact that Julie Boven was smoking hot and provided enough sweets for the eyes that would not tear me the DVD out of the device and blow up ga M80. My advice, take a $ 4.00 price you pay to watch this movie and just send it to me in advance thanks for saving time and frustration that you have to sit through this wreck of the train, or you might want to send me a replacement charge $ 50 that would accuse you of taking your twelve gags to use this piece of garbage as a skate practice.
