I'm by accident a director's nephew. It took me several years to get a copy of this film and I can confirm that this is really one of the worst movies of all time. My uncle no longer has a copy of it (I asked). I'm looking forward to giving him a copy. Currently, the average film rating is 1.9 / 10. As far as I can tell, it should put it sometime in the mid-30s in the IMDb "bottom 100", but with only 206 votes, more not set. It's sad that the movie does not even enjoy respecting the lower part of 100. In any case, this year I give family members a copy of a movie for holiday gifts. The best / worst gift ever?
