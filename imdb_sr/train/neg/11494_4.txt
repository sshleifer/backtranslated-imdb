Richard Dix is ​​a big, not quite a good industrialist, who almost got tired. If he takes a holiday that his doctors suggest to him, can he find happiness in the last months of his life? Well, he'll probably be better off if he ignores GLAS VHISTLER. This entry in the Villyamu Castle has some great moments (introduction and display of the life of Richard Dick through the news a la Citizen, Kane), and some intriguing draft in the final rolls. Dick's performance is generally good. But, unfortunately, just does not work well, because in the end it does not buy that characters will behave in the way they do it. Also, the film is moving from a dark (and fascinating beginning) to a nearly happy movie from the 1930s such as the middle (full of beautiful urban ethnicities that do not bother to be rich) and to return to a complex noir parcel for It takes 15 minutes or more. This is a decent movie - worth a look - but it took him a little more time to set up a couple of characters and a female trail capable of meeting the demands of her role.
