I sincerely want to return the last 30 minutes in my life. The only person who is capable of watching this movie is Helen Keller, and I myself constantly said that this has to be better. Then the zombies finally appeared and they showed the colors of the raccoon. They spoke like ordinary people. One was driving a car. Voodoo woman asked what one of the "zombies" wanted and "zombie" said (I want to dance) (It's That) It's released the movie and I can not anymore to stand. Can I sue for half an hour of my life ?????
