This sequel is a complete rewriting of the first movie. A totally meaningless movie. Basically, he just took every sessio of the first movie and they redesigned it in Omen IV, except with a female antichrist. It even ends in the same way as the first! Music is too busy and hinders, and because it's pretty much a copy of Omen I, it's extremely predictable. It's not a horrible movie, it's not terribly made, there are many bad movies there, it just did not make sense to make it. The 2006 reminder sign is much worse, even more meaningless than this, so I guess it has it. If you were pointing a pistol at your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 replay, I guess I would choose this.
