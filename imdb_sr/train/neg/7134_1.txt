So this has happened. Fast, expensive cars that only the top 1% ever drive. The girls who pose with them in magazines. Actors of the second order and without a name. Cheap promotional performances of people from niche culture. This is the garbage that Hollivood can offer. Do not get me wrong; I like a senseless hot chicken action as much as the next guy. But, please, will the collective Braintrust turn green, count to ten, breathe, have a hearty "Voooooosaaaaah," and then rewind twenty-five years and remember what made films pleasing sometime? Then actually make such films again? I do not have anything against poker, but the whole explosion of the pop culture she has enjoyed over the past five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother now think of their Maverick (not half will even get that reference). Some executive director said: "Hey, what kind of demographic situation do you want to deduct from $ 9.50?" "I know, sir. Market from 18-35." "Okay, let's give them poker, girls and fast cars." "Great idea, sir." The result? The movie I watched late at night on Spike's television, and more often than not, plays Dolph Lundgren. Now do not misunderstand me, I'm not a movie snob. Over-the-top artistic movements like an English patient do not float in my boat, but generic films that should not be made or on DVD also bother me. Only adolescent gears will have their engines in this way, and I assume that those who are at the higher end of their IC will see this for what is: waste.
