This is a movie that needed to live a lot. in the year of release, legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it the worst film of the year and that I did not hear anything but the bad things about her, especially the complication that was criticized for being too complicated. Frankly, the plot is something like a red haringa, and the film suffers even more when the word "plot" is used, because, as far as I can see, there is no complication as such. Something includes Russian gangsters, a character named Pete Thompson who is trying to get pregnant with his wife, Sarah, and an Irish boy Sean. How everyone fits into something called a "plot" I'm not sure. It's hard to explain the complications of Gui Ritchie's films, but if you're watching some of his films, I'm sure we can all agree that everyone has one, no matter how complicated they look at the first look. Likewise, James Bond film even though the complications are extended to the action scenes. You will have a serious problem to believe that RANCID ALUMINUM has any type of central plot that can be reasonably explained. If you look at the role list, enough warnings will be ringed on how the movie will be watching. Sadie Frost has appeared in some of Britain's worst films filmed in the last 15 years and does nothing to become inconsistent. Steven Berkoff plays a bad actor (and plays a character called Kant who summarizes the curiosity of this movie), while one of the supporting characters plays the TV host, probably because this group does not seem to be a serious actress. > The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it is completely forgotten. I saw this a few days ago and right after I watched that I would write a very long critical review warning people they gave up watching, but so far I have mostly forgotten why. But that does not change the fact that I remember that shit is meaningless
