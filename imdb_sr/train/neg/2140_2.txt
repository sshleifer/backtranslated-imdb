The mission of Assassin Hauser (John Cusack) is to strike a Middle East oil minister, whose name is Omar Sharif (Neikov), in the country of Turaqistan, governed by American interests. Hauser presents himself as a producer of the fair to allow him to reach Omar. Sometimes a satire can be so exaggerated that it becomes the most unpleasant. This is done too: government, politics, music, war, people that society did not accept at all, and did I mention "war". And that's what we have here - one boring movie that borders with a very bad nightmare. I'm still wondering why I continued with the DVD. Also, there are so many members of the Cusak family in the fact that John Cusak seems confused because the family is there, or is it just me? It used to be John Cusack movie, while a bit in the end, he was pretty good. Not here. Believe that John Cusack had a hand in writing and creating this mess. Do it from what you want. In the movie, is there a lot of events followed by constant fire, bombardment and shouting that you can not really focus on or is it the point? Probably. It takes too much time to hit, which is mostly forgotten for the last 15 minutes. In the meantime, we have a senseless joke among all actors. And the chemistry between John Cusack and Marise Tormay? I do not think so, but do you know: boy? Girl thing? and it took them some time to take. Yes, for what they were supposed to be, (unusual and bored) performances of Duff and Kingsley were good. But, when I saw Day Akiro's character, at the start of the show, sitting on the toilet at the dump, I knew that the rest of the show would go to the tank. I did not make a mistake. I'm sure some will sing praises for this effort, but if the rose is still a rose for any other name, then it's a mess. Now I remember why I continued with the DVD. I was hoping that the story would somehow equalize and save. Never. Violence: Yes. Gender: No Golotinja: No. Language: Yes.
