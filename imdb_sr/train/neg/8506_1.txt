This is perhaps the worst movie I ever had. Unbound would be a compliment. Even the end did not make sense, but there was a tremendous relief that was finally over. I watched her with some kind of fatalistic fascination to see if she could continue to get worse and that she was. By the end of this riot, I was sorry that any of the characters survived, and I did not feel too charity about the actors. Even the waiting on the abandoned railroad platform fights this mess. Obviously, I have not missed enough to fill in the ten prescribed rows so that, by risking redundancy, I will say again. This film is zero and it would be less if I had the word for an even lower rating. What do you say minus zero?
