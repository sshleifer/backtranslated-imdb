I love special effects and testify to new technologies that make science fiction real. The special effects of this film are very good. I've seen most of this movie, because it has been broadcasting on HBO for several months now. I have to admit that I may have missed several scenes, but I'm usually drawn into movies and I've seen some scenes more than once. But every time I see some of Hollywood's Man, I feel depressed, almost like "noir of the movie". I'm not sure why; Maybe it's that I do not want Kevin Bacon to be evil, and that's disappointment. But I think that the witness is only HOW an unbearable evil becomes. Nevertheless, I can recommend this film for excitement (although some parts move slowly), but I DO NOT recommend to young people under 14 (maybe 12 if they are mature).
