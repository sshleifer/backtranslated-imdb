Vov. This film bored my pants when I saw it. Bland, senseless and immovable. Obviously, Ash and co. Can I travel through time with the help of the "Ghost Forest" ("Princess Mononoke" a lot?) There they meet a Dorkie kid named Sam, and begins a "plot." Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) are high in nature, becoming a hippie and trying to free Celebia ("Spirit") from some freak. I do not know what was happening yet. Everything went through the blur. Ash's barely were in him, and all the fighting scenes were boring. After saving the day, Ash and his shameful friends must return to their time while watching Sam floating with Celebi (this scene) OO;) Then, after returning to their time, Ash reveals that his new friend is actually the grandfather of his rival. And I think that's it. Pretty retarded, right? If you love your children, you will not expose them to this. (1 of 10)
