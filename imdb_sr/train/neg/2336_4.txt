I've read some of the comments here on the IMDb and I thought I would give this movie a look. Dissapointed. On the positive side, the men's tracks are a good, but interesting photo, but in general this movie fails to convince. It seems to be full of its own self-relevance in an attempt to say something meaningful, but it's a brief and all-in-one picture of an unconvincing confusion. It is one of those films that are classified as a film noir that can be defined as follows: "Film noir is marked by the mood of pessimism, fatalism, threats and cynical characters ". So this is the story here: 3 losers encounter one another with their collective problems involving mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, indebtedness, etc. And together they agree to kidnap a child and outwit each other. It would have been a much better movie if the story was more limited to abduction instead of the defects of the character of the hijacker. I thought that the female leadership was far from its depth and came across as an amateur actress. While I had some good moments, I ended up feeling that I lost my time. 4/10.
