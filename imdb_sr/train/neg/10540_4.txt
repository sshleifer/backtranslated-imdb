Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a student of Satan / serial killer who owns "The First Power": even after being caught by Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and executed in a gas chamber, he is able to trigger the body's spirit into the body and continue to kill at will. With the help of an attractive psychic, Tess Seaton (Traci Griffith, half-sister Melanie G.) tries to stop Channing. This concept probably had some possibilities, I think, but in the end, "First Power" suffers from routine writing and filming. This is nothing we have not seen before, sometimes it works better. This movie is different from other supernatural horrible thrillers, and it's not really exciting and certainly not scary.Phillips is hard to sell as tough-like nails, a cynical police stereotype, and Griffith does not seem to be working hard, the best actor probably Kober who is trying to be extremely angry. Top The nac is pretty stupid and the end is very weak. It's not quite enough to rate as an average film of that kind, so: 4/10
