This is an incredible part of the storytelling. It's about an hour in the movie before we have a lot of ideas about what it should be; characters often murmur silently; It seems that actions often have nothing to do with; No one seems to be worried about who actually killed a girl; a couple of spooky kids swim in waters that look threatening, but nothing happens; Iraq strikes in the face of one of his friends for no reason ... that the sequel be as boring as the film itself. The only semi-entertaining element is landscape photography; but everyone could show the camera to the Australian wilderness and get unforgettable recordings. All in all - gloomy, unconnected, pretentious - and quite boring because of the loss of time for the viewer.
