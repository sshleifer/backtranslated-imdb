I do not hate anything more than self-congratulations. Kevin Smith deserves to show him his nail fingernails to inspire every white medium letter to make a film about why they can not lay it. I do not indulge in inexperience and low-budget productions, but when writing is so obvious and cloiing really burns potatoes. The money invested in this could have been a real fighter who actually has a chance like John Gulager. If you are looking at Project Greenlight, you will immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system. Everyone could take the camera and make a talkable picture that does not manage to say anything at all. When will we be saved from Smithonite and Vhedonettes of the world? Revolution can not come fast enough. Go watch the right effort for the first time by purchasing Desperado or by searching Friends Vith Benefits. Thank you and a good day.
