The story of incredible disinterest kills "The Psichic" over and over again. The characters and plot are completely uninteresting (such as Fulci's crazy camera, which in his films is usually a redeeming factor), and no understanding of uncertainty exists. It is elongated to an unbearable degree - to the end, you will not get excited, but you are affected by boredom (and, like me, maybe uncontrolled need to fall asleep). Performance Jennifer O'Neill deserves to be in a better movie. Watch Fully Up - there's just not much much going on in The Psichic. 3/10
