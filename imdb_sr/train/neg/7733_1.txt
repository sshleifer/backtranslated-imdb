What a shame! I checked this, hoping it would be James Garner's undiscovered gem and what a stink! The quality of production was good, but the plot was undoubtedly chrome and I can honestly say that I'm only a few hours older and much dumber now. The movie really did not have any qualities, and if things like this happen all the time, Hallmark will get a bad name. For those who insist on knowing what it is, this is nothing, and in this case it is not a good thing. We are subject to seeing an old woman who is one of the dumbest beings that ever walks in the earth, which is by chance in a marriage with a real soul who is probably the only living person to suffer. She pulls him through one mess after another, brings him into an unpleasant situation for the other, and is proud of himself all the time. Then the movie ends. What a relief! It's not worth the time you need to watch, so do the service and skip this, you'll be glad that you did this to know how badly this is.
