This film features, among others, "SlapChop" Vince Ponudu (who also wrote, edited and directed) and Joei Buttafuoco - not just the name that screams "quality." And with such exciting sketches as "Supermodels that take the landfill" (that's exactly what sounds like), a guy who robbed a sperm bank ("Rhimer"), a necrophilia with a rotting body, a fetus on a black market (with the type he collects should to be from a jar), lots and lots of gay jokes, skit on a gigantic phallus that is a superhero and a forced abortion. The skates are painstakingly infertile (such as "Batman and Rimer"), acting is not good enough to be considered amateur and the film is rough only to be rough ... and stupid. I sincerely believe that a group of eight years could make a funnier movie with the same budget. Obviously this film resulted in a lawsuit "Slap Shot" by Vince against the Scenologist. Frankly, I would not know for whom to go in this case !!! Apparently he claimed that scythologists in some way destroyed his reputation and sank this film. Regardless of the fact that the film is repulsive from the beginning to the end and 99% inconvenient (in contrast, ebola is smiling) ... and these are the nicest things I can say about the movie. So, it's Bobbi Lee (from "Mad TV") who wears diaper and participates in a stupid fake porn movie. It was incredible that his career could overcome this.
