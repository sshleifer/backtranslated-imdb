Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors! I'm trying to see all his work. She is known for keeping her films alone with her presence. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This film suffers from a low budget and its production value is disturbing. Please ... for love for Christopher ... avoid this movie!
