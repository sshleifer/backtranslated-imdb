The Three Stooges in feature-length comedy-music? Maybe "Rockin" in Rockies should combine Stooges comedy with a western musical, in matinee; If so, it was a pleasant way to break Saturday afternoon. Jai Kirbi (like Rusty) is a handsome young hero; and, Marie Beth Hughes (as Blonde June) and Gladys Blake (like Beti's brunette) are pretty women. Hoosier Hotshots are a coherent group; their songs are quite melodious; However, these are forties, not in the 1950s, so the film is not a "stone". There are a few laughs; but Stooges's brand of humor is more muffled than usual. The speaking horse is also underused. **** ************************************** ************************************************** ***********
