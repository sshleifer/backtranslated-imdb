This terribly bad piece of garbage can be suddenly racist, sexist and homophobic, as it turns out to be terribly chic and sophisticated. The terrible performances, the clich√© scenario and the boring direction make this film one to keep away from it. The two scenes were particularly offensive - those in which Schaech rubbed the tongue after kissing another man (whether that was really the case), and the scene in which Eastwood kissed Schaech's best friend, pretending to be a Russian. After leaving the room, she exclaims "f ** king of aliens"! So much so that she is a cultural artist who dreams of living in Paris !? Jonathon Schaech can be a nice actor on the screen and is amazingly handsome. Too bad he did not learn more from working with top gay director Gregg Araki in an earlier film, and tried to save this film from falling into a series of gay stereotypes and homophobia mud.
