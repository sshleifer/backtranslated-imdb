Straight, soulless computer images in less captivating backgrounds animate a horrible predictable story in this movie. Absolutely nothing surprises you, you can even say when the vocals of Brian Adams will appear, which are always at the wrong time. The main character, The Spirit of Horses, gets an unpleasant voice when he tells what is happening. Narration, however, is not necessary, because everything is really obvious. You can even say what the horses say, although everything they do is close. What would be good, but all horses do the same sounds - one for warning, one for sorrow, one for laugh, and so on. There is no difference between horse voices. Young children can love this movie. It's enough for a family soap to sit and watch, and there is little danger of being scared. If you do not have anything else to do, and want to watch a movie with your kids, it's not a bad choice. But otherwise, this is not recommended.
