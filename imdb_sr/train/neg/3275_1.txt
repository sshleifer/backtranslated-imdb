Do not watch this movie if you liked the classics like TOM VOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PILE, SONNI SHROIER, AND BEN JONES! THIS FILM EXPULSES YOU BAD! First, this movie starts with Bo and Luke who work for Jessie. Bo and Luke would never do it in the right series! This film shows unimaginable characters that do things that would never have happened in the series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest and respected the law. In this film, he is a criminal who makes a musical and smokes grass with the governor of Georgia. Plus, if this is an extension, it will be added to the Duke Hazzard Reunion! and the Duches of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have one question: HOW CAN NOT MUNSHINE BE MADE WHEN DESTRUCTED BEFORE THE DEATH OF HAZZARD IN A HOLLYISM FILM? AND HOW BOSS HOGG LIVE AS IT HAS BEEN BEFORE REUNION MOVIE 1997! FILM AND ROSKO RAN HAZZARD? It seems magical that these characters came to life when they were dead for 11 and 8 years? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, it was supposed to bring James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopath, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach as they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family movie with live original characters that they made film show what it was and was still compared to this disgusting, embarrassing film! If you want to see good Dukes movies, or buy the original series, or go to valmart.com and buy a DVD set of 2 that includes Reunion, and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies! Both play the original setting and are nice for the family! Do not waste time on a movie that is not worth the CD you are writing!
