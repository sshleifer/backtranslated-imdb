An expedition led by brave Captain Storm (Mark Dana) travels to the Valley of Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to the earlier expedition. Meet the wonderful mysterious Simiru (Ziva Rodann) who joins them. Soon they face a mummy that drinks blood ... and Simira just seems to know what's going on. True snoozer. I caught this on television late at night when I was 10 years old. Seeing this again all these years later I see why. It moves slowly, the mummy does not even appear for up to 40 minutes (which is only 66 minutes!), The act moves from bad (Dana) to REAL bad (George N. Neise) and no violence or blood. This film focuses more on the second-rate drama (including the silly love triangle) than on horror. This has three stars because it actually looks pretty good, everyone plays the right way, there is a good acting of Diana Brevster short and scenes of attacking mummies (all three) are not bad. They're not scared just a little creepy. Still, this movie is pretty bad. A safe remedy against insomnia.
