The trend of the hideous violence of the 80s, which turns into a horror film, has really begun. I was the target audience for this repulsive piece of garbage, and then I was as sad as I did now. Oh, where are we going to start? Let's see an item: You can bring people back to live if they died of violent death. So, this ridiculously poor premise is the excuse that people are horrified, because, well, it's necessary to return to life! This may have worked if it played at the top for black laughter and la Re-Animator or something like that. But no, play straight. There is a whole overwhelmed family in a chase car, one of the rare scenes, at least where their death is off the screen. However, everything else is on the screen. There is actually a scene in which a young girl walking around them is beaten and killed by a zombie inhabitant, who all shoot and tear off with several cameras. Then, close to her face is when filmmakers with love - and a lot of time - discover in time photography, her beaten face is carved to the skull and re-made to look again "normal". Of course, this was done by Jack Albertson who was dead behind everything. He likes to ride in ambulance and play old tunes Tommy Dorcei, I suppose it should be sweet. In the end, of course, even the sheriff is dead and the doctor offers kindly. to repair his rotten hands. It is not clear why the sheriff did not come out with other citizens who kill children with cheerfulness and cut off their faces, pinching needles in the eyes of victims, etc. I wonder, I'm really wondering what people see in a geek shov in this way any rating at all. It's not scary, contours are ridiculous, and everything is ill. It's not even good enough to do it "to see on a dash" or to enjoy the level you can watch in the bad movie HG Levis. It's just a divine garbage, made for people who go to this kind of meaningless saliva, and made up of people who break their wages. It's sad that Albertson was even involved.
