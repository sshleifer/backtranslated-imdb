This must be one of the worst movies of all time. The graphics were terrible, the acting was a b-movie, and the effects were ordinary Nintendo 64 qualified. You would think that you would invest a little more effort into it. Of course, this is a Scifi channel movie, so you have to expect it to be low, but this one takes a cake. Damn, I'm still laughing. So, as a film in the head of a movie about disbelief, this works well. Although it seems to have some "famous" actors and actresses in it, it's hard to believe they did not realize that the quality of this movie is worth their time and effort. The graphics may have been good in the 60's or even the early 70's, but come, this is 2009! I will not give a spoiler, just to say that if you played "Jurassic Park" on Nintendo 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this movie. It's definitely not worth 2 hours it was necessary to go through this thing
