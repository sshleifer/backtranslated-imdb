102 DALMATINI [Valt Disnei]: I have not been a fan of the previous sequel, and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first, silly storytelling, terrifying due to the acting actor Glenn Close, who jokes every scene as a play for her own fun and incredibly boring and uninteresting actors. Once again, dogs are the only "actors" who look "real" and it's stretching. Another lost effort here. GRADE: D
