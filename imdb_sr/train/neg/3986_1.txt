When I say Malice as a film noir, I do not compare him with masterpieces like Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon, nor have I compared Becker with Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel. I only register a protest against the darkness that spills this film from beginning to end, to the extent that most of the time you simply can not understand what is happening. I can understand the darkness in the night scenes, but this film was dark even in the middle of a white day, for what reason I'm at a loss to understand. However, it would not matter much that director Becker recorded it in complete darkness.
