The DVD version consists of 2 episodes, the pariside of Caesar is a junction. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles. That's why I find it hard to review this film in detail, because I did not understand what was said. Cleopatra is a historic icon, the part is very difficult and I discovered that for a newcomer, Leonor Varela just plays well. She is a strong will, but also a very supportive, gentle soul. Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and their romance is the main issue of the first episode. So, it's not really a documentary, not an ashes, but a great love story. After paracid, a new lover (Marc-Antoine) comes, but the taste is gone: we always remember our first love. So I found another episode that was boring and their tragic fate was not pronounced. However, the production is luxurious: the sets are large, tastefully decorated; the Moroccan living location is exotic, and the cabinets are brilliant. Manufacturers surely have a lot of money, but they do not spend anything on special effects. They are so poor (blue screens, ships, the Sphinx) that it's ridiculous. Finally, I would very much like to hear it in French or English to give a final opinion on these two films.
