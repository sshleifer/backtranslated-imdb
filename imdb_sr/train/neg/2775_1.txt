This was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Not really. I'm not kidding. All "based on true stories / historical references" aside, there is no excuse for such a bad act. Too bad, because, as others posted, sets and costumes were great. Sound recording was typical "asian-style" music, although I could not figure out where the "modern" love song came when Fernando lay in his bed thinking of Mary. I do not know who wrote and sang this beautiful song, but as if suddenly Nora Jones had been transported to 1500. Kvik-n-EZ battle scene. But acting. Oh, so painfully sad. Lines delivered as a bad junior game. That Gary Stretch had trained potato costume for the 4H County Fair, he might have been more convincing. In the end he sounded more like a street bandit in Little Italy. Sometimes I expected to shout "Adrian!" or even "You want a piece of me?". Favorite line: When the queen tells her lover (after being late on the floor) "I will have a baby". He answers "Child?" I expected to answer "No, ass, foot chair! Ghost."
