This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! There were people who left the theater, others fell asleep (okay, it was a late night show) ... This is a movie without any sense, one of those that can make you never want to see any mainstream picture again. I would like to watch the filming of this film because I am deeply interested in what is happening in the mind of the author of this kind of garbage. Do they laugh when they create all these funny things or actually think they are doing something interesting? I wonder ... Soundtrack is horrible except some instrumental things that remind you of the previous Bjork album. Even if you're a lover of Bjork music, stay home. That's the best thing. Small, small pieces of beautiful music are no reason to go out and submit yourselves to this torture. God! ...
