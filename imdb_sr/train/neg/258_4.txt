This is the first time I've seen a movie with Jamie Foxx, and I bet it will be the last. I did not understand why he was ridiculous, although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made the face of the camera, or that he said "I'm going to dry out". the land is completely predictable. The bad guy is coming for a good guy. A good guy has a wife, so a bad guy is used. In the meantime, officials are screwing. The last scenes are extremely incredible. Spend 2 years and millions of dollars in pursuit of a guy, but do not do your job to solve a trivial puzzle? , and the recording was done in the MTV style. Do not spend money on this one. <br /> <br />
