As soon as I began to see the posters and hear the conversation about this film, I was immediately excited. The Matrix was incredible for watching, and I could not wait to see others, especially after I started watching trailers for other films. However, when I saw it, I left the theater extremely disappointing, as did many other film viewers in the theater with me. While the action scenes in the movie were as amazing as ever, there were simply too few. The first film consistently led the struggle that seemed, but the other took a much more (and much unhappy) crushing point of view. To summarize the plot, there was not much that was not expected. The machines were digging towards Zion with the intention of destroying it (it's not a spoiler, they all saw it in commercials). The film's dialogue was absolutely horrible. Unless you are a psychologist, you will most likely not understand the majority of what is said in the film, and for that reason you just will not care. He became a somewhat romantic film with the screening of events that take place in life and the relationship between Neo and the Trinity. Agent Smith, like the one who was bad in the first movie, seems to have become religious and discerning. I personally do not have to hear about it or pay money to listen to it. The film was a serious loss of my time, and I think I can not watch it first. The dialogue and the constantly boring and dull monologues at the heart of each character prompted me to quickly lose interest in the film, and a small amount of good combat scenes pushed me closer to the edge, and the end of the film immediately pushed me away. Which movie ends with "To finish"? How original are those people. I wonder if the brothers Vachovski had to burn the midnight oil to get to it. In conclusion, the film was bad and that's the end.
