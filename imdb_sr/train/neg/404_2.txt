Soon after I looked at this film, I asked the question of the mental competence of every actor and actor who accepted the role. Elizabeth Shue is a praiseworthy actress, why would she accept such a surprising opportunity? Still, I have to admit where a credit is due. Some moments in the film were unpredictable and rather transfixed, but they barely compensated for the sharp perverse tendencies of the character of Kevin Bekon, Sebastian Kein. I would not recommend this film to anyone, a man or a woman, who has any form of self-esteem.
