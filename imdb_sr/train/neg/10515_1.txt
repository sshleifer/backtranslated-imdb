So this is a typical movie "straight up to VC". A short story, a bunch of teenagers / young adults stranded in the midst of the wild forests and burned naked demon nymphomaniacs. This film has all the basics for this slasher fromage: -Women women, young men or young adults who are marooned on some ghostly, spectacular place of death, survived well-built a young woman who will always show up with her mouth but never barefoot - a creepy, crazy person who knows about evil, a scene of a lesbian kiss - a sex killer - is not complicated Even at that time, for a movie with a slasher, he was really terrible. The atmosphere is completely dead. Nothing, even sexually explicit scenes and nudity, were not enough to interest the female and male audiences. Looking at him as if they were watching him with a nasty head of his head or a nasty head. Give demonic ..... 0/10.
