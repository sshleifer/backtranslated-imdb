My friends and I rented this from Blockbusters because we saw the name Nana Visitor on the box. This film is a travesty that I hope she lost out of her CV. The "action" was lost and flabby, the acting was generally dry and unbearable in some parts. The film did not make any sense. A crude parasitic species of aliens that infects people has been made many times by movies with much better scenarios than, for example, an invasion of the invention of the body and faculties. If you ever have an accident to come across this movie, I suggest you burn it. How it is classified as a horror movie when there was no fear, uncertainty, gore, horror or any normal horror movie. I do not know the techniques, but if you still want to watch this movie, I suggest you have plenty of sugar before your hand, so you can find the parts of the funny.
