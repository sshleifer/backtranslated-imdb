While I wrote this review in 2008, we are embedded in the remake culture. Film studios look determined to destroy as many classic films as they can with completely meaningless changes, including 'King Kong,' The Vicker Man 'and virtually any movie ever played by Michael Caine. This lazy remake of the mental mentality is not, however, a new phenomenon, as demonstrated by "Dough for Do-Do". A totally meaningless colorful version of Bob Clampett's surreal masterpiece Porki in Vackiland, Dough for the Do-Do, sucks life from the original by spraying the color throughout Clampett's original recording and adding some chromatic new recordings overseen by Friz Freleng. Freleng was a totally unsuitable director who was clinging to Clampett's original material, although in fact no director could hope to come closer to Clampett's inspirational insanity. Inevitably, therefore, 'Dough for Do-Do' is nothing more than raping a classical with a new, awful headline. For lovers of cartoons like me, it's equivalent to coloring 'Casablanca'.
