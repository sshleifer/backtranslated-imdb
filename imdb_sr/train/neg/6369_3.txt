The only reason I hired this was an article in the Fangoria magazine. This article looked interesting in the article. Well, it's not. It was a very boring, amateurly written and directed film. All the actors in this film are terrible, except Faie Dunavai, who is always happy to watch. But too much time was focused on Gina Phillips and her ridiculous encounters with the Ravens and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has such a dense Argentine accent, that you can understand only the few words he says. Also available is Nicholas Pauls, who plays an ultra-bland interest in Gina Phillips. Conclusion: this film is not terrifying. There is only one good scene, which is the last five to ten minutes of the movie. I'd give this one star, but I gave it three because Faie Dunavai loved me so much. But even she was not so good at this.
