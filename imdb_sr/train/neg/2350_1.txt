This performance was bad. Writing was sucked in, the dialogue was sucked. The guy who played Craig could not get out of the paper bag. Since it was Thursday night, this was definitely great for watching some beer. Cold music, bad acting, bad writing, all gathered for my entertainment. It was a drama / unintentional comedy. I do not care what happened to any character, they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, since they could not find out who the victim was, they had to write a dialogue around him, which was horrible. I mean, bragging at the funeral was funny. In fact, all the scenes that were played in the present were extremely terrible. So, let's look at it. Everything that happened at the moment was shit. Scenes with flashback, just writing, dialogue and Craig's acting are sucked. Music was reigning.
