I came from this film with the feeling that it could have been much better. Instead of what should be a tense story of the boy's survival in the wilderness, she appears as a National Geographic documentary that encounters Columbia sportswear ads. preparing for the journey by plane to see his father. His mother accidentally gives him a curious choice of an ax as a gift to go (which is wrong with Rubik's cube?), A little knowing how soon he will need it. Once in the air, a pilot plane (flicker-and-you-miss him-kameya Ned Beattia) suffers from a fatal heart attack, leaving Brian helpless when the plane crashes into the lake. Extremely happy to walk (or rather swim) by far virtually unharmed, Bryan must find shelter, food and hope for rescue. Here begins the main problem with the movie. By the very nature of Brian's loneliness, Jared has very few lines to speak, so the film should be compensated by the intensification of the tension of each scene. Instead, he is shown walking, sitting, and so on, with minimal sense of danger. As a result, too much reliance is placed on flashbacks of disturbed parents' marriages as a source of tension. These scenes just stand in the way and do not add much in the story. Worse, occasionally Jared? his face covered with mud - drops the original scream or two, which call unhappy parallels with the 'Predator'. When we were already with the unfortunate, we could do it because we saved a look at his scarf, but that probably helped him get warm at night. She and her father have very little influence on the film. For example, we have never been shown how they react to news of Brian's disappearance, how they can organize rescue attempts, and so on. This is just one source of tension that filmmakers could do well to explore, instead of wasting so much time on the events that happened before Brian went on the road.
