What's wrong with this movie? Lots, lots of things. Editing makes too much effort to look good, and does nothing else but confuses the viewer and at the same time gives him a powerful headache. The action is confused and obviously extended from what started as a short story or film. The action only takes less than ten minutes of good story, which is only painfully extended until it has reached the minimum length for the feature film. We all know what happens to things when we stumble, right? Just so. They become thinner. In the end, the action is so thin that you can miss it, if you do not pay attention, which is hard to do when watching this movie. The acting is not at all impressive. The characters are poorly written and boring, uninteresting. One of the worst things that's wrong with this movie is that it's obvious that the one who was in charge of the scores / soundtrack had no idea what the film was or what it should be (not to blame him, I could not.) T and understand it). As a result, half of the music in the movie does not fit in the scene at all. Also, what about all sexual subtonies between Eliza Dushka and the main character? Of course, this was to attract young men, but that was so cheap. And did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the movie? At any possible level? At all? It seems that these two freakish guys have nothing to do with the movie, they were just there to have some hunting scenes. I doubt anyone would really enjoy a movie that is so badly composed and so Hollywood's terrible and terrible attempt to come up with an interesting idea. But I step down. I recommend this to teenagers with a small range of attention that do not bother the really bad horor thriller as long as there is sex and blood in it (although that can be true only for Killer Cut, which I have seen). 1/10
