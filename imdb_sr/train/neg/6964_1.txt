I usually watch the MTV Movie Awards to watch a funny, entertaining show that brings a unique reward (Chevbacca has won a lifetime achievement award as an example). So this year was not different. Although I am not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann Villiam Scott has always been a funny-albeit stupid - to me. I laughed at Stiffler in both American film films, and even enjoyed him in the Dude Where is my car? But MTV awards were simply terrible. Nothing was coherent, funny or fun. Justin Timberlake needs to keep singing and dancing; He's sure he can not work. I am interested in who the writers are for this show. Last year's appearance of Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was extremely fun (the parody of "Lord of the Rings" itself was worth watching the whole show), but this year was completely different. Did anyone understand Timberlake's comments about Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They're watching the movie together, but they never met! Here they are ...") Where was the joke? Kate and Luke just went to their lame dialogue, never mentioning the "joke" of Timberlake. And Seann was completely lost as a talent, not even challenging to laugh, and yet I laughed. And what was the purpose of Harrison's single-layer ships? Did they give any sense to anybody? Perhaps the MTV writers thought young spectators would only know old Ford, such as Han Solo, Indiana Jones, or the president of the Air Force One. I am confused. Would somebody tell me an agreement with Adrian Brody? How old is this guy and how old is he? Man looks 30, tries to act again 19 ... give up, show some class (as in your best direction for the Academy Award) and act your age! I give this show 1 star of 4, simply because of speaking Goll for the best visual performance. This was very creative, very well done and provoked the only real laugh of the whole evening.
