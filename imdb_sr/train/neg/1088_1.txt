I rarely witnessed such an unnecessary waste of talent. Almost nothing constructive can be said about this hopeless marsh film. Those little interesting threads that the film looks promising at first turned out to be more than a red haringa. Actors - Robert Duvall, Robert Dovnei, Jr. - they are arranged in roles that do not go anywhere; the occasional genius director produces a film that seems to have been shot through a lens of colored coffee; The writer (John Grisham), who never produced any merit, reveals new depths of insufficiently motivated disconnection. The film has a cheap, disgusting feeling about it - but hardly at the level of commentary - its really a part of aesthetics. Normally, I am coming to the IMDb to write balanced, generally grateful comments. This incredible catastrophe of the film just makes me endless, fierce dishonesty. I will not, but only because I no longer want to deal with my "mind" with this waste.
