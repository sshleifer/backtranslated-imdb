Never watch this movie ... it's the biggest bunch of shikets I've ever encountered in my life. and it says something. acting, story and recording were absolutely terrible, this is THE LARGEST FILM IN THE WORLD !!! seriously, does it give you no guess because it cost me 99p from sainsburis and it was made only in 2005? hahaha this movie is like a cheap movie college, you can even see the camera in the corner of the screen .... although if you really want to watch it, you have to watch "scari scark shark" ... maybe the best act of acting. I saw in my life ... ha ha. I mean seriously this is the biggest loss of 2 1/2 hours EVER !!
