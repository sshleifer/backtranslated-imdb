Bodi Slam (1987) is an awesome movie. Low budget stink, the direction is a pedestrian (at best), and writing and acting are lame. But if you are in the old school in wrestling (around the 1970s to the mid-80s) then you will be more entertaining than the average viewer. I have to warn you, this film smells like ice. I gave him two because I felt generous. This party was "directed" by stuntman Hal Needham. The stars are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and a crowd of wrestlers and c-sheet actors (Dirk Benedict). The "movie" syndrome is about a promoter who wants to combine "hair" and "wrestling". But they are others who do not want him to succeed. There are more, but I do not want to show it to you. If you can wake up the bad acting and story, there are a few surprises in the end for fans of wrestling. I would not recommend this to my bad enemy (and I really mean it).
