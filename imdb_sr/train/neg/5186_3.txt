RKS films were always commercial films that were in the 90's, from GHAIAL, DAMINY His last films KHAKEE were visible FAMILY's shit This film is a decent movie, but it could have been better The problem lies in the fact that many old clich√©s are inserted and many scenes come out too much film and long Ajai Devgan's character is shown very well, but his character A good hero can be subtle. A long-lasting flashback can be avoided because the thigns-i simply pull out. Even the street game in the second half seems to be too simplified and difficult to solve. the message is well executed RKS's Directorate is decent, although it might be better Music is fine Ajai Devgan looks good and plays well his role mainly, although sometimes It looks bad in bright scenes. He stands out in dramatic fashion. Vidia stands out on the scene in front of the media. Pankaj has an insufficiently defined role and too much film, he stands out in his part of Darshan Jarival's ham as an old villain, and the rest are alright
