Another extremely unprofessional movie about computer programmers. It seems that the authors of this film do not know the true specificity of the world of programmers. The 20 best programmers in the world, a program that has its own satellites (for what?), a program that uses satellite frequency, somebody kills somebody to steal passwords (why?) and much more stupid moments in this movie. People who are not developers do not see something terrible in that movie, because they are not professionals. But people will not see the real things. The programmers will find this film strange and horrible - because many moments in the film are NOT connected to real life (why movie does not scifi in this case?).
