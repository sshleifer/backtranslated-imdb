The wife of the stage producer in London hopes to repair the American poet and dancer who plays in her latest acquaintance with an acquaintance, an American girl who shapes her life models in social circles. Unfortunately, the couple already met a girl who thinks that the guy is actually a producer of the show married with his friend (the fact that he does not wear a wedding ring should discourage any misunderstandings!). Music player Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers was eventually pulled to the ground by Dvette Tailor and the idiotic script of Allan Scott, which is full of juvenile behavior. Astaire and Rogers not only "meet sweet" - they meet funny (he danced like a lunatic in the hotel apartment above her and complains). The audience in 1935 probably did not care that these two would gather - as long as they did, and happily. It seems that today's central characters do not have the motivation to end up in the hands of one another: he is paired with flowers (after telling his friend that he wants to remain "fancy free" in the love department) and she gives him a mess. Nothing a little dance can cure! This glamorous duo is deliberately unrealistic as London and Venice, but we are watching only because the tracks are Fred and Ginger. It's a fantasy for those who are not ... those who do not bother the muffled plot. Music moments break the monotony of the fictional scenario, but they can not overcome the surrounding nonsense. ** from the ****
