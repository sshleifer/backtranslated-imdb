Tony Scott never was a very good director, but every movie he made after "Crimson Tide" seems to bring him to the point that today's unquestionably worst job is unavoidable (Michael Bai can fall into the same category, but at least his big, stupid , delusional epics that are entertained at some primary perverted level). And like other exaggerated Hollywood biographies (for example, "De-Lovely" and "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind") that depict the lives of pretentious, overestimated or open shallow codes that gave the aura of the "mysticism" of the society that thrives on the Strong details behind the scene , "Domino" is a film that begins with a little potential and throws that infinitesimal little number sixty minutes ago. With an already extended 128-minute duration, the movie feels twice as long, and spends time with characters that are so uncomfortably superficial and forgetful (as opposed to superior "rules of attraction", Scott's attempts to turn the process into irony through Domino's smug -scious-rich-girl-voice-over only attracts attention to movie-benches cluelessness) becomes an act only masochists could find comfortable. Story? Domino Harvei's spoiled-top-lover (Keira Knightlei, in a performance that is shallow as her brilliant look) is sick of the shallow lifestyles of the rich and famous in Los Angeles, and delights both the bosses of Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez to learn a thrilling trade ; By the way, there are double crosses, shootings, media attention (courtesy of Christopher Walken, who calls in his trademark), and funny indications of romance. Scott filmed the film together in segments that rarely last for more than a few seconds, raising the resolution to make the movie a neon nightmare that is sorely unpleasant to watch - if Scott is given the opportunity to tune the framing image, he appears, or in some way distorted, will; but all these sticky stylistic overloads overwhelm the little complication, characterization and uncertainty that the film has (not to say anything about his, ehm, "fun" value). Most characters appear either as despicable or stereotyped, often both (observe an unbearable, few-minute segment in which an African-American introduces a new list of racial categorization to "Jerry Springer"), and I found myself wanting everyone to end with a "tail" coin of our protagonist. "Domino" is the ultimate, untamed garbage - regardless of the interest in this person, Scott hoped to inspire him in his audience, and was lost in the sea of ​​a neon-like prediction that causes migraine for several minutes.
