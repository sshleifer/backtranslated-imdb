How many more of those fake movies should be done? Let's hope not too much. The lifting of Victor Vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by Peter Solette to draw attention to Hollivood. It's not bad at all. What is wrong with this film is that it ignores the audience and the bunch of every clich√© in the book allegedly "harsh" Hollywood independent productions. "documentary style" of the camera, except that the documentary would deliberately shake the camera ... It's "nervous" so do not waste time brighter film. It's "Hip", so let the kids use curses like Al Pacino in Scarface ... And so on, and so on. All you have left is a very self-conscious attempt to impress Hollivood that will not impress anyone beyond the "indignant" indie audience that seems to still underline every bad movie.
