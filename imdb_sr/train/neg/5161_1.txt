My life is about saving animals. I work voluntarily with a cats rescue organization. I'm a vegetarian because I could not kill an animal, even to maintain my life. I can not even kill a spider, I put it out. A scene where children throw stones on a bird until she dies, while she has previously taken part in an attempt to take other children, she has been sick and has been chasing me since. It simply assures me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance. Completion - adopted parents adopt earlier - does not buy out a demonstration of animal cruelty. Why would someone want their child to see this movie?
