Even if you did not realize that the sellers were in bad health at the time of the shooting and died before the film was published, FIENDISH PLOT DR. FU MANCHU would be a painful sight. It is assumed to be a lampoon of the famous oriental villain Sak Rohmer, but there is no focus. The potential for a satirical comment on the anti-oriental concepts of Rohmer's concept is ignored. Indeed, the film uses racist insults. Almost there are no real jokes or jokes, but mostly actors who act idiotic and leave gloomy lines. It is particularly disturbing to see that Sid Caesar is forced to utter a cursing and racial insult for a laugh attempt. Most other actors are so embarrassed. And there's Peter Sellers. He plays the double role of the fake Fu Manchu, who is trying to invent the formula for the return of his youth and his fierce British enemy, Naylor Smith. Sellers are not one hundred percent bad; he transmits strange warmth as Smith when he discusses his fetishist attachment to his mower and he marvelously moves like Manchu when expressing his love for the fun of the English music hall. But most of the time he plays both roles with tired death, which further sabotages any comical possibilities. The sales routines in which revitalize his weakness with electric shocks are particularly painful; It seems too convincingly agonized to be ridiculous. Several truly witty lines, a fitting shot Burt Kvouku (Cato in PINK PANTHER movies) as one of Manchu's servants, and the funny music numbers Helen Mirren can not save this mess. If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is a comedian genius, he will not learn anything from FIENDISH PLOT DR. FU MANCHU.
