I went to a movie like Sneak Previev in Austria. So, I had no idea what to see. The story is very normal. The film is very long, I believe he could shorten it to 1/2 without causing any problems in the story. His kind of movie you can see in the boring night you want to bother you more! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is OK. The film talks about the US Coast Guard, the way they are trained, the way of life and the problems they face. How there are not many effects in the movie. So, if you want to watch it, then there's no need to spend money and time in the movies. It would be more effective to watch it at home when it appears on a DVD.
