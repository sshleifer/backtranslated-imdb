I usually do not feel much encouragement to comment on movies that I do not like, but in this case I have to say something. This film is terrible, illogical and stupid. There are so many drawbacks in telling me that I do not feel obligated to explain at all, because it's time to move on to this experience. However, the most admirable fact is that at no time in the film nobody explains whether the motives for the madness of Bacon's character for traveling or a physiological reaction to his condition. The effects are impressive, and in the past Paul Verhoeven did some good things (the director's cut of Robocop on DVD is great). However, this film is silly and is generally not approaching the explanation of the point or the technical aspect of the subject, and instead it imposes predictable action without enjoying it. In short, like many other reviews here I say (I want to read them before ...) - Stay away from this movie!
