When this cartoon was first broadcast, I was under the impression that it would be at least half way, the boy I made a mistake. I must admit that watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin with George Clunii over the years. I watched several episodes and two of them Batman literally got a shot to the left and to the right of the Penguin who fought like Jet Li and beat the Batman shit, and I watched another episode in which Jacker hit Batman again. who obviously used Jackie Chan's movements as he turned the air like a ninja. Since when did Joker or Penguin ever respond to Batman? and even worse when they were Joker and Penguin Kung Fu colleagues Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It's really embarrassing, depressing and sad in the way Batman's picture is shown in this show. The animation is terrible and the dialogue is terrible. Since I have been a fan of Batman since my childhood, I can sincerely and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all costs, because it does not project the true picture of Batman. This cartoon is more like Vangabe Kung Fu Flick and if you really want to see the classic Batman cartoon, I strongly recommend the Batman Animated Series, but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece S --- T! Get Batman: Animates series and do not waste time with this cartoon.
