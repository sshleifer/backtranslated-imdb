Everyone for a while, Disney makes one of those films that surprise everyone. The one who keeps you to the very end. In the tradition of Pirates of the Caribbean, this film will surely turn into a spirit, kill and rape your village. It's horrible. If you want a mindless, meaningless, predictable "action" movie, go straight ahead. I believe that young children can enjoy this, because they like it when Good Lucky Wins. But I, I love films in which the throw is who will win. This film never allows Bad Guis to take precedence. In the end, when heroes are left in a cave that can "catch up to meet", you just know that they can get out. Everything works perfectly for Cage and his friends, he never has to think about a puzzle or track for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complicated. Watch this movie if you want to see some impressive scenes, not if you want to see a good acting or a good movie. Go watch the superman movie, it would be much shorter, and the children would prefer it more. For example, the scene in which Cage escapes from armed armed attackers, and the bullets refuse from the fence of a fire escape. (And I'm not talking about a fence or anything, just ONE MOM HALF) This film shows the decay of the movies and the film industry to cheap gadgets and boring, unrealistic action, which this film provides in huge amounts.
