"Darkness" was somewhat entertaining, but it never seemed as if it had a plot, it was missing more than other films accused of this damage; "Bad Taste". It started really well with the man who ran from something. The first few minutes was very creepy, but after a while, the movie became fun at the level of bloodyness, which was difficult to understand at some points because of the low light and the terrible quality of the recording. The movie was hard to believe because of the juvenile acting, which for most of the time seemed to be like some friends talking to a video camera, making lines as they went. This, in the absence of any complication, led to it seeming that the film had started without and that it ended without any kind of scenarios. As mentioned earlier, up was the only point of drawing in this movie, which was hard to understand for a long time.
