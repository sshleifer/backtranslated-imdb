My first attempt to watch this ended in 8 minutes, approximately after the TV report scene, which I could not stand. It went like this: Reporter 1: Hmm, in our sky is the pyramid. Reporter 2: I think they are aliens. * Unpleasant Silence * Reporter 1: In other news ... Several days later I looked him to the end, and it was not as scary as I imagined, but there are serious problems with this. About half of the plot can easily be discarded. The other half should be expanded to explain the story of the background or something like that. What are the benefits of the detective, the eugenics and monsters that Horus is currently removing? The funny thing was a monopolistic scene. "We are all powerful" gods "who lived for the eons, and of all the games in the multiverse we have a monopoly." Monopoly? Monopoly ?! Even Erich von Dainiken looks coherent, compared to that. The other half was terribly lacking. What did our protagonist do to freeze? Why was not there a big event when it was finally released? He had those boring followers, remember? What happened to normal people? What's the matter with the masked guy? How did a blonde girl appear? What about her vision? Likewise. It's visually okay, more or less, if you neglect the Egyptian gods who look like a bunch of walking heads.
