"Speedi Gonzalez" Friz Frelenga was the second cartoon by the title character after Robert McKimson's Cat-tails for two. In that cartoon film, Speedi was a nasty little creature with a big golden tooth, but in its other way, the famous design has already been adopted. Despite the fact that it looked much earlier, Speedi never developed in many ways. A big hat, huge speed and a bad Mexican accent do not make a classic character, and that's all that Speedi ever went for him. However, the confident little mouse proved to be incredibly popular and continued to act in many short films, including some truly incredible films from the last day of the studio. Although these early Speedi shorts are better than those of late ones in which it is often (rather unusual) paired with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to desire, relying on predictable gases that are usually based on a similar formula. In this episode of the same episode, Speedi is recruited by some other mice to steal cheeses from a local factory guarded by Cats Silvester. Although it brings the extra weight of the star to the cartoon, the role of Silvester could easily be filled by any other generic cartoon cat. His personality is exhausted by his forcing into foresight. the undeniable role of the persecutor. And it has always been a problem in cartoons of Tveet, but Speedi makes even a blind opponent because of his disgusting daring and the obvious inability to capture him. The poor old Silvester would have been forced to appear with Speedy for many years. Despite having followed the pretty basic formula and with minimal laughter, 'Speedi Gonzalez' won the Oscars and was born a completely inconspicuous star.
