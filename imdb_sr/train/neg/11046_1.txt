This is probably one of the worst movies ever recorded. Poor acting, bad special effects, bad action, all bad. In the last 15 minutes, a feline cyborg has been introduced that confuses everything. Malcom MacDovell had to pay the house, otherwise he would have to sell to Hollivood Blvd to pay the bill. I just do not know how you can switch from Clockvork Orange to this shit and be able to look in the mirror every morning. I could better make special effects in the bath. There is no continuity. Do they have to smoke to be bad? A pistol or shoots with a blue flame or bullets, it is decided. It's called Seadli Vake 2013. It has nothing to do with the movie
