Sometimes, creating something strange and contemporary does not always work for everyone. Although I will admit that the set design and concept of the film was quite interesting, the execution of these ideas into a true story simply did not work. This film was so terribly slow and pointless, even Robin Villiams could not save this garbage. Obviously, the dream of Barry Levinson fell on his face, but he should have warned the rest of the world on this slope.
