You can tell yourself: "Don Johnson like Elvis? Can this work? Is it possible? It seems to me as a horrible choice, but maybe I should have an open mind. I may be surprised. Don Johnson is not a bad actor But he's horrible Elvis He's too short, too weak, too sharply depicted ... well, you've already imagined it will be bad Add to that the black wig and eye pencil and mascara, and that's a big fat mess. The best I can say is that Johnson's acting is decent and because it's so fake for a long time, after some time You do not think of him anymore as Elvis, you see him like some other crazy pop star. Then, at that level, the film becomes visible. Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally positioned as a high, Queen of Beauty, Linda Thompson. But she is attractive in itself and plays a role with the sincerity, elegance and intelligence we expect from all of her roles. There can be too much intelligence in her performance. You have to be some kind of drug that is abusing drugs that abuses drugs. There is nothing new in this story; We heard him many times before. If you are looking for new information or insight, you will not find it. She is said to be a love story - unspoken: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs.
