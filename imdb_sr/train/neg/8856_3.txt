Li hosted 100 years of horror for Ted Vensom and talked about film insects. He said something about his only brush with lycanthropy was "Wrap II" and then he asked, "The less we talk about, the better." Indeed, he was right, because this movie could be the worst thing in the whole showcase catalog. The first Hovling, Joe Dante, was a revolutionary insect movie with its incredible special effects and his sense of style and theme. The film was taken seriously. Like other good original films, the authors of the film, for some strange reason, thought that more campers were needed than they were for the first time (see CHUD and CHUD II to illustrate this point). This film is miles and miles away from the first on every front. There is absolutely nothing scary. It looks cheap and black over most of the main scenes. Lee is the only actor in a movie worth mentioning (okay, and I will leave Ferdi Maine). Lee looks embarrassed because of the innocent dialogue and the funny thing (see who ends with him and Stirbom). Li looks incredibly tired and knows what it is that is something more intriguing than the two carriers who leave America and leave for Romania. The story is not really worth considering here, and you can bet that there is very little story worth mentioning when you have to have Steven Parsons and his band Babel through a large part of the movie at the beginning and ending with that terrible noise. Sibil Danning is there and that, she disagrees once, and then this scene over and over again and again - one of the reviewers said 17 times (I counted ten - but it may have been so bored of it). I gave the movie three stars, but it really deserves zero - the three that I gave to Lee for one, and two for the contributions of Ms. Danning. Iuck!
