When I was broadcasting "My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu" last season, I was pleased. Scrubs, I thought, was doing something smart and unique in terms of the clip-sho concept. Instead of repeating the recordings, they make jokes again for self-consciousness, and I really enjoyed it. I find it really unfortunate that I made a mistake. One season later, they succumbed to the fact that almost all comedies inevitably worked, video footage ... and it looked as if he was compiled by a work worker. Dr. Cock's shaven head shows how many editors were lazy when they compiled it, because it does not appear until four more episodes "My Long Lasting Love". I can not imagine that the wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once well-constructed by a sitcom. Who knows why it was set up just looked lazy and unreasonable, reminding me (mostly) of the episodes that were broadcast over the past year. An extra DVD for a (rainy) rainy day, not an episode of impact television.
