If you have not seen it yet, I say just go, walk in the park, do not waste time. No scenario nor acting is worth your money. * Spoilers * - Can not decide what's up: movie or Baldwin's haircut? The acting talent Ellen Pompeo is very questionable, I hope it will improve over time. The story is simply incredible. Loose cannon A US cop fights criminals in Europe alone? The notorious Slavic mobsters protected with only two pieces? An emotional art teacher who leads a ruthless gang? Spanish policeman dumber than hammer bag ??? Give me a break. There is only one good thing in this movie: At least, the production costs must be lower than the "Ocean 12," which was insignificant and at the top like this one.
