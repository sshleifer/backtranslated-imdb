This is perhaps the worst thing I've ever seen. Apart from the inexperience of having a glimpse of Hitler, it is simply not fun or fun in any way. It is very similar to the 1950s sitcom in its cornball humor and fictional situations, but while it can be well done as in I Love Lucie, it's not simply funny here. I think the show was based on the newspaper "Look, it's Hitler's messy sitcom," but he just fell in every respect. The guy who plays Hitler is so thin that it's hard for him to sit alone. I wonder what could have led the network to think it was a good idea for broadcasting. I thought that America had some nasty play, but the British won this time. America would never broadcast a series about Hitler, even though we had that show about Lincoln's goods, the Secret Journal of Desmond Pfeiffer. You'll probably never see this show because it only broadcast one episode and it will probably never be released on DVD.
