At what time do we live when someone like Joe Svan - whatever is considered a good filmmaker ... or even a director at all! Where are the new filmmakers with brain and talent? We need them bad, and hell with a mumblecore! This film is nothing, just as characters in the film do not mean anything. It's that terrible, the so-called Gen I, full of boring idiots, some of whom declare themselves as filmmakers without any trouble to find out about the craft before the shooting. Well, Orson Welles was a director. John Huston was the director. Fellini was the director. Dreier was a director, etc. Current films like these show how stupid young, the so-called "filmmakers" can be when they believe they go out without scripts, without direction, without thoughts, without legitimate "recording" (all was terrible DV), no craft for assembly, nothing "rebellious" or "advanced" film work. No, it's called ignorance and laziness or just a pure masturbation in the cinema (and there's actually a "shot" on the face, be ready.) See the early films of any of the "indie" filmmakers: Linklatter , Morris, Allen, Linch, Hartlei, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee, or Herzog ... no one has done anything so boring and aimlessly as this, nevertheless, Svan - whatever it is, still goes to SKSSV every year and is praised as some kind of brave, new talent, that's bullshit! I can not imagine everyone likes it, and everything else that this so-called film maker did (everything I've done Seeing) is the same thing (the new things are clearly made to appeal to a larger audience, one of the calls in the sitcom). Keep it clear unless you are a friend or family member of those involved ... to another thought, if you are a member family, or friend, you would probably be uncomfortable to see a family member or friend in such compromising situations. <BR>> Totally garbage. This is not art, this is the ultimate opposite.
