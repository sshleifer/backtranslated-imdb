Dave goes through a divorce and his mind returns to his first love. "Vanders" is probably not a word. I should say it fixes on a past girlfriend. He remembers the day when the connection was interrupted. Sequences of dreams have not only foggy crossings. He loves remembering his favorite songs and places where they went. I'm not a counselor, but maybe this has something to do with unsuccessful marriage? Dave goes to a support group and encounters a lady who is half younger (also divorced) who, instead of being "excluded" because of her horror, begins to be interested in him. Did I mention how Dave is creepy? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He does not move his hands while walking. It is strange. To shorten the long story, Dave complains to catch Marie (old friend) and kill her ... err ... I mean to face her. He does it. What was really creepy. He believes that he is married, but still flying halfway across the country to meet her. She leaves the house to make sure she is alone, before she "falls" on her. He has an inconvenient conversation with her that ends with his sharing of Christ's gospel by about 10 words or less, and flying back to a new young girl. We enjoyed the film mainly due to unintentional comedic value. I'm still entertaining a woman with my Dave's impressions ... "I heard another Dave & Mari song!"
