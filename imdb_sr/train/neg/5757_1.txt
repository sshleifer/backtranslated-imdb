The film was visible while Nicolson was on the screen. However, I had to fight against the division of the boredom when the film depended on Meryl Streep to wear scenes without Jack; she was as bold as she could have been. The relationship between the characters was nothing special; these characters are shown earlier - and much better. He felt like a scenario based on real life in absolutely worst sense: 90% of everyday life is boring and not worth writing or watching. Why did Ephron feel that her life and relationship with Karl Bernstein was interesting enough to write about how she escaped me? Perhaps she wrote it as a therapy - for many writers, putting the episode out of their lives on paper is cathartic. Fine: But why was someone in Hollivood then thought that this story worth recording is a mystery to me.
