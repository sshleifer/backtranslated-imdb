The moment the progress began, I knew we were in trouble! The premise is at best ridiculous. The story line was even worse, if possible. You expect more than those like Slater, Reid and Dorff. The lines were delivered as a robot. And I'm sorry, I like Reid, but she's VERY incredible as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff chose a bad movie to try to get back. Continuity has exhausted the entire film. The creatures were not bad, but they were not good either. All in all, I want to get back to my ninety minutes of my life. I can keep the money, but give me time! What a waste.
