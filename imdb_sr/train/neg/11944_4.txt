I rented this movie thinking that it was a fucking sad version of 1959 that I saw as a child. It was not. Therefore, I was very disappointed with what I felt like marginal action, bad character development, and most of all, the failure to emphasize the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version ... "The Flanders Dog" is just a cute "side" of the movie. Get the 1959 version!
