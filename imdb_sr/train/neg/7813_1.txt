In my eyes, this is almost a perfect example of the Hollywood Ego, which won only the new King Kong movie. Superman is an original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect, even though he wears hooligans. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen, since the very beginning of the film, I just want to push him to a piece of kryptonite in his throat. It looks dumb in a costume. But enough of him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choice for Lois Lane, she should be a serious journalist, but in this film she looks more like a student. The action was poor and predictable (VOV, He is actually a superman's son, who would ever think ...) and the acting was terrible. This movie has one good thing for it, and it's called Kevin Spacei. His portrayal of Lick Luthor was brilliant, but he could not even save this film. What this movie needed was the actors "lois and clark" (except Kevin Spaceia, of course) and another story. I watched this movie after I watched "hills have eyes" and I was choked to find out that there were worse movies at the time.
