This film did not have big stars in it, but he had a very good cast filled with great auxiliary actors and Gene Tiernei before he became a big star. With George Sanders, Reginaldo Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospe Callei and Cederic Hardwick, you expect more than a movie than actually delivered. Most of this, I suppose, is due to a second-rate scenario because the director Henri Hathaway was a competent and well-established man at the helm. - before the Americans entered the war. The British are trying to control their African colonies, while subversive Nazi elements are trying to cause trouble among the local population. One of the whites in the movie is a double dealer - working on the destruction of the British Empire! But, lovely Tiernei, playing the Sultan's daughter (!), Will not help save the day for good to Great Britain. a lot of films about the kingdom. Today, with the changed sensitivity, the notion of looking at the happy black natives who are dying for the Queen and the country looks ridiculous - and it would be hard for them to take root for both sides! Yet, in its day, this propaganda piece was effective in dealing with British support - although, as it is seen today, the film suffers from a long-lasting letter and stupid throw. One bright moment in the movie is the final bounce between George Sanders and the enemy agent. It's a shame that such a powerful scene seemed to be talking and talking about a movie - losing part of its hit.
