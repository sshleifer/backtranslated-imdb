- = contains a spoiler from original and film versions = - I'm a big fan of Notre Dame De Paris musical, I also read a book this summer and watched a movie today, in the beginning I was hoping to watch a good movie especially When I saw the 6.3 IMDb point. the first scenes were good, but I actually waited, the theater scene was directly from the book, but that was normal, but when Esmeralda kissed the gringoire I felt that something was wrong. they did not even a kiss in the book, even in the musical .. And there was a huge gap because of which Esmeralda judged the charm bnjaku, in the book she teaches the skin how to respond to a number of timer or to write the word "febus" Wait .. that there was Phoebus? In this film he is a soldier worthless nothing more, the creators are Kuasimodo love to show around and even cancel Frollo love .. but Notre Ladies is a frollo. his thoughts of fighting between love of God and love for people in the movie can not find anything similar to what we have, a criminal who is really bad and kills people who conflict with his thoughts .. and do not mention febus, not mentioning love for frollo , not mentioning jehan (brother frollo) who does not mention Esmeralda's mother (maybe it's okay, the story would be chopped too much) they did not even mention the real story .. (the other PS: the frollo was not opus dei or some cult member is actually in the interest of alchemy trying to make gold ... stuck in science and religion) <b /> Finally do not watch this movie, it's some kind of editorial release in the right masterpiece, and if you've watched it before you read the book, God is gracious to you .. you must read it immediately to reserve. . This movie is worse than the humpback Notre Dame II in an animated movie, spend your time watching Notre Dame De Paris music .. enough to say ..
