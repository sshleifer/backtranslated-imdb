It would help us know why it took so long for the book to be ready for a movie such as "House next door" to be adapted to film or television. The book was copyrighted in 1978. One of the reasons may be the problem of designing a 'home'. The house in this Lifetime movie is really so ugly that I can not even imagine buying it. In fact, it's so ugly that somebody probably came and destroyed it as soon as it was built. ten years ago. The main characters are not types of people looking for any occult in life, and this is one of the strengths of the book. They are not people who would conclude that the architect was a kind of demon ... (or an identified devil) without the presence and analysis of events that are so well described in the book. However, this is essentially a great book, and I do not think it attracts people who lead Lifetime. Maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in the years to come. Better house ... better music ... better scenario and darker lighting ... definitely would help.
