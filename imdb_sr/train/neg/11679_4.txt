First, this film is not a "thriller." Nor is it "tense". It could have been based on the scenario, but the slow direction of the route makes it difficult to enter. The plot itself is very interesting and ingenious. Unfortunately, we have a sense of how * genius after the picture is finished. It leaves us with more than two hours of long sequences with the music over it, accentuated by some action scenes that do not build the viewer, and "crafty" scenes that inject a little more intelligence. I wish this was a quick thriller that the box was promised. That would be an extraordinary movie. Instead, Spike Lee managed to get through the end.
