I finally saw INCUBUS after I waited 20 strange years to see it well, it was certainly not worth the wait all this time to see it. INCUBUS is strict in number of horror films: the invisible killer / monster rages and kills women in a small town. The film takes place like this: the film opens with killing; then blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; then another killing; even more blah blah blah; continues with blah blah blah; another killing (surprisingly, huh?); blah blah blah, etc. ... The film is completely predictable from start to finish. Even the stupid "big" red haringa used during the film would not convince the five-year-olds. And I realized the secret identity of the incubus at the moment I saw the character, so when there was a "shocking" surprise, I was not shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny I was trembling for days after I saw the movie. That's so stupid! In any case, the film is so numerous that the "rock band" sequence is one of a few moments in this gloomy movement. It's a stand-out scene not necessarily because it's good, but because it's so ridiculous and meaningless: the movie that plays on the big screen shows the moment in which video clips are seen with a guy in red leather pants, which obviously lies in long hair, This was edited with scenes of a girl who was attacked in a cinema sink. The best I can say about this movie is cinema, which I really liked. But, besides, about INCUBUS almost nothing worth mentioning, except that it is unintentionally funny.
