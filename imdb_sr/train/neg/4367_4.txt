One of the real clinkers of Boris Carloff. Basically, dying Karloff (who looked about 120 years older than him) is a scientist who needs money to complete his experiments before he dies. Starting from Morocco, where his funding is taken over by someone else, he goes to the south of France, where he works as a doctor while trying to get enough money to prove his theories. Desperate for money, he agrees with the young wealthy wife of a cotton baron who is dying. She will fund it if she helps her poison her husband so she can take his money and continue with a gigolo (which I think is married). If you think that I got it from watching the movie wrong, I had to read what happened to other people they announced to understand. Why? because I lost this film in two minutes. I had no idea what was going on with his many characters and multiple convergent lines. Little is said and a lot of things are not said until the end until I really did not care. It's a boring mess of interest only for Carlof's performances that are sometimes pretty strange. To be honest, this is the only time I've ever seen him in the bizarre territory of Bela Lugosi. Not every scene, but a few and seems to be wondering how much they were hanging out.
