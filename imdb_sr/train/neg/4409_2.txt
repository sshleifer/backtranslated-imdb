A strictly routine, Western number (directed by the genre verse Andrew V. McLaglen, was this a miracle?). Military colonel Brian Keith has a sluggish bandit Dean Martin, who just abducted Colonel's wife (Honor Blackman, who never found his niche after playing Pussi Gallore at Goldfinger). Fighting fists, shots, robberies in a carriage and Denver Pile in support ... in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Speaking of a low monotony, Keith met the prostitute (something that shocked him after he passed on the Famili Affair TV), but otherwise this low-cost material consumes Keith's kind talents. It's also a bad news for Dina, who does not seem to notice or worry. The hacking direction, bad writing and a few ungrateful attempts of low humor. * from the ****
