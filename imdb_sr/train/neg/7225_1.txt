I was sitting through this movie and I must say that it only managed to keep my attention. The movie would be a little more tolerant if I did not have to watch a terrible CGI for a future reference to the industry if you would use the CGI to watch it know what to avoid. Obviously this should have been a graphical novel for the screen, but all I saw was a bad movie that was not at all similar to the graphic novel. All in all, the story was not as bad as CGI, I was pretty impressed with the acting and I thought that the casting was good and a bit more character info would be nice as it got a little confusing for me at occasion, but this is not surprising as I said that he only kept my attention, but in all honestly I want to give this omission.
