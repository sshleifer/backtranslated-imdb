This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The action and the message are terrible. There are too many mistakes in this movie that it is impossible to follow. I do not even understand how this film can get any nomination, let alone 2. Here's why: 1) Sam Lee shows an angry / irrational detective who is provoked by his father's disappointment. Pros: He's angry. Opponents: When it comes to the scene of the explanation, it can not convey the sorrow / disappointment it has in its father. The crying scene was too fake and seemed to literally squeeze tears from the corners of his eyes. 2) In order to link the film to the title, there was barking or whistling of the dog's sound during the battle scene and rape scenes, which is completely irrelevant and confusing to the viewer. I understand that it should be a metaphor or not ... but it's just stupid! 3) WHY HOW TO DO NOT MAKE MUCH? What's wrong with this movie. When the killer began to stab a policeman, MESSAGES him. He's already dead! For God's sake? There were many opportunities for a killer to be killed, but I do not know why he was not! 4) During a scene where the girl had a sore throat. It was quite clear on the scene that the left leg of the girl was hurt, so how did she borrow all her weight on her left foot in the next scene? And this actress is nominated for the best new artist? VTF? 5) Sounds in the movie are synchronized. 6) I suppose this film is trying to bring about the awareness of brutality and violence among children in Southeast Asia, and why then the bad guy wins and then the policeman joined the fight? 7) This film is too violent for no purpose. The cops beat CI pulp, and then if they cooperate, they give them marijuana and cocaine? This is the worst movie. I really feel that the person who wrote this film is a sadistic and sick person. I've never seen a horrible movie in my life. VORST MOVIE EVER!
