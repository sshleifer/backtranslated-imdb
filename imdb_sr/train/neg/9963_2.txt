I love Alec Guinness. And he talks a lot after this film. Actually, it's not bad at all. It seems to just stand aside, be commonplace and usual, but to invest over. It is obvious that the girl with whom she agrees, the lighter, even as an inexperienced young French girl. Sir Alec would not have chosen him when he was young and obviously not too happy about it now. An interesting character is the sneer brother of the unusual "Suzanne", another crazy. "Donald" tends to be a French Heccliffe, and in vain I have waited for the source of his mystery. What secret deep was hidden behind that forehead? Was he in love with Father's mistress? Why did she twitch Suzanne's hair when she planned to bring together the parts of this party to the farm? Or maybe he just had enough abominable acting. The film would be charming with Ginis and the "older woman" who remembers and watches Paris together. That would be a great story! Two wonderful experienced man in a beautiful city after the destruction of World War II. Why did not someone get to it? I suggest you watch Alec Guiness in The Card, a little-known but worthy movie.
