Each time in a long movie, a movie will appear that will be so awesome that I feel compelled to warn people. If I'm doing all the days and I can save only one soul from watching this movie, how much will I be glad? Where to begin my discussion of the pain. To begin with, there were musical edits every five minutes. There was no character development. Every character was a stereotype. We had a dog that swore, a fat guy eating a donut, a dumb foreign guy, etc. The production value was so incredibly low that I felt like watching a junior video video presentation. Are directors, producers, etc.? Have you ever seen a movie before? Halestorm worsens and worsens with every new entry. The concept for this movie sounded so funny. How can you make a mistake with Garry Coleman and a handful of legitimate actors. But believe me when I say this, things have gone wrong, VERY IMPACT.
