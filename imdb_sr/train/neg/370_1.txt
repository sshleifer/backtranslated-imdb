Blank Check is one of the worst movies of the nineties. The action is completely meaningless; His outlines of loneliness are pathetic. Do you really believe that a twelve-year-old actor as a personal assistant for millionaires can achieve everything in this movie, such as buying a villa for only $ 300. The notion, let alone the price of a cheap cellar, is believed by the most skeptical viewers. Please, respect your intelligence and do not watch this horrible, horrible movie.
