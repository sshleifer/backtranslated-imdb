No, it's not a horror movie ... This is actually a love story. The ring is a quiet movie from 1927 that plays two boxers and a woman who comes between them. He loves a boxer known as "One Round" Jack. She loves him until a champion arrives. Although she marries in a single round, she starts flirting openly with the champion until the final fight between a circle and a champion. She returns to the corner of a round, just when things look the most suspicious, and miraculously finds inner strength to win the fight and win her wife. \ T but time constraints must not make him make a long film. Although there are special movie tricks, and some comedy relief, this movie simply does not hold up to one of its later work. It must have been extremely risky for that period of time, with a shameless adulteress. It may have been a retreat back in 1927. As we watch all these old movies, it's amazing how I think they could be redecorated on today's screen and really get off. Maybe I should be that ... <br /> <br /> Skip this movie if you do not plan to watch all Hitchcock movies. You can sleep in the middle.
