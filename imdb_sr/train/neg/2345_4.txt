I watched Written on The Vind starring Rock Hudson, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone - Robert Stack was terrible - just bloody awful - should have been charming mlazar-millionaire - instead of being pulled out to say the plot was silly and excessive, a 3 "romantic" did not have a trace of chemistry. Dorothy Malone is somehow won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress - although its distinctive character was boring - I think the older sister of Splendora in Grasse filled with malice and bitterness and lack of charisma. Douglas Sorghum director has the overall play of acting, that transforms into a dialogue which has been forced, and the end result is the loss of 99 minutes. He had a comedy actor who played head to Get Smart
