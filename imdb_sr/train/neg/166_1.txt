First of all, I did not remember seeing the Star Trek series premiere to see how a cowboy flies into space. so the normal Enterprise episode arrives 1 Archer finds a nebula or something similar to it and wants to look up close but can destroy the ship. 2 sends the shuttle to the mist and the shuttle is damaged ... In all the episodes I've seen, all the problems are due to Archer's stupid mistakes. Oh, did you see a review of an episode in which Archer and T'Pol are kissing?!?!?!?!?!?!? I planned to watch that episode, but after that I completely quit the Enterprise and I immediately turned to TV. Come on!!!! This is a star trek !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also, what was with the banana? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana, but he had to leave behind for some stupid reason. Okay, it's a little stupid to bring you a pet in space, but whatever. Okay, that's what I thought until they left him in the desert! BANANA SLUG CAN NOT WANT TO REMEMBER !!!!!!!!!!!! How are your writers stupid? By any means, I just say if Enterprise is DON YOURSELF !!!!!
