It seems bizarre that someone read this script and thought: "This is ridiculous! I mean, it's so funny it must be made!" Who is this person? Is he or she really responsible for this? Are they the ones who owe me for my time, more than the director / writer? This film smells of every possible way. There is not a single piece of good dialogue, not one nice character. A story ... I prefer the second worst movie ever, Hulk Hogan's "No Hold's Barred" to this pretty significant degree. It looks like it's almost Shakespearen in comparison. The end is rolled off with a few minutes of outtakes, and it's still under 80 minutes. Performers include actors who laugh at the 'harsh' mistakes they made, and things that went wrong in the set of this 'comedy'. I'm glad to see someone laugh somehow, with some kind of connection to this film. Nothing in this movie is ridiculous. Nothing. It just goes on and on. It's really so miserable. I love films that are so bad that they are good. It's so bad that ... something, but I do not know what, and I hope I will never find out. about this movie. But that really means a bit. Avoid at any cost.
