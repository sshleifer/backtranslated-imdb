Prom Night 2 is a fine horor film, but the prom night is much better and these films about how Queen Lou Lou in 1957 kills her boyfriend and returns 30 years later for revenge. The best actor in this film is Micheal Ironside and film actors from other OK actors and actresses such as Justin Louis (V), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (I). And there are some good scenes like Mari Lou kills a girlfriend trying to hide in her locker. collecting cabinets together and how one of the students on the computer and Mari Lou shot him to death. All this is OK / good horror movie and my rating is 4 out of 10.
