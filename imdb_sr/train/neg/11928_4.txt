Life begins sacred atmospheric vision of London as a busy bustling city, strange street and the sun. I was hoping to keep this atmosphere, but it got bogged down in a story that goes almost nowhere. Otelo works for large, thick g. at least I think that's what it should be because it is never defined, but he throws kittens in deep fat fries, so I believe he's a dick) doing little piles of work, while his skank girlfriend gives daddy of hand jobs. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black guy who always breaks from A to B. By the day he comes to almost no child of a homeless person who gives him the desire to stop running. The runner throws a lost boy into the Otel apartment, where he immediately starts giving more wishes. Wanting to fulfill some of his wishes, Karva kidnapped the boy. But he is not sure what would really bring him luck. Is it innocence to be a child again or is it another job? In any case, I do not want to see that a little boy approves him. It only needs to be moved, and there are numerous repetitive scenes. Completion tries to be shocking, but given that almost no one story about investing in any of these characters not only serves as a release for boring the audience. trying to fit into some kind of religious allegory, which eventually becomes pretentious as all hell, ironically. That gave us something more affordable or at least a better explanation for the characters who suddenly behaved strangely, then it was another enjoyable film. As is the case, we are introduced to a bunch of annoying spokesman, which then miraculously develop intelligence when faced with the mysterious boyfriend. When the origin is never revealed. It's simply irritating! Apart from the sporadic moments of the atmosphere and the unfavorable rating, this film has little to recommend.
