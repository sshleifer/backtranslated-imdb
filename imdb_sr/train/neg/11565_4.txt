So far, after the second week of "Lonely Beauty", I'm a little disappointed. Some of the actors are good, as long as we except that it's just a drama. I'm not sure how people can feel this FIXED DRAMA is "factual" coverage years of "Tacer" - it's fine as a drama, but I feel that the book that won the award is much better. > I wonder if the BBC will ever give us a sequel, and the next part of the drama and the years that follow "Things can only be better" ended in 2006 and the fact that we are still waiting! with that promise from a gloomy government.
