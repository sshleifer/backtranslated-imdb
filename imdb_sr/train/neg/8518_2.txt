I am wondering how many comments in this show are about how "real" it is. Maybe I'm not part of the same universe, because if Veronica Mars is something, it's on top in a great way. The act of chewing landscape with enthusiasm and plots have holes that you can drive through the truck. That's not what I call real. It is so serious in its desire to be "relevant" that it only shows how it is cut off from the reality of Rob Tomas and his staff. All in all, I found it was at best a snooze-fest and, worst case, more than a little boring. Kristen Bel seems to be a good actress, but it's hard to say with the superb style of the whole show.
