I had to turn this off after 15 moments ... I was hoping that this would improve. What I saw was either bad, directed or written. > This film should never be published directly on DVD. The main character who is the bride of HELL has a huge ice sculpture that killed her. She was such a disgusting person that I was not sorry. She turns there in some kind of paradise, and is still defensive, I went shortly afterwards. Paul Rudd, an actor who normally can not do anything wrong, was also in this nonsense. Jason Biggs (no longer a teenager) is also present, I like comedy, but do not be stupid about stupid people. Rating: * (of 4) 30 points (out of 100) IMDb 2 (out of 10)
