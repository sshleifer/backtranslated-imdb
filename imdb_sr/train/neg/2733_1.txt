I was talking about whether I should mark the spoiler box. Since 99% of this show is probably already seen by any follower of Scrubs, it probably does not belong to the category of spoilers. Clip shows. Grrr. We all knew Friends came down the tubes when they started shooting ... and for five and a half years in Scrubs they left and fell into that hole. I have to wonder if the writers simply could not bother writing this week and just said to themselves "let's show other funny things." It did not work. For starters, showing all the time when people are falling is not funny when it gets out of context. It is not funny to see Todd hanging next to his banana hanging net if we do not know why he hung next to his banana. the other was not his fantasy, even though I forgot what. And that's the problem. This episode is completely forgotten. We've seen all of these things before. And a collection of spots of people dancing? Why? It's not funny. Finally, I must admit that two of my favorite scrubs of moments are shown in the latest compilation ... Dr. Coke realized that Ben had died ... and JD told him he was proud of him. But even seeing these moments did not save the episode. The abstract tells everything. The worst episode ever. Bill Lavrence, please do not let your show go the same as Friends, let it be fresh, let it be funny ... or wrap.
