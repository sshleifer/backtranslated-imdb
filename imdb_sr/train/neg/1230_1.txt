The words can not describe how much this story is extremely stupid (and therefore bad)! Basinger, Del Toro ... what did you think? So, there is a shopping center and its parking space is fully filled. Basinger's character comes in to buy tea and some paper for packaging. When it goes out, the whole place is so empty that nobody can hear two shots nearby? Although he lives there, when he moves away from the criminals, he goes to the furthest and most distant place instead of to the nearest police station or at least to a hiding place? COME ON !!! I will not even enter the notorious red tool, because other people did it before. No matter how he kills moronic killers one by one. This is so stupid, with no logic, I can only warn you to watch it, it's TOTAL time loss, honestly !!
