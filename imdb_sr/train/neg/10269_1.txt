this film is unheard of. From the unheard, I mean terribly. I had more fun watching the dry color at my local store in August while I was suffering from a migraine and a heat stroke. The acting was getting worse as the "movie" progressed, and the directors used euphoric drugs became apparent that the final stages were approaching. when the fog was killed, she decided it would be wise to blink the post with the mordem. It was not intelligent. True, the whole thing could catch it with closed eyes. If you decide to play with a nail gun while you're drunk and watch this movie, keep in mind that your nail gun will probably give a better story to tell your friends.
