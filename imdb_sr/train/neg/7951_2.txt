I gave 'Kohi Jiko' a low score not because it was a bad movie, but because it does not do anything worth the praise. I have not seen any of Hsiao-hsien Hou's work before, but for non-entrepreneurs (including me), 'Kohi Jiko' is being advertised as honorary to Iasujiro Ozuu. (Japanese director whose last film was a trip, 1962 road) The film is an extremely rare business ... contains very few dialogues, stories, music or emotions. Io Hitoto plays "Ioko" without a job, a wandering figure who spends his time in a local caf√© or freely explores the Taiwanese composer he loves. Tadanoob Asano plays her friend, who works in cd stores and occasionally leaves her interest in the train. And that is all. We look at how Iok drinks just coffee ... walks around ... waiting for the train ... catch the train ... sleeps on the train. The kind of everyday reality that everyone in Japan can see everyday. Hou catches these common moments of life of these characters, but without any significance for these vignettes, it's a totally meaningless film for shooting or watching.
