Ladies Man is a funny movie. There is not much thought behind it, but what do you expect from the SNL movie? It's actually better than most SNL movies (eg Superstar or A Night At The Rockburi) Tim Meadows and Vill Ferrell were very entertaining. Chris Parnell was also fun in his short scene (one of the more fun in the movie). In addition, the rest of the actors are average and there is only support for Meadows. I definitely saw more entertaining movies, but I also saw the dumbest one. Again, that's not a very deep movie, but it's good for a few laughs. Still, it was funnier. But if you are looking for a pretty fun movie, I would recommend this. Just do not think too much about it, or you will hate it. Rating: 6/10
