I admit I'm just a college student at this moment. At the time I saw this movie, I was a high school student - I want to say a junior year, but maybe it was older, it's hard to remember. My quantum physics experience is in favor of my physics course, the interest in quantum mechanics that led me to read about this topic in numerous books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article that can be found in Discover and the like. I'm not a doctor in any way. It is said ... This film is simply horrible. It is intended to appeal to the scientific mind of the average Nev Age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special they are. My mother is such a person and since she saw this movie, she tried to see all her friends and buy a copy of the movie. I tried to point out the various flaws and problems I have seen with the films of logic and science - and they are numerous - and she has rejected my claims because "oh, that high school student knows more than all those who have a doctorate." In this case, obviously That's right. Leaving behind is the fact that earning a Doctor of Science does not necessarily require a person to be right or, in fact, intelligent. Leaving behind me the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to distinguish half of the film. Leaving it behind, the filmmakers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants in order to appear that he supported their beliefs when, in fact, he completely opposed them. I could go further, but I think the intuitor really did a good debunking movie, so feel free to read it if you want to do it. http: //vv.intuitor.com/moviephisics/bleep.html
