Good running around. A badly conceived opponent with very little complexity. A scientist working in communications sends signals to the universe and receives them, is obtained by aliens. Together with his beautiful wife, he attacks their territory and gives them secrets. He becomes quite traitor in this process. However, he does not have much choice anyway. There is a scene in which they give them everything they want. This is a boring movie with many long parts where little is happening. The plot is not technically bad. It's just that we usually follow a car, a path through the forest, exploring the building. This is about editing only. I suppose the story would not technically support much more. There are not many here.
