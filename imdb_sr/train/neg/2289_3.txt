Unfortunately, Marri Harron decided to make a fictitious display of Betty Page's life to start with her problems with men. As is typical of all of her works, every great male character is portrayed as weak, messy or twisted. In addition to her fiction, she projects ideas and questions that are not true. Betty did not leave her because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious problems (although she later became a newborn in her life through the influence of her third husband - the minister). She left him because she was in her late thirties, her acting career did not go anywhere and she felt she was losing her look. The allegations of abuse and rape are invalid and rejected in Bettina's own words and they are attempts by the director to claim that every woman who did what Bettin did did have to be a victim of men. Harron does not manage to point out that Bettie designed her clothes in almost all of her offspring (not given to her by "sick" fetishists). Harron also fails to say that Bunny Ieager, who made many famous Bettie photos, also made many "naughty" footage with Bettie and was not a morally correct professional photographer featured in the film. The only rescue grace is Gretchen Mol, which looks like Bettie. Otherwise, there are other films and documentaries that are more precise and sincere to her life and people in it.
