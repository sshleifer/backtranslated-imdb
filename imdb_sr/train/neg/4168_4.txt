Well, this movie started funny, but it quickly worsened. I thought that humor would be more adult-oriented than the first few moments, but then the movie switched to a badly-made way for the Disney Channel type, especially for a cartoon race that was incredibly long. Alana De La Garza is gorgeous but has a really fake Italian accent. The film looked and sounded very independent and low. There was one very sweet moment that I would call a serenade scene, but in all, this was a star. Laughter is very small and far between. The ultimate surprise for Mr Fik It is so funny that I was more insane than anything else. It might be worth a look if you can catch it for free or on television, but do not spend money on buying or renting this movie.
