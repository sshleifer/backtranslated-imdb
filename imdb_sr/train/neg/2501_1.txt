I've seen this on TV some night? or, to put it more simply, I was going too quickly to another channel to watch commercials when I could no longer watch. It was bad. Really, really bad. Not "so bad is good" is only bad. How is it financed? Who thought it was a good idea? My acting friend was auditioned and told him he was not good enough to play a bad guy, but I think they thought he "saved himself and escaped from that crowd @ # $%". I bet the rest of the actors got an option. To be honest, acting was difficult to judge because of the terrible fake American ascents. The shooting was dullllllllllllll. The action was awkward and stiff. Dialogue was empty. The far most sad thing is a ship. In real life, the ferryboat Interislander is a wrecked boat and can not be traced well on the movie. Instead of trying unsuccessfully to look like a new crew crew with parts of the jewels wrapped around rusty surveys, I do not kid you, they could change the script to explain or even celebrate the breakdown. Dumb, stupid, stupid. Do not watch this movie, not even a joke.
