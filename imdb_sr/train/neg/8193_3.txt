All right, during this last Thanksgiving pause, while we had a whole family together, everyone decided to watch the film, and since Fred Claus voted for the majority, that's what we said. To run the movie, there was so much holes for the work that it was pathetic. Simple explanations as to why a particular event occurred was void. example; Who, the hell, is trying to quit the Santa Clause? Is it some kind of corporation? A little explanation would be wonderful. Second: The film has cast thin characters that do not cause you to feel compassionate towards you according to their feelings or actions. For example: a small elf called Villie and the only high girl in an elves village. they are seen twice, and then the couple and I could worry less, because this film did not help me. Third: I suppose it was a family movie? Her rating was low on PG only. There were several articles on the family film for suggestive conversation. I did not mind, but if I were a parent, I could see the problem. Throughout the whole film, Paul Giamatti looked very boring with his role, but honestly, he was the only one worth watching in the film. Vaughn had a few funny moments, but he played the same character he had for the last two films. mouth frat boi. (nothing against Vaughn, he was good in other films) So this movie gets from me 3 out of 10 stars, just because somebody had to make an effort to produce, record and publish this movie. In my opinion, I would definitely forward this film, or if you need to see it, save it for a rainy day.
