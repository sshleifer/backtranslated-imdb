When I first watched this movie, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for this is Bo Derek and her various situations in this film. However, now that I am older, I can honestly say that this film is terrible. Keep in mind, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure to see her. But when you exclude this aspect from the movie, it becomes a great boring ride. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular as you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he does not know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo wears a wet shirt, which is visible on the chest. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have this problem. If you are looking for a movie that will spread through a beautiful naked body, then it can fill in the map. If you are looking for an imaginary, fun and worthwhile movie, go somewhere else ... almost anywhere else !!!
