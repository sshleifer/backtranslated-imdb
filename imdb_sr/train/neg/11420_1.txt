Elmo's Fire has no impact on life after the university (for most of us ordinary people). Why is this trash made? Who really can relate to this? Who lives like these characters? I'm really sorry that the actors have to deal with such an awful script. There are some talented young actors in this "movie" who have done a good job elsewhere. They must have been just one joke on the set. I actually found this "movie" offensive to my intelligence. The only joy I got from this is to hope Sir John Hughes laughed when he saw the screening of the same year when his masterpiece The Breakfast Club was published. The same mistake as I've watched this because you enjoy 80 movies. It's really offensive to the genre.
