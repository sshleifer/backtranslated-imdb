This movie is terrible if you pay attention to it. It's the perfect movie if you just watch the colorful pictures dancing across the screen - everyone without obvious affection to the other. I rented this film because I'm a fan of David Bovie and I really appreciate the musicals. In the final, Bovie was in the movie for ten minutes, and the songs and dance sequences were rare and left something to wish for. Morale stories were really confusing. I could not say whether it was racial issues in London in the 1950s or about not selling. In the first half of the film, I was laughing at how complicated it was, but I liked the "no sell out" campaign. When the blacks started killing, I thought my cassette was messed up. Maybe I rented half of two different films? No, there was a song and dance section "Keep Britain Vhite". I'm sorry, but the Second World War is not something you can write a musical. At least not a musical that could be described as "camps" as I have repeatedly in this review. All in all, I would say that this film could do much better if you decided and acted better. (And put David Bovie in him for a long curse!) My class: C-
