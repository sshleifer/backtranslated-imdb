I watched this movie last week and I had the biggest laugh I had for a long time. The film's action is pretty stupid and intricate in a badly-designed way. The only plus that can be found anywhere in the movie are Corei Savier's impressive abs. Alekandra Paul (I think that's her name) is terrible as a wife of a preacher who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is disgusting, and his character is at the top of everything. And as if the fact that you think having sex with your son is not enough, they throw away unnecessary solo solos at all times! The end and climax of this film is absolutely hopeless and also funny. I mean, who wants to wear a child of scam who tried to make you think he is your son and you have an incestuous relationship with him!
