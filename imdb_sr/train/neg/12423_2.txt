Cage (1989) was another of those low-budget "buddy" actions that emerged during the 1980s thanks largely to movies such as 48 hours. and Lethal Veapon. This is one of the stars of Reba Braun and Lou Ferrigno as a former Vietnam veteran who run a local diving bar. Reb takes care of Lou because he saved his life in 'Nam. But Lu is shot in the head and is now quite soft. Although immense, Lou has the brain of a child. One day some hooligans waited in the bar, and Lou and Rebb beat them. But the return is the mother. They hit a bar leaving Lou and Reba nothing. It's as long as these two robbers do not come to the picture (one of them is a real guy) who has a plan in mind. Film is a waste of time. Perhaps they went all the way and made a fierce action, instead of trying to alleviate the horrors of the situation, it might be able to function. Unfortunately, not the audience remains to hold the bag. Oh well. It's a shame that you have all the elements for a big B-movie. More luck next time, I guess. It is not recommended. kkk
