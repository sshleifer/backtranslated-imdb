Wow, this was a very bad movie ... as has been read in other comments, this film has no complication, no character development, they may have had some type of script, but it's hard to say based on the actual end result. The editing of this film was really nonexistent, it is inclined to jump from the scene to the scene without any connection or anything that would help the viewer to determine what is actually happening. All in all, this is simply a low-budget zombie shift that has not been thought out at all, has bad acting, bad dialogue, bad things. The only thing that saves this film from 1 or 2 is burning factor, I think this is the place where you spent the money you had to try to justify. Unless you are (like me) dedicated to finding and observing all the zombie shifts you can find, do not look at this. Period.
