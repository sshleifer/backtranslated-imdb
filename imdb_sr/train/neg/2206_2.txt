A scientist on the island is in deep sorrow for losing a son who died of kidney cancer. So, he thinks: why would not my dead son turn into a shark. Well, who would not? It's kind of hard to deal with the fact that a hammer that kills everybody is constantly called "Paul." Also, Villiam Forsithe acted as MacGiver-kick-ass-savingthedai - somehow the hero lacked credibility. On the other hand, there are several hot chickens that make you look at the screen while shark Paul killed another one to death. I actually think bad b-movies are pretty fun. But for my taste it would have been a much better movie that it was made for $ 100,000 less. Then it could be fun.
