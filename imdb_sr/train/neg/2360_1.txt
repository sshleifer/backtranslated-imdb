This will be the most useless comment I've ever made, but I still have to do it to alert you to the crime against the cinema that "Freddi's Dead" is. It's not just the worst part of the Nightmare series, it's up there with the worst horror sequel of all time! It was boring, meaningless, and almost without death. The terrible 3-D ending and excessive CULI killing are enough to bring this "movie" to the ground. However, this does not stop at this, just add a bad acting, a terrible script, and a number of horns of the cameo, and you've got this bunch of guanas! No wonder Freddie, as always played Robert Englund, made two performances after his death. And I would, if I had come out that way. This is strictly just a fan of the film, it does not stare at our shame.
