This movie became very dumb when things started to happen. I do not care about any of the characters; Susan Valters was so boring, and the leading actor (he also forgot his name) also came to my senses. I can not completely remember how this ended, and so on, but the whole idea of ​​aliens possessing human bodies and all of them just seemed stupid in this film, things did not completely take away. My dad told me it was a stupid movie ... I should have listened to him.
