The first look on the cover of this picture, looks like a good rock n roll movie. But do not let welding deceive you, or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie are in it. The story is simply terrible, as well as acting. Easy and Easy: BAD It's not a movie about roadie, it's just a thin love story, so terrible that you see it through it. The only good thing in this movie is a soundtrack. Some good songs, and therefore I give 2 out of 10. If there were no music, there would be 0 out of 10. Meat Loaf is a horrible actor (at least 1980), and the girl who plays the keyboard did not look good! This film was a great disappointment for me, because it gives me many good promises.
