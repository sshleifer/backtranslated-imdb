Really, really bad. How is a movie that is bad? I've always been waiting for something to pay off, interesting camera work, or at least some free nudity, but nothing. I just watched Cabin's fever and thought it was a wreck of the train (except nudity and pancakes), but it looks like a genius compared to this shit. The best doctor in the world could not preserve this nasty bunch of stinking beer. The only thing that goes for this "movie" is that it's finished. I have a headache that just think about this movie and I'm trying to write something. Ugh! I'm glad I paid only $ 5 for it and will soon end up at the landfill.
