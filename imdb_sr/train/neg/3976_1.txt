The action was boring, the girls were tortured and the alleged Italian leader apparently never heard the Italian accent. Someone said that the boys were cute in this movie, but it seemed to be filled with the central people. There was virtually no discovery about this film. I think this is a cemetery for actors who will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of twins from Olsen who obviously fascinate people for no apparent reason. I hope Olsen twins find something out of the center of attention to keep them away from the fun business. They have no place in it.
