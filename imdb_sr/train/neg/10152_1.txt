Being a fan of fanatic horror films, I saw it in my video store and I thought I would try. Now that I've seen it, I would want it without a living soul on the planet. I get my movies for free, and I feel that I did not get the money. In my time I saw some bad films of horror, hell I was a fan of them, but this was just an insult.
