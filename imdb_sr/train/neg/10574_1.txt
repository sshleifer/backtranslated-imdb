With the exception of the family, this new season is worse than the first season. I can not imagine what they think. As a fan of horror, he can tolerate much worse and foolish chaos, but this series worsens with every trip. I can not imagine how discouraging it is for the actors and the team to go to work every day, trying to throw out such shit. STORY! Is it too much to look for? CHARACTER! How can we be cursed about the fate of anyone in these stories? If we did not do it, who cares if they are carved or what else? Almost every episode ends with a foolish release of blood, going to gross shock without any feelings or conclusions, or the REASON of why we were subjected to bloodshed hours. Even Dante's efforts this season have provoked disturbing sexist violence and turned to a pointless conclusion. Ironically, production values ​​and performance are usually up to speed, while the content is extremely crap. I have a great hope that Garis's VALARIA from the producer of Ekec is under the roof, but we will see.
