I wanted to hit the TV. Watching was torture. I hated that. Never watch this movie. Terrorists are boring. Adam Sandler is boring. I usually love him, but not in this. I wanted to break the DVD. This is the most critical film in the world. A comedian who is jealous is disgusting. The only fun part is the rocker with black teeth that bring all the girls. It was so irritating that I wanted to hit the TV. DO NOT BUY THIS FILM, IF YOU WANT NOT A BACK. If you even love Adams Sandler a little, do not buy it. It'll just make you hate him. Do yourself a favor, if you see it in the store, hide it to extinguish everything. It's a waste of $ 1.99 that I paid for.
