Last week I looked at Sunday's Nielsen ratings, and there was also Veronica Mars, supposedly "the best performance you do not watch." Well, it's right you did not watch it. It was broadcast twice and ranked 147 and 145 out of 147. Translation: This is the lowest broadcast on any nationally broadcast network ... and deservedly. I tried to watch him several times because of all the newspaper coverage they bragged about as a "great" show, "realistic look" in life and all such nonsense. The reality was different. Veronica Mars is boring. It is unrealistic how much it gets, and it deserves a great deal of worthlessness. The only Mystery is why the CV felt forced to put its inaugural schedule to its lowest level in memory, after two years of continuing commercial and artistic failure.
