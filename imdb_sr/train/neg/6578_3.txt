Unofficial, not including the Cruel Intentions and Vild Things hybrids, but it's not nearly as good as any of these trash min-classics. It's about the actor's sheriff, Artie (Tae Diggs) who is called to investigate the almost fatal overdose of a drug in a top-class higher-level university, but keep it at a low level. As he digs deeper, he thinks it's much more than he looks at first. We follow Alicia, a girl who has overdosed in flashbacks. About 90 minutes, if this film were to be welcomed, it would have gone out. This film does not bring absolutely anything new to the table. But it's the only film so far that has Miss Svain Toples so the rating is only higher for that. My Rating: D Eie Candi: Dominic Svain gets toples (Fixing the "Happi Campers" error); Another girl is toplea Anti-Eie candy: more men's ass than girls
