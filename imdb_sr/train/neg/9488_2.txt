I've seen some terrible horror films in my day, and although this is not the worst of the crowd, it's definitely in the lower half. The script starts with OK. A young doctor goes to a hospital as a trainee, hoping he will take him to a better job for him and his future wife. Cute huh? The film then goes straight to the toilet when you realize that something kills the patient. It turns out that the demon is on the basement that collects human souls. It's the job of a doctor, 1 nurse and 1 security in the entire hospital staff to pull this mental patient down, make a ritual that mainly involves just cutting out the tongue, then allowing the obsessed home option of a demon to go out and steal his soul through the magic of cheerful special effects . At the moment, the movie becomes so ridiculously stupid, I begged it to end. It was another hour. It looked like half an hour of the episode "Stories From the Tomb", which somehow stretched for an hour and a half shit. From Tina Lister, who best mimics John Coffei (The Green Mile) to Traci Scoggins, playing the stereotyped frigid sister of Ratchet, this film fails at all possible levels. I gave these two stars for two reasons. 1) His bridegroom is quite hot, he did a little less pain in the end and 2) The movie looks really good, much better than the current trend of horror movies made with wave-quality high-quality home cameras. Finally, avoid this shit, even if you have a blockbuster movie block (which I do, and I still felt cheated). As a bonus drink game, you and your friends shoot every time Matt Stasi (Dr James Bishop) shakes his head while he speaks. You'll be drunk for 15 minutes in the movie.
