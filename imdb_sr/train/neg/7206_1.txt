Okay. Where to start. Let's just say this; Avoid this film at all Costs. It's based on a series of cartoons. The film makes the appearance of a cartoon film like Hamlet. Filled with emotionally inclined actors who seem embarrassed to be here, a bad work with camera, horrible music, and plenty of product placement that you want to never visit Yahoo! Again, this film is actually the bottom of the tube. To quote New Yorkers, Matthew Broderick and Rupert Everett to break through this picture, while gay men leave men who have spotted a rare type of salary in the distance. "They should pay us something from the millions that have earned for it." "Terrible."
