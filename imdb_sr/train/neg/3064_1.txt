The original "Vanishing Point" was a great movie. Subtle motifs, characters that looked real and spontaneous. Preachi, obviously obvious; he missed the point why the original was a classic. The Black Charger was cool, but even that could not save this movie. Why keep a White Challenger? I did not think it was the best choice in '71. Some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious. Like when Vigo was standing on a cliff above the canyon after the Dream Lodge. His Indian friend stood beside him. Vigo wore only white panties. I'm sorry - it looked stupid - he looked at his Fetus. Another scene was in the end - after an explosion in bulldozers - the speaker said that the blow was at 180 mph. Then he mentions that the police said that his remains were not found because he was evaporated, but some people believe that he saved him and that his friends were hiding him in the crowd. Then it shows that it rolls out of the car at 180 mph! First, you can not open the car door at 180 mph. Secondly, the car would not continue to travel straight-line for 100 meters. and nobody guides him. Immediately they would have rolled about 30 times. Third, if you hit a sidewalk at 180 km / h, you would pop up on a variety of pieces. Regardless, we see him finally ending with his daughter. All in all, a movie that would offend someone's intelligence.
