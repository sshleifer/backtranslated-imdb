This film was a disappointment. I enjoyed a good movie. I am the type of person who launches the movie and does not turn it off completely, but I forced myself not to turn it off. The only reason I did not exclude him was because I was a great fan of Christian Slater and I wanted to see him behave in it. I was speechless after I finished watching the movie. This film was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Thank you, Christian Slater, for putting humor in him. If you were not in this movie, it would be boring from my mind. I also agree that Anthony Hopkins has to keep acting. When the film was over, I did not even get a plot. I was confused and angry.
