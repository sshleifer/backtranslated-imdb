Want to see the movie "Players" by Dead Gentlemen Productions. This is not the movie. This movie is not funny. It's a waste of time. All the good comments here seem to have written (poorly covert) a false third party. People who made this movie seem to be trying to synthesize a false interest. This film is not well done mockumentari. Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" or Christopher Guest are offensive. The film is so malicious that I can not imagine that anyone was familiar with the topic of being ridiculous. Being able to laugh at yourself is important quality, but if you are the one who is ridiculing in this way, you would have to hate to enjoy it. The film is not offensive because of its great satire taboo theme, but because of the constant pathetic banality.
