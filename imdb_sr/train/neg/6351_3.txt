Possible spoilers. Although there was a good acting - especially Chloe Sevigni, and Radha Mitchell in a semi-comedy - it just was not an interesting movie. The differences between comedy and tragedy were inconvenient or sometimes invisible. At first, this viewer was confused by the fact that the supporters differed in the two halves; I thought that things were set in the starting scene that people around Melinda would be the same people, only reacting differently (more than the assumption "He said, she said"). However, what we have are two completely different stories and two completely different women, both of which are played by Radha Mitchell. Take the same premise and get out of there, but these two stories are just poorly linked. They give little help to the subject of the discussion, which is that almost everything can be seen as a comedy or a tragedy. Nice role, but a disappointing movie.
