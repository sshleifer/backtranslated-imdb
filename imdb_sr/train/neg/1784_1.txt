OK, I recorded this from TV and I missed the beginning. The film was ten seconds in the titles (I suppose) and if something happened before that, I missed it. Many people say that Mark Hamil is in this, I have not seen him. I recognized Clive Barker, John Landis, and obviously Stephen King, who really acted like a cemetery. Alice Krige looks beautiful next to scenes with a cat face or is completely alien. -Up. Even with the initial titles, it was never well explained what Sleepwalkers are or where they come from. From the title of the title, I assume that cats resemble two-seaters living by pulling out the life force of men. I suppose they live long and these two are probably the last of their kind. Add this very large dose of incest (Yes! I thought it was a little suspicious), a change in shape, a cat killer, and invisibility, and you have Sleepwalkers. It's a very bad story that does not have the right explanation behind the main 2 characters and too many cats to try to divert attention from the simple fact that it did not explain enough to the viewer. Avoid.
