Films were shedding me earlier, but none of the films did it twice, so it took me three sessions to finish it. The dialogue was bad. Women spoke stiffly, and men were caricatures. The two supposedly Japanese women looked Chinese, had Chinese names and spoke with clear Chinese accents. I'm still trying to figure out why men from Emmental are sexually wrapped up one at a time. 10 minus 8 1/2 equally difficult choice: Am I giving this movie a rating of one? or two?
