And that's all it is. This thing is slow. Actors have the ability, they just do not seem motivated to make an effort. The plot is not so large and it is additionally complicated by the above mentioned dispute. Accents, when they are, are British. Uh, many of these people should be Danes. OK, OK, accents are not that important. But it's the language. I do not think they used words like "yes" and "OK" in Beowulf's day. And this supposedly cool the weapon that the king gave him? Has he ever filled that thing again? Did he ever see him? Or Beowulf is such a bad target? His goal at least corresponded to the computer graphics used in the creation of the monster. That too was too much. Bad special effects. A bright spot? Only one that I can remember. Marina Sirtis has been good for years.
