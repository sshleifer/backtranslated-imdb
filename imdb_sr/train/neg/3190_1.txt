Jimmy Dean could not be more hammy or absurdly crazy. Hysterical if viewed through the eyes of Misteri Science Theater 3000, which I estimate as 10. I mean, a look at this fat, pork feeding around Malta should be enough to send you into vomiting if you go far into the film. This ugly, hysterical farce should be set up with Boots Call, Pumpkinhead, Swarm and The Smurfs Go To Bangladesh. Such a gulp film proves that sometimes actors, writers, producers, etc. They lag on the hypothetical, or stoning to madness. The question is "who was so stupid to finance such a whale?" But then, when there was a good estimate and "Final Justice" prevailed, then we would not have a wonderful performance in the "Mystery Science Theater 3000"!
