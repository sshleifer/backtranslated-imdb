Thank God for seeing this at a friend's place and I did not pay for it. The action is terribly transparent and the entire film was felt as an episode of a TV show. If you have any knowledge of computers or electronics, beware. You will feel like a movie is an insult to your intelligence. Also, the actress turned Much Music VJ Amanda Valsh shows the worst act I've ever seen, excluding pornography. She's lucky Matt Lanter is really decent. He is the one who carries the movie. I hate to spend almost two hours of my life watching this movie! It's a shame that they called it a sequel because I was an original artist, which was actually pretty good.
