All X-Men films were great. I mean all of them, including the long-suffering X-Men 3. They had solid characters (Magneto and Xavier were the best, in my opinion), and a good story about the story. I was all excited when I heard that the film was in production, and my expectations were increasing until I saw a movie. I was so disappointed. Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best film is The Fountain, although you will not hear about this movie when he talks about an actor), and his acting is not What's that fucking movie. The whole film is burdened with a number of pointless characters that do not add anything to the action (such as Blob or Gambit), which were thrown there so fans would believe that the filmmakers had read the original comics. I am a fan of KSMena, I have read many, many of their stories and this film has not respected any of them. No one. Not even continuity. Disrespecting the Veapon Ks project, or the relationship between Volverine and Sabretooth, or Emma Frost, motivation for wolves is a common nonsense and is seen in millions of films: The Deathly Hallows of a loved one. Oh. Oh. What I expected of the entire film was Berseker's moment for Wolverine, similar to the one he had at Ks2 at school when Striker's men came and he decimated enemy forces, but hey, this is Fok, this is a family movie and you will not see it explicitly violence from the most violent and most defenseless Marvel hero. Besides, I had the feeling of constant action with this movie because Volverine's Origins have already been explained in X2, but we already know how it got its adamantium skeleton so it makes no sense to make a movie about something already I know about. I personally believe that wolves are one of those few characters who do not need a solid story. because the mystery is nature's character. Do we really want to know how Joker got his scars?
