Interaction between characters is a moral disaster. In the end, you do not like most characters, and none of them like you especially. Even the two main characters of David and Gwen are so badly written that it does not really matter to you about them. The film has no complication, no direction and no purpose. The only quality of the film was to treat it as an insight into the messy lives of several losers - and it hardly stimulates even afternoon waste.
