Another example of the complete loss of UK lottery money. How much this film was commercial. The film council, which financed this scrap garbage, should stop at one of the stations that left the London Underground, which allowed this clich√©, a sad copy to devote to the film, half of the mutant stuff composed of all the horror films that the director saw and felt fit for imitation, and especially Deathline. Among many of his sins, it is quite obvious that the main character was distracted until the last moment. Then it's a little too late! Certainly all of those development leaders, at the British Film Council, could spot this in the scenario stage. Add to this terrible acting and funny look of the creature and you will get a great example of how not to scare.
