Why can not a woman be a strong figure in a film without sleeping with a leading man? The campaign manager in this film dreams of running Tom Seljko in the White House. That's all he can think about. So, why, for God's sake, she had an affair with him? They did not add anything to the plot and served only to humiliate successful women. The only value of this candy was a sweet scene "we all slept with your husband". Also, did not the people who made this movie watch the national conventions that were faked? Broadcasting between the two main political conventions only indicated their complete ignorance of the process of nomination and selection.
