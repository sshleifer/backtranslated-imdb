**** SPOILER VARNING **** <br /> Absolutely no doubt, one of the funniest comedies ever made for the screen. It is completely impossible to seriously understand this. It should be a great novel to list all the comic routines in it. During the celebrity days of her program, Carol Burnett and the company, which often made films, persuaded this one in a way that's hard to imagine. Carol acted as Jenni who suddenly got sick with a mild cough and instantly appeared third-party music, and everyone looked around and wondered where she was coming from. Harvei Korman played Oliver with liquid locks and almost looked like Ryan O'Neal. The only thing that's funnier than this battle is a real movie. What a scene of death in the end. Jenni really looks like she's dying right ... dying her makeup artist comes in and gives her a little color. And of course, we all know how often the hospital encourages a loved one to get into bed with them during the final moments of the patient. The final scene with Ryan O'Neal sitting on the bench in the snow, thinking of his future in film business is the current classic. He had a lot of reasons for concern. He never recovered from this.
