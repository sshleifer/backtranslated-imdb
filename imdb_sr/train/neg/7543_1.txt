A policeman is on the side of the road, taking care that every 1 respects the speed limit (doing his job); then pulls a woman who seems to be a mother (she has a child on the back seat); then he tells her what's wrong and BAM ... they will be killed. Okay, this is the beginning of what I personally thought would be a good movie. When I watched this movie in the theater I was with some friends. This was our first night after summer, so we wanted to see a good movie. We all decided to see the tension / thrill that looked good to everyone in the group ... this was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. Not only did I spend $ 7.oo on the movie ticket, but I had to sit through a brain torture. This film started with mystery and uncertainty and I seriously thought that "this can not be bad" ... I was so wrong. The whole problem with this movie is that it does not make sense; Even if you can go through a bad acting, "not really scary" story, and over all the terrible disorder in this movie, you will still be confused. Not because you're not smart enough to understand it, that's because no one with the brain could figure out what this is about in this stupid movie. Maybe now you're thinking, "Oh, man! I have to watch this movie just to see if he's as bad as that person says he is." DRAW YOURS THAT MISLED ITS SELF FROM YOUR HEAD NOW !!! I'm trying to save you the effort to watch this movie by telling you it's so bad that it does not make sense to even think about it. Please, people do not make the same mistake as I thought this film has the potential ... no. I give this film 1 out of 10 (if I could give a zero, I would), and I do not recommend anyone watching this movie, you will save many sleepy nights trying to think v.t.f. It's about it.
