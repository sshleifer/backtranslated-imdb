I can not believe I'm so angry when I see what I'm going to write my first review on the IMDb. This Disney Documentary is nothing but a rehashed Planet Earth Lite. Now I knew that I was betting that it was advertised as "from the people who brought you Planet Earth," but I had no idea that it would deliberately use the same cut as the revolutionary documentary mini-series. I just paid $ 8.75 to see something I already have on a DVD. It's a pity that Disney did not warn people that there is absolutely nothing original here (except for James Earl Jones and 90 seconds of sailfish for which I do not believe they were in Planet Earth). The biggest crime is that, while Planeta Earth uses the tragic story of a polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecological change, Disney took over this story and turned it into a family journey. After the death of a male polar bear, they show that young cubs grew significantly a year later, and to throw out some rubbish about how they are ready to carry it in memory, and that the country is still a wonderful place. There is no relevance to adult cubs who are due to die because of the same situation their father suffered, without warning of trouble for future generations if we are not together, nothing. Just mounting things we've already seen through the movie (and many times more, if you are one of the billions of people who have already seen Planet Earth). I never left the theater so embarrassed and deceived in my life.
