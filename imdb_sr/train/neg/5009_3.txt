This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The action did not make much sense and the acting was terrible. I'm a big fan of Amber Benson, I think she's usually a wonderful actress, I can not imagine why she decided to work this movie. Her character, Piper, is drunk for almost the entire film, with the exception of the introductory scene. On the plus side, there were a couple of points in the movie where the acting was so bad that I actually laughed out loud. But despite this, I would not recommend this film to anyone. It's only 80 minutes long, but it's 80 minutes of your life that you will completely lose.
