We have an average family. Dad is a famous rapper, we have a "rebel daughter of a teenager," adopted white little and cute little children. And we have a carefree home assistant, what kind of a maid was there? Do we have a Brady Bunch mess? Yay! When it first came out, I thought it was really cool, mostly because I was young. The music was bad. The holes were so bad and were too g-rated. All his raps related to his family, friends and problems. Dad was a guy named "Danni from Full House". He always gave advice. But it was not a pure freak. They had a home guard for that. To remember? Plots were basically Lil 'Romeo in some trouble, or ... not that's it. Oh, and maybe some drama. That things are good. Not really. But it's still a good show for kids. But Nikelodean could do better.
