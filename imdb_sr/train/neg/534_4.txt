This shit is like drying the color. I'm so disappointed that I was so eager to see it. This movie simply makes no sense. If it was never done, no one would notice or care. She was grabbed over all the big names in her, but if no one was in it, nobody would give this movie any love. I would look at Vanessa Redgrave and think: "Hurry and die already!" This is like "Joi Luck Club" without any fucking joy. It's "Oceans 13" (nothing except for the big actor) of mother and daughter films and completely anti-climatic ... until it's finally over. I'm sure everyone will be nominated for Oscar ... - 4 stars for cinema and the ability to convince great actresses to dedicate this garbage.
