Dinosaur movies can be fun. Like Vhoopi Goldberg movies. But Vhoopi and dinosaurs? After the first 20 minutes "Theodore River", I came to one conclusion: this film is evil. Evil, corrupted, evil, and disgusting in defiance of the audience. Nothing bad was done accidentally; This is the visual equivalent of the torture chamber. First of all, Vhoopi does not make good action films (watch "Fatal Beauty" if you think I'm lying), but filmmakers do not care - she's a hard cop here, again. Have you seen millions of police for this year? Well, here's the number one and one, buddy. Do not you like sweet, humanistic animated dinosaurs from the one about Spielberg about them? Too bad, here's another, and he's a cop! You are one of those who hate car pursuits, shootings, messy dialogue, boring futuristic FKS and watching talented people (Goldberg, Mueller-Stahl, Roundtree) stuck in a movie that looks like a write-off of taxes? A large number of written taxes? You read this review all the way through to the end. You deserve a continuation. Seriously. No star, no one. And if he really does make the sequel "Theodore River," Hollywood deserves to be attacked with a whole hide of dinosaurs from rubber rubber tires. Now I would pay to see it.
