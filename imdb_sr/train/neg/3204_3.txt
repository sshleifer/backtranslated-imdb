Although not as bad as it was made (I've seen much worse), this is still a very chromatic movie. It's basically a repetition of Siegel's "Coogan's Bluff", and the main difference is that Clint Eastwood's hat has more charisma than the whole Joe Don Baker, an irresistible actor if he has one. is great (and fun) as a bad guy, some kind of budget Vittorio Gassman. He is the main reason to sit through this steampile, while other actors deliver mostly terrible acting, especially to a girl. Poor old Rossano Brazzie, it's hard to believe that he was once a romantic leader (watch "Mondo Cane" to see him fleeing from women). It looks like Ben Gazzar of the second order. That's all Joe Don's shov, unfortunately. And all this is recorded on the generic 80-odd "action movie" music that can not be boring. , breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, at least the locations in Malta were pretty, and there Venantini tried to save the day. 3/10.
