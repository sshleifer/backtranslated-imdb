It seemed that this movie had all that with good camera, sound, film, sets, music, costumes ... but the drummer, Gari Stretch spoke! I do not know whether it was his bad acting or simply a bad script, but I would say it's both. Considering his role in this role, it was difficult for me to get him to the very end. I wish he had died in battle or that he was one of the swords / nightmares. Then, the ashes for conspiracy to kill the king was because the king did not have dinner and sex with his. The Queen? Pretty lame. And to go to the extreme to kill her son? And then she pushes her lover as a successor to the King? I see one or two themes of historical bytes here or there, but the way this was presented was Farce. I've read other users' comments on audio recording, but do not think that it's synonymous ... after all, he speaks English, right? It was really terrible. The lines were read from the coroner's table ... a straight line. It may be that he simply does not have a voice that carries a tonal fluctuation. Besides, I looked him to the end, so the film had at least "interest." It could have been more if the script / line and casting got more work. The scenery and the cameraman together with a high quality film is what this film made above all. Actors and stories were secondary. I'm giving the movie team 10.
