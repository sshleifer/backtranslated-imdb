After I looked at the trailer for this movie and discovered that Spike Lee directed, I was thrilled to hear about this event. At that time, I was not alive, I did not live in New York, so I expected more lessons from history than anything. What I got was an interesting acting, a lot of sex and a movie of about 30 minutes that had anything to do with Sam's son. I guess the film was not about Sam's son, but that was a glimpse of the summer of '77. Mark me disappointed. <br /> <br />
