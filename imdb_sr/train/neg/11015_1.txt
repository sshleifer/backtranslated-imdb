I foolishly read the last page of the DVD about this film at Best Bui a year ago, and I said to myself: "It seems funny, plus Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose it!" I continued to pay $ 15.99 plus a tax for that. I took it to my friend's house and we both watched terribly how badly it was written and treated. Wooden performances abound. All the "hilarious" and "extraordinary" performances of the promised never arrived. After 90 minutes, I embarrassed my head, knowing that I would never be able to get 90 minutes or 15.99 dollars back. And I almost cried almost, because if that was what could be considered a "comedy," I did not want to believe in movies anymore. My friend and I have constantly informed our friend about the horror of this film to the extent that he had to see him only to figure out how bad it is. During the holidays this year I watched him with him because he did not want to look at him alone. This was my next terrible mistake, because I watched as I just got angry. I started shouting about the film, and I'm not going to talk about a movie. Anyone I know he even saw and this movie arranged his worst thing they ever saw. My sense of humor is sick and distorted and often offends my friends, but it was not even possible to save this movie. The fact that this movie is not at the bottom of the IMDb list is staggering. The fact that her rating (at the time of writing this text) is a 3.6 crime against humanity.
