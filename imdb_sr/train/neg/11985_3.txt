Have you ever wished to eat worms? Here is a "documentary" that will show you how! Yes ... The kid eats live worms! And that's the most interesting part of the movie. This film is pretty well summarized from the previous reviewers as quite boring. I fully agree here. The movie just does not go anywhere ... unless you like to eat worms! This is a movie that is almost impossible to write a spoiler for .... because nothing special happens. Now on the technical side: It was necessary for the child to scrub. Who's trying to look like ... Bozo Klovn. It was almost comical ... I was almost expecting to turn into a hairy dog ​​or something like that. On top of that; The kid was too stiff to ever look hungry! I should keep him away from unhealthy food a few weeks before shooting. All in all, this movie has nearly slept me. My children could only stand for 15 minutes before they left the place for something more interesting. I admit that the landscape was very impressive. And if it was a decent story to go with her, she might have made a hit. It seemed safe enough for children to watch: bear scenes and "weird" eyeballs were too scared of most children, and a short scene of "skinny" did not show anything. I gave this very generous 3.
