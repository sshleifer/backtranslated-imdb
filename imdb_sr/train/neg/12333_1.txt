Un-bleeping-convincing! Meg Rian does not even look at her usual personal person in this, which usually forces me to forgive her on a shallow, stupid act. It's hard to believe it's the producer of this dog. Plus Kevin Kline: What was the suicide drive? Vhoosh ... Banzai !!! Finally, this was directed by the guy who did Big Chill? Must be a repeat of Jonestown - a Hollywood style. Vooofff!
