The fact that most of the budget for this probably went to the heavy duty list did not have to be important that it was set up with a flair and imagination and with little sympathy for the original satirical intention. Instead, we get risky bad songs and dance sequences with picturesque beggars and whores, and final alienation is achieved by pulling to reveal that the action took place on the stage of a music hall enough suited for the production that is more Lionel 'Oliver' Blair of Brecht. The acting talent is shamefully abusive: Migenes and Valters are good, but they do not have to work hard: The Migenes Bar has an excellent voice and some sense of material. Julia looks perfectly like Mack, but fights with a character, a cunningly cunning accent. Harris Peachum is embarrassed and Polly is terrible. Adapting lyrics, scripts and music is often inconvenient: it was a bad move that the film is based on the inclined version of Marc Blitzstein, but at least his words are singing, unlike most of what is interpolated in gestures of loyalty. An attempt to overcome a low budget by recording claustrophobic angles on fog-coated sets lit in silly blouses and oranges as if some cellar Vittorio Storaro is failing completely - the film looks cheap, bad and ruthless. Shameful.
