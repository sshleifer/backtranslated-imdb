A surprising skip by Larry Cohen (God told me, K, etc.), Full Moon High tries so hard to be ridiculous and unsuccessful, even with decent editions Ed McMahon (!) And Kenneth Mars. Alan Arkin looks embarrassed about his performance and Adam's son just seems to be deprived. That makes Teen Wolf look like a classic comedy.
