I am a big fan of Ludlum's works, as well as the book Covert, and I often thought about how they would be incredible in the film. Imagine my excitement, then, when I realize that such a film really exists! "Hades Factor" as the first in the series seemed an obvious place to start. From the very beginning, the film was disappointing. The simple elements of the film, such as Griffin's first meeting with Smith, are unnecessarily different from the book and much less exciting. A few characters are poorly poured. To begin with, Dorff is as sad as Smith. Not a bad actor, just an incredibly bad choice because it's too soft and does not show many of the features that are definitive to John Smith. Re-designation, re-assignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film. For example, the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire story of the virus, including the involvement of VAKSHAM, makes the whole point of the movie a bit murky. Marti Zellerbach is a very large part of the book, and on the seat he occupies, the rear seat varies a lot (not to mention that the movie figure does not share anything in common with the figure in the book) is another big mistake. Rachel Russel should be Randy Russell from the book. Not only she should be sister Sophie Amsden (it should be called Sophia Russel), but should also work from the CIA, not "Covert-one". What brings me to my last point, and I think it is one of the most important. COVERT-ONE does not even exist at this time! As long as the other book in the series is not hidden by the president as a preventive measure against further biological terrorism. To be honest, I could go all day. In short - if you love books and want to see a good adaptation, I'm afraid you'll be bitterly disappointed. Even as an action movie, it is completely average, mainly because of very poor editing and bad effects. The lost story and script with dull water are the final nails in the very cheap box of this movie.
