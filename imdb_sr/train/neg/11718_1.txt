That's incredible!! ... who wrote before me that it's time to sit and watch this movie ... that's it! Do not do that! I'm totally wounded! I loved Vesle Snipes, and funny I found out that he played his name in the movie. In any case, I wanted to see this movie (at home only of course), but now (immediately after) I am completely disappointed! It was his worst movie ever. Invatchable !! Bad actor! Bad cameraman! Bad scenario! Just one good thought: a beautiful girl! Must be a doll! Eeeeh !! Min.10 rows minimum?! I do not want to waste any more time reading my opinion! I hope I was clear and sub-stable, because English is not my original way of speaking. So it's time for a solution, and see good movies, as I'm trying .. Peace!
