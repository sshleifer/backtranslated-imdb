Since the "rugrats" fall from the category of good and fun cartoons to central and really disgusting cards for two-year-olds over the past three or four years, it's obvious that the tyrants in Klaski-Csupo have to be without ideas. After rejecting all the characters, adding even more stupid new ones, replacing some voices (though I like Nancy Cartwright, she's NOT Chucki Finster!), And without the feeling of continuity (for example: in the episode, I watched others Tommy and Chucky each got a new one puppies, but in the next episode, the aforementioned dogs never appear), you would think that creators could kill the show for mercy. But I will not. All I will say about this special is that it's bullshit! Although not as horrible as the episodes of Kimmy, everyone is even dumber than they were, including grandfather (my God! He was the best character in the show, but now, he has no real purpose). The ending is unnecessarily flustering, and the only thing that is different from this and other fucking new episodes ('98 -'01) is that children can communicate with adults. Wow, what's fun! There are no stars for "Rugrat has all grown up". Klaski-Csupo, please DISCOVER this play before it gets worse.
