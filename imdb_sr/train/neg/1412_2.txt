While watching this movie, I came up with a script for a movie titled "Making 10 Items or Less": Producer: I have good news and bad news. Good news is that we can get Morgan Freeman! Writer: It's great! But what are the bad news? Manufacturer: We can afford to hire it only for one day. I guess we'll have to find someone else. Writer: So we hired him for one day. The film lasts an hour and a half. The working day lasts eight hours. I do not see a problem. Producer: But ... he will have to spend time getting to know each other. The writer: So, we have to act it in essence alone. Producer: But he will still need to understand his motivation and all that. You do not say that we let him play the actor who plays a low-budget movie, right? Writer: Why not? Manufacturer: It's funny! But fine, at least we'll have Morgan Freeman in our movie. And I guess we have to put the film in Los Angeles. Writer: Of course. Manufacturer: This scenario is shit. We better make money on this. In any case, Morgan Freeman has an extension for Val-Mart or Target or one of these stores, so at least someone will want to sell the DVDs. <br /> <br /> Writer: Sure! Producer: Wait a minute ... what is this with a tiny bit with "ten things or less" with an express tape? Writer: Oh, I suppose it's pretty weird. But now we can not change the title! I doubt my script actually resembles reality, but then there were no "10 items or less". This is a case of good acting, but bad writing, and I hate to see it. When viewing an independent movie, you expect to try to transfer some kind of message. I think they may have been trying to tear the old message "do not let anything keep you", which was done to death in much better movies. In any case, with "10 Items or Less," the only message I received was "Look! Look at Morgan Freeman!"
