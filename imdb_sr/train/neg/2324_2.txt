I agree with the comments of other users that the two main roles played well, and that was the one played by Gary Gillmore and Giovanni. Too bad the story was so boring. I did not hear about a story I did not know about Gary Gillmore before the movie, so I did not know what to expect. I thought it would be something like the Dead Man Valking or the Chamber, but how much I made it wrong. The whole movie was just talking, talking and talking about their mom and dad. The only cool scenes were flashbacks in which Dad would lose his nerves. It was the only interest I had received from this borefest.
