The film was to be shown here in Bangkok with all fanfare, and even in the theater, it was miserable. Apparently the storyteller simply does not hold water. Something was definitely lacking. In my opinion, people must have a reason to look at it, except for historical insights into the past. The accuracy of history is not what we ask at the party. The film lacks any substance. The only way to do this movie is to somehow change the place where it is a kind of legend, not just a story. And the legend will have certain elements that try to tell you something that people have forgotten over time, such as the meaning of the victim, nationalism, etc. This is called the central theme. Film fails to answer, why should I still watch? At least some strange legendary Fliing Elephants, a psychic king, or an eccentric king like "The King and I" were wonderful, something would add a lot to the appeal of the movies. I suppose there was no appeal other than a normal vanilla movie. When you receive an appeal, then the next thing we are concentrating on is the story. In marketing terms we call it "must see". Having heard the title of the movie, people would say, Oh, I have to see it. Where's the complaint in Kingmaker? Why not just repeat the title and call it, "How not to be the king?" and make a black comedy of old Siamese days, in the style of "Dr. Strangelove." That would be much more interesting. Narrative experiences of the closeness of the king from the people who first left the game would make the film extremely entertaining. Most movies today have this "must-see" appeal, such as Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If they do not have famous characters, some other films, like the island, had an appeal when advertising is asking: "Do you still believe there is an island?" Or for a movie, reciting "How Not To Be King" can ask the question, "Do you still want to be king?" Parhat
