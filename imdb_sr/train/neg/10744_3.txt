In the first it was mostly gigantic rats, but there were also several axes and giant chicken. This, however, is just a giant rat period, gigantic rats and a really growing boy. This is about this rising boy and scientist who is trying to help him accidentally create huge rats killer ... you know how it is. This film has several murders and moments, but I think it's in the ranking with the original, I just prefer some sort of diversity in my giant movies. Well, that's not true ... Actually, I like "Empire of the Ants," maybe I do not care about gigantic rodents. All in all, a rather uninteresting movie, although there is a rather strange turning point in this dream, which is truly bizarre. I just can not recommend this.
