Describing this film as garbage is unfair. At least a trash can be an absorbing hobby. This film did not even absorb or entertain. Kevin Beckon can behave perfectly, so he undoubtedly had an IRS account to settle when he agreed with this horrible scenario. The story of a crazy scientist about "Holl Manu" has already been said, she was told better, and she was told without much crazy and expensive special effects. Most of these special effects seem to have been built around a transparent anatomical doll of men, women and dogs that you can buy in the early seventies. In the United Kingdom, they were sold as 'Transparent Man (/ Voman / Dog)', possibly the place where they got the title for this movie. Smart special effects, awesome scenario, non-existent complication. <br /> <br />
