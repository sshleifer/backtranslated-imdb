A singer from the country who received the nickname "Big T" - seriously, so is called - risking her musical career and her life by falling into the company of a sleazy drunkard (Busei) who wants to be her manager. His mother committed suicide, his father is an alcoholic, and he has a violent temper. You can imagine where it leads. In the meantime, there are plenty of music, as Parton, with his fluent vocal talents, recites the song after the song (at least half a dozen on Texas). Stay away from this mess and check it in NINE TO PET or STEEL MAGNOLIAS.
