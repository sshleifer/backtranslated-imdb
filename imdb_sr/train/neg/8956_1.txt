A rather disappointing predecessor of the first two films, it has no uncertainty of the first nor the interest of the other. Concentrating on the guys who run the cube, it essentially takes away any sense of tension within the cube, because we just do not care about the characters inside. Much of the film is simply boring, and it becomes really horrified by the introduction of premium glass and green crazy marines. After that, however, he only descends into unintentional joy. The end is nevertheless convenient, linking it back to the first in an indirect way. The scenario is horrible, the acting central at best, and the direction that does not impress. Much less tracking.
