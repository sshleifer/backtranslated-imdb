I've watched some pretty bad movies in the past, but what the hell were they thinking about when they filmed this movie. To turn the production team into zombies when they came up with the idea of ​​making it, because you must surely be dead in the brain to find any pleasure in it. "shoot 'em up" games, but joining a tricky scene from the game just made this funny and elusive. I will not waste my time on describing it. Anyone who evaluates this film above 4 must be part of the production house or Sege, otherwise it has a very distorted concept of entertainment. > I must say, I was more disturbed by the video shop, which gave me the thumb up, which led me to rent it. Thank God I had another movie to watch in order to restore some of my faith to the movies. The comic guy would be right to say "The worst movie ever"!
