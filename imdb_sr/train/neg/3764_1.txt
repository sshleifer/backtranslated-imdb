This is definitely the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen and probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The actors and actresses were terrible and it seemed as if they were too busy playing their roles like shit, rough guys, jerks, they knew all this, etc. It seemed to be a kind of computer generated image from the time of Atari & Intellivision. At one point, near the end of the film, when the army of the saskatchewan rushed for the remaining survivors, one was hit, and as it worked, it looked like a version of the poor man. And one bullet hits a bullet and the blood that comes out of it is just a terrible animation. The other thing that was boring was music. A trip over too many music (classical score or whatever you call) during the whole movie. It never ended. Oh yes, and the film is boring. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I recommend that you take 3 dollars or whatever they charge to rent this movie and spend it on a gallon of gas or somewhere in the value menu. TRULY AVFUL!
