Final result: 0 (out of 10) *** Possible specific spoilers (but who cares) *** Yes, so is: zero. And I rarely give one. Even for the brightest movies I'm looking for things like music, cinema, imagination, humor, even a good pace to be as objective as possible in the rating. Watching him within his own generations or subgenerals. But absolutely nothing can be used here. I can not remember that some movie sent me up and down the room at one time. The only reason I came to the end was because I could not change the channel - I sat there simply horrified, looking to see what would be next. It was as if I watched the snake digest rats. But let's have some fun and split this baby. First, nothing is technically about the "Vhipped" that works. Graphic displays are all sitcom style. All scenes are just pictures of street traffic that are repeated at night. The music and the result, not only do not contribute to any movie - it's disgusting. Not to mention, it does not have anything to contribute anyway. The acting is like a cardboard, like an eye, and this also applies to Amanda Peet (apparently "the star" that has weakened this cart green). These guys, supposedly good friends, have no more chemistry or sense of purpose if they are director Peter M. Cohen rounded off at the bus station a few minutes before shooting. With the creative side, there is no original bone in her body. No imagination. This does not show us anything we have not seen a thousand times before. The whole premise, or the "twist" of this film, is based on male battles and the "idea" that women who have the power can play men "just as they play". Anyone who thinks this is somehow turning or is in any way original, has never turned on the TV before. Dry, shallow women are common. Torture of men is a norm. It's not a stealing from anything concrete, that's even worse: it's theft of clich√©s. I can not imagine that women make a movie that shows other women who are so much based on stereotypes and this feeling of contempt. I want to rent a flat "In the company of men" - or better yet, "There is something about Mary". This movie wants to be "Edgier" version "There is something about Mari" so bad that you can see sweat. The film has no insights into women, men, dating, sex or anything. Koen is simply pleased with the vomiting of myths indoctrinated by other sexist films. On the other hand, the film does not work even as a satire, because although it is ripe with exaggerations, it could be viewed as "satirical" because there is no such basis in the reality that satires need. He does not even know what it is. Then, there is a dialogue, which is little more than the characters screaming each other. Example: Character 1: "F ** k iou" Character 2: "Oh yes, good f ** k you" (repeat) And the bottom line, a thing that could tell all other discretions : There are many films without complication, without good acting, with morally repulsive characters and obscene dialogue that was ridiculous and that was so good. "The whip" is not funny. Not for a moment. No comic skills or time. All the situations are completely false, not based on any truth, especially enough to ridicule us. All characters are widely drawn, so they will be linked to the lowest common denominator. See only the "tent scene", "cult classic" gel hair. One of our messy anti-hero opens a medicine cabinet and sees Mena (Peet) a vibrator. For some reason, the light shines on him as though he had found a holy grail. Why does Cohen think that people are reacting in this way to vibrators that I do not know. While he rubs on himself, he throws him into the toilet, and then tries to pull him out with his bare hands when, oh, Meen hits him. Oh, my sides. But, what's weird, people actually like this movie. Of course, people like "Friends" and the reality of outings show that I should not be surprised. All this has a common thread. "Vhipped" is a great proof to me that there is only a huge pocket of people in America who will laugh at every joke just because it is about sex. They will love any show or movie (or they think they like it) just because it's about dating or relationships. The lack of any quality has no scratches on these people. Just like people are indoctrinated to want to whiten teeth and a thinner toothbrush and weight loss programs, they are also indoctrinated to blindly show anything about / to sell cheap, empty, effortless TV, movies and any other number of products. The only consilation will be that when I die, because I saw this film, I have the credit to return 80 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
