Probably I will always go to see Voodoo Alleb's film, as it's never known if he could return to his past. Only one or two great moments or lines can be useful. Unfortunately, this film just does not work on any result. Talking really makes me sad and even a little guilty. I am sure my reaction is similar to many other Voodo fans, but what can we say? It's probably time to concentrate on your Clarinet, which in my opinion is pretty good. Speaking of all of this, I'm likely to go to any new film with which Voody can come out in the future. There is always hope and I will continue to love and respect VOODI !!
