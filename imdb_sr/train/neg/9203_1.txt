Many people like to point out this film when they argue with Hanks-Philesse's enormous legions that Tom was actually making shitty films (I think "Bachelor Parti" was excellent, but that's another story). The film focuses on the game "Dungeons and Dragons-style" which eventually brings our young Gamp to a hallucinatory madness. The story is charming in the early 1980s, focusing on the inevitable threat to our youth that represent these evil game roles. I, however, prefer to watch "mazes and monsters" as a turning point to "What happened to Chris Makepeace?" do it. We all remember him as "Rye of the Hare" in "Meatballs" and as an unhappy Clifford in "Mi Bodiguard," where he gave us all the exciting excitement by breaking the shit of Matt Dillon. There were not a few who could claim (especially those who regularly read "Dynamite!") That big things were ready for him. And then came Ron Jaffe. The boundary between bad behavior and bad writing is sharp, so I let you decide whose guilt is Makepeace's effect on it. All I know is that the last major edition I've seen was "Vamp", which was in 1986. He played a small role as the brother of Sean Penn in the "Falcon and the Snowmen," but until then the torch from the "Brother of the pack" was overtaken by others with flat hair and glittering biographies. I can not recommend this film with good conscience. Look to see only the younger, more idealist Chris Makepeace, before Ron Jaffe is having fun with his soul.
