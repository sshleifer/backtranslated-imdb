It seems to me, as a recent graduate film school, that in these times New Zealand's film, which reaches new heights, it seems that the public thinks that every New Zealand film is excellent. Sione's wedding proves this is wrong. It is completely overrated and not funny, and away from the 'funny' movie that other IMDb users commented on. The only really funny thing I found in this movie was Derek, a black guy, but in addition, the jokes were recycled shit that we all heard before. Being semi-Samoan decent, he wanted to see how the film would deal with polynesian presentation. It was a complete ball - I know it was an alleged comedy, but I did not feel that the characters had something new to say about a Polynesian identity, even if it was in a language. I was most disappointed with the ending of the film and the resolution of the relationship of character - Mikaele was a player who only roamed with white women, came to turn a little way when Duski Maiden came into the city, he has an epiphany might need to start looking for a stable relationship, then at the last moment he rejects him and accepts his position of Polynesian Plaiboi for palagios. I did not understand why they did it. All in all, it was very disappointing. My whole family went to see how she was expected to laugh, but in the end, she was very upset because I paid her to see her in the cinema. Jokes are at best poor, acting, especially Sefina Girl, APPLICATION, and honestly, I would be happy to get one of those pirated copies of the movie to save myself the price of a $ 15 card. I think the only good thing that comes from the film is that it is the second step (behind No. 2, of course, a far superior film on this) in the birth of a Polynesian film. I hope the pacifists in the future will be able to learn from Sion's wedding that they do not reflect Polynesia and that they have something more meaningful and rational to say. Even if this is done in a comic way.
