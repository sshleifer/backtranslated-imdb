White Lugosi as a creepy crazy scientist who uses orchids to bribe brides to steal the vitality of an old woman. The dwarf in this movie is hilarious! A lot of freaks, plus lots of rainfall and no complication, watch this movie as a nightmare. I loved that all the pieces eventually fell together in a typical Hollywood style. The story never gets interesting, and you feel helpless while watching. Usually I would achieve a boring shift like this low, but the dwarf has added enough horror and fun to get a few more points.
