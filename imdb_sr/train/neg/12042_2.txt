Acknowledgment of fantasies about Brad Pitt is a fairly difficult recognition for heterosexuals. But what can I tell you? Perhaps it is a famous extra something everyone is talking about and make up a star with a star. Crossing that barrier. Leads you to an unknown sensual and emotional territory. Brando had a peak, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean of course, and more recently, Tom Cruise, Jude Lav, Johnny Depp, Evan McGregor and Billi Crudup. Women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelli, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meril Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julie Roberts and very recently Natalie Portman. However, Brad Pitt, on the one hand, redefined the concept. He is the only reason to go out, enter the car, find parking, buy a ticket, popcorn and enter the theater to see "Troy". If you like the epics in "Jupiter's precious" style, you can enjoy this. But if not, go anyway, we want to keep Brad Pitt in business.
