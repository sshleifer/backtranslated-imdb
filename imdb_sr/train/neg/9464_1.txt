Well, the looks were funny and I usually do not go to the movies at the opening, especially with my children, because ... you never know. This is a movie that does not like children or adults, because jokes are too perverse for children and they fall completely flat for fun for adults. In fact, I was embarrassed to be from the ninth and sixth year olds and I had to explain to my 6-year old letter S H * T. In essence, what is happening here is a complete twist of the classic Dr. Seussa. Adds evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the mother of children for her money. If it was a sub-assembly, it might be fine, but it ends up as a major plot around the whole movie, and the "cat" plays a greater role in placing the neighbor's exposure to the mother for what he really is. Listen to my advice and read the book and download the movie.
