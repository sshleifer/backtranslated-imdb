So, should I start? This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever paid. I will not comment on the story, it's a wonderful classic, but here it feels like a soap opera. For starters, acting, except Eric Bane, is the quality of the soap opera. I've always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here every actor on Bol and Beauty is embarrassed. Camera action also does not help. How he keeps it when he is thinking, he just returns me to Brooke Forrester's days in the lab! Peter O'Toole either had a poor plastic surgery, or he was desperate. In any case, it looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And to finish my comments, Diane Kruger is a cute girl, but she's certainly not Helen from Troy. Peterson would rather choose Saffron Burrows for the role, since Elizabeth Tailor would have been pretty wrong so far.
