* Spoilers * Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is a brilliant critique of the media obsession with violence. But this claim ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown his serial killers as evil, inhuman killers of innocent people and opposed them with the morbid fascination of the media. Instead, he gives them justification. The film shows almost every victim as someone who deserved to be injured. Incorporating wicked stereotypes, Stone presents victims as unpleasant caricatures - dumb redheads, immigrants smashed in English, lazy fat people. One person killed by killer birds is also a stereotype. Of course, they make friends with the old, hallucinogenic American Indians - because they are trendy, comrade? Let's make him a great character. Fat, Chinese clerks and "peasants" are untrustworthy, so let's look like we deserve to die. Instead of twisted, mournful ones who are corrupted by their weeks, their rage makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallori become sexy, and cold and surrealistic visions will surely attract the most memorable people. Justice is laughable. Police and prison officers are shown as brutal, ugly and carnous in relation to killers of GK. Again, this is not in the media reports inside the film, but in the "reality" of the movie. There are no nuances or subtlety in the film - only exaggerated performances and images. The film does not say anything new or specific about the obsession with violence. Proof that the movie fails in its message lies in real realistic reactions to it. Some striking young people who watched this movie cited him as an inspiration for the murders they committed. The "message" of the movie is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction from terrible results from real life. A smart message can not be seen anywhere.
