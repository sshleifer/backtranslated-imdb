Whoever wrote a "nice" post about it must have been a friend of these guys. This is bad even for wrestling in the yard. In fact, this is not even a fight in the yard, it's a few guys who hit the trampoline. Each guy is about 45 lbs wet and there is not one ounce of fun value in this one. These are just a few boring kids who even give a bad name to the backyard, if possible. If you want to see some fun wrestling in the yard, pick up Backiard Vrestling A Pleasure for Pain. These are the two biggest names in BIV, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibited. These guys are good. They actually left his yarding and received professional training as "real" professional wrestlers. They went legitimate and became better. I recommend checking these 2 guys. MDogg is crazy and off. So do not waste time or money on this shitty DVD, there are "better" videos behind the house.
