This film was exactly what I expected, not so great, but not so bad. In my opinion, the PG13 films are not scary enough, so I already knew that I would be bored throughout the film. There must have been terrible things in the hotel room, but nothing we have not seen before. I guess I did not like it because I thought there was too much turnaround; It has become old and repetitive. I also did not understand if all the things Cusack experiences in a room really or not. There is no explanation for any event that happened. The movie just pulls in and when it finishes, you want to keep on going, because you're still waiting for someone to tell you what the whole movie was like. What I liked are special effects. In addition, there was not much enjoyment. Maybe it was just me, but I thought this was below the average.
