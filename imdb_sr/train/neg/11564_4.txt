Italian movie about horror / uncertainty about a rich English lord who cruises pubs and taverns for girls with red hair, as well as his recently deceased wife Evelin. You know that he really loved his wife, because he brings them into his home - a huge castle that grinds - and makes them tear apart, and then tortures, kills and kills them. The most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow to the end of the film, we see this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as a HERO film. In any case, soon after the advice of his uncle Roberto Maldero, De Teffe, he settled down with the girl he met at the party of his uncle. It moves and strange things begin to happen to De Tefe's fragile state of mind. He starts to see and hear his dead wife and finally, well, just look at the title if you're still curious. Also, family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashion. The poor Aunt Agatha (it looks as if she could be younger than De Teffe and had her in wheelchairs and try to look old) luck her destiny in crazy fashion. The other man is injected, then lives buried. And, of course, there is a complete explanation why Evely did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia is doing some things pretty well: the settings in the movie are suitable for this movie, although trying to convince us that England is at best ridiculous. None of the actors look English. Many who have dark black hair and Mediterranean hair and wear clothes, the Englishman would not be caught dead. Cars drive on their wrong side of the road. But all this, regardless of this, the scene of the crypt was effectively recorded and I liked Syrian resolution too. And of course, every movie with a red red Eric Blank is always a plus. There is a trail of sexual perversion; however, I found it somewhat scary with the idea that the torture of women is quite good and healthy to get rid of one of his mental demons. Come on.
