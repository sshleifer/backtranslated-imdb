I could not believe it. I had to rub my eyes several times. Is it true? Yes, there were Billi Dee Villiams, Jeff Conavai, Makvell Caulfield and Traci Scoggins - all of them have some sort of talent, but here they all were in what really contributes to Cinemak's movie. mounted on a spaceship! It's sad, but "Alien Intruder" is trying to be unique with a computer virus / alien demon / harp / whatever else you want to call Ariel (Scoggins) infiltration into this type of high-tech virtual reality station on the space a ship where four men are allowed to live their fantasies because the system is supervised by their captain (Villiams). Interesting? Perhaps, but here everything is played as a well-coated episode of the "Red Shoes Journal". Williams is out of class right and left, and he seems to prefer to do anything else, anywhere else. Ah, things people do for money .... FKS are pretty static, maybe even less than what you would expect for a cheap cheap ad. Unfortunately, even female nudity is less than you would expect. SEXUAL INNUENCE is a real star here and, of course, gets ALL the best scenes. If you like a movie that is all messy and has no brains, see the "Alien Intruder". Of course, you'll probably have to look further from Cinemak at 2 or 3 in the morning. There is no star, even for those stars that this movie can collect. Leave this lost in the universe.
