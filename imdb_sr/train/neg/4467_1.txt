I'm not sure who decides which category fits the film, but this film is NOT a horror movie. As for the story, it was quite interesting, but rather slow. Although I was particularly disappointed with the ending. ** Spiel ** Tell me why on Earth you have run home your uncle (?) detective or police? She knows exactly what's happening at that moment, plus she has a video tape as evidence. Instead, she runs there and begins to cry and says, "I know everything, I have proof! You did not expect proof, did you?" Then she is surprised when her uncle gets up and begins to come to her as if she were going to hurt her. Vell DUH! Of course it will hurt an idiot, you just told him you know everything and you have proof that you can uncover everything. What a stupid end.
