Pathetic. This happens when the director comes to work only because someone pays him. The intentions were good, excellent locations and settings for an epic-scale film. But performance, damn it! I swear, in some footage you can see accessories on the background that staring at the camera, or watching actors because nobody told them what to do when they hear "Action!". The battle scenes are so bad that you are wondering - are these people really? They could do more damage just by hugging themselves. In slow scenes you can see people on the battlefield walking around or just standing, waving their hands. Only the action in the foreground is somehow highlighted. But for what? The story is so illogical and discontinuous, it seems like random situations in chronological order, sometimes even that. Dialogues are stupid, the love plot is more embarrassing and funny than in Hong Kong action movies. With a budget of 40 million, and you can see every dollar invested on the screen, at best, the ultimate result of all this huge effort is a brilliant round laser disc in a thin lid on the shelf in the video.
