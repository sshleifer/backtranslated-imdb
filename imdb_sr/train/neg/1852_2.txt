Whoever made this film must have done it like a joke. I mean, this was the dumbest movie I've ever seen! Snowman's killer terrorizes a small town? Give me a break. I like it when he drives a police car. More like a comedy than a horror movie. If you want a laugh, rent this. If you really want a horror movie, be away from this!
