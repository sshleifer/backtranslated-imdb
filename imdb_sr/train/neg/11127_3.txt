I'm not sure what Diana Silver meant when she was making this film, but it obviously had nothing to do with Richard Wright's novel, on which the film is based. summer for AP English 12, and just watched the movie. During the periodic recording and checking the clock, I was thinking about the chance of lightning strikes. Of course, the sky was completely clear, and I was forced to watch the rest of the film ... and then write an essay of 5 paragraf. The Wright novel was talking about very real topics, mind killers and psychology behind it. Silver's movie turned the killer into a victim, which was NOT what Wright wanted (see: "The greater was born" 454). I will do this briefly and sweetly: if you want to leave your consciousness, in the words of Rafael Lambert, untouched, skip the movie and read the book. The 1986 adaptation is not a material that gives rise to thinking. ... :: sigh :: Now I have to write an essay.
