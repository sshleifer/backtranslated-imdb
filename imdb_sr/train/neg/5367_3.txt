I've seen every episode of this spin. I thought that the first season was a decent effort in view of the expectations to follow such success as Grey's Anatomy. So I continued to look. I'm afraid the second season lacks charm, chemistry and even more important drama of her predecessor Grey's Anatomy. It seems that relations are fictitious and that the treatment is so. The script lacks intelligence and comedy tips seen in GA. There are indications that it is a formulaic, but that it does not feel formative and fictitious, unfortunately PP is not so. I loved the presence of Kate Valsh in GA. I am afraid that Kate Walsh's life in LA is simply not interesting.
