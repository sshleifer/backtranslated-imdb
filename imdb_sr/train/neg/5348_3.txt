Inventor Vaine Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is preparing to donate his troublesome machine to the Smithsonian Institution's downsizing while he and his wife Diana (Eve Gordon) are preparing for a long weekend away from their son, Adam (Bug Hall). Vaine's brother Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patti (Robin Bartlett) and his children Jenni (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) are volunteering for Adams while his parents are absent, but how luck would have him (and the title would has led you to expectations), adults are accidentally fried by Vaine's gathering air. While children are angry, their miniature people have to fight with huge insects, fight on a rug that looks like canyons, and other threats. This was bad, as most direct videos are: Honey, Ve Shrunk we were somehow ridiculous. I had to laugh at that movie "Rouse" Stuart Pankin and the party thugs were even more funny, looking at their own risk!
