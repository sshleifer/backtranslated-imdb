Escort Villiama Lustiga to "Maniac" affirms that without the spectacular effects of Tom Savini and Spinell's compelling performance, "Maniac" would never become a cult hit that did it. "Vigilante" is poorly directed, with a simple script that describes everything for you and is predictable at every step, as well as the central performances of all actors. Judging by the sense of "deja vu", this film gave me, Lustig watched "Death Vish" several times before he did this! (* 1/2)
