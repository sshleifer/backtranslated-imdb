This film was heavily threatened by the presence of Steven Seagal. Or as I was supposed to say Steven So-dull! As before, Seagal is either too good or too stupid to recapture his own lines, leaving someone to act as a voice for recordings where the sound should be looped. A few films before that, he did it, but I do not mean to measure that! To be honest, the movie looks pretty good, the script could use some work, but parts of this movie looked like a real movie! Of course, this movie is pretty bad. It would be much better without Seagal who became a cartoon. Do not bother. Anything over one for this is too much! I honestly think this is the last time for me and the Seagal movie. What do you realize so long ?!
