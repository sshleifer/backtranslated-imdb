This is a 30 minute show about a joke. A joke, cavemen are not treated fairly. Hahaha !!! He can not call the phone because he is a Cave man. Cave people are not as smart as human beings. Oh, God, these cavemen are so rude. There is no humor in this show. They can just go to this joke for so long and already have Geico commercials. This show does not deserve the time slot on the national TV. Looking at this show, I thought he was trying to be like "Bachelor's Gone Wild Shov". So they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women. A paid caveman is boring. A caveman with glasses is too smart to be a cave man (HAHAHA !!!). All three have personalities, but I can not understand why I do not care about them.
