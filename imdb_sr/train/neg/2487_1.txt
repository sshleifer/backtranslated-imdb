Get "Rambo", mix in some "Miami Vice", cut your budget by about 80%, and you have something that a few ten-year-old boys could think of if they have enough large yards and too many access to the "Penthouse". A policeman and former commander McBain (Busei, with a name like McBain, you know he's so big as they come) was recruited to bring the American supertank that was stolen and hidden in Mexico. Trapped with a tank were stubborn Sgt. Major O'Rourke (Jones) and McBain's former love Devon (Fluegel), a commanding officer and now flesh for corrupted terrorists / spies / drug dealers, who have no sense of authority, blah, blah, blah. For action movie with broken sex, there is a lack of action and a little bit of sex. The joke is that McBain is constantly hit and survived, holding bullets as souvenirs. Obviously, the writers did not see the "Magnificent Seven" ("The man for us is the one who gave him that face"), nor did he think that McBain would even provide intelligence. Even for shareholders with a budget, production values ​​are poor, with distant recordings during dialogue and very little movement. The main propeller, the tank, is stupid enough to produce Ed Vood. Fluegel, who might have been blonde Julia Roberts (she had a far greater role in the "Crime Story" of Julia!), She must immediately move from excitement to frightened and striking shots and back. Jones, who was in an incredible series of films, is mostly at the bottom. Both he and Buse were probably just looking for easy money and a couple of laughs. Look for the talented, future actor Dannie Trey ("Heat", "Once Upon Time and Mecca") in a stereotyped, threatening and important part. Too dull even for pleasure, "Bulletproof" is still buzzing enough to play when you leave the house, but you want people to think that someone is at home.
