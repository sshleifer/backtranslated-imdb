The film is basically a boring array of stunning clich√©s that do not provide real intercultural insight. The Middle Eastern part of the road is described in a particularly irritating manner: apparently they are villages of mud brick, roads in the middle of the desert, women dressed in black dresses and abdominal dancers. I wonder how the camels and palm trees were missing in the whole picture. The personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and many situations are hardly credible. The original idea may have been interesting, but at the end of the day, if you are looking for a cultural insight, you should skip this film.
