Here we have a film about how the search for money and vengeance can spoil your soul ... or something like that. Gui Ritchie, a director known for his processing of the gangster genre, bites more than he can chew on this. swallowing your pride, be kind to your enemy, and give all his money to fall on his face. When the character of Jason Statham is no longer afraid of Rai Liotte, this obviously brings Liott into madness to blow his head in the final scene. Why? Basically, you can not set up a mobster like Liotte, who probably came to his station in life by showing that kind of merciless behavior that is obviously through the film, only then to take him to suicide with a pityed smile on his face Statham's character. Before anyone begins to say that I miss the point ... I'm not. Am I okay? Get out of the pursuit of riches and you will find real happiness and inner peace. Be kind to your enemy and this will confuse him with self-destruction. It seems to be the essence of the film, and this is not by itself a bad assumption for the story, although it's hardly original. The problem is that Ritchie simply does not have the skill as a film maker to carry it out. At a time when even Gary Ritchie realizes this, he seems to be bored with a story and begins to throw in red herring: the scene when Statham gets a car - Why? Shooting some scenes like Marvel comic animations ... again, why? There are so many free threads and unanswered questions that remained at the end of the movie that you can get for all of 2001 and try to understand them, or simply accept that there is no answer and every viewer will interpret things to your own the way. Himself? I was so boring with the pompous tone of the film that I just did not care. Frankly, the end could not have come too soon, so I no longer had to sit through this pretentious psychoboom. Spending two hours of my life.
