I remember seeing this in a shocking term when I was about 7 years old. At that time, I was a great comic book reader, and everything related to superheroes was highly anticipated. The end result, however, was unsatisfactory. I was aware of the story of Diana Prince "Emma Peel" because they recently ended up and Diana was returned to the Amazon form. However, there was so little action to bother me during most of the film. The last costume was an interesting idea, but it looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero. I saw a movie again in late teens. Not much has been repaired. Cathy Lee Crosby was more famous, thanks to That Incredible, but her acting was not better. The script had several good ideas, such as Amazon, and a decent villain in Ricardo Montalban, but he simply did not come along and he was still bored. I think that they should build a better story back, and the exhibition was built in the epic peak. It was too much like a spy movie, crossed with a story about superheroes written by someone who never saw the comic. Amazon's elements were intriguing, but they needed to be expanded. The film has managed to make manufacturers back to the drawing board and make sense more faithfully, if there is too much camping and little budget. . The budget was also pretty low, and superheroes are not cheap. It would be nice to have a movie available on DVD, at least as a comparison and a historical document. Even Superman 4 is available, and there is nothing to do with this film (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It is important to see for curiosity and for a little inspiration and caution for future versions.
