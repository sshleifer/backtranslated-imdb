"Houseboat Horror" is often regarded as the worst Australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher movie, featuring the promotion 'See a movie that can not get the Oscars'. Underground members of the disco band begin to die from a burnt down maniac as they attempt to record a musical video on a remote lake in the Australian wildlife. Bad behavior and writing a slasher film with zero uncertainty and boring characters. Women were killed and a woman was killed with a horseshoe. If you like cheesy slasher movies, you can try this, but you have been warned. At least it's better than the Swedish "The Bleeder" .4 out of 10.
