There are several problems with this movie, but the bottom line is that she tried to do too much with too little. The basic story is pretty good, but the money was not there to apologize for justice. The non-existent budget really killed this film. Stuart Gordon (writer / director) writes for "Honei, I Shrunk the Kids", which broke the casino. However, this film had a serious financial support from Disney. Frankly, this is a good example when you do not have to make a movie. Had it been waiting for a few more years, technology would have made it cheaper to do many effects. (not to mention that he could find a company with money.)
