A terrific film that should be independent. It took some addiction to something. This totally miserable movie deals with interactions between Irish people. Did they try to mimic a wonderful movie "Crash?" If so, this film has completely collapsed. Too much is happening here, culminating with a little brother who runs around and throws stones into buses and cars that obviously cause disorder. The film is too exhausted to work. A woman loses her husband after 14 years in the other, while the younger sister is broken by a junior. This leads to the fact that the ex-nurse becomes a bitter beaver and walk in clothes that are not worth believing. The older sister also becomes outraged, but soon finds romance. Then we have 3 losers who buy masks to rob a bank. Apparently, the robbery goes wrong, but there seems to be no punishment for thieves. Perhaps the punishment should have been on the writers because of the failure to create a cohesive film.
