This superior inferiority to the original Blind Dead film is another garbage waste. So many people have uploaded these movies so I can not believe what they say about it. Since I was a kid, I heard that these films were terrifying and great, and I saw them all and disappointed me, were they all on drugs, since the 1970s or just do not know how boring this rough thing is?
