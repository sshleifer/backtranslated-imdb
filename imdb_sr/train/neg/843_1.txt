BDSM's "sub-culture" from Los Angeles serves as a background for this low-budget and shabby-built mess, apparently a piece of vanity for its best player, Celia Ksavier, who also produces scripts while performing a dual role as sister twins Vanessa and Celia. Soon the question arises as to whether a rather unreasonable camera, lighting and editing of pyrotechnics can reach a point of contact with a weak and often inconceivable narration that will not be taken seriously by the sensational viewer. Celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer in Los Angeles County, while her evil naturally twin has become an icon in her fetish world, mainly due to erotic performances on CD-ROMs, but when the catastrophe enters "Miss Vaness," the honorable Celia, determined to disclose her sister's evil assailant, she begins a new job as a "sexual slave" in a private court club where the dungeon's specialty is home-made. Two FBI agents in the field (whose deployment in the Vanesse case is allegedly necessary due to her participation in BDSM websites), were assigned to investigate the crime, alongside detectives for murder at the Los Angeles police station, while trying to provide Celia with enthusiastic performances in her new appointment, were deeply regarded by her clients that they created conditions for personal danger to her. Lack of logic and continuity in abundance, such as the murder granted to L.A.P.D. Operations-South Bureau, a metropolis region that's far from placing a movie. The direction is unfocused and not supported by improper post-production assembly and reproduction of sound. The mentioned photographic gymnastics culminates in montage near the film end of previous recordings, which is tangentially reference to the script. One solid move appears between this slug: Stan Abe as an enthusiastic FBI agent.
