I usually do not get out of the movie, but I'm halfway. This film promised something different, but I was constantly thinking whether I already saw it? Spoiler Alert! Returning to 1, the spacecraft crashes and land on the ground, well, all these years later, with a super-grown person on board, this thing still manages to burn and fall! What, this advanced civilization can not develop landing gear? For an industry that is so liberal, we can see another Voody Allen movie, no black ones, please! Superman is running around saving people, taking care to keep Europe and the United States, do not go in the dark areas please. Maybe I could try this 30 years ago, but now now.
