NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB and all other agencies in the world need to watch this movie to get information on how to spy people. (as MST3k comments ... "Sanitation has dirt on every one! Santa's tricks reach far and wide! There is no Claudius organization") From telescopes that can spy millions of miles to the ears that can all hear . It's amazing that the CIA does not have Santa Claus on the payroll. Satanic dance routine is hilarious. Pitch ... he's so useless. The cheese factor in this movie is enormous. Very low budget, but it's fun to watch. I recommend you to watch the version of Misteri Science Theater 3000 for even more laughter. Even you laugh at the accident of good children. I give this 1 to produce quality and 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.
