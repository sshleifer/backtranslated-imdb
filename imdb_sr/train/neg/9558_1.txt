I thought it was a continuation of some species, and that was supposed to be on the original from 1983. But the continuation is not the taking of the original plot and its destruction. this movie, but I only spent 95 minutes of life. There is no tension - I really feel clairvoyance, bad acting, and so full of technical errors, so as a computer geek I just could not believe it. They tried to make it a mixture of a generic war movie and 24 hours. But it is not even decent television low budget movie. Do not watch this movie, this is a complete waste of time. Instead, take the original. The topic is still valid. Do not allow much energy to enter the machine. Both the acting and the plot are far more enthusiastic.
