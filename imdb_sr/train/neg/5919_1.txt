I rented this movie yesterday and I can hardly express my disappointment in the little Laura Ingalls for inclusion in something so badly produced. I'm not sure whether it was terrible writing or bad directing or both, but it leaves the viewer very disappointed that it's wasted time to watch this device. It consisted of a bad naive line of stories, very bad lines, and relied exclusively on a pretty landscape, and nice people to sell it. Unfortunately, that was not enough. It would be better for you to rent a tape full of static than wasting time on this shit. Lindsey Vagner also played a rather pathetic role as the owner of the ranch who obviously works hard, not doing anything, anyone who has ever been close to the ranch knows that this was obviously written by a young person from Los Angeles, not someone who has much knowledge about the world.
