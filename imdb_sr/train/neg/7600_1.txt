This film proves that good action comes from a good direction and this does not happen in Ask dust. Colin Farrell is usually a good actor, but in this he is a minor. Donald Sutherland comes as an amateur. Why? Because the script is horrible, the adaptation is terrible and the actors look bored and half-hearted. The atmosphere of the movie is bad - I could only think when it would end and I turned it off half way. The director did a very bad job, and even though I did not read the novel, that's certainly a missed opportunity. The atmosphere that this film is trying to bring both message and story never reach the audience. In a word, it's a BEAUTIFUL movie.
