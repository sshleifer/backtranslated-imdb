I can not believe that the Indian film industry still puts that third rate like Vakt. To begin with, the story is completely incredible? the spoiled son is thrown out of the family home to teach him self-sufficiency. So what does he do? He immediately continues to win at some national talent competition by doing some jumps in front of the judges' session (I'm not sincerely joking here). In the meantime, his father dies of lung cancer, but keeps him secret from his son, but survives long enough to see his son who has become famous, to see his new grandson and to make a new toy giraffe with his hands. The action is touchingly decent in its hamminess ?? there was no effort to try and in any way convincingly act by any of the main players in this film. As usual for Indian films, the family lived in a huge villa and operated relatively untouched worries of the real world. Honestly speaking, the main losers when making such terrible movies are intelligent viewers who made a mistake watching such a movie. Actors, such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshai Kumar, will still be respected as Gods by people who have nothing but a blind faith in Bollivood.
