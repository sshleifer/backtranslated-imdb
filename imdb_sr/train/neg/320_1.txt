With Adam Sandler. This is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made. It's about Shell's shipwright (Sandler) who wants to be a comedian on board. First, there is no funny or smart line in the whole movie. It's so unbearable that it's pathetic. Unexpectedly, there is not much grudge or sexual humor, but f-word is abundant. The budget is really low, and it destroys the film too. It happens on board, but it seems that they only had the money to rent a small boat and that they only had money for 10 extras, one of which was Billy Bob Thornton. Initial loans are animated reallieeaalli inexpensive, and it's just pathetic. I hate this movie and all the others who see this will hate it. 86 minutes. rated R for Language.
