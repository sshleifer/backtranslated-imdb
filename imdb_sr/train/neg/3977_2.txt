The identical twin sisters Marie-Kate and Ashlee Olsen climbed to fame in a series such as "Tvo of a Kind", I never saw them before, but I had an idea of ​​what to expect, but it was much worse. Basically, Sisters Hunter (Mari-Kate) and Leila (Ashlei) are in Rome on a summer international program, but shortly after starting work they are immediately fired due to a series of accidents. But the man who owns the company in which he is working, Derek Hammond, returns their work, and they are slowly proven to be useful assets, and talented (fashion) artists, and help stop the man who takes over the business of the Company. Also starring Leslie Danon as Jami, Derek Lee Nikon as Rian, Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari, Archie Like Nobu, Valentina Mattolini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. You can say that this film was made to go directly to the video, working with cameras is completely incompatible, and it does not help when you want to admire the sights of Rome. In fact, the background is the only good thing to look at, twin sisters are two of the nicest celebrities, I knew before I watched that they would not be interested in me (even their beautiful ones), this is a horrible excrement of the movie. Pretty poor!
