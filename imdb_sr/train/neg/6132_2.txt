As a child, all my friends and I believed that Gimkata was the most imposing, bloody movie ever recorded. I'm not sure who started this rumor. She was probably born from the frustrations of 10-year-olds who could not see it for some reason. For years after Gimkata was released, it became a long-standing cable film late last night, and as a result, I managed to make up for the lost time. I must have seen the scene from this horrible pronunciation of the movie about a dozen times, and I can always see it with 1-2 seconds of the screen. However, apart from the forced connection of gymnastics and martial arts, poor synchronization, solid dialogue and unusually heavy stories, the film has some of the things to do. With everything that's bad about the movie, the sound is actually pretty fun. Never before had he had any blow or stroke with so little force and so much volume! The preserved kung-fu sounds are rude but slow and smooth music, and almost 5 minutes of slow motion scenes are really weird. The pursuit of a city of crazy, blood-thirsty villagers is not as tense as irritating, and there are enough bad wigs and statists who, besides looking at the camera and waving to make this wreck of the train entertain. Can it move towards a cult classic status? Where is MST3K when we need it?
