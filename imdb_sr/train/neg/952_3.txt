Happi Go Lovely is a waste of time and talent for all who involve the audience. The ease of the old hat of misidentified identity and false scandalous entangled lines is extremely apologetic. Very few people watched these films because of their complications. But, they usually had some interesting little signs that were included in subgroups - not here. They usually had interesting choreography and dance and stunning songs. Not happy Go Lovely. And Vera-Ellen as the female lead played the entire movie as another banana that desperately asked the star to play - and instead was called to carry the film, and she could not. The Scottish site is lost. Usually, the omnipresent Scots Scottish Capricorn is absent. The photo was pedestrian. Music numbers were pedestrian. Cesar Romero gives his usual professional performance, cheering on the scene as no one else did his part, in the kind of production role that was often written by Valter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is fine, and nobody could do David Niven like David Niven. At the end of the day, if you worship Niven like me, that's the reason for losing 90 minutes on Happi Go Lovely. If not, skip.
