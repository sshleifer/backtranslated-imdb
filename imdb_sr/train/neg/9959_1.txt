Cheap and manipulative. This movie has no heart. It also has an awesome dialogue, incontrovertible characters and absurd, that is, a non-existent story. It just hunts from bad to bad in a cynical attempt to dig up some kind of emotion from dishonest and unengging hysteria-afest! I HEDGEHOG !!!! How much inexpensive footage can film? By the way, hedgehog has given the most convincing and most ambitious performance in this ninety minute crowd. If you've been thinking about watching this movie, do not. I'm sorry, but I can not find any function for this movie. He has a big, fat ZERO with me. Strictly for sub-dogma humidifiers. Iavnerooni! Still, if you liked Dancing In The Dark ... <br /> <br />
