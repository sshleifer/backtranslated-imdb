Although this film was created before Dogme appeared as the dominant film shooting method, and before the digital triumph, he did it. You understood the point. This masterpiece from 1991 clearly envisaged these events. Korin Nemec is outstanding because he should not be an author and narrator. The pace is slow, but elegant, because the cinema is so beautiful. Take it next time on T.V., because I guarantee you will never see a better nostalgic movie made for T.V. Direct video has never been so good!
