As an occasional listener to Rolling Stones, I thought this might be interesting. Not so, as this film is very "its era," in the sixties. For me (someone born in the 1980s), this seems like a hippie purist propaganda shit, but I'm sure this film was not made for me, but for people who were active during the sixties. I expected drugs from the stones, I was disappointed, actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, I felt so much like working with them to reach the conclusion of this terrible film. I have not seen any other directors of other films, but I guess they follow a similar style of directing, somehow "amateurish" who gave the feeling that the Eurotrash TV show, poorly directed, trimmed and lacking was a real fun value. My only good opinion of this is that I did not spend money on it, I came free with weekly newspapers.
