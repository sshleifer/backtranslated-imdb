The London boring Henri Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emili Hill) receive an advance on inheritance. They use money to travel. Their lives are getting more exciting when they start relationships with exotic Betti Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Mrs. Barrie). But they remain boring as before. The director of the boring Alfred Hitchcock is trying to revive the well-titled (as stated in the film, from Shakespeare's "Storm") "Rich and Strange" ordering some tricks of the camera. Honored King King Vidor "The Crovd" is the highlight. The lowest point can be a dish of steaming on a Chinese prepared cat. *** Rich and Weird (12/10/31)
