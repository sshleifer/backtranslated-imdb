First of all, this is a teenage movie - Spam-In-A-Cabin genre, as Joe Bob Briggs sparkly said. (NB: A spoiler warning, such as this!)) First of all, this is a teenage movie - Spam-In-A-Cabin genre. If you are looking for Roshambo, that's not it and it will not be BEZ. I am not desperately impressed with stabbing in cinema, directing or acting. Second, it was not the first Zurigin movie of horror, it was the period of the first appearance on the screen, cinema, TV, anything. For what is worth; neither Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon nor Katherine Hepburn. Third, you have to give even the chrome props for the brushes. Of course, she follows the deeply offensive formulatory message of her genre: every young woman who has or shows interest in sex is beef on the hoof, and the time of harvest is now. Apart from giving this a sweet, virgin protagonist! Now there is a central teen film about death that has the courage of your beliefs! Interestingly, it is said that ingenue is the only film role. Another miracle, except that the term gives too much credit. (Then, this film probably has one of the greatest percentages of actors from a single film in history. Of the nineteen accredited actors, the Incredible Thirteen never appeared in any other movie, three appeared in someone else's movie by the same producers, and only one of Zuniga has six screen points: What was it, the Mutual Assistance Society? Permitted, I've seen this on a cable night cabin a long time ago when I was bored and never I did not expect to be bored again, but I do not see the difference I want to catch everyone involved and throw them into the incinerator with Joanne. 2/10.
