I grew up (1965) watching and I love Thunderbirds. All my friends at school were watching. We played "Thunderbirds" before school, during lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. No one wanted to be Alan. Refusal of 5 has become a form of art. I took my children to see a movie in the hope of getting an insight into what I like as a child. How bitterly disappointing. The only highest point was a strong themed melody. Not that it can be compared with the original Thunderbird score. Luckily early Saturday morning, one television channel continues to replay the series created by Gerri Anderson and his wife. Jonatha Frakes should surrender to the director's chair, his version was completely hopeless. Losing a movie. Totally trash. Remek CGI may be acceptable but to replace puppets with Homo sapiens subsp. Sapiens was a big mistake in judging.
