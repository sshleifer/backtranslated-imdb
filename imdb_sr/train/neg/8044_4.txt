Well, I watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now I took it out of the dusty shelves to watch it again and I have to say, actually I think this movie is good. This movie caught buzz like a bootleg I know what you did last summer 3, just like Final Stab was Scream 4, and well this movie is not that bad. I think he had disadvantages and of course it would be funny to post this in cinemas, but for midnight popcorn, this movie is not half bad. There are some fears and some very hot women that I could add. In addition, he shows the new look of Joe Lavrence, although he obviously did not even make any major Hollywood roles ... I feel bad for a man, he had such a career in the early and mid-nineties with blooming, Some Disney movies and eternal brothers Lavrens show ... Joei Lavrence was a little player in the sitcom scene, but then like at 360 degrees, his career went south only by working low-budget films like this one. The film also rejects you, you seem to think among the crew, there is really a secret that somebody knows, in the end, they will disappoint only to discover the secret. It also throws you to who the killer was, I had an idea, but I would not think that the killer was the one who was, but his motives combined with the secret were a huge disappointment. Was there a secret that was released? This movie could have been one of the better movies. But I'm a fool for college topics, and I also went to college for a break at a beach house house that was similar to that in the house, so I felt sentimental about this movie. And so-so dash. Good for midnight movie.
