It's not exactly a new story line, but this romantic comedy makes the concept a concept. John Cusack and a beautiful woman (Kate Beckinsale) accidentally meet and wonder if they are meant for each other. Though both are promised to others ... It's strange that they still feel their soul is somewhere there. A little suspicious in some places, but viva la love. Since I am romantic, I am almost obliged to be concealed. My favorite scene is where the Cusack on the ground and snow begins to fall. The finale is almost too cute, but most deserving. This is not one of Cusack's deeper roles, but Beckinsale could not have been hit in hell. Significant support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen. On the other hand, Eugene Levi is strange and fun. Look at this with a soul mate.
