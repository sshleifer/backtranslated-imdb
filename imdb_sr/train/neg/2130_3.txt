I suppose I'm late for a party. I just saw this version of the 1995 Bie Bie Bird on Ski TV. I did not know it existed and I was completely ready to look at the 1963 movie version when I turned it on. I played Albert long ago and I'm thinking about amateur production because I remember it as so much fun. I was not impressed with a newer version. It was just not fun enough. It was not colorful. There was a lack of youthfulness. Lighting was bad. No one seems to have mentioned that fact. This is not a musical, it's great and good. The lighting decision was a poor creative choice. Bie Bie Birdi is a Farce, a comedy of errors. I do not make any sense in this version. The lighting was terrible and it weakened overall performance. And the dance numbers seemed anemic. Today we have music videos. At least the dance numbers should be scanned to some of the best of them, or to say some of the best on Broadway. The choreographer slept behind the wheel as it seemed. Although all the actors were extremely talented, there were some really bad choices. Vanessa Villiams is not Latin, and with so many talented Latin artists, would not it be right to cast one of them as Rosie? Vanessa is an African American, lovely and talented, but poor. Jason Alekander's effort was astounding, he always worked intelligently, but it was simply not Albert. He was wrong and I think it's most of the people who see this version obviously. Film film is not the stage medium. It needs to be translated from one medium to another. The abundance and flash of the scenic musical must be translated into a movie. It does not make sense to be a true scenario scenario when it's filmed. Spirit, the essence of production must be stated. For me, the 1963 Bie Bie Birdi film production was brilliant and vibrant, while the 1995 production was as brilliant as lighting and glittering as dance numbers. It turned out to be an unfortunate loss of effort by many truly talented people.
