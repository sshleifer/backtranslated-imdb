What can I say? I love movies about sweets and go out of my way to watch a dashing action, but Snake Eater would rather have a nail in my hole until my grandmother gave me a dancing in her lap. this guy has so many acting skills as Bill Clinton has self-control. She has everything she can do with a bad movie worse. Crazed Hillbilles IEP! unnecessary shot of a tit (with a real weird scar) IEP! crappi soundtrack IEP! I wish I could give a movie -10 stars, but 1 is as low as it goes. I seriously think that someone played a joke on me when I saw that it can not be real ...... the upside there is 2MORE SNAKE EATER MOVIES! ...... guess your demand.
