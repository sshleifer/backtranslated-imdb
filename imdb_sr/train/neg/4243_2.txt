The most entertaining scene of this film is probably when our lifeguards receive their medals and plaques and the like. So, the basic idea is that the police outperform these gangsters by one million, but they are helpless because the pistols of the villains are just a little higher. I guess the police ammunition just bounced. They decided to film this documentary-style documentary with fake interviews and everything seriously, what's wrong with those guys? They say they're armed with newspapers. Well, I admit, it's probably still dangerous to be on the line of fire, even when the situation is in your favor, but do not crazy. And why, to hell, it took 44 minutes to get rid of everything? I'd say it's been a very long time when you surrounded them and you are allowed to shoot. They are like ten feet away, do not hit absolutely anything. Then they go and buy bigger weapons to increase their hero. And then, yes, here it is, one of the policemen actually hits someone. The bullet was probably redirected by the lamp or something like that. I guess I was laughing a little.
