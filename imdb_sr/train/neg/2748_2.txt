this film gets only the second star because I'm working in the city center and I loved seeing it destroyed. The effects were pretty good - I hear it was the most expensive Korean film ever made. Being the most expensive and still absolutely horrible, it makes it a huge loss of money. I rented it so that I would not overly regret what I paid, but it took a couple of hours that I would never return. abundant cavities. horrible acting on all sides. I do not recommend giving up watching this movie, life is too short. If your friends want to watch this, escape. I can not emphasize enough how bad this film was. Where the hell did the second dragon come in? why did not he show up before? how did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs just 500 years ago?
