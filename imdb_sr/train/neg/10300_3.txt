I am a fan of art films, but unfortunately I have to report this film to be pretentious. Agonizingly slowly developing non-existent plots based on a promising premise, the experience is, so to speak, trying. Even after bad movies, I feel like learning something, or enjoying some aspect, but I have nothing to appreciate there. The premise was not uninteresting, but the film begins and ends there. The acting was fine, although the characters were quite boring. In order for the protagonist to focus on such a goal, she is very empty. A pity. I usually enjoy movies that are informal, but the lack of a formula should not be mixed with zero content.
