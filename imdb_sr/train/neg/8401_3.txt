After I saw this on TMC, it's fresh in my head. It is obvious that while the puppets are prominent stars, they do not actually run a show. First, they are divided into 2 groups - Moe, like "Shorti" and Larry and Curley as a pair of rogues, so there is not much work in the team. The love story that triggers the action is uninteresting, the two ladies are the only ones who have any acting skills, there is another group of music boomers who are lonely, unless you consider their attempts to be funny to be sad. Music is tiring, driving cars to the ranch, and then dependent on the horse, the western western clothes are stupid, and there's also a terrible lot of cameraless cameras. Otherwise, this is obvious after Curley's first stroke, and his reduced energy level is clear. Vernon Dent appears early in an accredited role. I loved everything these guys ever did, including all things that were not Curlei, but this little dog is pretty bad.
