I saw this film at Edmonton International Film Festival, with a great dr. Almost Boll. The film is, simply said, very, very bad. And no, not in the usual Uwe Boll "so bad it's actually fun", but just bad. The action refers to a man who leads a terrible life (because of the previous criminal record, obviously), can not get a job, and a horrible husband of 900 pounds. This man turns to his uncle of the cult leader in a plan to steal a toy truck containing bird flu virus. Al Qaeda also has ideas about toy toy, and what follows is a little less than two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence. The act is terrible (except for Dave Foley, who is really trying, despite all this, jokes never rise above children who are killed in the chest slow motion, and people take whores. It should be a satire, but I'm not sure what to do. Think about "Airplane!", but it was made by the South Park creators and without a joke.
