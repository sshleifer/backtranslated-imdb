As a spiritualist and non-Christian. I thought that I would really keep my faith, but what kind of burden I see. I thought the film would have great arguments, but it only got unilateral views from the Ateista and the Jews ??? And who are all those people from the street that he interviews and who do not know that their head is from their head. Where are theologians and priests and the things from which he could have arguments? Non-retired partners who wrote books and completed their studies in 1970. Personally, this DVD was a waste of time and it's not worth my time to check if the facts are right or wrong or if I should or should not believe because the antichrist has told me so. Please think that he came to the conclusion that he did not find God because his own ego and demons got better than him. I will not say that the film was stunning to help atheists read what is best for them. But if you really want to show the world that you care about us, the poor souls who believe in Jesus then attract us with their value, not your drumsticks.
