A young professor of basketball-based genetics to investigate the genetic sequence using human fetuses. He hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He is forced to complete his research because he did not publish it, so the university has difficulty justifying financing (I think). Then he is trying on it. The relationship with the single mother of an extremely boring boy begins; she was the one who demanded the results of the research. Initially, there seems to be no effect from the injection, except some new strength. He then realized that he had some loss of memory and began to reconsider what had happened. In addition, it starts to look very unhealthy. Since the film is called metamorphosis, it eventually changes into something else. You will not believe in your own eyes-nothing to turn into, or to the absolutely crazy costume the actor carries to show what he's turned into. Unbelievably, there is another change in the warehouse - the end of the movie is really, really absurd. Very small part. Once I saw a video box for this with a plastic mold on the lid. Perhaps at some point he may have had some electronics, maybe the eyes that illuminated it (the eyes of the protagonist occasionally become green in the film). The copy I was looking for had a box that showed only traces of tears where the glue was holding the plastic that was removed. A newspaper box, if it still had, would be the only reason I would hold this film; I definitely get rid of it.
