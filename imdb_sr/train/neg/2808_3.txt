A guest star of the 1980s television and television series (Misty Rove, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seimour Cassel among several others) in a story about a photographer who dreams of killing his models. Of course, models and other people are starting to appear dead by causing all kinds of complications. Too not quite a good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get R rating, but not enough good material to provoke any real interest. This is best described as a movie that Cinemak gave the alternative name Skinamak to the cable channel. I really do not see the point of seeing this, unless you need to see every thriller there later. (I must also say that this film is filled with smoking, to the extent that it becomes ridiculous when someone starts up)
