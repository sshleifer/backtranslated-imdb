SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I watched half this film and I do not like it. The first reason: boring. Barely nothing happens, women sit and talk about how their lives are terrible and have no hope, smoke grass, read magazines, take care of a sick friend, and cut off an occasional dead body. Another reason: Too many things remained unexplained. Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men, keeps them on a chair and examines them. Who are these people? How do they know something about illegal activities involving eating disorders? Why does he kill one and let another one? Also, there is this guy who initially thought that flesh was eating a disease, but he puts his fist through a wall with superhuman power that suggests that it is not exactly what we originally thought - it was never explained ! How frustrating is this? Conclusion: Women are boring, the story is uninteresting, the duo is boring, and the action does not exist. Also, the cover page is wrong because it says you believe that this movie will be cool when it's obviously not. I rented this movie based on some reviews by other people on this site, and although I appreciate the fact that some people could enjoy this movie, from now on I will take care to read more than two reviews deep into the film to avoid renting another movie for which I regret.
