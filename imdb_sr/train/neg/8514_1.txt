I'm giving this film ONE, because it's a really horrible movie. The soundtrack on the DVD is so bad that I actually hurt my ear. But the vision, no matter how unconnected, shows something real in Italian society. I will not go into details what actually was so shocking, but different incidents are absolutely abnormal. So, for the kink value, I give it one. Otherwise, video, photography, acting actors / actresses are simply substandard, practical athletes who like foreign movies. Roberto, the main character, has a full spectrum of emotions, but exaggerated to such an extent that they are incredible. However, children in the film are mostly 3/4 years of age, and they are authentic and the film provides an insight into Italian life.
