It is necessarily a funny movie version of the literary classic "Mobi Dick". John Barrimore is Captain Ahab, who falls in love with the pastor's daughter, Joan Bennett. His brother Derek is a rival for Mrs Bennet's affection. When G. Barrimore loses his leg in the whaling accident, Bennett rejects him. He must kill whales and conquer Bennetta back ... There are several scenes that may have thrilled the 1930 theater audience; especially the scenes where Barrimore lost his leg. The film, however, did not grow old; there are many better films from that time, both quiet in the 1920s and the sounds of the 1930s. Two attractions, John Barrimore and Joan Bennett are not the best. <br /> <br /> **** Mobi Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrimore, Joan Bennett
