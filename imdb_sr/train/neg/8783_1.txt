I do not think I've ever been so preoccupied with the nonsense of a movie in my life as I was when I got out of this shit. Nothing makes any sense in that. None of this is wise or well thought out. because of the lack of genuinely uncertain moments, they repeatedly use this total cop-out trick, where you built music before the character does something like opening a door or pushing into the side of the curtain and then nothing is there. It's okay to do it once, maybe, but I counted three times. there are things inserted for no reason, characters, semi-formed stories .... the characters were not well developed on ALL. The end was bad. bad, bad, bad, everything, every component of this movie is terrible. and I'm just here to warn you about all this.
