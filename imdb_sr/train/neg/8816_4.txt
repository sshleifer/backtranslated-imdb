I saw Mom ... well, she did not really love Santa; she has a hand on her thigh and wicked thoughts in mind. It was enough to emotionally scarce a young boy who wanted to believe. He grew up as a bitter man who was upset with the quality of the toys and the lack of a Christmas spirit. Expecting the right shot, I was very disappointed that less than a handful of people are dying, and there was no nudity at all. What a pity. I wanted to like this movie, but it was too slow and really did not have a good scenario. I did not expect great acting, but I wanted some action. It just was not.
