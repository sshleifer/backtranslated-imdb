This is probably one of the worst French movies I've ever seen, among more than 100 French films I've ever seen. A terrible script and a very mediocre / unprofessional action causes helplessness of directing. With all this it does not matter how beautiful a Western French scene and fancy music can contribute to the story. One of the key weaknesses of this film is that these two characters do NOT attract people, the audience I do not care what's going to happen to them. I was astounded at how this film won the jury award in Cannes, man, I like almost all rewarded films in Cannes, but not this one. Great disappointment for me.
