This could be incredible, but this film earned $ 878,138 in Russia! It is featured in almost all movie theaters and is still working! Well, I have no idea why distributors are looking at this "movie", which had almost no projection around the world. It's kind of an enigma! Ha-ha! Perhaps this is based on the fact that another movie, "Pledge This" with Paris Hilton, which was also published just about a DVD almost everywhere, had big projections in Russia and earned more than $ 1 million. In addition, both films have had many promotions, such as banners all over the city, TV commercials and the like. Speaking about the movie, I would say it's boring and completely boring. It could be better, really. Even if she has Jessica Simpson.
