This film is like S.E. material. Hinton wrote in the 1970s and Copola adapted to the screen in the early 1980s, and Trueblood was the product of one or the other, the results may have been much better (especially in the acting department). Instead, we get a pretty bad, funny piece of mediocrity. Jeff Fahei plays Rai Trueblood, a former street crowd, I suppose this is the exact description. It was in the days of action movies used by boys in their 40s and 30s and dressed in fatty threads or some kind of more feminine gang selection and fought for the bad music of the 80s. Nevertheless, Rai is the lonely guardian of his younger brother, Donny (Chad Love in a screaming part), whom he is forced to leave behind inexplicably at the railway station when he is caught in the escape of the cops. and forced to serve time in the Marines. Flash forward to this day, and Rai returned to the city and asked his brother who also became part of the street gangs, although he was in the gang that was Rai's opponent and now the old results must be forcibly placed (and again, policemen have to be avoided. and this time, the honor of the lady defends in terms of action movie) before Rai can continue his life with a normal step with his brother, Donnie. The film is mostly funny. For me, most of this has to do with excessive threat, although not by Fahei or Sherlin Fenn, who plays a waitress who is a fidgeter. Guys in the gang and Love itself seem to be doing excessively unnecessarily excessively, as in New York. Although, a larger downhill is a recycled plot line and maybe some kind of movie that has passed its climax as a product from 1989.
