ORCA is not very bad, but not the best hour of Richard Harris. As crazy, fisherman Ahab, Harris enters the game of death with a devious whale killer after killing his whale's "wife" and unborn child. Charlotte Rampling plays a Whale Expert who interacts with Harris. He is very much shouting about how important it is to leave nature in peace. He does not listen and ends up in some sort of arctic battles with a vengeful whale. There are no special effects that can be said, except what looks like a round mirror for the whale's eye - there are endless Harris images reflected in the eye so that the audience realizes that the whale knows who he is. Bo Derek, as one of Harris' team members, has a particularly unpleasant performance with Ork, and most of the auxiliary actors, including Robert Carridine, Villa Sampson and Keenan Vinn, are also not well.
