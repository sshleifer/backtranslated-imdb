For this review, a list of good points and bad points. I'll start with a bad one. Bad things: Casting choices (especially Burt Reinolds as Boss Hogg), dealing with bad selection of film, story, the idea of ​​putting the movie in modern times, direction, editing, soundtrack, and above all, the whole idea creating a feature film from a television series that was not so good to start Good things: Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ............ that's it! It can be made On a scene where Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke breaks up to Michael Weston as Enos, and raises the question: "Enos, where is Boss Hogg and Roscoe?", in her obscene opinion, tells her where are they. maybe he also asked: "Enos, is this a good movie?", the red bikini would blur his mind to say that, although he would say in a healthy head: "No, not really." while she watched the bikini, she could have been naked, and even this would not save this terrible film work. Stay from Hazzard!
