I think it's time for Seagal to quietly go to bed at night. What I've just watched seems to be that all his direct videos in the past few years look like hits of the early 90s in comparison. The secret of a laboratory was a new type of drug that drives the adrenaline system to such an extent that they become psychopathic killers or something like that. Somehow Seagal should stop the infection or its end ... or something like that. Seagal also went through the hit skuads like jellibeans, every time I looked, he commanded a new face, so it was difficult for me to follow the development of character. are they repeatedly called by people who do not sound anything like him? Usually, movie actions and action sequences can be saved from being a total waste of time, but it was not even close. As I said, it was more a horror movie with a lot of blood and sting, not exactly in the fight. The problem was that it was not so scary and Seagal looked completely unwise because the infected people should have the speed of light, but 40 years old 280 lg Seagal killed himself? I guess the lonely peak of the film was the first 20 minutes when the new recruits asked Seagal to come to the strip club with them. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
