I am a big fan of John Reitman - I loved Evolution and who did not like Ghostbusters? You already know from the trailer that Umin's character will be discarded by Luke. So the construction is obvious at the moment when she releases her superpowers on her. (mild) giggles, but again, everything was in the trailer. with a constricted smile until your cheeks begin to crack. This is a comedy, is not it? It's not terrible - just sit there like a staggering cracker behind the fridge. can save the last name.
