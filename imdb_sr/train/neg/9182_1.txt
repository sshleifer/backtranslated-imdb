Just as everyone said, the acting is terrible, there is no story, or in general, poorly directed. As far as SFKS is concerned, the 360-degree, matrix-style recording, 1 shot is stupid enough, but for each character. I mean, give me a break. And what about all these video game scenes, just to remind us that this is "video game adaptation"? Jesus, they should have fired anyone who thought this idea. 0.00001 / 10
