I must say that many people have claimed that some of us have to get over time because the new film "Dukes" is a modernized version. Let me beg you. If that's what you consider modernized, Hollivood can keep it. Many people on the MSN site also said that (and quote) "You, old fogy, you need to cross over it and besides it as it is." Let me tell you something, I'm 24, so I'm far from being an old FOGIE, and I'm not going to get over it, it was unrecognizable for everything that is a landscaped county. The only thing in the movie was "HAZZARD". Did all the curses, smoking and drinks be necessary? The actor was terrible. Jessica was on a couple of morning shows to talk about the movie and honestly believe that all this went to her head. She is not in any case Daisy Duke, maybe by chance, but definitely not Duke. I love Sean Villiams Scott, but not like Bo. It should have included the original role as bar cameos, but even Hollivood knew that he would not approve the script. I think that even today's actors and actresses express a negative opinion, so why some of you give positive comments.
