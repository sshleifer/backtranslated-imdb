I wanted to vote zero or lower. I loved the comment. It's the worst movie ever made and 'unbearable' is the perfect word for it, unless there is something worse Roget never thought. I am also in doubt that I think anything negative enough to accurately describe Bo Derek. The best thing to say about her is, she is consistent.
