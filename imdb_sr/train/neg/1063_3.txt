The idea is good. Bringing so many stars into one movie is great. But .... too many stories, too short and without any sense. There's no connection between the scenes. There were some 3-4 brilliant stories ... but this was one of 18. The frame reminded me of "All Invisible Kids" - a movie that I liked very much. Compared to him, however, "Paris Je T'Aime" has no intriguing short story, which is developing - it begins and ends. There is a topic that links everything to children. I do not find that Paris is enough to connect 18 short sketches. Perhaps for people who know Paris interesting. Otherwise I would not recommend ...
