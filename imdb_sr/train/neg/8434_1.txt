This film showed racial hatred toward Jews from David Mammoth than I ever saw in an American film. Sterotypes are so much above the top that my ability to keep watch is dead. I was so disappointed with Joe. Mantegna called a group of people sitting in the New York Jewish Weapons Clearing Center. I'm deeply disturbed by the concept that Jews are not Americans and "different." I suggest that Mr. Mamet is one of the causes of hatred, not the healer of the same.
