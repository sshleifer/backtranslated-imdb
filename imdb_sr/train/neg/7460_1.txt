Corki Romano must be one of the most horrifying and horrifying "comedies" ever made. While sometimes funny Chris Kattan who pulled out a very funny performance in a hilarious "secret brother" his character in Cork is so dumb and so clumsy - which is a shame because the premise is a wonderful idea. They are bad when they reached the third party of the script.
