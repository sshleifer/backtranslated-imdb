In a recent movement that brings Asian movies to America, this is the LAST film that should be published here. Since I'm a big fan of Asian movies from all genres, I browse the internet and come across it to be re-released on the US market, so I decided to check it in advance and rent it in a local video. br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> > <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> > <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> > <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> > <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> > <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> Jet Li would fall asleep watching combat sequences. If you are looking for a fun martial arts, your time would be better with Jackie Chan flick! More ... you think you will be watching martial arts with a girl who swallowed wenge for your parents of death OR SURPRISE !!! A good hour of this film in the middle is filled with dialogue, absence of action, lack of disclosure of a tangential action, almost nothing that has nothing to do with the premise we are exposed to. It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, and the boy with his entrapped group in which the producer / director did not devote enough time to the elaborate, yet he devoted a part of the film to the troubleshooting. It would be much better if you would just shorten that watch and develop a story in yourself through another movie and focus on the aspect of martial arts. When we are already in this, I really do not believe in the choreographer of Iron Monkeys, he has done an action sequence in the Princess Blade. I was completely offended by the frequent use of slow-motion images and rapid camera modifications to show the physical speed of the killers. I just did not buy it. Please ... I warn you to MOLIM do not waste time / money with this movie. The premise is intriguing, and the trailer may even have tried it, but I'm sure this film is NOT suitable for the audience (maybe in Japan, but not in the countries) and that the worst movie will be brought from Asian Asian countries. industry.
