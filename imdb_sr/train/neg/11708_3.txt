it explodes how this movie was shot. I watched him while I was working at home by writing emails and answering the phone - I just watched him because I was hoping that a part of the "revenge" would be good. it is superfluous to say that revenge and forced embezzlement were not worth the e-mails they were watching. In fact, I'm not even sure what happened at the end. the performance was as bad as the "FBI Files" re-recording scenarios - far, the worst re-enactments (really just "arrest and trial" can be so bad on re-actions). I did not even know that the main man was in the Third Eye until I looked at the IMDb movie here, but it's obvious why he had not made a single film ever since. I hope he's a good singer.
