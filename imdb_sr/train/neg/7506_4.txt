Good actors and good performances can not disguise a meaningless letter, bad dialogue and patterns of behavior that turn into anything you care about. The most interesting figure is David Berkovitz. There is no development of character - there is no growth, no interest, only some suffering for no particular reason, nothing teaches us, nor does it take care of entertainment.
