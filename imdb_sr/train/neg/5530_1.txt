Of the many problems with this film, the worst is continuity; and having processed it on VHS for college channels many years ago, I tried to figure out exactly what went wrong. It seems that it happened that they actually made a much longer film and then cut it off for standard theater viewing. How long? to fill all the holes in the plot, as it was, it takes another three hours of narrative and visual development - especially given the fact that the film we have is so slow and taken so seriously. It's amazing; What could Halperini try to achieve here? Their previous film, "The White Zombie", was a successful attempt at a low budget to duplicate early Universal Studios monstrum films (Mummy, Dracula, etc.), and as such stuck close to the zombie mythology that North Americans would know from popular magazines. The rebellion of zombies, on the contrary, seems to have been conceived as a kind of allegory for the politics of modern warfare. This not only explains the opening, but also the change in the character of Dean Jagger in megalomania, but also explains why zombies do not actually do much in the movie, except that they stand around, they look scary and wait for orders - only Allegory soldiers, not the undead cannibals which we all loved and despised in zombie movies. I am equal to everyone in my dislike of modern war and his politics - but I think the movie should be fun first, and only later, perhaps, educational. And definitely - a movie about zombies should be about zombies. Indeed, one of the most colorful films in Hollywood history, but not the one I can recommend, even because of the historical value.
