The first time I saw a Vendi Vu advertisement, I was definitely excited. Brenda Song, one of the hottest girls on Disney Channel, would have been fighting martial arts, and that's good ... until I saw a movie. The action was poorly constructed, the film could not be compared to anyone, the fight was unrealistic and exhausted ... along with the plot. If you really think it's Vannabe Buffy the killer of a vampire, a girl who is a descendant of other warriors who were women, the girl wants to ignore her call and wants to become the queen of return home, an observer who prepared her for a great fight against an ancient evil. The idea was simply not so original, the film is a waste of time.
