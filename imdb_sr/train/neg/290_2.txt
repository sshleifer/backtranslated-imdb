Movies "Killer Tomatoes" have a special kind of humor - either you love it or you hate it. I like this personally, but in this fourth movie, the feeling is gone. Tomatoes are not the same, jokes are silly, even actors are not so funny. Because it's the only thing that these types of movies should be - funny. Now, following complications made to laugh, is boring. Really should not do the fourth part of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.
