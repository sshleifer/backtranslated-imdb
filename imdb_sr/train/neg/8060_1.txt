What a bad, bad movie! I tried to watch without a quick transfer ... It did not work. After about 30 minutes I stopped the movie, online to see how long this disaster is. (Only 84 minutes, Vhev!) It was a confusing, boring movie. I do not think anyone can be knocked down by hitting him with a fluorescent bulb that's a lot smaller! One funny thing is that I watched "The Killer Cut" version of the movie. The box boldly says "More Blood!" "More sex!" "More terror from theatrical release!" Iikes! If this film was terrible with all these claims, I wonder how "Stormy Killer" was? If you want to see a great movie about the world of the living and the world of the dead, watch any of the series of Night of the Living Dead !!
