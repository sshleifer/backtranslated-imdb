I bought this $ 5 movie in a good bin in my local video for only one reason, Chase Masterson, but I should have smashed five, threw it in the toilet and washed it. The film talks about a crowd of twenty people who reached a peak in high school and reunited themselves at the anniversary of the death of their idiotic friends, who got drunk and lost their way in the woods and died. There is a problem that hunted monster hunts one by one. The acting is hopeless, these worthless people are obviously rejected on shows such as 90210 and Davsons Creek. The director was at the level of a twelve-year-old, and the script was probably done by a thirteen-year-old. The whole set looks like someone's yard in Malibu. The people who praised this movie are obviously friends of directors and / or actors. Avoid this bunch of garbage at ALL costs.
