this film was not what I expected. If this movie was named something else, no one would notice the difference between these two films. It's really weird because I do not see the point. we just say that they do not make sense, they do not even match. I may be na√Øve, but I did not vol 1 and vol 2 meant to match. Carlito was in jail in the first and dies in the original, and pre-school lives and does not go to prison. The action was fine, but it had to be changed around some actors and some stories and the name of the film, and that would be a good movie. I really expected it to end like the others. If someone has an opinion on this post, please.
