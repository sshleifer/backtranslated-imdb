I saw this movie last night after many good reviews from many sources. I would like to point out that if you are not ready to try and constantly develop who is who and what it means you will hate this movie. I'm still struggling to understand the role of actors in this movie, the movie jumps from different stories and does not allow you to truly sympathize with any of the roles. probably quite good, but the average movie viewer this film is inconvenient, very boring in places, and you will leave the cinema confused and upset that you paid the ticket. 100% for every detail detail or policy you are interested in. You do not see if you really like to watch movies.
