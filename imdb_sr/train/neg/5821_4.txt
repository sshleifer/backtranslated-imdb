As others noticed, this should have been a great Hammer-style movie, and it seems to me that so many actors have been given the task of playing ... but the script is so lead, poorly baked and filled with a lot of boring solilokvia (the poor Timothy Dalton is burdened by most of them) that everything is too exaggerated and self-important. This is a non-characteristic poor performance of Dalton, although it quietly touches the top scene in which Dr. Rock finally realizes what he did. The only actor who works well is Patrick Stevart, who is welcome. Freddie Francis may have been a great cameraman, but he was a bad director.
