This is one of those films that I remember that I was in the cans for years before anything happened. I do not think it's terrible, but it's not good either. Alec Baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is at best bad. Actors are pretty good at what they are given, but you're good again only from the scripts. Baldwin directed this, although I could swear that he did not direct it all, I thought I read somewhere or that a lot of repeated videos were bad, but he definitely has some potential there. Although his work on the film "30 Rock" is no less ingenious and should be kept for a little longer. I just hope that the show is going to get a wonderful exit from La Seinfeld, but maybe not even that long. 9 years have passed. So, if you want to see a movie from which you will not get much, but you will not hate it or this is for you. I can not remember when the last time the film was so wrapped up that it was finally released on DVD only. It was nice to see Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins again together, as their excellent, but not many people saw "The Edge." Now take a great movie for real fun.
