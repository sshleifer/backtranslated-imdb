This film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the forest. One of the friends caught a terrible virus that eats meat. Suddenly, friends turn to each other in a desperate attempt to refrain from illness. For one, she tries to be more genres at once. Should this be a homage, a slasher, a black comedy, or an intimidating movie with unintentional comedy? Nobody knows. At first it's a serious scene and a second shift, that's ridiculous. When a movie tries to be fun, humor is pretty mild, excepting the end. I loved the end. But apart from the end, I was pretty disappointed and horrified. Violence is devastating-worthy, more looking away from the screen than frightened. The tone changes within each scene, sometimes ridiculous, sometimes intimidating, and sometimes quite accidental. In fact, you see a girl doing karate in slo-motion. What should we get from it? That same girl would catch one of the characters. Was it supposed to be funny? I do not know. Some of the performances were decent, and many were fairly amateurish. I did not care for most of the characters. I liked the plot, but the execution was terrible. As a horror movie, I did not know what it was trying to be. I did not consider him funny, tense, or terrible. In the end, you remain indifferent, thinking: "What have I just been through?" Unfortunately, you will never know the answer to this question.
