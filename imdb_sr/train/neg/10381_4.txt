A trulder who bothered home found an American family who moved to a 200-year-old house in Japan, where a violent murder took place. The new setting is the only element of interest in this very slow horror run by Motel Hell Director. The film generates zero uncertainty and consists of slightly tense scenes that rarely seem to have water. One obvious example is the pretty early scene in which the male leader visits the temple after he realized that his house was cursed, as the monk had previously warned. The monk narrates the history of the house (which the viewer has already introduced from the introductory series), and then the film simply cuts off something else. Earlier, the monk offered help. Well, where's the help? The family continues to stay in a house that is haunted until things get worse and worse, and did not mention the monk until the very end when he appears again to do what he was supposed to do an hour earlier - try to drive the ghost from home, though At this moment, viewers are hard to worry about. There are some (probably) unintentional laughs in the sense that American actors eventually became obsessed with Japanese ghosts and suddenly I start to work poor martial arts, I say probably because the scene more than a bit resembled the duel of a chain saw from the Motel Hell of the same director who obviously should have been fun, but in general this is a forgetfulness.
