Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but funny to play it as a romantic lead. The fact that he dances so well, so he sings effectively, and throws himself into a part so completely somehow, made him look even more creepy. In his more feline moments (with a girl at the train station, in the final issue with Rosie), I could not take my eyes off him, he was so repulsive. You always expect to drop the stupid guy and start running. Vanessa Villiams was a real star, the only show that was better than the 1963 film. Otherwise, if you see the production of a scenic musical, a 1963 movie, and a 1995 movie, you will see three versions that have more revisions (different songs, the same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other music I've ever seen.
