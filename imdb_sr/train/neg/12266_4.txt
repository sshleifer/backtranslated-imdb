Images of the Republic come late in the game on the "Werewolf" and the Verecat genre. The plot has a writer who returns to Paris after a long trip abroad where he developed a fear of the jungle during which he was unconscious. There is great recognition because his novel, which is parallel to the notorious trial, is the best seller. The French government wants to know whether he had access to secret documents, something that seems more probable when an officer is killed by a "catman." Doubt really falls on a writer when his fianc√© ends up dead. Complicating things are the return of decay so the writer does not know if he is a killer or not. The right thriller is too lazy to be fully enjoyed. There are too many music numbers early and too dead when everything is spoken in the middle and later parts. The acting is fine and the sets are pretty good, but there's a reason why most people I know only remember the ultimate killer, it's the most interesting thing in this movie. despite the short duration (more than an hour) I think the reason this film was rarely seen on TV was that after 20 minutes you start losing patience with it. No matter how good speech is, I just wanted someone to do something. When it finally happened, in minutes of completion, it was too late. Take a pass.
