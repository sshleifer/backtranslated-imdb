This is one of the funniest bad movies I've ever had the privilege of seeing. I watched this on a DVD with a crowd of friends one Friday night and we just could not stop laughing from the beginning to the story is simple: terrorists are snatching a convoy they think they carry uranium, but actually carry a bunch dinosaurs who eat people. A light mistake. Shoot the incredibly incompetent team of special forces of the army to tackle prehistoric beasts. They are led by Colonel Rance, starring Scott Valentine; a man who seems to have perfected acting "Smells Fart", as Joey in Friends has advocated for him. It has much worse and terrible shooting, but unfortunately the Rance team seems to have a problem with the goal of its weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant, wooden monsters. Also, the lights always seem to blink and exit whenever Velociraptor attacks (mostly so that we can not see how bad the effects of the creatures are). Having said all this, we all had a lot of fun betting on the one who will next beheading them. As an action adventure in Jusassic Park / Aliens, this movie smells worse than a dinosaur groin but as a funny, tongue-in-the-cheer game is a terrible success.
