I read all the reviews here NEXT watching this piece of cinematic garbage and it took me at least 2 pages to discover that someone else did not think it was a horrible non-lethal installation of VASN's acme of humor in the 70's or even in another era! If this is not the least funny comedy * I've ever seen, it will be until it comes. Half the sketch has already been done (and infinitely better) by works such as Monti Pithon and Voody Allen ... If I say that a nice piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the culmination of this film, do not get closer to summing up how senseless and burdened it is with this waste of 75 minutes. Seminal comedi? Only in the world where seeds really really mean cum. Scatological humor? Only in the world where scat IS is really feces. Tumble jokes? Only if we think this is a manual on how NOT to do comedy. Tits and bums and weird beaver. Nice ... if you are a boy who has at least one hand free and has not learned that Plaiboi exists. I'm giving you a break, because it was in the early 70's? No way. The comedy sketches back at least ten years earlier. The only way I could forgive this film, even when it was shot, was that it was armed. Retro? Hard. Sketches about clowns that subtle perverse kids can be top-notch in some circles (and that could actually be funny), but it just turns out to be very sad. What kept me in 75 minutes? A clear belief that they might have saved a really funny skit for the end. I gave movie 1 because there was no lower grade ... and I can only recommend it to insomnia or patients in a coma ... or maybe people who suffer from teeth ... their jaws would ultimately fall into disbelief.
