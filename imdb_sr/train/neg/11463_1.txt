This is only a response to Yahoo which says that this film is more realistic than the classic, genre-defined MASTERPIECE, Javs. Yes, the brainiac, the great whites (and other species of sharks, bulls, black peaks, ocean white peaks, tigers) are known to inhabit areas where light prey is found. People often do not enter that menu, but the shark in the movie has been repeatedly stressed to show abnormal behavior. It's not that it never happened. The prospect of a whale killer destroying almost the whole city, isolating the human enemy, sinking a few tens of thick stormy North Atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people, all the friends of the said "enemy" are enough close to the water to reach it, they are so thin they are ridiculous . Like this pile of jaws. Laughable. It is known that large white sharks often boil boats, protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards, because they look like seals from below. The size of the Bruce size (if you do not know, look) would be more than capable of sinking a boat like The Orca (hey! That's the name of the rampant robbery we're talking about!), It would weigh more than 6,000 pounds. I could go on, but I do not have to. The jaws are incredible (better acting, better effects, better music, better writing), Orka's shit (BLATANT's crop of Javs, bad writing, disgusting effects, the most ridiculous plot on this side of Olson Tvins). It is not necessary for masters from the University of Columbia to see this. Watch better movies.
