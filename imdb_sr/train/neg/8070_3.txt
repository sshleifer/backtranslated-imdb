This is not a good movie, but it's not even a stench. It is very confusing and unnecessarily long, so you are leasing it at your own risk. My GF and I have understood this film (we think) so this is: * ** THE MOST IMPORTANT SPOILERS *** First, this The film is actually quite simple after you remove all the confusing unconscious-san-condition of garbage (95% of the film). Ignoring garbage, what really happened is: a group of school friends go on a rave one night. They leave and crash into a traffic accident where everyone except Cassie and Sean dies. It's a simple version. (That's right, I said Sean, take me) Immediately after the accident, Cassie lies in a hospital that lies between life and death all the way to the very end of the film. Here begins the dream part. The film is called SOUL Survivors, is not it? Cassie's mind and soul continue after an accident that interacts with other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, 2 freaks and Jude), along with images imagined by her mind (Shawn, school and everything else around her). Souls continue to do what is defined as: Annie rave-go chick, 2 freak-killers (from opening the scene), Jude's father continues to help people, etc. long ride, many images are displayed (many of my GF and I still can not tie it), but it all comes down to the fact that Cassie is not the time to die. Finally, Cassie wakes up in the hospital after being "dead" for some time. Her family and Sean are there. This is a reality again. It's fine. Then the director adds a little extra spice trying to confuse us again by showing a small piece of dreams in the wheelchairs that are strangled. But this part is actually just a nightmare, and she wakes up next to Sean, obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience. Due to space constraints, we did not cover every detail, but feel free to send us an e-mail if you wish. <br /> <br />
