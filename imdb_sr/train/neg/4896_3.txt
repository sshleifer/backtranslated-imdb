I'll start by what I like. I really liked the songs, everything about them was great, costumes, music, verses (as long as the translation was good :)), choreography, everything Voleo I'm a crab scene and a cooking scene. But that's all. I understand, arts cinema, blablabla, but too much is too much. Too much silence (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours of listening to the steps and mourning from time to time, really ...), too much boredom (no film should be boring, no matter how deep it was!), Too pornographic scene (I really understand this, I understand that they were shooting porn there, but really, really, it's really too much) I really think that the movie should be for watching and this is definitely not visible in any way. 3 stars for songs.
