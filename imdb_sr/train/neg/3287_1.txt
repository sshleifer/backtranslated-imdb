If this movie needs to be renamed, it should be "The Jackasses of Hazzard". To summarize, this film is nothing but 88 minutes from two immature punks from the country who enjoy the famous Dodge Charger from 1968 in the city and in the country, chasing girls and avoiding the law. I was a "Duchess" fan, and what makes a movie is that characters are out of the key. Excessive humiliation of cursing, sexual references and drug use has made a good name for "Dukes" in trailer trash. On the other hand, the comparison with television shows, the acting was terrible. The only actor who got this right was the famous Dodge Charger from 1969, named General Lee. Others exaggerated the role of the character who damaged the film. Dukes are another victim of Hollywood 21st-century television to a major transitional tragedy. Skip this movie and just buy a TV series on DVD. <br /> <br /> My Rating: F
