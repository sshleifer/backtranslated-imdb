Once I can go through this movie, but I doubt that I could pass another time. Slightly fun mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. Matt Dillon's fun (think about something about Mari) and the re-appearance of the more serious actor Micheal Keaton. This is not a fun game "Love Bug", but it is visible. One of my main obstructions in the movie was the fact that Herbie developed in most cases in R2D2 antics. I was bored with the effects of the headlights around the second time since the 30th time they were used, and the bending of the front bumper caused the same reaction from me. Go see this with your little ones, i.e. With "one-digit brackets" and do not expect much from this movie. <br /> <br /> _Ks
