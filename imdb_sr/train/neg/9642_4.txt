I could not believe that some of the terrible dialogues from the mouths of people arrive, and the final bloopers reel attached to the body of the film was a real sound. And we get the recordings of Angelikue Pettijohn (type) and Loren Crabtree for lifting. The teleportation device activated by the psychic Angelikue Pettijohn brings an alien bowl into an underground laboratory in the desert. According to director Fred Olen Raia, they are the remains of the film Klaus Kinski, ANDROID, which gives the film a higher value than it looks cheap. Inside the container there is a dwarf dwarf (played by Rai's son) who begins to chase people to death. It was rather funny to watch this little 'creature' in a black suit with a reaper with what looks like a big bug shell attached to it, running around in the dark. We even see a small seal and tear on the ET poster, which I thought was hilarious. And then what looks like a snake that also comes out of the container that charges the death of Villyam Fair, after a mini-creature chew in the neck of Frank McDonald's in the kitchen. Low budget takes ALIEN, I guess ... The whole thing is over, it looks like it was finally running out of the movie, before the reel came up with the end credits. Talk about the lack of finance ... Fred Olen Rai also says in a commentary by the director that they were not sure whether Aldo Rai would go through the recording and remember his lines. Hardly it is. Low budget cheese syrup. It's fun to watch, I'll give it to you. 4 of 10
