I'm 11th grade in high school. In my class, the current world of children in my class had this video and suggested that we watch. So are we. I firmly believe that we went to the Moon, because my father worked for NASA. Although I think this film is the biggest piece of shit I've ever seen, the guy who created it has some serious balls. First, did he have to show that JFK was hit? And how dare he use all these biblical quotes. The only good thing in this movie is that it provokes debates, which is a good c / b in my class we have weekly debates. This film did not do anything to change my mind. I think he and Michael Moore should work together and make another movie. The next film, Michael Moore, could be called "A Funny Story Happened on December 11th" or "A Funny Thing Happening on the Way to the White House".
