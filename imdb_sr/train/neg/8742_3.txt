After I saw the movie in the cinema, I thought it was the original concept for the thriller, which puts it in the competitive world of computer companies. All the stars are another message that this film is likely to be good. But when I did not go to watch it in the first week of release, it disappeared by the 2nd week and I was afraid that something was wrong. I waited patiently for a DVD release, and then I bought it and hurried to the home for a pleasant viewing. Expecting the way home was far better than film. For starters, the direction is terrible. There is no thought at all, and the director is just a part of himself, so he can appear in the film. I would not hurry to recruit him in the future. Secondly, the main role is completely wrong as Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe's a cool cool character like the Cruel Intentions and Vai of the Gun, but in this he should have been an unpleasant hero trying to show by slipping when he runs and has geeky friends, but he just does not look good. Women's stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani, do not have enough characteristics, but when they do not do, none of the performances are close to their best. The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins as a role that could have been made for him, and that's his hot temper and mysterious ways to pull the movie. The final thing is that this movie is another one that fills the scenes of scenes that you do not see in the movie and instead appear only in the fragment from the deleted scenes on a DVD. Inducing even more disappointments, although some of these scenes are rude, they fill important voids in the story.
