I'm not sure if Carpenter wants to ask questions about abortion, and makes a really difficult and obvious thing that a woman should be allowed an abortion if Satana is a father, but it gets distracted. Ron Perlman is ridiculous. The baby is really dumb looking, basically a cancer with a baby head. You can pretty much see the material about the costume of Satan. What a mess. This episode has about five minutes of story and 55 minutes of boredom. Very, very bad. And the end is just funny. After learning that his baby is dead, does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everything in a big, bloody, bloody noise? NOT! He just heads his head and leaves the room. Terrible.
