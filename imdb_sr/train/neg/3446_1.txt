This film on paper seemed to be good after watching, although I realized that this movie is totally awesome !! The plot does not make sense, and I think I've counted the best part of 5,000 cut scenes, each made the movie boring and boring. I watched this late nightfall without any noise just to add to SCARINESS, but the truth is the only thing that scared me is music, what they would call tragic music, they play opera I mean seriously !! This film sums up everything that is not good in this type of film. To be honest, do not say more, but look at your own risk that this movie is just total nonsense, LIVE!
