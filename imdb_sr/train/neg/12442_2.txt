The Star Creatures invasion would definitely be in the category "so bad is good" if the film was not so sexist or racist. If that's the case, it's simply bad. It has the same type of stubborn stereotypical sexism that you have seen in the Queen of the universe and the kind of racist stereotypes (in this case, the Indians) that would otherwise be found in thirty and forty Westies. In the sense that it is not funny, the same walk through the deck is repeated more than ten times during this rather short film. Ray makes a good impression on Jimmy Kagney (but he can not make it work for two impressions of Cagney's rhythm or to handle Peter Lorrae when he tries to do it). There are really no productive values ​​that could be said, because "Star Creatures" make Ro-Man from the Robot Monster or Tor Johnson in Plane 9 from Outer Space looks like creating industrial light and magic. <br /> <br This film was definitely one of the leaders of what you should call an early independent movie ... is not artistic enough for these theaters and is not good enough for everyone except for the last feature of the whole night drive. /> <br />
