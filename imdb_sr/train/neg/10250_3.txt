Dull, a cheap sci-fi thriller, made with almost complete lack of conviction (control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decrypt messages from the universe is led by only one man and is very poorly guarded at night), and full of stone sound effects . Christopher Lee is not just lost, but he also gives him one of his few "I'm Just For Money" show. (* 1/2)
