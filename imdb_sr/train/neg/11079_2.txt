Over the course of several years of searching for half-decent rental films for my children, I have developed the sixth sense to spot really raw, direct efforts that are really painful to pass (for those over eight years old). I left the ball on this one and the children spent half a film asking me "why did she say that?" and "why did he do it?" and my eyes got sick of swinging every minute, because the characters did really bad to introduce seemingly random changes. And the next time someone decides that there is absolutely no skills with the sword, simply "bring realism" to the movie, please take them with a butter knife. "Prehisteria!" He was above and above his head. Arrgh.
