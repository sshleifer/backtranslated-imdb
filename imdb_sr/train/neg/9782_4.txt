This film had such a promise !! What a great idea, a paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, just to lose speed due to poor dialogue, poor editing and a half-written story. The characters were initially interesting, just to lose a couple halfway to become one-dimensional people who were releasing tired single-layer tapes. it was a great movie, instead of a little fluttering effort.
