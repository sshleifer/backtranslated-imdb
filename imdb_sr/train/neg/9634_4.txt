Whatever rating I give to BOOM is just because of the extraordinary location of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is only for hardcore addicts about ELIZABETH TAILOR (its downstream stage) and RICHARD BURTON (his miscasting phase). Tennessee Villiams wrote "The milk train does not stop here anymore" and should be loved very much by this adaptation of his drama - but it was obviously the only one. Tailor allegedly hated him, and Burton needed the money. Anyway, it's a beard of beans with a Tailor that holds and clings in its sharp manner, exploding on the servants and exchanging bad conversations with the baby of NOEL COVARD who looks like a visitor from another movie when finally appears. It's so striking that among the fans of Tailor probably thought to be seen. But if you can sit through this without a drink in your hand, you're far ahead of me. Unfortunately, this is a film that marked the end of Tailor, who was seriously regarded as a film actress, even after he won two Oscars. It was equally devastating for Burton, and critics called it BOMB. Judge for yourself if you dare.
