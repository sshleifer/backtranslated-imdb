This film is a joke and Quinton should be ashamed of himself, trying to convey this as the Mods of Blaise Film. If you have trouble sleeping, then all means renting this movie. A figurine they call the actress who should be the Modesty of Blaise must be the most contagious person on this planet. Maybe it could be used as a hat on the back of a real movie. Seventy-five minutes of nothing thank you who you ever made up the quick-swipe button in advance. If you look at this movie, you can call it RUN. I can not help but think about what the third world country could use the money spent on this shit. this film is boring actors are boring waste from the color of the waste air you breathe If you want to see the Mosti Blaise Film then watch the one you made in the 60s maybe the director was supposed to do.
