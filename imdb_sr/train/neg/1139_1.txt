I note that I have not seen a movie since I discovered it in 2007, and my city is smaller and does not carry it. However, I really want to say something about it. I am actually doing research for the university on the title of Richard Maurice Bucke and I want to point out that the person in whom the main character was in reality completely different !!! Hollywood ideas about people and artistic licenses, real dr. I think it's funny to see various film critics writing for legitimate newspapers saying that this film has some historical background! The only real thing I can see is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Please do not waste time on the film with such neglect of the horror that the real women experienced in the hands of this doctor who is now celebrated by the film industry.
