Once a big action star falling from the ground ends in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent. Reconciliation with former co-stars to clean the city. Low key, often to the extent that "action" comedy is mostly not working. Part of the problem is that Chris Klien was a former action hero. he's not bad, but he's really not convinced as someone who was disgusted. As I said, he is not bad, he is just wrong for what his story is. The real problem here is a combination of scenarios, which is not really funny and sometimes looks artificial, and the direction that is pedestrian to the port of drowsiness. There is no life in the way things are being put. As if the director had a list of recordings and went to that sheet. This makes a movie that does not attract attention. Nevertheless, the film occasionally revives, as in the final show that ends the film. This sequence works, but because the earlier parts of the film flooded its depleted power. I can not recommend a movie. It's worth a try if you're a fan of actors or you're a big fan of independent cinema in all its forms, but it's just a disappointment.
