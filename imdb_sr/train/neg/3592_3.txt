For a series of fans, I must admit that Hidden Frontier is not that bad at all. However, the consideration of this series can not be based on whether it is a series of fans or not. The initiative itself is commendable. And creativity. I think these are people with ordinary jobs and a great enthusiastic heart for Star Trek. But I'm doing all this work. Withdrawing all these resources. Taking all this time, and still all of these flaws. First of all acting, and the lines are terrible. For the majority. Dialogues belong to the military show 70, not to Star Trek. Captain (Mr. Skuinti) seems to be preparing at any time. Most characters read their lines. Directors should be aware of the fact that "repetition" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I guess the series were made in the "Tvo Takes Frakes" mode, which directed many episodes of TNGs and movies. Also, I could not help but think that most actors are typical Trekki. Not going deeper into this assumption. My greatest concern about the whole project is the quality of the edition. When they first decided to spend so much time and resources on this series - why did they not make it available in decent quality? The use of a fast time format, with low resolutions, is the loss of talent. Even "higres" episodes are considered poor quality compared to a standard quality series. Using an Xvid codec with higher resolution and file size would greatly enhance the experience. If the problem band was a problem, setting up a torrent tracker would solve this. deserves.
