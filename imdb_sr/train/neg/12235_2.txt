If you want to know what kind of music White people listened to in 1974, this is a movie for you. But you will also have to listen to many flutes and violins (see my notes on My Girl 1). Cautious Recognition: I came to my girlfriend 2 with cynicism and anxiety, just looking at my predecessor. But as the adopter prepares to finally go in search of my mother, my girlfriend 2 has made me look, with the topic of search for her mother. Nothing that happened to My Girlfriend 2, but in connection with the protagonist who asks, like many adopters, "who is my mom"? And if there are home movies of my mother in the acting hull, I will take care to make my film about it. People are voluntary. Movies should not be foolish. My girlfriend 2 (like my girlfriend 1) is just ... voluptuous. Avoid unless you are a complete juice that is comforted by a series of tiny disturbances.
