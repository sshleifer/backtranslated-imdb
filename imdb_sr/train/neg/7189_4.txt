What a complete disappointment! The score of 6.1 here on the IMDb created some mild expectations, but oh, oh, I was disappointed. The first thing that bother me is that smart, stereotyped university kids. Yes, I know that teenagers can be childish and so on, but why are they in movies that are always shown as complete stupid morons? There was one character that I thought was fine, but he / she (not revealing him here) was killed far before the end. The other characters were badly derived, and even the alleged hero / heroin simply did not do it for me. On the positive side: the action is pretty good and the productions value the above cut for these types of shifts. The act was not good at all, Rutger Hauer stands out in a small role. But all this does not work with mild and careless characters. Stop worrying about them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and this is generous).
