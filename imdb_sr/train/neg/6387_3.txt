When I first picked up this movie, I was intrigued by the basic idea and eager to see what would happen. I am a fan of animation and I love it when it is successfully connected with live action. However, the animation in this film was about everything I enjoyed. Though it must be said that the performances of the actors were excellent. Visual appearance - including animation - was a delightful piece. However, it was the quality of the disadvantage that was lost among too many pictures, both visual and in the script, that you were practically stabbed over your head. The most disturbing thing is the relative lack of significance for the plot. It seemed that the plot was shining rolled at irregular intervals, giving stuttering that massaged the flow of pieces. The Felisberth voices - especially those at the end - were a very desperate attempt to fill empty holes in the plot that were ignored for the sake of side issues such as the whole thing with the ant (even that was not) properly addressed). I'm afraid the entire work came to this, at best, on a 'reasonable first attempt' by a teenager who spent too much time reading DH Lavrence. Not what you expect from experienced filmmakers.
