Even the hottest fan may not like the movie, (one of them), no material was given to the pupil. It's really a shame because it's the only feature film that the puppets did with Curley, and this effort is painfully immature when he could have great potential. Terrible music numbers also do not help. The short text that they did with the same title has more laughter.
