I'm allowed to write 1000 words about this movie, but one word can be enough: bizarre. Mužić and I did not laugh as much as watching this really terrible film. We continued to watch each other with our best "What ...?" expressions. It is not possible to adequately describe this film. The killer's parachute was ridiculous, but this is just sick. What kind of mind produces these pictures, then puts them on a movie so others can see them? What kind of mind involves innocent children in this strange, strange movie and then packing them as if it is suitable for children? Parents, whatever you do, if your child still believes in Santa Claus, do not let him see this movie. Preteens can watch it - probably with "What ...?" expressions on their faces. If you choose to add this film to others, you may want to stab your eggs. Probably the worst movie ever made.
