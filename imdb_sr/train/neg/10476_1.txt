I am a Christian. I've always been skeptical of the films made by Christians. As a rule, they are "knowledgeable" when it comes to film production. I admire the TBN that I tried to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. However, they did so disgustingly. The acting was terrible, and if one does not know the Bible in some way, it could not be understood what the film was trying to get. Not only was the movie horribly made, but the people who made it had some facts wrong. However, in this "critique," these facts are irrelevant and too deep to embark on. In short, Omega code is the absolutely worst movie I've ever seen, and I would not recommend anyone except for comical release from everyday grinding.
