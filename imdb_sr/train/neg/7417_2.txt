This film is so bad - dialogues, stories, actors and actresses - everything! - It's hard to imagine that this year or the next years we will see a worse movie. The "Love Brother" (set up in Australia among Italian immigrants) has nothing but shallow clich√©s on the offer of Italian culture, and it is quite clear that even Italians from Italy and Italy in the film speak English. The message of the movie - ugly people must marry ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - it's really embarrassing. Giovanni Ribisi is pretty good in films such as 'Suburbia' or 'Lost in Translation', but here's a pseudo-Italian accent hard to bear. Watch this movie at your own risk. Trash like a trash!
