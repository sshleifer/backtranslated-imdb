When I first watched Robotboia, I discovered it was fresh and interesting, but then I noticed that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave, what is good / bad. Episodes have become predictable. And the main characters are not interesting. Again, we see a hyper-smart boy, beaten by an older brother, parents who do not understand their child, and his friends: a girl and a fat boy. And this show has no logic. A super-modern robot working on two AA-size batteries and can use a lot of weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super-activated modes. We see two different robots, and she rejects the main idea of ​​the show: "The robot must learn how to behave in human society"
