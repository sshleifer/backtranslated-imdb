That's right. The film was written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and his family. (Fred was supposed to know better, he worked the sets 'Titantic' and 'Dogme'.) So, the plot. There are some scientists, some foresters, and hot fish with huge fake chests. They are all very bad at work, including hot fish (which I think should be a photographer, but who cares because she wears a bikini). One of the foresters comments that scientists are "professional people", which is good, because it would be terrible to be professional foxes or jellibeans or Evoks. They walk through the woods in search. some strange monkey bones, and no one even mentions that bones might be just those of the infamous Big Foot. They're just wandering around and one of the renegades stammerlessly hits the hottie. We all hope that he will soon die (along with his sister who should be cute naive, but she's really just boring). Then they, sigh, * find the Sasuke ... I mean, a monkey animal cemetery. Of course, she does not mention that it could only be Bigfoot bones that make fun of ... I suppose that scientists and foresters do not think about these kinds of things. Then Saskuatch and his tribe. Really get angry and kill all the people we do not like, drive away other losers and bury our Big Aunt Muriel and cousin Josh (who died in an unfortunate trout) again. Bleak, boring dialogue (I've zoned several times), rude complications, unpleasant characters, bad CGI (a man in the monkey suit would look better), and an act that was not really good enough to sum up I'll make a movie that I will not watch again. But check it; It's good for some unintentional laughs.
