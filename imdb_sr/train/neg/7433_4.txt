I have to be completely honest and first to say that I fell asleep somewhere in the middle, so I can not give a full view of the film until I see it completely. Basically, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslav), are planning to make a wealth of stealing contraceptive pills from the Finisham family hospital. This is played by the title character Matron (Hattie Jackues), along with staff members Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Villiams), dr. Francis Goode (Charles Havtrei), dr. Patients and their visitors are also nearby, including pregnant Ms. Tide (Joan Sims) and her nervous dad for future husband Mr. Tidey (Kenneth Connor). Also starring Bill Mainard as Freddy and Eastenders Vendi Richard as Miss Villing. By the way, this plan does not take place, as all staff are on the road. That's almost everything I can say about the movie until I see it completely again. Okay!
