This is one of the worst movie adaptations of music ever made. The scenic version of A Chorus Line is wonderful. This film misses the trace in almost every way. Even casting is confusing. Take Audrei Landers as Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is Wave's song. Wow's story is that she's a great dancer, but 3 in the lookout. Yes, she finds a solution, but in the end she's a great dancer. What do great filmmakers do? They hire an actress who can not play and is known for what looks great. A way to miss a boat. Then there is choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett was turning around in the grave. Why did not he use his choreography? This really can not be improved.
