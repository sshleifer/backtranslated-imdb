I do not know why I comment on this stupid real-shov that I accidentally watched several episodes (cable marathon broadcast when they broadcast 5 episodes in a series or so, but I did not see the whole thing as three episodes) as I was nine months pregnant and I needed I try every day. Maybe I'm just bored today :-) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, Britney, I really am. Money and fame seem to have very little sense of dignity. Or is it focused on extreme. She married a stupid Federline (whoever could make a mistake) and before that she "acted" this terrible notion of her everyday life where he pushes the camcorder wherever he feels, whether in someone's face or in a shower Federline is standing there. She is chattering about her sex life, leaving nothing to your imagination, I do not care about my part, but I can not wonder how she feels now when she is divorced. And yes, because of her, I am a shame. It seems that still live a rather empty, shallow life. I do not want to live with her, even if I could. Kill TV if you want.
