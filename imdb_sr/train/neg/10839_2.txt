This is shown on a biographical channel and it was as informative as a children's comic book! I gave her 2 out of 10 for his attention to detail because she mostly had the feeling of the 70s, and the three ladies that played the first three angels looked like them so makeup is good. This was supposed to be a biography on a biographical channel, but it was empty of everything that is usually / usually seen in one of their biographies. There are no interviews with surviving team members, crew members, members of the production team, etc., or their friends, families and biographies of these people. Actually, now I know as much about the program as before and before watching this film based on a (supposedly) biographical book. As for the learning of something that nobody knew about the program, it was not well known that this never happened.
