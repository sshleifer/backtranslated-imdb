The music that was scribbled on nails on nails, acting so zombie, was a shame to lose actors by not recording a second film; throwing everything in it like real zombies - with actress Sabrina Teenage witches as heroes ... a film so terribly awesome that if "stoners" are still around him can be considered a cult film --- but, oh oh yes, the scenarios could also they are worn by actors, their lines are read while slowly moving through the film - banal, illogical gatherings modeled on LA divisions, props directly from ToisRus! Has a movie ever been made so completely incompetent? Logic flying in the wind in this boring, pointless, senseless and "monster" so stupid and inconsistent that it can not catch a turtle in a cold store --- a low cut, long-legged --- and amazon! It kept my attention to the end; the way in which a terrible, constant chain fog accident involving multiple vehicles keeps one looking to the very end ... like, after a funny fight with a pistol in a prison on another planet, a sexy and mentally unbalanced head hunter who is in a disadvantage hunting a retarded alien Fugitive --- IN THE COUNTRY! Do not let anyone knock you popcorn, you might really enjoy watching this. It's so bad!
