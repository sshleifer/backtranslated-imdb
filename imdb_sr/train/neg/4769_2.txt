Unfortunately, that was wrong. This film is from the beginning to the end. It was hard to watch because I watched Clarissu explain everything on Nickelodeon every day. He liked himself. Then the next thing I found in Makima and she was wonderful! I did not hear anything about her until I watched this film about an accident. I could not believe she would even allow something like this to be seen with her name. Everything about this was wrong, but it still seemed like someone somewhere in the team really really was trying to save a submerged ship. Too bad ... I hope she will continue to act and I would like to see her with a real acting in a real movie.
