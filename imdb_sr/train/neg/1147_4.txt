This film is in the history of F.BI, while Knott's Berry Farm is in the old west. A shamelessly disinfected version of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to Fight Crime. Hoover's heavy arm (did he have any other kind?) Shows in general with the teevee quality actors to read scenarios, cheesy sets, cheap sound effects and lighting 101. With Jimmy Stevart with 20% dramatic capacity, Vera Miles chews the scene, The film is characterized by every c-lister known in the mid-1950s with the indication of irony or humor, from the 'Amazon jungle' to the 'barbecue in the back yard', all stinks to the sound stage and back. Even shots are preserved and well-known. I assume that Mervin Leroi drank every night. Except for a few (very few) interesting exteriors that make recordings, nothing of a note that is beyond curiosity.
