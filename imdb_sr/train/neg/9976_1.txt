The first scene in 'Problem Child' has a baby that writes in the face of a nun. For this movie, it's funny. A nasty, humorous 'comedy' is incapable of so many levels that she does not believe it. John Ritter is a lovely father who adopts a child from hell, and is honored to maintain his dignity in the surrounding attack of one note, boring performances and childish humor. And what the hell Jack Varden is doing in this mess? Poorly directed by Dennis Dugan and disgusting in his attempts to include sentimentality when it comes to rust, the film is so badly made that it's a pretty bizarre experience. But it does not matter all that. None of this is Michael Oliver, the most troublesome and most unusual child actor ever to hit the screen? Believe me, you want to hit him right in his mouth.
