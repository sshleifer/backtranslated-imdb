The only good thing about "People I Knew" is to serve as a perfect example of the films that Al Pacino should avoid to perform. Sometimes he was weak and unattractive, while in other segments he seemed too exaggerated. Dialogue and character interaction were terrible together with a slight complication. The support made an extremely superficial job in keeping the movie interesting, and in one hour I did not see any signs of a solid plot. The whole story is really boring, and I had to squeeze my face several times to be awake. This film will surely and you will ... avoid at all costs.
