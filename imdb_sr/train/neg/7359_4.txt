Anyone who has watched several films from the Lifetime Film Network knows that the credibility of the plot is the first thing to throw away from the planning table. So when Lara moved to Pattin's home and methodically began to drive her landlady, I did not even blink. When Lara ultimately increased her activities to threaten the poor Patty and dared to do anything about it, I only nodded. You see, on LMN planet, people do not behave the way they do it for some special reason, they do it only to get the action going. Only on Planet LMN could someone have the owner of a house thrown out of their own house using their seductive powers !! Poor Patty - she believed too much, and Lara removed the drug, and then there was this great fight at the top of the stairs that included syringe full of deadly things that end with injection in one's belly, and the body bag exits out. front door. Horror! But take it from me, this Planet LMN product is a classic. You have to watch him once, just because of the big laugh you have. On the Irreplaceable Scale, I give this film 95/100. Create a large group of popcorn and take apple slices. You'll understand later.
