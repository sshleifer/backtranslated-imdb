This is another depressing and boring film about AIDS and tragedy. It starts very unpleasant and predictable and continues through the film. I waited for it to pick up, but unfortunately it was never done. The acting is fair, but the scenario needs a lot of work. And if you are looking for nudity, do not waste time with these not-so-hot actors. Due to poor audio quality and lack of description, I missed 1/8 of the movie. If you've never seen more than five gai movies, or have recently calmed down with being gay, maybe this movie will be interesting to you, otherwise it's your little budget movie. It's one of the worst gai movies I've ever seen.
