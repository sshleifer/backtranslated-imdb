I accidentally saw this movie and this film was an unfortunate case. Blondes that are being harassed, the criminal who then appears disappears from one place to the other in a minute, then disappears and reappears, hiding. He was not even a super hero, so I do not know how he did it. cat and it's not difficult. The old "mirror in the bathroom" is no longer scary, in fact, it has ceased to be daunting many years ago. You had a policeman on the trail of a villain, another cliché (played by idris elba with a very convincing American accent, he was from London), the director had no idea and made a movie full of clichés and made a terrible move "that the comedy looks scary." pathetic!
