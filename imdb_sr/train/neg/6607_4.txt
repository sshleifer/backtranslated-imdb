Not as bad as some do, although apparently pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion, Amitabh was as good as criminal Babban Singh - try not to compare with Gabbar in the original because they obviously do not go for the same effect. However, apart from some of the main action scenes, the rest of the film is flawed. The development of character was bad and the development of the story was hopeless, with many holes and missing information that I would not know that I did not read the back of the DVD. The worst part of the film was the role of support of Nisha Kothari and especially of this new type, called Prashant Raj. Nisha is simply boring from the moment her lips were opened. As for Prashant Raj - who is this guy? where is it, and why, for God's sake, was present in the film studio for anything other than serving drinks? His acting ability is zero and has the same tone, dialogue dialogue and stubborn expression in every scene, whether it's action, comedy, or even the scene when someone just died. Ajai Devgan was average, at least his terms changed, which is more than I can say about his mistake. Generally speaking, Rag's Aag is worth watching Amitabh's solid performance, as well as the very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special look.
