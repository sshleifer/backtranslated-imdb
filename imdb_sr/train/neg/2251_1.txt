A really amazing crowd of popes! The movie that can be predicted, slow moving, destroying the soul and dying, reducing your wrists with a rusty knife for bread ... seems almost necessary. The acting is ready for a thin dialogue, each scene is at least twice as long as it takes, the trickiest details about how this career breaks down or career grows is just too bleak and earthly for words. Music would be good if you do not have to watch a movie, but really, three good songs are not enough reward for the effort you need to watch a movie. Watching this movie, I prayed to God for Narcolepsy or someone shot me. Never, never, never again.
