I can not imagine Al Pacino. I'm looking at him in Kuma, Scarface, Carlit's Way, and I think I'm looking at one of the greatest actors in the last thirty years. Then I see him in the Money for Money, every Sunday and the Revolution, and I wonder what he thinks about that guy. I ran into Revolution a few nights ago and thought that I would invest in the next two hours. Here are the news: Do you want prisoners to talk? Force them to watch this over and over again ... they will admit anything. I will not reconsider the plot because there is no coherent complication, but it happens during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to get involved, but in the end. While there is no money, no education and dress like a cave, very hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no reason, because together they only have two minutes of dialogue. Totally honest, if "Al Smith" acted in this movie, instead of "Al Pacino," it would ruin their career. The scenario was terrible, but Pacin's demotivated performance and obvious false accent made him even worse. Donald Suterland's role was ridiculous. I really can not describe it. Natasha Kinski is the main character, but she has 5 lines in the movie. In fact, no one talks much about this film. One of the happiest premise in the movie is that Al Pacino and Kinsky have this unusual sense of continuously meeting each other on the battlefield. His whole northeast is Starbucks. "Hey, it's funny to see you again here, in another battlefield 100 miles away ... see you in a few months." I am obliged to give one star to the IMDb, because there is nothing here because of the negative result.
