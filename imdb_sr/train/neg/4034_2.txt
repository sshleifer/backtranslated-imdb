Oh God. good cast, but to write and direct is art and write wit and direct spirit is a little task. Even if you are doing a good comedy, you must get the right time and the moment. Im not putting everything down is the parts where I laughed loudly, but that's very few times. The main focus on me was the fast, free dialogue that some people in the film bored. It may sound great when you read the script in your head, but it's a different task. A handheld camera delivers energy for several parts of the movie. The general direction was good, but the scenario was not everything, but I'm sure that you read the script in your head that it sounds good. Sorry.
