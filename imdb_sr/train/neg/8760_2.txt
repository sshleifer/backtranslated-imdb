This film deals with allegedly non-assertion (aesthetic and sexual) which obviously can not resist basic romantic needs. Although there are several great players, including Jon Tennei, Timothy Oliphant and Cinthia Nikon, they are based on a childish letter that almost completely rely on smart dialogue; what is not. Nixon's role has the best features, but it often goes too fast into them, a mistake of time that must be burdened with the director. The grotesque climax uses every available cliche, whether consumed or not, and conveniently ends up with this elusive comedy attempt.
