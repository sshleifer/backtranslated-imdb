The same difficulty I have with the musical version of "Les Miserables" refers equally to "Oliver". Instead of writing a composer in a stylish placement period, they only wrote Broadway melodies, which were historically one-way and stylishly distorted. Do not mix well with some of the sunny pieces that permeate the result. It's an unpleasant mixture that leaves a distinctly acidic shade. The casting of Oliver's boy does not help substantially: provisional from the tambourine and the disturbing preciousness, there is something less than solid. Fagin performs his traditional routine in an adequate way, although the melodies that are required to singer have a small basis in a periodical manner. "As long as I need it", a sharp exhortation is given, throaty and tense. The two big production numbers, "Who Will Buy" and "Think About Yourself" seem to be overproduced, with everything except the kitchen sink thrown into. It's one thing to go all over, another go over the line in excess. Darkness, despair and depravity of a large part of the novel does not seem to be subject to such fairy tales and choreography. While the novel is considered a classic, I must admit that I have a problem with Mr. Dickens' consciousness, because his works tend to emit negative vibration. This may be due to the prolongation of his non-working life, which was full of disappointment and regret. Not all of the combined talents of this production, either on or behind the camera, can overcome the nonconstructive nature of the basic material. All this results in an unpleasant experience for me. <br /> <br />
