It's funny when you stop and think about it: fans of movies about fear strives for a deep and lasting love for those who scare them. The Texas massive tape can give us nightmares, but who among us did not feel the real thing in love with Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE or Ken Foree, forever and forever a determined hero of the original DAVN MRTVI? His remake in the remake forced me to get up and cheer (as he did to Tom Savini); I do not kid you. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, you get my drift (if not, just stand by the wind ...). These are some of the hero of horror. It seems that many of them are gathered in one movie is almost unheard of (at least to the extent that I know). If only the writer (s) were ready for such a monumental task. Maybe someone else, somewhere along the line, will try again. As long as this is not another tireless effort (such as BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD, for example).
