This film lost me with an independent RPG (missile bomb). It was as if someone cut out and pinched the scene from Robocop. Halfway I expected Beowulf to say, "I LIKE IT!" I watched this because I like Chris Bruno from The Dead Zone and he did his part. He chose a strange accent, but at least he kept him consistent for the entire film - unlike any of his costumes. They have been constantly drawn into all kinds of speeches from the old English to the modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. However, even by itself, the action of this movie is not good. It's just boring, which even a low budget does not justify. Having a low budget means you must have at least a good story, dialogue and decent work. These things do not cost much. Instead, they spent their money on the semi-cedric CGI and some decent costumes and kits. Life is too short to watch this movie.
