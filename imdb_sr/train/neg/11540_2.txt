This reminded me of the many disgusting Dirty Veekenda Michael Vinner with the feeling of a terrible English low budget. First I must say that I am a fan and exploit and a serious movie. I appreciate, say, 'Demented' because it's incompetence and 'Last House on the left' because it's pure shameless brutality. And any number of inventive and increasingly brutal Italian spins. This was however meaningless. Something like a British budget director thought: 'Let's rearrange' I spit on your grave, 'and I'm not going to make it so horrible now that the horror returns to a hostel mode. or you have a point. What about the rapist's daughter? Why are you trying to be a security camera expert? Crappi.
