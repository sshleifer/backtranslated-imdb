This was really the worst movie I've ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And it looks absolutely awful through the whole movie, the hair is so bad! They speak as monotonous voices and there is no chemistry. The DVD cover is neither near nor close to what the movie actually is. Really, really boring. I had to speed up some of them, because it was so painful to watch. I really want to know how can anyone in the world think this is good? if they literally like to speak and say "yes" and there is no passion. I could not say they were in love at all. I'm sorry, but this is the saddest excuse for a movie that I think I've ever seen.
