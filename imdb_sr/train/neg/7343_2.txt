Have you ever heard of a Taiwanese horror movie? Or some Taiwanese movie? Checked for a reason. This one was really boring, even though it has black magic including the exhausted body of the baby and people exploding inside with thousands of eels. and worse, but there is not much. Some bloody and other mischievous things, if you are waiting for graphic mountains or any terrible effects, you will be disappointed. They obviously did not use the eel explosion and other things to their greatest potential. Little is good in this movie; one character that was not completely mild and a few OK black magic, such as eels. The action was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and boring, including the main character. The horror aspect did not work at all, the scariest thing was an albino girl (not so scary). This is the worst Asian horror movie I've ever seen.
