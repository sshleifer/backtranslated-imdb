I am a great fan of sci-fi 50s, but this is not one of my favorites. While the concept of the film was a natural means for the classic tone of the bopper sci-fi movie, the director was too careful to bear the film. It is clear that he worked without money, because the whole film is full of an abandoned dialogue that lasts and continues forever. I've never seen so much killings of time in the movie. In the whole film is probably less than 60 seconds of "blob" footage, and most of the rest make people into a lot of bad written dialogue. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but good heavens ... how could casting think that somebody in a healthy mind would trust them as teenagers?
