Perhaps I've seen too many criminals, or maybe I'm not taking the right drugs. It was the most clich√©, scandalous plot, complicated-absurd, just a stupid movie that I have Visible for a long time. As for the direction, it seems that it took less time to show it than to meld. It actually looks like to get it to the video before it's finished. It's a bad division of "M", a classic film by Fritz Lang in which Peter Lorre plays. You'd better rent it instead.
