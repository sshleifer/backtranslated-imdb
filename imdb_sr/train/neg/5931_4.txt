This film was supposed to be only 10 minutes. I think that in this matter, there really is only 10 minutes of content that can be viewed (even when I turn to call it a movie). The film's initial film was somehow promising. Since the film begins with short comments from the man himself, you are really rubbing your hands and staying up with more shots from Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave is doing a good job covering one of Cohen's famous songs. The length of the cave performance makes you even more eager to see more than Cohen whose wit and well-spoken words have already buzzed your imagination. But as it turns out, Cave's performance is just the beginning of long-lasting super boring performances of literally a bunch of those who do not even have the minimal appeal to keep you on their seat. I mean, what does the director mean? five-minute major shooting plans want to be singers at a fake concert in Australia !!! What a film maker really thinks he offends the audience by adding a "fake applause" to these endless nasty performances. The movie is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you came to see. There's not a single shot of Cohen's past. In fact, except for several photos of his early days as a singer / poet, there is absolutely nothing! If you sum up all the minutes that Cohen is talking about, it may not reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are a bit presented somewhat between the catastrophic cameras captured by some of the most embarrassing people who scream Cohen's texts. If you have ever decided to spend your money on this movie, NO! just throw it in the trash and at least save time.
