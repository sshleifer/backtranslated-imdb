Spooks is funny garbage, which contains some well-ordered sequences, funny complications and dialogue, and a third actor's work. The American version shares the bad nonsense, but the execution is so hazy, sexy and suspicious, costly. Some people describe a bad comedy as a "gentle comedy." . This is a watch of a spy story, totally the opposite of everything created by John Le Carre. Give me Smiley every day.
