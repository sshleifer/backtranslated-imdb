As the title page says "For our time, for our time". I had to study this recorded version of Hamlet immediately after I watched the version of Kenneth Branagh and that was really a disappointing experience. /> <br /> This version has a different approach in several aspects of the game, including sexuality; one very homosexual OsriÄ‡ and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ofelia. I think that during this time (60's) this was a very well made version of Hamlet, but it can not be compared with Branagh's complete version. Just a note ... I found a video in my local video store (in Australia) and actually I'm looking for DVD Kenet Branagh to buy it if there is such a thing. If someone knows one, please tell me.
