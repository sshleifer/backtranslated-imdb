I spent my time and gave a chance to this show. This must be one of the worst new shows. If they have given a reward for shows that come up this, the category should be swept. The acting is bad and the story is fictitious. Now Dinosaurs were a little weird, but at least it was fun. This show lasted for three seasons and was finally peeled off. This new show, based on advertising for insurance companies, is not funny and has nothing to do with it. It is possible that original commercials and how many times have been and are still repeating what is wrong with this show. There has been television and we are already tired of watching "cave people".
