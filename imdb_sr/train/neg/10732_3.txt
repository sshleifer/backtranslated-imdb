Russian film "4" follows the lives of three (not four) foreigners who meet one night at the local bar. One is a musician, one frozen meat seller and one girl to call. 4, I suppose, is intended to show the frustration and hopelessness of life in post-Soviet Russia (characters have to invent stories to make their lives look more interesting than they really are), but the film is so disconnected and boring to seriously doubt that many people will be able to sit down to the end. There seems to be a movie that says that the dark Russian government is ready for some suspicious things behind the scenes - to use secret cloning facilities, to sell decennial frozen meat, etc. - but the film is so shapeless and incomprehensible that I doubt who could have understood what someone is really doing here. Despite the decent play and a few shots with a sharp sequence, "4" is a two-day competition of endurance that should be avoided at all costs.
