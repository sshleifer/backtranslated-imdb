There was nothing in this movie that I liked. It was so obviously low-budget with poor lighting and work with the camera (almost like the Blair Vitch Project, but it should not have been so). There was not much to plot, and the film was just drugged. In fact, I was quickly transmitting the last 1/3 films, but that did not help much. It seemed to be good from the box, but I must say again: nothing about this movie was not very good. There are no good actors, special effects were so fake, camera work was terrible, and the dialogue was painfully awesome. On my own level, I give this film 0 of 10. Iikes!
