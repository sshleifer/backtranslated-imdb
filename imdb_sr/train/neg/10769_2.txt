I found this on the shelf as I cooked and bored. How can people give this 10? It's not just about being a movie that's good for redemption (I think), because he does not work at that level. Poor plot, bad dialogue, terrible acting; There's nothing there. Harvei Keitel is decent, but there's nothing to do, and the Bridget Fond and especially Johnathon Schaech are just terrible. The progress of the plot (especially the relationship between Bayron and Ashley) makes no sense. It seems that the writers wanted the plot to go in a certain way and made it, but it did not actually write in the necessary sections to do so. It's only an hour and a half, but it's 90 minutes of your life, you'll never come back.
