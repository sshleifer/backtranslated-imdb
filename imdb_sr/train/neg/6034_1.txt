Oh my, where to start ... this movie was horrible. Writing was bad, acting was bad, special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me smile! I was in a mood for a terrifying film, but I certainly did not understand it! I thought it would be decent enough because I was not picky. I watched a few bad horror movies. In fact, my goal is to see all the horror films, no matter how horrible they are. At one point in the film I commented on "corn syrup of blood", and by special characteristics they actually admit that it was a carob syrup (branded corn syrup ...). (blood, nakedness, crazy assassin, stupid moves), but there was nothing that would really be good. The writer should either take some lessons or simply give up!
