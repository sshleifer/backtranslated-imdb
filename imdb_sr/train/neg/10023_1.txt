The shame of Iash's films and Aditia Chopra, who seems to have lost his intelligence over the years, and provided a constant treat in this part of the movie shit that even does not value the Iou Tube standards. I brushed my teeth through the entire beginning of the movement to end with a schizophrenic direction, a complication that was never completely materialized, and in the last scene I felt shame that my country and its filmmakers could "FUN" such a stupid thing. Shame the actors who took this work and even comment on it as some of the work they can own. Saif Ali Khan - totally disappointed in your movie choice. Kareen shows enough skin for puberty and Akshai appears as a ghost. Anil is another retard with pubescent fascination for English. His handlers were praiseworthy in their acting and bizarre cinema scattered over the last 15 minutes, it was enough to drop the blood vessel. DO NOT REMOVE any brain cells, energy or your money to go see this - Go SEE / Rent AMU by Conkhan Sensharma instead of a piece of independent film that has ever come out of India. An intelligent, touching and wonderful story that touches everyone with intelligent actors and give me the hope that everything is not lost in Indian film creativity.
