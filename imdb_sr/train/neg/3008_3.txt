A group of people was invited to a high school meeting, but after they arrived, they found that it was a scam by an old colleague in the class who played an almost fatal joke. Now, he is trying to get revenge on those who hurt him by sealing all the exits and cutting off all phone lines. Dark film with unexpected premises. It's a few good performances, some creative death scenes, lots of thrills and fears, a bit of humor and the original ending. No rating for extreme violence, graphic nudity, sexual situation, cursing, and drug use.
