Your first clue that this cheese film is to be filmed on a video, not a movie. The story is intricate, and the production is staggeringly messy. Keep in mind, for example, that when the headline is on a plane that is supposedly descending to Vermont, where they went to celebrate their connection at a civic union ceremony, an airplane arriving at the airport is palm-covered. Their ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in the garden of tropical plants, including palm trees, which would not last five minutes in the climate of New England. On another trip by plane, a recording shot shows a FedEk cargo plane that flies. They could only afford a trip to the rudder. As for the plot, this film expects you to believe that Victor, the pious Christian brother Arthur, is thrown out of his church when the assembly finds out that his brother is gay. And not only that, but the pastor finally puts Viktor with the killer to get Ben and Arthur killed "to cleanse their souls from sin." Apparently nobody in this church has heard about the Ten Commandments. If there was no Jamie Brett Gabel, who was surprisingly efficient as Arthur, this film would not have any features at all.
