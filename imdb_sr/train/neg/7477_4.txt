Mostly a dense road movie with some comic relief provided by excellent John Cleese (although he is really sending his performance to Favlita Tovers). It seems to be flipping over the upper slapstick to the whimsical sentimentality of a hat falling, and the worst part of the film is that Martin and Havn must "find", who they are, and so on.
