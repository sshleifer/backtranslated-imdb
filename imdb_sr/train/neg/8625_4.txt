In the unlikely event that some of the directors who want to read these comments, I want to offer some tips (for free!), From the perspective of the viewer. If you want to make a serious exotic adventure movie, do it. If you want to make a podium of exotic adventurous films, just go ahead. DO NOT try both of them at the same time, do not work. For example, when the character of a stupid "comic relief" was killed and his head was torn off and followed by a monkey who shakes the tree and throws a coconut on the cannibal head, you just seem to have no idea what type of film you want to make. This is boring, curvy, cheap, racist ... you get a picture. A few clever moments and a few short views of the nakedness of Kathy Shover (which is too humorous here) can barely be worth it. There is a reason why everyone has forgotten the existence of this movie. (* 1/2)
