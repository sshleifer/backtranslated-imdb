At first I was glad to know about a new movie about the superman, although it would be great but not. The bad copy of Richard Donner's work, Lek is again a bad guy The evil plan is the same as the first Donner movie that is much forced. The script is predictable and simple. (everything that Luthor finds in a museum or an old woman). The story is the wrong thing, it must be Kevin Smith Script and it can be better. <br /> <br> I just hope to continue without Brian Singer and the new talent director to do something new, not a copy. <br /> <br />
