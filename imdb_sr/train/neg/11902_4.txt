The hysterical thing about this film is that, according to the director, there is a difficulty finding a distributor in the United States, since most of those who watched it could not reconcile the seemingly contradictory message of Christianity and American anger. The idea that anyone saw this as a religious movie is in any case ridiculous. Because the minister in the mission prays with the homeless or wants someone "Godspeed" to make it a "Christian" film? It could be interpreted that this is actually a ridiculing of religion for the "Earth of the Assassin" with all its material surplus, the best that an organized mission can do is to hand over to the bowl of soup and biblical verse. Many unhappy or depressed maybe? A lot of useless missions for homeless people? How about a lot of psychotherapists from Vietnam? Is America a "land of abundant" paranoid patriots? Maybe we have plenty of psychiatric patients? Certainly we do not have many people worried about the Palestinian policy based on the telephone conversation of the main characters in the film. Of course, if you were working in a German shelter for homeless people, the unhappy would be much more concerned about peace in a distant country than their personal survival, because the world knows that Europe is the "Continent of wealth" when it comes to sophistication. /> I really agree with the title in the end because the United States is a "land of abundance" and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of bad letters, amateur acting and impartially directed films. Life is too short and one, even an American, does not have enough time to lose by watching this piece.
