It did not make any sense and it was so terrible ... I think Hollywood has a lot of movies like that ... you do not have to watch it. people cut or eat what I would say ... it made me sick! Oh my God! The film is about people we do not know, but it is fed to people! have teeth blah blah blah ... do not you know that? I can bet that you saw it in another movie. actors were great, but I think the script really was horrible. and I should say that Bradley Cooper was totally awesome ... he's so talented ... I actually said horrible, but I think it's because of terrible scenes ... to explain. Did you ever eat the tongue? but in the film, one person did it! it was really terrible ... in any case I think the movie would be so good without that horrible human food or scene ...
