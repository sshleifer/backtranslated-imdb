Randolph Scott leaves the US for the green pastures of Canadian British Columbia. He wants to start farming with his partner, Bill Villiams, and cook Lee Tung Foo. He pushed his little flock over the tower bridge that was lifted by Victor Jorie. Later, Jori rattles their cattle, and Williams loses his left hand during the frake. From 1945 to 1962, when he retired, Randolph Scott made a series of good adult themed westerns, some of which considered true classics. Unfortunately, Cariboo Trail will never be included among his best western ones. It's more like a material that Roi Rogers or Gene Autry can use. The story is sometimes silly. Villiams, who was able to ride with Scott, wanted to go in search of gold, because at that time there was a big strike. Not guilty, accuses Scott of persuading him to go on the road for losing his hand. There are also scenes in the film when Scott, Lee Tung Foo and Gabbi Haies are captured by the Indians. They escape because Gabby's mug is learned to shoot at the command and hit the Indians who let our heroes escape. I'm not sure it would be played in Rogers' movie. In addition, the story actually wants you to believe that researcher Randolph Scott accidentally came across a golden strike after just a few lessons of prospector Gabby Haies. how to find gold. This was a fun feature film by Gabbi Haies. It would be better if he came out in a good Western, and he actually did a couple better with Randolph Scott before this. film, this is one of the few Canadian films from the past that did not have any Mounties. But if I am you, if you're not a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Haies, take the next roundabout from Cariboo Trail.
