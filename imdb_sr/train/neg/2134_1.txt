Expect even more with this cast and budget. John Cusack has made films that borders with strange, but still work. Neither he, his sister, nor Ben Ben could do anything to preserve this travesty of bad, poorly written garbage. The film is nothing but a series of cues and bad ones. The action does not go anywhere, the writing is fictitious, meaningless, and the characters are thin. If you consider a film three-dimensional, where story and characters bring depth to images, this stink encounters on a flat surface like a steam ship Mickey. really horrible movie, 1991. Nothing but Trouble. Frankly, this movie is a type of project that kills career and releases agents.
