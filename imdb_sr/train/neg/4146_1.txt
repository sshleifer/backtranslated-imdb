After watching this thing, then reading an abstract on the back of a DVD, then thinking about a real movie .... I became a little dizzy. I thought, maybe I fell asleep and dreamed that I was a baby with a down syndrome that walks through an uninterrupted forest where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop for no purpose, and not occasionally foolish lesbians. Where (zombies?) Come out of nowhere and (vampires?) Which (zavodi?) Pure the heart of citizens on the road to save the world. Neither the zombie nor the vampire meet in particular. The only fight I can remember is that she was stripped of her underwear Bonza Girou. Coo Coo FAT! All of them! Maybe it was because we watched the videscreen stretched and too lazy to change it to its original resolution, but it actually made it even more fun ... In conclusion, my accompanying thought had more continuity, complication, character development, antagonism, object thing, and then acting in its entirety as a movie. This made Bloodraine look like Citizen F *** ING KANE
