As a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse book, I think this series is a totally coarse representation of them. Vampire Bill is not very handsome and looks much older than he described in the book. I discovered that they have already created beautiful colorful characters that look very fluid and vulgar. One of the things I liked around the book is that despite all the shit that goes through Sookie is always a lady, yet in the TV series it does not look like that at all. Not only this, but also the prejudices shown in the television series are not nearly as widely distributed in books. I did not expect an accurate replica of books, but at least I expected it to be used for the series.
