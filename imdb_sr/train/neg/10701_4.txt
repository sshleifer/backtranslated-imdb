Lucky lunatics in London are treasure hunt, and one young woman inadvertently corrects the father of a married politician with a powerful, independent flyer who has never been in love. An intriguing early car for Katharine Hepburn, playing as an Amyli Earhart aviator, who was too involved in surrendering to a man. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and the scriptwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted Gilbert Francois's book) are obviously assigned to this project to get a female view, but why are all the old clich√©s stay intact as frozen artifacts? Billie Burke plays such a simpering woman who returns to bed when something goes wrong, and Hepburn's final scene is another problem. An interesting artifact, but not a classic for Kate observers. ** from the ****
