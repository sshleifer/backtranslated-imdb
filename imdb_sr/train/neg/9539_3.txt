A crowd of children set up a theater to hold a marathon of all-day horror films. However, as the night continues, one of them kills one by one. Who is it ... and why? I saw it on the theater in 1991. I was happy - but, lad! It did not work at all. The premise is good, they have a very attractive young actor and some professionals like Dee Vallace Stone on board ... but that does not work. The story ceases to make sense halfway (this may be due to a major change before the film is released), the killings are relatively bloodless (as this has gotten the R rating), and the discovery of the killer in the end was boring and stupid. It's really bad - this movie had the potential. With a better scenario, this could become a big horor movie. As it stands, though it is largely forgotten, the gypsum itself seems embarrassing about it (I've heard that Stone will not talk about this). I give it 3 and it's just for the actors.
