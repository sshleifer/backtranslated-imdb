Sarah Silverman is currently a comedy of the moon comic. Is it really worth anything? Yes and no. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes hilarious (its routine is actually quite interesting, though not always funny). In other cases, you feel deceived by the media to exaggerate another performer. She is one of those really sympathetic comedians whom men are especially struggling, saying they are digging her intelligence and brains. But if you hook them, most people will admit they just want to sleep with her, and that's why they're watching. It reminds me of why many men hated Margaret Cho and Janeana Garofalo, although none of them are really "hot" in terms of popularity. Sara does not drink or smoke (at least cigars), so she should be hot when she is 60, so her fans (especially men) can rejoice. As for this show, it's very much like her comedy. When it works, it's ridiculous. When that does not happen, it's full of boredom and very, very boring. The AIDS epidemic is the best. It's consistently funny and has some really good satires in it. The character Brian Poeshna has an unhealthy obsession with Tab in one episode, and it's funny to see him in the Tab T-shirt. But they never go with her anywhere, and this ultimately exhausts his welcome. Sarah's character in the series is pretty uncomfortable, the gay couple (Brian Poeshn and some other guy) seem to be drawn and never doing anything for the performance as a whole, and the players who support them (including Sarah's real sister Laura, which does not look like It's OK When the jokes hit, they are brilliant, when they do not, they're terrible, and I mean really terrible, there's an obsession with coprophilia here (aka poop joke), which today replaced the real mind and intelligence in comedy. should you watch this show? If you're in love with Sarah, go. You can LEDAS and pretend it's yours. As for its performance, it ranges from good to absolute zero.
