The creativity of this film has been lost since the very beginning when writers and directors left a good story, only to replace with terrible special effects. This film seemed to be focused on entertaining children, but it could not be achieved. Many small budget films have the potential to become great movies, but this film is not even close to it. Fortunately, this will be another easy-to-make and easy-to-forget movie. This film was probably a chance for actors to make little money on the side until they got a chance for a real role in a good movie. Anyone who has little respect for movies should avoid watching this movie at any cost.
