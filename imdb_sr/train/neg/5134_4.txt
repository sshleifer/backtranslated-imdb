It seems that SCARECROVS is an unsuccessful horror that encounters a supernatural film. A group of robbers withdraws a paramilitary payroll at the Pendleton camp in California. They raise a freight plane that kidnappes a pilot and his daughter with requests to fly to Mexico. On the way, a greedy robber decides to save himself with money that fits into a cornfield that is followed by a strange scarecrow. These are not just scarecrows ... that I can kill. The acting is no better than a terrible dialogue. And humor is not funny. Very low budget and shot completely in the dark. The cast includes Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B.J. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
