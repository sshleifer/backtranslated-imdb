If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend $ 9 on a used tutorial, not on this movie. I'm a little worried that the money I spent is used to buy Kool-Aid for delivery in Guyana. I think the directors did not make any sense, but it seems that they may have tried to make several: 1) Science can explain everything we do, which means that our lives are deterministic; 2) Science can not be used to explain everything we do, which means that we have free will; 3) Science is, like, really cool, brother; 4) We are God; 5) The world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is a difficult role to follow and 7) here, put this little paper square into your mouth and you'll see some really groove stuff.
