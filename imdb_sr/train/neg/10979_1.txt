The words can not begin to describe how this film is horrible. I wish it was "so bad that it was good," but it did not. It's just blunt, lifeless and boring. It's so bad that I could not even laugh at it. In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the film. The only person who is less charismatic is the director Brett Kelli, who, as a true statement of vanity, is a male leader. They both look like inbreeds, sister and brother. Gal, Sherri Thurig, looked. The complete opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and wild, and she can work. Although you can say that she refuses. All actors seem to be retaining, especially the one who supports, Mark. I saw fewer trees in a rainy forest, but he's even better than Kelly. Why would Kelly keep the actors in the act? Is he really a bad director? Everyone else has summarized the story perfectly - there is no. The children were kidnapped, and Kelly started to solve the crime. I know how he felt like walking in a poo, that's how I felt after I watched his movie. This is the home movie that best left it to be seen by the directors' friends (and if you search them, you will see that these same friends were the ones who gave positive ratings to the movie).
