*** One of the ten stars *** For if it was, it gets F. Sv. I mean, I gave her every reasonable accommodation since it was a direct video movie, but she let me down at every step. Like many other B films, the basic story was decent and filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but execution was ridiculous. It is a shame that the good name of the Halloween was attributed to this fiasco. The premise surrounds some of the frenetic garbage bags in which their annual fund for the haunted house of Halloween is held, when the Satanic book of spells comes out of nowhere and throws fellows from the fraternity to living hell. Well, this is an idea, but instead, most of the film is dedicated to showing these scout connections among these boys, abounds with an incredible lesbian background. Very little of the real story is dedicated to the Witch Night or the mystery book of spells. This actually leads me to think that the filmmakers thought I could get away with such dribbling. The film is essentially related to frat color relationships. This is NOT what the movie charges. I am tempted to find the manufacturers and to at least prevent them from injuries. The acting is as bad as it gets, it's terrible! The script is inadvertently funny. Cinema is simply lazy. The whole movie is an amateur night. This film actually makes movie productions of SiFi channels look like masterpieces. The last half hour of the film seemed to be that filmmakers realized they did not produce a soap opera and that they had to insert some kind of horror sequences. The book of evil spells finally enters the game and turns everything into a haunted house into a character dressed. I almost feel crying as I write this review. Wow! I mean vov! This thing was an incomprehensible crippled disaster.
