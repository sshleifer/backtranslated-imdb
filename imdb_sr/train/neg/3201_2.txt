Joe Don Baker is a good and good actor in small roles here and there ... he was good at Goldeney and made a pretty good Bond in The Living Dailights and appeared in various other films. One thing he can not do is carry the film as a leader, who is in this extremely bad movie about the revenge in Malta. Joe Don's partner was killed by killing the murderer's brother and escorting the killer to Italy, but some boys cause the plane to land in Malta and the killer escaped. The rest of the movie is seen with Joe Don who is murdered there and there, Joe Don is taken into custody for various times, Joe Don tortures the barter and interrupts and so on. The film is pretty bad and you will not find yourself just for the character of Joe Don. You'll be stunned as many times as Joe Don's hero gets out with one shot and how incompetent he is. The crowning part of the film comes when Joe Don catches a killer all over Malta with a killer in a priest, and then in boats, and he searches them across Malta. This film also has one of the worst endings to the end of the film.
