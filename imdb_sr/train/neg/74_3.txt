They construct this as a kind of fantasy Man from the Snow River meets Butch Cassidy and the kid of Sundance, and only for the romantic touch Ned and Joo play with high class talent, young wives of rich elderly men. OK, there are many myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also many well-documented facts, which still leave room for artistic creativity in the production of good historical dramatization. I mean, this is not a story about Robin Hood, not the Arthurian legend, not Beovulf, is not someone whose life is so wrapped up in the fog of many past centuries that every recreation of their lives and time amounts to 99% of guesswork. Just a few lives. My grandparents were already at school when Ned was hanged. So it's stupid to imagine that this film is a serious attempt to tell the story of Kelly. After I recently read Peter Carey's great novel "The True History of Kelly Gang," I eagerly expected it to be the same. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger was making fun of the 1970s. Kelly was probably far closer to reality and a better movie as a whole, which does not say much about it. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that it cost me only two dollars to rent a DVD! I'll give him 3/10, and that's just because some of the beautiful shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.
