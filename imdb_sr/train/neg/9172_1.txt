When I go to see a movie about zombies, I do not expect the Oscars, I do not write at the level of Kuma, but I expect the actors at least do not look like they are trying to read their cards and the dialogue does not sound like it's typed 10 minutes before the actor read in the camera. This film was terrible, I actually got up and walked for about 25 minutes and went to the neighborhood and looked at Cold Creek Manor, which was not very good, but it seemed like Citizen Kane in relation to this bunch of shit. On the plus side, the girls were very nice, that's probably the only thing that kept me in the headquarters for more than the first 5 minutes, actually I went after the hottest was killed, there was nothing to keep me after that.
