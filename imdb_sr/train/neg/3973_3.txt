The acting was bad, but in horror, I can live with that if the story is good. It was not. The initial event was an awkward and obvious trick to use the worship of most people towards children. OK fine. Fast forward to the "place in the country" where they will recover emotionally. I love the revelation of ghosts. OK, cool - this will be a supernatural story of horrors, with rotten things partly in our world, partly in ... wherever. Then the action starts pulling like a dog with three heads in the cats and birds' crash - Is there an evil force that tries to attack them directly? Is there an evil force that tries to attack them directly - to make people horrible things that they would not really do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the entire REGION is some kind of psychic echo chamber in which ambient disagreement can resonate with murder? Okay, wait, maybe it's just a little mentally intricate "Delbert" -that is a rare boy who misses his mom and on some kind of joy like K-Tel Norman Bates dropped? Oh, yes - extra points off: the only black character seems to be the grandson of "Our band" pullman porter. The actor plays the way he can, given the touching dialogue, but the fact is that his purpose is "you're done with the boss!" At least they wrote him smart enough for the GTF from there. The little girl's silence and retreat was definitely scary, as was the chick in the shower. These were just two very tasty flavors in this movie. The problem is that they are combined in non-compliant ways, such as a bit of a chopper, a bite of chocolate and a bite of the Gummi Bear. Every one is great but mixed? Bleah! Such a potential. Vasted.
