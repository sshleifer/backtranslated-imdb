When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) begins to look at her brother's death, she begins to suspect something more sinister than the "natural causes". The closer it gets to the truth, the more it becomes a threat to its own power, Fioni (Helga Line) and other local satanists. She will do everything she needs to stop her roads. If you are in bad movies with satanic themes, Black Candles has much to offer. The film is filled with abundance of nudity and ritual soft-core sex. One scene, especially in connection with a young woman and a goat, must be seen to be believed. Unfortunately, all the stench in the world can not save black candles. Most of the movies are total boredom. Except for the scene I have already mentioned, many scenes of sex are not shocking and certainly not sexy. The act is at best noticeable. Even the genre of the favorite Helga Line gives disappointing performance. The plot really does not matter. It seems his main function is to keep a series of boring sexual scenes together. I know only one more film directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared to his Daughter's daughters who mingle with eroticism and horror, black candles fall as amateur. 3/10 is the best I can.
