This series is the CBS network responding to the success of the Great Valley. It was 90-minute west as well as the ABC program. Although this was the answer, he did not have things that last season 2. The problem really became the reality that was lost in this show. For example - in one episode, Johnny pulls his eye out of the stick. Incredibly, until the end of the show, Johnny was completely cured. In addition, the stories about it were not nearly as strong as the Great Valley. This is a show I would not like DVDs, and I sincerely hope it will never be released. You're considering, as CBS has run out of a lot, they've re-used many familiar settings. This was one of the last Western series of CBS produced as Western ones that were not popular in the seventies.
