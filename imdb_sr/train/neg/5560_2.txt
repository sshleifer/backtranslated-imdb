It seems to be moving in shape, every movie in which Dolph Lundgren plays is bad! I do not know whether the story is full of holes, or that Dolph is such a bad actor. There is no spoiler here, it seems to be late to pushing and pushing and touching in this movie. In my opinion, it is a miracle that some of these projects find risky capital to come to the can and theater.
