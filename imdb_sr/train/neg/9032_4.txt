I never understood Garba's appeal. It always appears in movies as if it was stuck, not very attractive, and that boring voice that could suffocate the tube section. She was also a very limited actress, as Gloria Swanson was much better left in a quiet era. In her latest film, her performance is very average and even unprotected. She tries, but it does not come to anything, because the script is worse than her acting. And it would be a romping that was never convincing and would never come down from the ground (although Melvin Douglas succeeds In the air we ski in skiing scenes, which are really the only interesting thing in here. <br /> There was a potential, but the scenario fails in almost every department, spending every actor in it. Douglas and Garbo had good enough chemistry, but this is not even a place at Ninotchka, which I also found to be extremely overestimated .
