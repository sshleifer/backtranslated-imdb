There are similarities between "Jindabine" of Raja Lawrence and his latest film "Lantana" ?? dead body and its consequences for more dysfunctional lives. But while "Lantana" offered hope and resolution, "Jindabine" leaves everything unresolved in a gloomy way that will leave most viewers unhappy, perhaps even deceived. a body floating in a distant river - is based on a short story by Raymond Carver. He became an element in the classic ensemble of Robert Altman in 1993. Short Cuts. Lavrence uses this topic to explore and express relationships within the small Australian community under stress. The film asks some moral questions: "Would you allow the discovery of a dead body to ruin your good weekend?" and even sharper for the Australians "Would it matter if the dead person was an intern?" The acting, especially Gabriel Birne and Laura Linnei, is praiseworthy. And there are elements of mysticism enhanced by music, not as "Picnic in the Hanging Wall". If all this sounds like the basis for a great movie - be ready to drop, the pace is very slow and the killing is shown near the beginning, which eliminates the element of the mystery. And so we stayed with those empty lives and an empty ending.
