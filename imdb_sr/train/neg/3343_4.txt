An interesting story about a soldier in a war who failed to save the young girl's life from the enemy and was persecuted by this event, although he saved many other captured children. The film shines with a head and this soldier is now a high school teacher, managed mostly by policemen patrolling corridors, baths, and even classrooms. In other words, high school is a prison, and most children give very little attention to their teachers or principal. Dolph Lundgren, (Sam Decker) plays a soldier / teacher and decides to stop teaching and go to another area. However, the director asked him to have a Clerical Class as his last duty as a teacher. At this moment in the film, when all hell breaks and the story becomes a complete BOMB. Try to enjoy it if you decide to look at IT!
