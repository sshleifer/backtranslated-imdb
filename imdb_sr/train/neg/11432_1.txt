I watched this movie yesterday and I was very disappointed. Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh basically had to carry this unusually incredible scenario for five hours (or how long it actually was). From the very beginning, every element of this film is incredible. This film has giggled me several times, but mostly they were out of shock because the director / writer was expecting to believe in many disorderly elements that were trying to make this film together. The focus of the film is Graya (Graham) and her problems with intimacy. Things become interesting when they realize that she and her brother are unexpectedly too common. Interesting, intriguing. However, instead of revealing this story to something convincing and tasteful, the director constantly leads Gray into these ridiculous reversals which in fact do not make any sense at all. As a LGBT individual, this film seems to repeat what all heterosexuals think we are going through the exit process. (I would insist if the writer is a kueer.) If there was no sweet chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which was otherwise comprehensively forced), I would give her the negative 3 stars.
