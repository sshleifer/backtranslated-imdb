With all the excessive violence in this movie, it could have been NC-17. But the blood could have been pg-13 and there were plenty of curses when Mom had an original guy with bad haircuts. There was a lot of character development that made the movie better for watching, and after the kid returned to life as a scarecrow, he was a foolish clock and ten minutes away from him killing people. Violence was overly exaggerated and I think the number of bodies is greater than twelve, which is a huge number for films like this one. Almost every character in the film is stabbed or cut off by a head, but the teacher who called him "white garbage" and "hoodlum" (although the character's character is nothing else to the hooligans, even close, I know the hoods and I do not draw it in class, sit there and throw things at teachers). The teacher earned more terrible death than any of the characters, but only stabbed her back. There were two uncertain scenes in the film, but they did not last long to be scary at all. As I said, the murders were excessive, and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story become cut off. If it was fun to see above, then it would be nc-17. Two children describe the body they find in cornfields, describing it as much worse than it actually was, explaining to the policeman that red wolves were crawling in worms. His stomach was not open, so there was no way in his stomach that the worms were in the stomach, although I would like to see it. The acting was pathetic, the characters were losers, and the scarecrow could have done many gymnastic stops. I suggest that I rent this film for death scenes, I will not see it sooner, but I enjoyed excessive violence. Also, do not bother with the sequel, I looked for five minutes and I got bored to death, sounds good, but not. The original scarecrow was actually interested in me.
