Somewhere in this movie is a half-hour episode from the Twilight Zone that tries to get out. While the Cube was tense, well-made, claustrophobic and attractive to the mind, I am afraid that Cipher is an overwhelming, boring re-examination of several well-worn topics that simply do not contribute much, especially if you've seen almost any other half-way decent sci-fi movie. Cipher manages to pull its way through a relatively short 95 minutes to an incomplete ending. None of the characters are excluded, and for a film made in 2002, technology is truly a cheese. It's hard to connect this tired and uninspired film with director Cube. It's not a bad movie, but it's definitely not good. When you watched the grass grow and dye the color and bore your insect, then surely watch this movie, but other activities will probably prove to be more stimulating.
