There are not many good things that could ever be said about Underneath, Soderbergh's untrue efforts in neo-noir. Soderbergh is faithfully restoring the decent noir of Criss-Cross Robert Siodmak, without changing the scene to anything, but the adaptation is exhausting from every modern atmosphere of the film noir, giving her the same story that places the least attractive, lifestyle and anachronisms. Soderbergh, who will later make great movies about crimes such as Out of sight and a series of ocean of great style and atmosphere, leads a dangerous path to modernization by renovating the story of the poorest, deepest and most prolific modes of the early 1990s. Night clubs have horrible, disgusting garage bands, an inconsequential version of the anti-hero Burt Lancaster leaves his femme fatale girlfriend for compulsory purchase of kinematic lifelike modern appliances such as stereo devices, televisions and other newest pieces of equipment that suck up the reaction from the movie. It could have been more fun and less annoying that he had several rescue merits such as a good score, more meat to his characters, more than just Villiam Fichtner who performs performances that are not. t wooden, sharper pace. Unfortunately, Underneath has none of this. Soterbergh, a fine director, does not use his dry move this time for the benefit of his film. This disposition works miraculously when he launches a multi-language crime film in his face, such as George Clooney's previously mentioned images, or social or characteristic drama such as traffic or sex, lies and video tape. With a movie like Underneath, it enhances the boredom that the viewer experiences.
