I never expect the film adaptation to follow the novel (especially loved, as the evening), but when I saw that the author of the book, Susan Minot, scriptwriter and executive film producer, I thought that evening would be a good adaptation. If you enjoyed the book, do not bother with this movie. It's far from the book that the two of them can barely remind each other. Here our characters are completely different: the bride is in love with Harris. Harris is the housewife's son. Buddy is a drunkard, in love with Ann and / or Harris. I do not think any characters have been made from book to screen; Oh, it just worsens with every moment. And, really, we did not learn from Madison County's borders to cut from a story that we thought to be enchanted, to the scenes of our heroes, grown-up children who have unpleasant and minor fights, just do not work on the movie? This film is a disaster. Skip.
