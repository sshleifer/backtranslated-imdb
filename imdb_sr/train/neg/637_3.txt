Good Earth is not a good movie in any way, it's a way to be plain. Maybe it was different in the thirties, but who would like to see the life of a farmer. This is not interesting to me. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni are great performers, but the film took place too long. I could tell you the end of this film with the first act. In short, Wang Lung (Muni), a small farmer who does not want to be like his father, turns out to be like him. They both fall in love with their wives, just as they are on the death knots. The film makes a complete 360 ​​from one generation to the next. And this film did not have good acting actors nor funny moments, it only depressed things about the duration as farmers in times of crisis.
