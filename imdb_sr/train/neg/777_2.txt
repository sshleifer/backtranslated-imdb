I can not believe that this is tilted, the humorous material is being transmitted to the Americans as artistic home material. Early, from such lines as "we want to be sure to play for the right team" and manipulating framing and lighting, the love divided shows the right face. The cruel way that Irish Catholics are portrayed as hegemonic, Protestants as peaceful and subjugated, is equally a bad representation of history as the early American Westers who describe the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of the story is distorted by the stereotypes and the open humiliation of Irish Catholics in the story; corruption recognized by the authors themselves! It is sad that people today still think that they can win moral influence by making a film that is so easy to recognize for its obvious intent, away from attempts of art. This film has no business in any legitimate cinema or library.
