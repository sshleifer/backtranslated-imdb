De Niro is a master ... one of my favorites. And I love good sports movies in baseball so much, but hey, his sports movies, right? I expected much more for this film. It seems to start well: DeNiro is what I expected; Snipes who I really do not like is as good as a spoiled star. Barkin's role for me was OK. She is a good actress, but she looked as if she was not in this role. It seemed to me that they always seemed to push the scenes, and then it was a little pulling. It just seemed like I was so uneven! Given the role and the action, it could have been much better. I rated it '4', and I was generous I'm trying with numbers!
