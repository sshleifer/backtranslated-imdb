Almost every detail detail in this film is illogical and unbelievable. She has no vision of a human story, dead and boring. It's a parody on Hollywood, with trumpet music pieces that remind you of Denzel Washington's film, uncertain camera shots and focus, racist stereotypes, absolutely unnecessary and comic shots and gestures of famous people in the clothing catalog. It is designed to satisfy a multitude of zombies whose meaning in life comes from viewing the names of celebrities. The only good thing in the movie is the ultimate bonus and funky song that follows it. I feel like an idiot watching this, save yourself.
