I watched this on the tube last night. The actor who was involved first attracted my attention. The first scenes were more careful. Some funny sad ones. Good character development. I felt that the last third of the film had diverged. If there was not an early part of the film, I would stop watching. I continued to look at how I wanted to connect together. Unfortunately, I feel that this never happened. Especially I did not like the extension period that several characters spoke Yiddish (?). Was it another shoe? Would you recommend? No, I do not think so. As other reviewers say that it is much slant dated (60th years), but that was not too confusing. Completion turned off completely.
