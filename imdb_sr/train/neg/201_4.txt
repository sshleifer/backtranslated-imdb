Iberia is nice to see on TV. But why do you see this on the silver screen? A lot of dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance, it could be your date movie. But otherwise, one and a half hours is too long. If you want to see a skillful dance on a silver screen, it's better to see a movie from Bollivood. They know how to combine dancing with breath and long film. Director Carlos Saura knows that he is shooting old experiences. And it's time to look really good. but when the movie is one and an hour should be at least most of the time interesting. There are many types of art, not everything is greater than life and this film is not too big.
