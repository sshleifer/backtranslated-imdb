I've never seen anything as horrible as this movie for some time. The film was a boring, long and long complication. Special effects are bullshit like hell - It's like watching a movie in 1999. It's a total loss of about an hour and a half of my time. Matthew Settle's performance was pretty bad. I saw him in the Band of Brothers playing Lt.Speirs, he was not bad. In fact, it's not bad at all. But in this film his acting was not convincing enough, it was pretty bad and there was no chemistry between the rest of the team. Plus, his eyes are empty as if he does not feel it. It was surprising, indeed, because he was good at the Band of Brothers. In any case, do not even try to watch this movie. It's a big big waste of time. Even if you had to kill an hour or two, take something else but watch this movie. Believe me, you will regret it!
