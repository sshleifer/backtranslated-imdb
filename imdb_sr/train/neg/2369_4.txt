The sixth escape for Freddie Krueger, in which he finally managed to kill almost every young man in Springwood; now wants to expand its horizons and (** SPOILER **) needs a family member to do it. Failure as a horror movie because it's simply not frightening. It works better like a dark, dark black comedy, to tell you the truth. Freddy Krueger is now deprived of all his ability to cool down this viewer. (Too wise, that's for sure.) The actors are not interesting (except Robert Englund, as always, and obviously Iaphet Kotto) and simply have too many visual effects. The finale is fine, but it does not give as much spark as I think it could be hoped for. Adding a new twist to the famous story of a killer of dreams, Englund gives an opportunity to do more non-makeup. scene than ever before. There are also comedies worth mentioning: a joint comedy of Roseanne and Tom Arnold, who was deprived of fun, the corresponding comedian, Alice Cooper's veteran shockwoman, and the funny comedy Johnny Depp, who also recognizes the pop icon he became. Film debut by Breckin Meier, who plays Spencer. One of the best things about this is to repeat the key scenes from previous entries during the final loan. 4/10
