Kurosawa really ruined this. Any genius is allowed failure. The concept is fine, but execution is very blurred. There is a film of fantasy about this movie that makes it something artistic. Poverty in Tokyo deserves a fairer and more realistic view. Many of them have interesting stories. Very disappointing movie.
