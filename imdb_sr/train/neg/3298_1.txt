When I heard that Dukes of Hazzard would be rearranged with current actors and a solid script, I was like, "Okay, I'll give him a chance, it will not be better than the first, but we'll see what's going on." Well, I saw what happened. I saw a big concert of the late '70s and' 80s, which was a classic, basically humiliated by Hollywood. It's sad to see that Hollywood scriptwriters can not come up with something original these days. It seems they made a great show that had a big target audience and tried to "REMAKE" a classic shov. HEADS UP Hollivood ... DO NOT WORK !!!! Anyway, more about the show. I think they could play a better actor than Sean Villiam Scott (Stiffler from American Pie) to play Bo. I am sure that John Schneider is definitely disappointed that his character is portrayed and exploited. Also, for the real thing, Johnny Knokville, like Luke Duke. How low can you go? A stupid stupid actor who plays sweet Luke. That hurts me. Also, I will give Jessica Simpson a beautiful woman, but her acting is bullshit. Catherine Bach, who played the original Daisy, was a smart, sexy, strong, stubborn and good IL's southern girlfriend. She was every age from a little girl! (I had a doll and a jeep - thank you very much!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a smart ass, a 2-bit slut like Daisy Duke. Daisy was never a blonde. Why they had to throw it away. Jessica Alba would play a great Daisy Duke. She can speak with a great southern accent, and she is beautiful, and she would do a wonderful job. In any case, I would like to say that this film ruined something fiercely. I feel like I was robbed by paying $ 8.50 for tickets, and they should give me the money. If you like Dukes of Hazzard (original series), you do not see this movie. It will only upset you. CMT (countri music television) plays Ducks' reprise all the time later at night. Set TIMO and go with the right thing, not imitation on the big screen in Hollivood.
