This piece of dirt is practically impossible to follow. The sound is shit that the picture quality goes from bad to bad to good and bad! Things happen without obvious reason because characters appear and disappear. Did the director suffer from a massive brain injury during his production? Bad making movies aside, the story is disgusting, just sick evil sh * t allei. And if the simulated murder scenes are not enough, you can enjoy the snippets of real people who have been executed. I watched almost everything, but I had to turn off after I saw some brains ejected. I've never seen a movie that left me so shameful and dirty.
