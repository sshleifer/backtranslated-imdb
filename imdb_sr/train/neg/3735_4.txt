Actress Patti Duke wrote an insightful, entertaining, coarse book about her acting career, crazy life in crazy clothes and her manly depressing episodes and suicide attempts that she almost drove for ever. With this rich drawing material (and Patti playing in the final act), one might think that a TV director, such as Gilbert Cates, could link it all to the film, but "Call Me Anna" is a pale shadow of Duke's autobiography . For those who have not read the book, the sketched narration (jumping ahead in time) does not absorb, we are never allowed to deal with what is happening, and production seems to be tainted due to a low budget. Actors are wrong, and the value that Duke finally appears is not worth it - the false reality of the film is so dense at this time that Patti can not bring stability to the script. It seems that the producers were honest enough (and aware) to disturb the film in an uproar against Duke's ultimate diagnosis and mental freedom, but they left out many dramatic possibilities in that process.
