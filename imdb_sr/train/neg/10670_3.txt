Flat characters that you do not have and will never be interested in. The dialogue causes shaking in places. There are no turns (they think they have one, but if you do not understand it after about 40 minutes, you're not too bright). Many well-known actors in roles and performances who, fortunately for everyone involved, will be forgotten as soon as the credits are over. I do not mind 'slowing' the movies, but they have to be going _somevhere_. This is not. The action was not what made this movie a direct DVD, it's just a pretty convenient excuse to try to crack some false controversy. <br /> <37 (!) Ten (10) ratings must be from people involved in the production.
