Watching Marlen Brando on the screen is like watching a masters of carpenters carving the tangled details into a piece of mahogany. Brand acting is the only thing that makes this movie visible. The action is meaningless and ridiculous (not comical). It seems that other great actors desperately try to show little humanity to characters ... these characters have the wisdom of wet cardboard. Everything about the technical side of this film is either central or simply terrible. The director casts a freezing threshold and slow-down footage of it unpunished. By-pass music is caricatured and destroys any hint of dramatic effect. It's not something I really want in the movie, but even the closet was far away. Dear Brando, he could not ignore the terrible cloths in which he was dressed. I heard this film called "David Linch-eskuire" and "unfairly ridiculous" ... it is neither. David Linch's films come from evil creativity - this film was by no means creative. And do not mess with contempt with stupidity.
