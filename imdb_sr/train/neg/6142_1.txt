Gimkata is no doubt one of the worst films ever made. But it's not a bad type of bad movie. This is so terrible it's fun to watch and laugh. Kurt Tomas obviously has no lucrative career in acting. He should return to the gymnastics. But who can forget such unforgettable scenes as a tall chalk bar, stone horses or a five-minute scene through the lunar village in a slow motion. I think it was not that bad, but who knows. It's not art, but if you want something light and fluffy to make a good conversation, rent a gym. Makes a party.
