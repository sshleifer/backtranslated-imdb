This movie was great !! (Not as good as Leif Garrett's masterpiece Longshot), but still excellent! I thought Ashley looked strange compared to Marie-Kate in this movie. I wonder why. Who would have thought they could pull off with such places and almost get out of it? Dad was some kind of jerk, and Mom was too tearful with Helmit's head. I give it to him 4. Anyone who loves this movie has to check out Longshot.
