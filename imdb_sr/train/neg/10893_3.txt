This is one of those films that should have been better than it turned out. I was afraid to think how the editing approved by the Blockbuster seemed to be, because the DVD director's director was boring with epic proportions. Of course, you do not expect it to be a "Kum", but the acting or two acting may have been welcome. Also, there were so many cute guys in this movie, but they were desperately underused. I like to watch how the bird is moving in its BVDs as the next guy, but even I have the right to expect more. However, this was not a complete loss; At least we've stormed into Drev Fuller (covered) garbage and a really disturbing hairstyle. There is also Huntley Ritter, which seems even better than "Bring It On" (and it also plays). There are always silver coatings, kids. You just need to look very hard for it. And occasionally you have to use the pause button.
