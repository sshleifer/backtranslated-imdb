I saw this film with low expectations and I was not disappointed. It's so bad that it's really funny in a very rough way. Gael is absolutely awesome, I think he just can not react. He should now give up, because acting obviously is not his thing. His stars are the same caliber, I'm sure my 5-year-old cousin could do a better job than all of them! The director should be ashamed of putting his name on something so ridiculous. Somehow I do not think Oscar is on cards for this guy. I never wrote a comment on IMDb, but this film was so bad that I felt compelled to do it. If you get the chance to see this movie, do not 0/10 if there was 0
