This is a really bad movie, with bad acting and a very boring pace Lorenzo Lamas is really cool! All the characters are just boring (except for the Lama), and absolutely no one has to shout or worry! Plus the action is very boring. The movie gives us 3 criminals who were supposed to find threats and disturbances when it was really boring, funny and just a bunch of morons I wanted to silence! Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma, but he can not save this shit, and I believe it or not, the opening was really cool, as it was the end, however, the environment is incredibly boring, and she told me that I need to push the button for fast rewinding in advance !, plus The dialogue is particularly funny! There is a cool bar scene that I really liked, but when Lamas goes to the docks, everything breaks apart, plus a scene in which the villains are torturing Jennifer's family and kills them It should have been disturbing when it's actually funny! This is a really bad movie, with bad acting and a very boring pace, Lorenzo Lamas is cool, but that's not enough, it's not recommended. The direction is very bad. George Erschbamer is doing a very bad job here, with central work with the camera, a mild location, and holding the film on a boring rhythm. The acting is pretty bad (except for Lamas). Lorenzo Lamas is great here, and although he is not obliged to act, he is quite entertaining to watch, and he has a really cool character, and he had a lot of charisma, but even he can not save this, without chemistry with the actors! (Lamas Rules!). Josie Bell is terrible here, and while looking decent, she is not very convinced and she did not have chemistry with Lamas. Cheril Jeans is hot, but there's not much to do, but screaming and scared, she did it well. Robert Scott was incredibly boring as the main loser, and was not at all dangerous at all, he was as hilarious as others. Other actors are bad. Overall Avoid! Avoid! Even if you love Lamas (like me). * from 5
