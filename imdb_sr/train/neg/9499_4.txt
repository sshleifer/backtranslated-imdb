I thought the movie was a bad documentary. It was not discussed about the essence. It seemed to have diminished ideas and did not provide anything new. The film had no miracles or romance or anything that would lead to science. Most scientists looked "stereotyped" and sometimes weird. One woman said that her awards were not of great importance, only children were helped. She said that after a ten-minute scene where she explained all her rewards. We play "a modest scientist", right? "I have the equations that dance in my head," others said. I do not see how this explains this to us. It did not cover the significant effects of science on our culture. The science of science has barely been touched. Not bad for 10-14 years. Besides, I felt it was boring and undetected. 4/10
