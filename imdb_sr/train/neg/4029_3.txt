The idea of ​​the story behind the LOST SPACE is not at all bad, but unfortunately the story becomes somewhat boring to the middle and excessive use of the footage, and the bad special effects push this film to a subordinate level. /> Film begins with a rocket to Earth. In panic because they will strike the Earth, the Soviets will be able to reject the object. However, this is not necessarily good, because this seemingly unmanned ship has a trace of steam that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now on a low orbit above the planet. In other words, with every situation that follows, a stench follows - one that could potentially kill us all !! So, on good US scientists (headed by a very young and hardly recognizable Robert Loggie) is to formulate and plan to save us - and in particular save New York who is in his immediate flight! Unfortunately, they are not able to save Ottawa (I've never been there, so I can not say whether it's a big loss or not) but thanks to a good old American honey, they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction !! So, as you can see, the idea of ​​a story is not bad and pretty original. But so many old clips of battle planes and guys with radar bands became a bit old and it looked like padding. All in all, a decent, but hard-inspired movie that extreme fans of the genre can love - everyone else, they see it at their own risk.
