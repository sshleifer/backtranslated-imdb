Average original picture of Sci-Fi channel. A little, but not much. Submarine with nuclear power U.S.S. Jimmi Carter is on a mission deep under ice ice near the North Pole when attacked by giant super-charged electric eels. A crew member (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) thinks she has devised a way to communicate with monsters, but there is not much chance for unclear reasons. Among the crew are: David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Vhalen. This movie could have been a bit better that eels / monsters were not so cartooned.
