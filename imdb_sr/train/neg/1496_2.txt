Bad breed is a very strange twitch which, unfortunately, is not good. The beginning of the film looks promising, but in general it is a disaster. The dialogue is pretty bad, but not as bad as acting. The acting is brutal and unbearable. characters deliver lines horribly and even if it is deliberate, the method does not work because the characters become unfriendly. Some of the killings are innovative, but it took too much time to get to them. we get the first death (except at the beginning) and then almost every other character is smoking in the next five minutes. The film then turns into a kind of false lie with funny characters, unrealistic karate like fighting, and a scene in which Man pulls outfits from his * sscrack. None of it is ridiculous. It's just funny. The film becomes ultra-bloody and ultra-meaningless. Most of the characters are clickable even for slasher standards and is as solid as Ter left at the counter for 5 days. Evil Breed is not even ridiculous, so she fails in her main task. Look at the Tekas Chainsav Massacre, Just Before Dawn, or see No Evil for the real slasher.
