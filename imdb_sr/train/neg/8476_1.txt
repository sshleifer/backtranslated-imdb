this film was a horrible excuse for ... a movie. First of all, casting could have been better; The main character Katelin did not look like a TV mother. Also, the plot was pathetic. It was extremely cliché and predictable. The ending was very disappointing and cheesy. (but that's all I will say about it). But the nail in the bag was a scene when Katelin (Jordan Hinson) was crying, but the girl could not cry by order! there were no tears running down her face, only a few incredible chatter. she is not a dynamic actress at all. she gave the same fake laugh identical to that of Hillary Duff at lizzie Maguire (sp?). when the film went from not so good to bad. It looked like she was acting. In short: this movie was very bad! it was some sort of mixture of every kind of cliché of the 1990s childhood movie, from which everyone is sick - just worse! b / t / v, I kept it when I saw it). However, you may like it if you have 9 or less. ;)
