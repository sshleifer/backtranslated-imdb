30 seconds to the introductory credits, I had the feeling that it would be a bad movie, but I did not know how bad it was. Then the actor who plays the evil Nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and I decide that in order to survive this film, we have to reduce the volume, make our own dialogue and double the speed on the DVD. But that did not help. We turned it off half way. Now, I have survived some very bad films before, with and without the assistant of "Misteri Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie", but there are only some movies that I doubt even Bots can save. The bulk of the film that bothered me most was that people were hypnotized in the belief that zombies rub their green skin. I suppose everyone was hypnotized to death, and then hypnotized to rotate themselves. Stick to the true classic B-movie classic like "Plan Nine of the Universe".
