I wish I could give this film a zero of ten. Before I went to this film the day after it came out, I came to the IMDb to check the comments. The commentary called the film predictable and cheesy with a terrible dialogue. I never go for someone else's opinion, so I lost seven dollars for this movie. That had to be one of the LARGEST movies I've ever seen. The person who wrote the script should be pushed from the cliff. Since when scary movies have squeaky scenes? I swear, I am amazed that there were not moments of HUG GROUP. I think I jumped. One time. And that's because I zonal, thinking about my research work in English. Clich√©s, birds / cat appear out of nowhere when you thought something would happen. And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost died of laughter when the alarm went off, and the main character said: "I have to get a joke of a mum !!!" You. Idiot. Fuck a joke! Security is just a few steps away, but NO, the mother scarf (which does not match the dress) is more important than my health and safety. And to finish it all, she was taken back to her house, knowing that the killer knew where she lives. God. My friend and I also envisaged a TOTAL film. And not only, I bet she is hiding under the bed, moments. It was, "He stole the seller's clothes and sneaked out of the hotel" and "The detective came down the hallway, not the killer!" moments. Movies NEVER should be predictable. Disney movies are not even predictable. Now I will finish my speech, saying, this was a horrible movie. I'm glad I went to see him in the movies, so I would not buy him for $ 15.00 and then I would hate him. It was just bad. It would be better if only one thing happens. If after the murder by the detective, the killer fell to the same position as he was shot. A knife in his hand, dropping and hitting a girl on the way down. Oh, how wonderful it would be. It does not waste time and money. Go see a good movie.
