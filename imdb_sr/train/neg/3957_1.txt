The original Boogeiman was a silly but fun supernatural slasher movie. It was by no means a big movie, but fun in the right spirit. The third installment in this series, Return of the Boogeiman, on the other hand, is simply cruel. It consists of two things. First, cheap and lifelike new footage. Second, LOADS recycled bits from the first movie. The new material is incredibly amateur, but not in a fun way, just incredibly boring. This video is obviously fast and effortless. It serves as a device for framing infinite clips from the first (and possibly other) movies. And the boys, whether those pistons from the previous films are milked; sometimes they reuse sequences. The only new addition to these parts is a voice that senselessly describes exactly what we can see with our own eyes. The whole experience of watching this is really deadening. The return of Boogeiman is an example of the worst kind of exploitation film; which exploits the audience in a very cynical way. I want this review to be short and to the extent that this film no longer deserves. There's nothing valuable here. This is worthless.
