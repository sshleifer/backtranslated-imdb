Oh, what a humiliating film! Set in Los Angeles, the center of the universe of POV Hollywood filmmakers, this film is trying to be a deep social commentary on contemporary American anxiety. Stereotypes, stupid characters of different socio-economic environments cross paths in their everyday lives. The plot is unconnected and empty. Numerous unimaginable works on the film guard the film like: shooting, deserted baby left in the weed, a band of bandits intimidating a lawyer, a man flying through the night sky over the city, a child in a summer camp. And through all these events, one constant is generously helping sociological "insights" transmitted through dialogue, while characters compile notes of their life experiences. One character tells the other: "When you sit on the edge of this thing (the Great Canyon), understand what a joke we humans have ... ... those walls laugh, I can say, myself and my worries; tom Grand Canyon ". The second figure pontifies the meaning of all this: "In this country there is a bay, a wider sink between people who have things and people who donate it ... as if this big hole opened in the country, big as ... The Great Canyon, and what comes out of the flood ... is the rampage of anger, and the rage creates violence ... Apart from the terrible unnatural and forced dialogue, besides the shallow, scanty characters, in addition to the stupid complication, the tempo of the story is agonist. The acting is not inspirational and superficial. The film's tone is self-satisfied and self-satisfied, in the disdainful scenario of viewers. O the film project was approved by the Hollywood suits who love the almighty guru, looking from a height. They think that their film will be startling discovery for us humble, unknown audience films, eager to learn about the true meaning of American social change.
