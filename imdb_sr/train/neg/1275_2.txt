This is a horrible movie. All three stories are in brackets with a psychiatric line of hypnotism that is unnecessary and all the stories are bad. Firstly, it's about wild wolves and some lady, there are some things that do not make sense, but the thing about hypnotism does. The other, with a poor Bill Pacton as a maniac roommate, should not be seen by anyone. The last, unfortunately, the best is almost incomprehensible that makes it better than another garbage.
