I was willing to go with original _Cruel Intentions._ It went along with the plot and remained faithful to the characters of one of my favorite stories. However, this film was, in my opinion, a dark rehash with essentially the same line of story and without a clear choice of character. I did not honestly wonder what happened to any of them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) are characters and their interactions, not the events themselves. It was not clear to me until I read the IMDB that this movie was meant to be bumped, especially since the title includes number "2", I expected to continue, but then I decided that it must be companion. After all, I must say that this film was read, at least to me, as a soft porn version of Les Liasons. I was not impressed.
