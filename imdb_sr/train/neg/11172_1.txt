The undeservedly popular "I Love the Eighties" in 2002 is a senseless, idiotic, abusive and disgusting pop-culture clash in a show that was the first in a long line of horrible television programs that ultimately brought the end of VH1, which at one point is the only real music channel who stayed on TV! I used to live practically on VH1 until spring or winter, I forgot what now, in 2002, when the garbage like this started to appear without any reason. From pure morbid curiosity (I suppose that's what you would call it) I decided to go ahead and look at it anytime I first came in, although the commercials looked like full shit. At least I can honestly say that I was not a bit disappointed by the fact that my expectations were obviously lower in the basement. The emphasis of this show I learned in the first 5 minutes was less for every year of the 1980s and what was and was not culturally significant or popular (which I expected to see), but instead of more improvised platforms for a whole series of really terrible a comedian without a name who would show what they probably think their comedy * Roll eyes * ... more like a lack-if you ask me! Now it's pretty easy to see why no one heard about these idiots before they appeared on this show, because they are all so terribly infertile and pathetic in their attempts of so-called "humor" to swear I can feel my hoses every node with each Warm liners that were shooting one after the other! All in all, I have no problem saying that "I love the 80s" was / is the garbage of the lowest denominator and one of the main reasons why I never see VH1 again.
