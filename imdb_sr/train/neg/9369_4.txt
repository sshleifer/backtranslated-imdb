Although I've heard this film is a bit dry, I'm watching Scott Bakula. At the beginning of this film, I had great hopes for a classic but nice ending Scott-get-girl and up to 20 minutes before the end was going great. The screwdriver was crazy and unexpected and very smart. I kept my fingers in order to turn out and it would all be a terrible misunderstanding, until the moment the loans turned and I realized that there would not be a happy and happy ending. Unfortunately, I was left with regret that I watched it and hastily put on some quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the Great Scott!
