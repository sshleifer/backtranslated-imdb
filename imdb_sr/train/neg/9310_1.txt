OK - I expect this film ... I'm loaning this movie myself - because it made me so stubbornly a fanatic of horror. I've never been able to watch this movie myself. I also heard many stories about the effects he had in his original edition in theaters, spectators. An incredible masterpiece ... A terrible, psychological thing scares my trousers from me. Like it. I thought the whole movie was decent and interesting. This movie is so terrifying - this is the most horrible movie I've ever seen in my life! It's not that what's happening in the film and the idea of ​​a movie is not scary enough, but what's always there is Brendan's incredible acting. The best horror movie EVER. Nothing can be any more terrible. Watching the Night of the Witch on the Fierce.
