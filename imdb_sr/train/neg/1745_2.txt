In the first half of the film, the film had a steady pace and presented the characters. however, suddenly everything went too fast, which was a chromatic reason for Akshei Kumar to come out with three girls, very loud about acting, both from Akshey and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the peak of the film, Paresh Raval was good, but not as good as his performance at Hera Pheri. All in all, this film was the biggest disappointment that the movie has no right to its trailer. Save your money and do not watch this movie, watch Hera Pheri and Hungama again! Summary: A cheap scenic performance and the appearance of a movie without a story or substance, the plot was remarkably good music from the Preetam of the man who bought us Dhoom! Keep it up! the film taken in one room, the newcomers (female actors) were fine because it was their first film, but established actors such as Akshei and John completely disappointed the established director as Priiadarshan gives his worst movie ever!
