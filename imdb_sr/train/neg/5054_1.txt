We know that firefighters and rescuers are heroes: a few ideas would cause. The friends and family of these and others who died in attacks on the World Trade Center could be encouraged by this pointless film. A cute, serious, though bound firefighter, he remembers what lost colleagues can be spoiled for a journalist who turns his fragments into praise. They are considering the results. Something else is mumbling, composing another hymn, etc. Etc. The terrible events that have caused the need for several thousand eulogies are predominantly sad, but this boring drama dramatization is disturbingly boring.
