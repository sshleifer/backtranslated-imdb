SPOILER ALERT! ! ! Personally, I do not understand why Pete did not help save Villiams' life, I think it would be great to know why Villiam was motivated or forced. I think that members of the secret service are everyday people, and there is a rumor that the writer was a member of the Secret Service, now the motivation is clear, well-known. But as a rental, this movie will not satisfy you, cause old, but reversed, average performance used - these are just things in this movie, just because Clark Johnson is holding you as director of SVAT has done a much better job than this time, and more I wonder how the producers (for example, Michael Douglas) left this movie to theaters.
