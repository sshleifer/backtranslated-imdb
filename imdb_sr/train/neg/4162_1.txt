If you really enjoyed the movie Resident Evil in 2002, then you should see it instead of giving up 2 hours that you will never return. I can not believe that nobody commented that this movie is just a cheap RE. First, the "special" commando is a unique defense of an object with a computer matrix that has an AI and a holographic projection. And this "hive" has several traps that inevitably kill one team member at the same time. There is even a chess reference in the code names that was in the RE dialog. Despite the fact that there are no zombies, "Rook", a film foe, is a kind of bio-creature, a very brown color that suggests necrotic tissue, with many cyborg components as a super mutant RE. So, push your finger to Mr. Richard Tailor because he claimed to be responsible for this story. They obviously are not the same movie, but the writer got the idea to watch Resident Evil.
