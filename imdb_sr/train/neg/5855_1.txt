The film was released in early 2000 together with MELA both disasters. So sad for the beginning of the millennium with such glupidity Film seems to fit in the 70s, but it looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000. > Anyway, some classic jewels from the movie: Paresh Raval I do not understand that I laugh at his role or cry. Reason: He goes to search for his mother in the hardest village, when he understands the secret of Anil, he keeps a secret in his stomach that becomes big and makes him I remember pregnant in childhood, my teacher told me the same joke Urrf !!!! In childhood I laughed then, but here? The whole movie is a joke that can not be explained. We have Anil in the double role (One older and younger) and the river plays the older woman and the younger Raveena. We also rejected Harish while Shakti played his son Aruna Irani who struggles with the worst wig. The direction is obsolete Music is poor Anil tries hard to look too old in the younger role and too young in the older role but good effort Rekha is adequate, Raveena is fine Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is awesome Aruna Irani is as usual Rajikant is fine in kameya
