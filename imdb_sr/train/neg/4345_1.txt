I've seen a commercial ... I saw a commercial for Carlitos Vai: Stand up to power that says "From the producer Scarface and Carlith's way" YES TO LET ... Michael Bergman did not produce Scarface, in fact he was an assembling assistant for Scarface . Not to take Bergman's talent ... but in my opinion it should have a little more class. I think I can speak in the name of the mass when I say ... We hate to be obviously light. As far as the film is concerned, it was bad at best. I thought Puff Daddy did a good job. Nevertheless, Luis Guzman should be ashamed to work on this film. All in all, this film did not fill in the gaps for Carlit's way. Obviously, this project was an attempt to make a quick attachment, not a good movie.
