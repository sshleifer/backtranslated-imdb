I do not think I've ever felt that it was down with a movie before. After I loved two previous films by Guia Ritchie (I do not count Svepta Avai - he was a blindfold for a pussy), I was so glad that I would see this. Reviews were bad, and again, I do not trust journalists. More worrying was the fact that internet buzzing was that this was a little stinky, so with some fear he handed me Â£ 4,80 yesterday afternoon. I will not even try to explain this film, mostly because I have no idea what's going on and at one point I was really close to standing up and wondering if I was the one who did not get it! Unfortunately, it seems to me that Ritchie fell into the trap of his wife that he had taken too seriously himself. characters. Almost as if he had a list of films he wanted to cut off, here are some of the ones I noticed: Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, Ordinary Suspects, Vanilla Ski. . I find it most frustrating that the performances of two main actors, Jason Statham and Raia Liotte, were actually very good and it was the real story and editing / direction that allowed the movie down. Such a big, big thumb from me.
