The first episode of this new show was today, and it was terrible. Not only did Shaggy have a furious new voice that caused torture, but it's so far from the original concept and style of animation that it is barely recognizable as the "Scooby-Doo" shov. Even in the dark days when Fred and Velma left, and Scooby's nephew Scrappi was there, the team still solved the mystery. This new show is instead Shaggi and Scooby who fight with the type of super-criminal James Bond and his supporters while living in a villa. There is not even a van called "Mystery Machine" (and a teaser for the next episode that promised that a robot car of a transformer type would not ease my mind). How can anyone take Scooby Doo and do this? The show earns two points for two scenes with the whole Scooby Doo band, all of whom speak with the correct voices except Shaggi, and even then I'm too generous.
