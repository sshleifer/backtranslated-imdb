I've seen this movie for some time (while I was working on a trailer for a film production company) and it was TERRIBLE. Hevitt is at best central, Hopkins telephones his performance in (but still hits Hevitt in their scenes together) and Alec looks bored. Trust me in this: you should avoid this movie as a plague if it is ever released. It seems that it lasts forever, because the tired action takes place at the puddle pace. It is inexorable, the cinema is exhausted and the direction is a pedestrian. Alec Baldwin should go to the film school if he intends to re-direct. In terms of his acting, his character is completely unacceptable, which makes him impossible for him. Dan Ackroid is a pretty fun and surprising jury composition near the end of the movie is cute, but this movie is simply terrible.
