When I learned that it was a movie I had and my favorite actress Meril Streep and Vinona Rider, I went through the roof! Jeremi Irons (the actor I still admire even after this disappointment) was a terrible game. He treated his family as a shit, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I could not get closer or sympathize with any character and I was not modest, but the scene of sex was really unnecessary or could have been reduced. The characters of Vinone and Antonia could have developed much more and their romance could be more passionate. And what about Marilyn's character and her "mysterious powers"? Why did not they get into this? This film had a lot of deadlock, and the bottom line is that this is a really bad movie and that there was a lot of lost talent here.
