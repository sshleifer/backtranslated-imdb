Darkman 3: Die Darkman Die directs Bradford Mai, the same guy who made the first Darkman sequel. Darkman 3 is worse than Darkman 2, and in my opinion it's nothing special. Larry Drake is no longer the main loser, now played by the great Jeff Fahei, whose character still wants to get Darkman's work and create some ultra-strong people this time to get the lead of the whole city. The film is quite similar to plotting and executions like Darkman 2, but it was most irritated by the presence of many scenes from Darkman 2. Made. Several scenes are quite stylish and outgoing, but this is a pretty tired movie and it's often irritatingly stupid. The characters hide and laugh too much and it is very embarrassing. There is no philosophical depth in the film, and that is like a remake of Darkman 2 which still can not be equal. Darkman 2 had many great scenes and stylish camera work, and Larria Drake's ability to play a great bad guy. Darkman 3 offers only some nice scenes and moments, but mostly this film is tired and full of cliches. A few positive things in this film are the editing of the flashback (Westlake's nightmare) and a couple of really surprising turns and tricks. And it is worth mentioning also the rather unpleasant scene of the death of the main criminal who was quite comic and inventive without any worse. Much more interesting than the death of the main villain in the second part. Darkman 3 is the worst in the whole series, and we must remember that these two sequences are made directly on the video and do not come even close to Raim's original Darkman with Liam Neeson. Darkman 2 was a good stockholder with many great scenes and uncertainties, but this last (?) Entry is a tired and often dumb and boring part of the sequel. It has some merit as mentioned, but the overall feeling is that it should not have been done at all. May is a talented director, so we hope that in the future he will get more important projects in the future. 3/10
