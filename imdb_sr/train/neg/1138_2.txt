This was a complete disappointment. The acting is not bad, but the production was so bad that I sometimes felt I had to stop it, but unfortunately I managed to get over and I was able to confuse him a bit for the whole bad movie. It's fine. if you are o.k. along with moral plots and do not mind watching them film that very wrongly interprets Witman. If you want a fictional story.
