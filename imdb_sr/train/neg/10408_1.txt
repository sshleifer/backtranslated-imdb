If Fassbinder made a worse movie, I certainly do not want to see him! Anyone who complains that his films are too loud and claustrophobic should be forced to see it, to learn to appreciate the more spare style he has chosen in great films such as Bitter Tears Petra von Kant. This film picks up so many artistic, quasi-symbolic images that look like a parody of "art-film". The scene in the slaughterhouse and scene where Elvira loves channels for prostitute friends in only ten minutes are just two of the brightest examples of what makes this movie a true test of endurance for the viewer. But what really makes me angry is the few scenes in which Elvira and her ex-wife and / or her daughter are only. These are the only moments that show any real human emotion, and prove that at the core of this terrible film was an excellent film that is struggling to get rid of it. What a waste.
