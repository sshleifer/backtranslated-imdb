After I looked at a poster from Smother, I knew that I would live one of those unbearable film experiences that I wanted to get my eyes off. However, I felt a mild optimism because the film had a solid role, which I thought Unfortunately, this did not happen. Mother is a horrible movie, but it's not ugly. That's the best I can say about it. The Smother script (written by the same guys in the license on sri, something that explains that they have nothing but talent for writing movies) are full of cheap and predictable humor. Seriously, I did not laugh even once when I watched this movie. After the large number of garbage he was involved in (such as monumentally horrible and terrible because I said so), some people may think that career Diane Keaton has been extinguished. However, it is impossible to forget the excellent performance she has brought in the previous case for decades, on films like Annie Hall or Babi Boom. On Smother, she is working hard with her performance, but her character is so terribly written that she can not do anything with it. Dak Shepard gave me a good impression of the idea of ​​Beba mama and idiocracy movies. However, he does what he can with his character. Mike White also makes a good effort but does not reach far. He is a very talented screenwriter (as shown on films) like Good Girl and School of Rock, so I would like to see that he is one of the screenwriters from this film, instead of just playing on it. Liv Tiler suffers from the same situation of all the mentioned actors: it is lost The worst failure from Smother is absolutely boring and infertile. His script is nothing more than a collection of forced scenes and situations that we saw on sitcoms. Stay away from this shitty comedy.
