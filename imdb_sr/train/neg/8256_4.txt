the only word I can imagine to describe this movie is: Usually. The plot for the character of Garry Sinise who attempts to commit suicide is a funny premise and idea ... to live like some sort of Salingerist hermit or desert in a cabin that drives golf balls into the ocean because it is not could he endure life in a lucrative pro / am golf community? It pays to me the river. I wish they were my problems. I enjoy Dylan Baker and Sinise, but this film was obviously a bad choice or a check for Sinise. The scene in which little Timmy Price receives verbal abuse by another club member in front of his father during the tournament is so surprising that it is a shame to watch him
