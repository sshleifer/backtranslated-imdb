Yes, in 35 years of film, I finally looked at the stinker that surpasses all the other terrible movies I've seen. Beating 'Good Vill Hunting' Baise Moi 'and' Flirt 'for pure horror. This is a pretentious flash of the first order ... not even fun turning. The effects are cheap, and even worse - meaningless. It seems that the script was written by a student of the first year of a movie that does not come out much, but wants to show itself with a full image! The acting is simply indescribably bad - Tilda Svinton is launching a career filled with a meaningless tree with a performance that neurotically moves between comets and a funny 'intensity'. Obviously, some fool allowed the director of this film to make another one ... to be warned
