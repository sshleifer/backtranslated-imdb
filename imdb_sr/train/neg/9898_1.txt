This version of "Mobi Dick" insults the audience, claiming it is based on Melville's novel - even so far as to portray a fake sentence in the first chapter, not known as "Call me Ishmael." In addition to having a terrible acting, even by John Barrimore, this is perhaps the greatest example of how far Hollivood (especially early Hollivood) would go to revise and change the novel just to increase his chances in the office. The beautiful, poetic language of the novel is absolutely eradicated, and Ahab has been transformed from a dark, blasphemous, obsessive madman to a summer, incomprehensible hero who only wants to kill Mobi Dick after his bridegroom (!) turns from him after seeing his wooden leg. This is added to the standard evil brother who wants a bridegroom for himself, and a different end!
