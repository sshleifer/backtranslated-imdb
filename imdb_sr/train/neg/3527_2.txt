I had to see this because it looked like a big scary premise - prisoners find a magic book, oo err! claustrophobic terror occurs, etc. but it seems that the story does not go with a big idea. rather than cooling / physiological horror, relying on the effects of open fire and OTT body horror, which was not scary at all if you were over 12 years old. Logic in the end is ridiculous, while characters are killed only because of the number of bodies. the scattering of good characters - what was the best in this movie. Apparently low budget, which does not spoil it, the movie does not really go anywhere, and unofficially believes it will say - need a Hollywood remake. you simply lose interest in this version. definitely not in the same league as other French films that have emerged in the past few years as scarlet rivers that were at least visible / fun, malefic is not visible to the end to be honest. and I bet you can hit the end before watching a movie. really really disappointing - it's impossible to recommend.
