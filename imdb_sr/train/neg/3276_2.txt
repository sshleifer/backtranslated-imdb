TV show from the 1980s, updated with fresh female meat and non-spoken language. "The princes of Hazzard" have passed me; He did not repeat whenever I was in front of television in New York or California; or, I would probably watch. However, from somewhere (as well as footage that tracks the updated 2005 movie), I knew it was a fast, orange Dodge Charger - and "General Lee" was still good. Hunk's relatives Seann Villiam Scott and Johnny Knokville (like Bo and Luke Duke) are the new Orange Orange Sage drivers. The beautiful Jessica Simpson (like Daisi) fills her scant short beard - but even her pink bikini can not win the competition from a full-bred dorm-tople-to-wheelroom. Too stupid complication implies that Burt Reinolds (as the "chief" of Hogg) threatens to turn Hazzard County into a mine. ** Princes Hazzard (7/27/05) ~ Seann Villiam Scott, Johnny Knokville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reinolds
