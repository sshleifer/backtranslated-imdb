I understand that this film was made for children, and as a parent I went through many films that do not interest me, but I can understand from the constructive point of view my children receive it. Parents should however be encouraged to take part in their children's activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment they are watching, so there should be something that attracts an adult audience to some level even in children's movies. Disney has always understood this why it's so hard to figure out how it can allow such a complete piece of shit to carry their name. Technical, sound editing is terrible and all dialogue sounds too synchronized and unnatural. Personally, I hate it, but it was twice terrible given that the dialogue itself seemed to be written by a 12-year-old for a school project. "Gluma" reminded me of the school play and none of the children actors had any emotions in their voices. Fortunately, it was a very short film. Now, before I separate myself from the video-geek that measures a children's movie with an adult stick, the only thing that can save the worst movie for children is a positive message. It's far from me to determine how the message must be delivered as long as it's right. Let's go through this movie to see what messages are given: If you are lost, do not worry, you will inevitably find the way home. Access to wildlife without any fear. You can win any competition just because you "know" you can. And my favorite, the final message left in the movie: It's okay not to obey the authority and do what you think is right.
