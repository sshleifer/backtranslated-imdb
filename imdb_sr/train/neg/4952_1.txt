All right, I've always been a fan of Batman. I loved animated series, and even Batman Beiond. I even read Batman's comics now and then. As you can imagine - I was a little excited when I heard about this series, and then I was RAZORAN. This series is nothing. It does not even begin to be compared with the original series. It's like a long TOI commercial. No depth. And what about Joker? Who, in my most modest opinion, is the best Batman's criminal all the time and killed him. I wish I could say that his design was the worst part. In fact, I would like to say that there was anything about this series that was creative or interesting. In short (because you believe I can say so much more) DO NOT waste time on this show, or your money.
