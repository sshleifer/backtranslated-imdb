I can not believe that so much talent can be lost in one movie! Gingerbread Man begins on the right foot and manages to build some great expectations for the end. But at some point the film turns into one of the worst stories I've ever lost in time. It's so incredible how fascinated Mallori Doss manages to pull the figure of Kenneth Branagh around his nose. The highlight of the films is uninteresting and flat as a beer, which has been left in the sun for too long. Gingerbread Man is probably the worst Grisham-movie ever and it does not change because the talented stars are filming the movie. Do not waste time here!
