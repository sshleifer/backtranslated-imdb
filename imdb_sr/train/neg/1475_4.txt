Most episodes in season 1 are terrible .. There is no comparison with Tvilight Zone or Outer Limits, as the programs actually had decent stories. Most incredible stories are incredible at least ... rent or buy a series of Tvilight Zone ... I heard that Season 2 of this series is much better. Also for some reason the DVD has cut out parts of Rai Valstona that additionally diminish this compilation. The only nice thing to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... Most stories are very predictable, and the series could be better with crafts and turns that left you wondering ...
