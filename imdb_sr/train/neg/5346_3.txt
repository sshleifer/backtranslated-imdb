I had to watch this film because the plot was so unheard of and the film was full of expectations. In fact, it sometimes makes quite an unpleasant look. Unlike other Meier films, sexual antics are reduced to a minimum. Some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily free and offensive. The action is chaotic, and some acting and lines are terrible. The film is a strange combination of sado-masochistic fantasy combined with the window of brutality and immorality of slavery and fails at all points. It was as though Meier was trying to compensate for the blackmailing / blackploitation by having a higher moral message. Meier knows that we feel a little guilty of being disturbed by the obvious connotation of the dominoes in the early scene where Ladi Susan had a whip in a provocative suit. Then he tries to get back on the right path, turning him into a movie about the triumph of good over evil. However, since they mutually cancel each other, you end up with nothing. Because it's so bad in so many ways that it's really worth watching if you appreciate the art of making a horrible movie in the worst case. possible taste. Perhaps, because it's so bad, we almost let Meier get off with an unacceptable one.
