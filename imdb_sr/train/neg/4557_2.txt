OK, it's very rare to complain about something I got FREE. I guess this movie pushed me across the border. I saw him at the Hollywood Cemetery for free and I went very disappointed. Asking a member of the audience for the director to use Indian references as "bookends" instead of being better absorbed in the film, basically tells everything about this film's collapse. NATURE US REFERENCES --- The Indians really felt insecure and fictitious. Obviously, this director and writer tried to tackle the arena they had never played before. They should have kept old saying "write about something you know." The AKM is actually familiar with this, it certainly did not show on the film or the beauty of this unique culture did not get the right justice. CHILDREN AND ON THE NOSE --- I agreed to watch this movie on the basis that it is indie. So I kept it at higher expectations. "Little Miss Sunshine" was indie and she saw her before she became so popular. Before he went public, I was already buzzing about how it would be a hit. Inexistent I could not say the same about the "Expiration Date". "Sunshine" led us to incidents in the cliché, but the film's authors were so clever in their approach that we would take the outcome in a different direction, avoiding the trap to be a "cliché." This film, on the other hand, had no way to fall into the trap because it was TRAPPED from the beginning. Psychomamine of antiquity, Hendrik couple, etc. I hate to say that, but the best and worst movie I've seen this year were both Indians. "Little Miss Sunshine" is the best and this film is the worst. I wish I could say it differently. But I congratulate the directors on the good departure of family members to the cemetery.
