One of the finest films I've ever seen. I wanted to vomit after watching. I saw this film in my class of American history and the purpose was to see the impetus to the life of farmers in the West during the late 1800's. We saw pigs that were killed, then slaughtered, human birth, branding. Oh, and in the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the delivery was not bad, but a lot of fluids that went out drove most people to my classroom. The story itself was fine. The presumption of the story is the widow and her daughter and they are moving west to be the home guard of this cowboy. They live a life in difficulty and interesting is a fairly accurate view of life in the West during the late 1800's. But if you have a choice, do not watch this movie.
