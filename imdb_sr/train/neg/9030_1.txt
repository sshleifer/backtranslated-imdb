The faces are cut, the throats are cut out, the blood is spattered, and at the end the three main characters are either depressed or dying. They even destroy Kevin Costner's dog with a shotgun. Why would someone want to watch this kind of movie? Violence is only valid when good guys kill bad guys, not vice versa. Take for example Undervorld and Undervorld Evolution where you can enjoy justice when demons are killed. In this film, good guys are cut out. See the difference? Why would someone want to make a movie that depresses the audience? Beautiful photography and professional editing in a movie like this is a waste of talent. Put this in the category of exceptional corpse.
