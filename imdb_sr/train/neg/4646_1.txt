Spinal Tap was fun, because if you knew something about heavy metal, you saw jokes all over the place. If you know something about porn, this mocking documentary will leave you cool. Everything in it is wrong. Spinal Tap was fun because he took the famous world and pushed it over the top. This film is definitely not funny because it looks at a picture of how pornography is made that has nothing to do with the real world. The films were good. But it's not.
