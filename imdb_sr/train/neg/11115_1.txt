One previous critic called this film "pure visual joy" I wonder if he saw the same movie I recorded. "High Art" had to have the most serious depressive interior of "Seven". You can almost forgive Sheedi and Mitchell for the first time in B & B. Of course, before they do, you need to watch opium parties in which people are obviously not working, but they can somehow support the flourishing of drugs. Not to mention the glamorous views of those familiar types of movies, Girl / Boy at the beginning, who are aware that they will be moved somewhere in the next 100 minutes or so. The film also says that the character Sheedi has given up professional photography for ten years. What did she do, she was retreating for twenty years?
