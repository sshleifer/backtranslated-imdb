OK maybe a 13 year old like I was a little old for this movie. It's about this spoiled rat, who lives in the palace. Then he dropped the cracks in the sewers into the toilet! He ended up in this city of rats and met a girl who has a gem that a greedy frog wants. He will do everything for this gem that sends the whole army after these two rats. He plans to take a gem and flood the city of wars! A wonderful part about this movie are snails. They do all the sound effects. They sing, make sounds, his awesome, but also pretty fun. All right, it's for 7-year-olds. Another wise, great movie to see the younger family member. I thought animation was not a real dreaming art, more like VAllace and Gromit. and a little I got rid of it. The film was decent, it's not worth spending $ 9.50, though, I apologize.
