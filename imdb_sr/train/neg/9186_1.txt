Do you know the feeling of joy that you get when you are watching a movie that is so hard to try to be serious, provoking a part of the movie and failing in failure? When you can not help but you can not laugh at the terrible nature of the garbage that fills your screen? The "House of the Dead" is struggling to achieve even this low level of cinema. From the beginning to the end, the "House of the Dead" manages to recreate the feeling as if you just woke up to find out that the cat laid her wrapped work on your forehead while you were asleep. It is clear from the beginning that the actresses acted on the size of the décolleté (which they shamelessly exploit), while the men for their hardcore "kick-ass" attitude. Frankly, I did not care for any character at any time in the film, and I found myself actually wanting to be shot down to save a good watch of this torture. Uwe Boll was supposed to consider filing two hours of real-time video footage as a movie. At least we'll do better then? However, not all can be blamed for the actors because it is certainly a challenge to make a compelling film when faced with the script of this film. It's probably the worst part of the movie and actually contains lines like: "These are zombies, clean and simple" and "No cap'n, we can not go there! It's evil!". We all know Zombie movies will never be particularly provocative or full of meaning; at best, they are harmless two hours of action, blood and tight terror. Trash, yes, but fun trash. It's not the kind of garbage that comes out of the garbage bag as you drag it over the room and squeeze your shoes in cardboard boxes of sour milk and decaying banana skins. According to the IMDb, "The House of the Dead" has received such bad criticism that no Danish film has bought a movie. If only we had the same privilege. Final result: 1/10.
