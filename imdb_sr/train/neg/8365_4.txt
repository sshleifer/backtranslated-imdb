This is a simple story, but it is very manipulative. There is a lack of pathos because it leaves no room for imagination or personal thought or time to think. The animation is well done, but I feel like it's too much presentation. I would prefer more pictures from the background, more space in the background and maybe I would not feel such a kitsch for me. But for a Hollywood-style movie, it works well, but it's very much derived from Aardman movies and that's bothering me. Perhaps a longer film will be tested if this manufacturer can voice-free. <br /> <br /> I think the voice is overweight.
