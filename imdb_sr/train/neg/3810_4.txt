When I was younger, I liked this show, but now ... BLECCH !!! This show is dark, poorly written and rarely funny. All three players were good actors and ridiculous men (Saget stood much better than what this shov came out, as Coulier was a better climb, and Stamos was better than an average actor). After a while, Stamos wanted to leave because he wanted to do more serious things (who could blame him?). The show was eventually canceled when many actors demanded more money. Here are some of the things that are driving me out because of the emission: 1. Phrases for catch - How many times one person can suffer fatigue phrases such as "how rude", "you have dude "," nerdbomber "," cut "and" have mercy "for a 24-hour period? 2. Kimmi Gibler - the most adorable figure ever written for television. 3. Leaves and writes as a cookie ore. There is good clich√© and poorly written writing. Full House wrote badly. 4. Three people who live together in San Francisco - enough said. 5. Unrealistic - Too much to remember. 6. Trends Children - The girls had all the latest fashion models and you can see the posters of trendy record artists in which they would be. Now is this show on Nick @ Nite. I would rather call it a classic. I have nothing to say about the people involved, because I think that many of them are talented in their own right. But this show was just sweet, I could not stand it after a while.
