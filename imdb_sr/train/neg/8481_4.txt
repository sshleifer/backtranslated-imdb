The act was terrible and they got both sports criminals ....... not only misunderstood the skating rules, but also the GIRLS Ice Hockei rules. You can not check in GIRLS ice hockey. You also do not block somebody. Not all these girls are disgusting and big. I play hockey and I only have 4'11 and I'm asked to go to schools like the one in the movie. Also, all hockey players do not hate the slider. Many instant hockey girls used to be skaters. We also slide much faster than those in the movie. I was embarrassed by the film that gave people the idea to suck ... although I have to point out that it is difficult to cross between sports because of the fact that on the fingers ... from those tricky moves KAtelin worked on ice that you could not to do in a regular hockey game. She basically interfered with a person who is ill. It is also unrealistic to get a HOCKEI scholarship if she could skate. It really angered me that the scholarship would usually be used by someone who could use the team.
