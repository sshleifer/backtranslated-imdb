Anurag Basu, who directed the flute KUCCH TO HAI, debuted in this film. The film was ahead of time in some way, although it has a story that is not different, and HAVAS was the closest one released a week earlier and lucky This was better and done better business. The film starts well, Maliki's guilt is well presented at the beginning, although the scene with Emraan-Malik is too rough / vulgar. The scenes between Emmanuel and Malik are well handled, and the craft in the story in which Ashmith faces Emraan is brilliant The pace moves quickly and the viewer keeps on the edge, but the other girl's trail of Emraana is not entirely convincing. Also, the cop is looking half-broken. <br /> <br /> <br / > Finale is too cinematic Director Anuraga Basu's music is good music is the winner, all the songs were fantastic Kamer a-work was astounding Emraan played well his bad line, it was the role that gave him the glory and though he continued to play such roles and bored in this movie was great Ashmith was also he was good in his role once, he did a good job and one of his good performances and looked good and Malika was brilliant in her role in the second half, but her delivery for calls was sometimes not to the limit. Unfortunately, she rarely showed such potential in other films, Raj Jhutsi is fine
