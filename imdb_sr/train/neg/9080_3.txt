Well, I just ordered that on my pai-per-viev at home, because I was bored and I needed to laugh. I have to admit, I laughed a few times, but I do not even remember in what parts they were. I do not understand why this movie was shot. She claims to be a comedy, but seriously, I do not find that the penis, or naked woman 70 years old, is very funny. This film was trying to fit into 'gross-out' comedies in recent years, such as American Pie and Road Trip, but it just collapsed. It was a way to make it a lot harder, then it was a comedy. Also, why, for good reason, Cameron Diaz has attached his name to this movie?!?! The only thing I loved in this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought she was sexy, comfortable and well made. Additionally, avoid this movie. 3/10
