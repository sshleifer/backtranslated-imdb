I gave myself a personal mission to go for those who are responsible for this film. I even got the landlord to give me the money because I claimed that they had committed a false advertisement. <br /> <br /> It is not enough that the movie itself p.o. I did better make-up effects on my children on Halloween than the film actually shows against the cover. Can you say "eyes of raccoon?" grew up in Alabama - but has a German accent!?! It's more than offensive.
