I wanted to say that this is the worst gay-thematic movie I've ever seen, but honestly I can say that this is the worst movie if there is any genre I've ever seen. It is in trouble when the film begins with the "personal note" of the director, asking the audience to "understand" the "many challenges" that the director is facing for the first time. The audio track is so bad in many scenes that it's almost impossible to follow the dialogue, and that's from the DVD version. Poor lighting, bad sets, bad photography, bad script, mostly bad acting, all make this "movie" invisible. I went to a bad end after a few attempts and I immediately donated a DVD that I bought crazy. I am sure that there are many challenges that the director is facing for the first time. But do not try to discard this lousy attempt as a finished product. I see from the IMDb details that this was not only the first attempt at directing Richard Natale, but the only one. That's one positive thing I can say about this alleged "movie".
