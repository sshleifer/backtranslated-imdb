I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. Based on the novel by Brian Aldissa, this film attempts to tell the story of Tom and Barry Hove, the united twins who were impressed by the family out of the family, to create a rock band. Almost intentional gimmicky, the film is also too smart for half (if you will forgive the dash). By combining genres, styles and moods, directors (whose previous film was an excellent documentary Lost in La Mancha) are quickly losing their way. I was never sure whether it was all serious or not. Flashback, dream sequences, everything was just a little bit. Plus, the promised rock and roll just did not move me. I reminisced a bit about Hedwig and Angry Inch, a movie I found genuine and moving. But in this case, the songs were not that good, nor were the main characters sympathetic. An unfavorable comparison would be similar to the disappointing Velvet Goldmine.
