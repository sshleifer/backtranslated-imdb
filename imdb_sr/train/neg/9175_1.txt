This is the worst movie I've ever seen. This film coincides with the quality of films such as "THEI" and "Cabin Fever", but they even had the names of the actors in which this failed. The "Sweetie" of this film looked like 50 women with a bad face lift. (quality example only). I would evaluate this film negatively if possible. Ladies, I need to tell you that men were not bad for watching, but not much. If you were planning to see this movie, I would recommend that you save money.
