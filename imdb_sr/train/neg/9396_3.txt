Radar men from the Moon are a fairly typical series of series from the 1950s. Special effects are pretty cheap, lunar rovers are obviously World War II surpluses with colored plywood over them and the like. It's just the way it is. It inspired the imagination of children, which I believe was directed. According to today's standards, it's boring, cheap and bad. There is also a large amount of recordings in the first nine episodes of natural disasters.
