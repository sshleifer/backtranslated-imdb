A terrible horror sequel "The Hovling". This coincides with the funeral of Karen Wyatt (she was killed at the end of the first movie). Stefan Crosscoe (unfortunately Christopher Lee) arrives there and tells Karen's brother Ben (Reb Brovn) that Karen is a waswolf. He goes to Transylvania to kill Strib (Sibil Danning) the head of the insects. Ben and his colleague from Annie McEnroe join him. The awesome script, bad direction, inadequate editing and a really terrible acting by Brovn and McEnroe individually dampen this. The effects of insects are mostly kept in the dark - for good reason! They are terrifying when you see them. Subpar Special Effects - Even though I loved cartoon light from Danning's fingers. There's also an invertebrate organ that is especially stupid, and Danning takes off his top at least eight times during the final loan! There are several good things - I discovered that the village in Transylvania was fun - it seems that it came from the Universal Film about the horrors of the 1930s! There are interesting camera tricks between the scenes of transition; Brovn and McEnroe have good bodies, and Lee and Danning are good at this - but I can not save him. Indeed - WHY did they do it? Where are they hard to earn for money? This is one of the IMDb's lowest movies. It just needs to tell you something. Apparently Danning was horrified when watching a movie - I understand why! You must miss.
