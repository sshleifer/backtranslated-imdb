My wife and I watched this movie while we watched the other DVD and thought: "Jon Heder, Diane Keaton, Jeff Daniels and Eli Vallach, must be better than the summer reprisals, so I ordered it from the local library. Well, any episode of "Lavrence Velk" would laugh more than "Mom's boyfriend." In fact, I was sorry about the actors who had to read the script in the privacy of their homes and I could not imagine what it was like they had. Perhaps, perhaps, the way they offer a movie of this kind, "Just say no!" One anna two.
