There were moments in the film that I wanted to beat me to death. The only reason I was able to sustain the whole film was because I could not believe how badly it really was and I thought it had to be better. This was really a horror movie. I was horrified that I lost what seemed to me like 4 hours of life that I would never return. The other two hours I spent in sadness for loss. Please recommend this movie to whom you want to torture and tell them that the uncertainty will kill them.
