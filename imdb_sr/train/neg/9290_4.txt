STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning Long time prisoner Tvitch (Kurupt) is being transferred to a more stringent prison than again open Alcatraz. He claims he is closer to his lady, but his real motives are a bit more grandiose. There he crossed the roads with Burke (Bill Goldberg) a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself. Vučica, despite being less muscular, is equally mouthful and is pretty much the same. But there is a war between the gangs of black and Hispanic prisoners who explode into the hostile seizure of the gang leader's death and his finger points to Burke. But the shot will really hit the fans when the real killer and the leader of the Hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Tvitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter as a hostage. Steven Seagal does not work on the sequel (apparently very opposite to the idea of ​​siege 2 and only by agreeing to do it, provided that the film company at that time let it direct its film) so that despite the fact that it is a DVD sequel, the main role of this time goes Bill Golber (Steve does not even appear in any of the footage from the first film that appears in the end.) But there is a reason why he did not do much work from the Universal Soldier 2, and this is because he is not a great actor, and there is not any action star, which manages a character that begins as a very Racan and dark, but undoubtedly transformed into a standard action hero who clumsily rejected boring jednosmjernike. Smart, veterans from the first film, Kurupt and Toni Plane, just jumped with a chance for extra work. This is a movie that tried to copy the original style of the original, dim light, dark shadows and rap music that plays on a lot of things. It works pretty well, unfortunately, it can not fight a non-burdensome hero, an equally cardboard criminal and an apathetic story made by manufacturers as if they were compensated while they were going together. **
