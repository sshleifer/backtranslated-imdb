Fishbourne's performances (somehow seem strangely funny) and (short) Ed Harris are incredible, unlike Conneri who seems to make no sense in his role and ends in the motoring behavior of the 80year old man. In fact, the scenario makes no sense; Imagine 60 mins. a happy end of the action and a quick add-on to turn around without any argumental structure in relation to the characters. It's more a coincidence than a script and can be good for screening schools. The more you remind the details, the stronger the impression. The death penalty here is not a problem, although it is a subject from the beginning; it somehow disappears without further comments. The subject and environment could have been good.
