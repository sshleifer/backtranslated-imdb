As with other episodes in a series made for TV, which is spreading to many adventures of sea legends, the super-human infallibility of Horatio Hornblover destroys all chances of uncertainty. As a small Vesle Crusher ruined many seasons THE NEXT GENERATION, Horatio Hornblover invariably saves every situation. Every smart solution comes inevitably from the lips of Horatio Hornblover. Impressively superior, Hornblower's main problem in this series of films appears to be tolerating many of the error signs above and below him in the command chain. It's a perfect being for bored talking stories. So, our hero is superior, even those who are trying to help him are powerless to do something right if Hornblover is not there to manage and control every move they make. What is the meaning of telling the story of any person who can not make a mistake and will win again at any time? What is the purpose of watching such a story?
