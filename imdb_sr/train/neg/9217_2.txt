Yes, the only thing that this film remembers is that it was played by young Tom Hanks, who was just a few years later a relevant star in Hollywood. Here, however, is not a film that will show much of his talents, and the only other thing that could be a bit of fun about this movie is the scene in which he thinks he sees monsters and passes through it. Yes, this movie talks about the evil of playing a game that requires a group of people to use their imagination and try to find interesting scenarios. In essence, the special guy after the Dungeons and Dragons school game about the evil game was cleverly reciting here as Mazes and Monsters. Apparently, the creators of this film thought that nerds should not be entertained of any kind unless they go out and work drunkenness, drugs, have a lot of unprotected sex and harass other weaker children as well as all popular kids. No, these bad people played a game that actually required that the brain be used there, heavenly no! It is not that, if they have a brain, they can actually think for themselves and that some groups can not wash their brain there. Yes, I think this film is completely stupid and a waste of time. It could, however, be a film against addiction, but there are many fewer people who have died getting Dungeons and Dragons completely in their existence than they say driving in a drunken state in one month.
