I basically scrolled the movie, but just enough to catch the story. To tell you the truth, it was kind of boring to me and in some places it did not make sense. The only reason I was watching this movie was to see CHACE CRAVFORD !!! He's so hot, but in this film his hair was weird. But it's still hot. However, despite being hot CHACE, it really did not make up for the movie. I suppose the plot is not so bad, but what really confused me was the fact that they cursed in every sentence. Is it so hard to express your anger without saying the word F every time? , I found the film as boring and dramatic. That's why I just cut in the scenes with CHACE. LOL In any case, it's not worth renting unless your fan is a special member like me. Oh itah, the actor was Hot. The girls were HOT! But CHACE IS THE BEST !!
