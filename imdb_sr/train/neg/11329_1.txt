Elizabeth Tailor could not act at all, and she was just the usual boring, untouched self in this film. That was before it became so thick, but it still looked very short and stinky. Rock Hudson was as good as Bick Benedict, but it's clear that a multi-player actor like Villiam Holden would be better off. James Dean certainly proved that he knows how to mumble his way through the film. The whole movie is incredibly slow and it takes too long. The actors were too young and light, and none of them had grown aggressively because of bad looks. Hudson looked ridiculous, only they left him, and Dean and Carroll Baker were obviously the same years. 0/10.
