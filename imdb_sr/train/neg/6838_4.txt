Plot Synopsis: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built the Victoria tunnel, was killed along with his wife by his associates. His twin sons, Chad & Alek, were separated. 25 years later, Chad, an instructor of karate in Los Angeles, and Alek, a Hong Kong smuggler, join forces to revenge the murder of their parents and rightly claim to be a tunnel. that Jean-Claude Van Damme & Sheldon Lettich worked together, previously worked "Lionheart". This is also the first of three films where Van Damme played double roles ("Makimum Risk" and "Replicant" are the rest). The action is a very simplified story of revenge, and the only feature of the film is Van Damm's performance as two very different men? pick up a rich kid and a rough guy. As it goes, Van Damme does not do a good job in any of the roles, although his opinion about Alec is a bit fun. It is puzzling that the brothers replace one another, wearing different clothes and having different hairstyles. Bolo Ieung makes very valuable supporters for criminals.
