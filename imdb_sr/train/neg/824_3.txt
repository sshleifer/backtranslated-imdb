Gene Hackman was arrested by an unnamed government agency seeking him for an assassination. Of course, Hackman has the skills for this job. Nobody tells him anything, they gave it to the public. It should be tense, rather than boring and boring. Hackman goes through the mission, but the escape is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders all dead to mask it. So everyone in the plaster dies and in the end you do not really care. One of the other reviewers pointed out that the film was originally two times longer, almost three hours, and that it was cut off quite a bit. Maybe something really got lost in translation, but I think it was a favor to the audience. Very talented actor who had people like Richard Vidmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Vallach, and Edward Albert is so fundamentally lost that it is a crime. And we never reveal what the federal agency was doing all this, the FBI, the CIA, the DEA or even the IRS.
