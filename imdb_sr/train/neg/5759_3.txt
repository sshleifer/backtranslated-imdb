This is the third parody of scary movies and we hope the last one. This time it's a bastard mainly on the Ring, Signs and 8 miles for some strange reason. In my opinion this film was very meaningless and unnecessary and not even funny. I may have laughed three times and it's not enough for a comedy. I really enjoyed the first two, but this one was just stupid. If your scarves consist of beaten corpses and people who constantly throw things together, then this film is for you. In my opinion, if you are smart enough to stay at home and save money and please stop making such movies, they only get worse 3/10.
