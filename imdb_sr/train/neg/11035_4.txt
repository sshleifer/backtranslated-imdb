This is the busiest romance I've ever spent. A perfect movie for an empty housewife in a wipes, a home-made dress, and high heeled mugs that were worn-out and watched in the afternoon, lying on a couch eating sweets. In fact, candies play a prominent role in the film. The only reason I was able to look through to the end was that I finally managed to look at the dream face of Keanu Reeves on almost every scene. . In most of his films, he moves too fast to look good. The only fast action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini, who waves hands with Latin emotionalism - more Italian than Mexican, indeed. Dialogue is rigid as a tree. Unfortunately, no body is tainted - the hero is shamefully perfect and mild. The aristocratic warm-blood family clich√©s of the old world is as old as the hills. What is important if the Irish people are Italians or Mexicans? This is a fairy tale. I knew before the titles were finished, that it would not be a movie I was hoping for. The glowing grapes looked like a model for all the food advertisements in the Women's Magazine. I did not see his name, but the art director was certainly Thomas Kinkade, who painted millions of screens of Irish cabin tucked into fuchsias. This film is literally seen through pink glasses. If you like dreamy pink and blue sky, this movie is for you! (Bonbons also looked good!)
