An indecent mess that presents itself as a comedy. Elvis Presley plays the Indian riding champion who leaves the rodeo to stay at home in the Arizona's parents' wilderness, where government clothing has just been invested in a family herd of cattle (which is in terrible need). What the director Peter Tevksburiu desperately needs in his desperate need is some narrative skills, although he lacks what he misses in his estimates in disorderly comedic editions (his social commentary is not very memorable, but Tevksburi has a satirical curve for his strangeness and there are some funny scenes there). Despite the colorful moves of Kati Jurado and Joan Blondell, general whispering gets a way out of his hand, and there are too many hoopin 'and hollerin' to withstand a lot of interest. As far as Elvis is concerned, he is relaxed and naughty - and while it's nice to see him playing on the screen, he needs to wonder if he just gave up the movies at this time. This demolition of the image has a clear sense of hell, and although the ghosts are high, the return is generally low. * 1/2 of ****
