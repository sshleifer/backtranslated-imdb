I saw this movie last weekend and it's stupid and foolish. An ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas? Victims are frightened senseless and can not run from an old man who is slowly moving. They drop their torches and tremble instead of trying to defend it or, in turn, burn it. Kventin alias g. Fabersham of Honeymoon is married to Diane Brevster alias Miss Canfield of Leave it to Beaver fame, which is unhappy in marriage. Vov, a love affair. The rest of the actors just follow each other in the tombs and wait for the shouts to react and help them. An Egyptian girl does not look bad, but does not give much to the movie. Where's the mummy? It's just a curse. This at least does not hold the Universal Mummy torch. Watch this movie if you need a dream, because you will separate.
