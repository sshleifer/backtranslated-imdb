Had I not read his name on the cover of a DVD, I would never have suspected that this pretty gusi and an old-fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave. In fact, the film is so far away from it, whether I wonder if in the 50s and 60s, the authors of the new wave absolutely hated this kind of film - that's so ... so ... unreal. And he seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. This is not necessarily a bad thing - it's just a little surprising. What I was a little surprised was the amount of praise some reviewers gave to this movie - especially when there are many better French musicals. The songs in this movie were simply not particularly interesting, and the characters all looked so cordial and stereotypical. If I had to see another rich person who was worried about how difficult it would be to be rich or get a good selling price on designer equipment, I intended to vomit. The bottom line is that like the American musical, not every French musical is gold. This film is not another "Les Parpluies de Cherbourg" (UMBRELE CHERBOURG or "Huit Femmes") and despite Audrey Tautou's presence, I do not see much reason to recommend it as something other than boring strangeness.
