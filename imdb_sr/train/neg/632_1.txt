Well, what was fun ... except for the fun part. It's my second favorite so far, I even thought it was worse than "Lazarus" and "Ghosts in the Machine". /> <br /> Let's start from a good one. Teaser, he was incredibly well-made and emotional. As a great animal lover I was, it was fun to see so many wonderful animals in this episode. But then everything is bad, and believe me there is a lot of it. It makes little sense, so these animals were taken by aliens and fertilized? vhaaa ??? The dialogue was also quite terrible. There were about one or two lines. And worst of all, have almost all those animals that died were very unpleasant for me. In the end ... what's the point? Everyone died. We did not learn anything, we did not have fun, and Sophia's death I could not find the sad ... just very frustrating. * Star. The shame that season 2 worked so well.
