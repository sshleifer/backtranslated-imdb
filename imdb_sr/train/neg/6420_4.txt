Okay, I admit it started very cozy and good, but then it just went downhill, I can not believe that Sarah Michelle Gellar could even finish reading scripts after about 5 minutes in the movie, the only reason I actually sat on the movie, I was I wanted to see you tweed at sun, and to my surprise, well, people can not even tell you if there was one, because the end just leaves you confused, and then the credit role, I was like hell? this did not deserve a theater show, I'm sorry, but I did not think it was terrible, the only reason I gave it was because it had a couple of nervous parts ... that's it! you can watch it, I'm not telling you that you are not doing it, hey you may even like or even love! but if you hate him, do not say I did not warn you!
