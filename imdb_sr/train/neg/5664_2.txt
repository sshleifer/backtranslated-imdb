I loved Boiley's performance, but that's the only positive thing I can say. It was all over to the absurd. Most actors spoke as if you expect your 9-year-old nephew to speak if he turns out to be a policeman, or an ultra-evil villain. The cowards seemed to me amateur. I could buy a cheap synthesizer and make better music for the opening. And what about the entire police torture? It was completely superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story. Coke added many things, in fact, for which, in all likelihood, he thought it would be really cool, but they have nothing to do with the story. This is a great disappointment, because one of the things Borges's stories do so is his minimalism - they are firmly bound, without superfluous details. This film is just the opposite. I stopped watching after a scene in which Lonnrot was examining a guy from Iidische Zaitung, or somewhere there. I spent 4 dollars for rent, but at least I can get some pleasure from writing this review and I hope to save others from making the same mistake.
