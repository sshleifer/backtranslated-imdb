Looking at other comments, I'm amazed that there are no warnings to potential viewers about what they can expect when renting this garbage. First, I rented this thing with the understanding that it was a competent separation of Indiana Jones. What I got was one of the most horrible movies I remember while I was trying to sit, which even shocked the relatively high production value of the film. I think this is not a spoiler, but if it is, be warned ... If your idea of ​​fun watches Bimbo rape behind you Fearsome Tribal Chief while she stares at the dead eyes cut off the head of their significant other, all the means, rent this movie. If not, I advise you to look elsewhere for a party. When I think about it, this scene so sharply sums up the movie that I do not need to say anything else about it.
