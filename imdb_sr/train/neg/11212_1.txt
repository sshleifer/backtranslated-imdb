The premise of this film was decent enough, but with the sub-part, it was just smooth and boring. SPOILERS The film does not work because of the nature of death, it was random, and even though it was a murder, it's not like the guy started to do it. Also, through some flashbacks, there is a secret that reveals that such events lead to justice to a certain degree. There are no emotions in this movie. For the first 20 minutes, only this woman called her sister and heard her message. She was boring and boring. With a bit of polishing and better action it could have been pretty good.
