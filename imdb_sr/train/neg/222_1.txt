As a single woman over 40, I found this film extremely offensive and humiliating for single women older than 40, not to mention any other woman of any age. It was a sad, pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a "chick", and it failed. Andi McDovell is not a lot of actresses to start, but given the lack of "conspiracy" (I hate what I call her a complication) in this, she did not have a chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy / empathy towards any character, nor an attempt to make the film realistic or convincing in any way. And there is a mandatory male fantasy of an attractive straight woman who suddenly decided to try lesbians - PLEASE. I want those 112 minutes of my life. What a robbery.
