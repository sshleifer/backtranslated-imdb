The terrible story (Amis in the worst case), the meaningless and self-conscious 'decadence', the obvious shock tactics and the uneven acting make this film (like "Rancid Aluminum") embody everything that went wrong with the much-acclaimed British film revival. Humor is, at best, lukewarm, and the pretentiousness of the whole set (including some kind of "internet terrorist group" - ooh, as it is modern) really began to squeak. The final summary - a half-exhausted attempt to be "nervous" that does not help anyone. Still, it's always a pleasure to see Kati Carmichael on the screen ... <br /> <br />
