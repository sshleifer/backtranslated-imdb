This film was terrible. During the whole film I was confused and I did not see any meaning. I had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what this is about. This movie is not worth watching at all. Not only is it sick and disgusting, but also stupid! Please do not look if you are not one of those who like to watch bad movies. If this film questions the Japanese society and their values ​​and roles, then it's a country that I would not like to visit or would not try to know. This is a totally sick movie !!!!!!!! I did not enjoy it because it did not make sense. My boyfriend and I sat and waited to see if it was a horror because that's what is stated below. That was a total disappointment.
