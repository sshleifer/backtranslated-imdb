... but a bad movie. As Maltin says it was an attempt by Christopher Lee to make a serious horror film. Well, that's serious ... Rarely! The action is stupid and slow (something about the old people who live in the bodies of small children to achieve immortality) ... the film is all talking talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again. Actually, I've been catching up a few times! The film is sooooo boring! The actors are going through this with the only exceptions of Peter Cushing and Lee ... but this was probably a work of love for both (they often complained that horror films are too violent ... well, this is no violence!). Avoid at all costs ... unless you have insomnia ... this will bring you to sleep!
