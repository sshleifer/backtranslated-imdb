Everything in this movie is bad, story, acting, effects, but its funny, funny, funny !!! The leader of a group of special operators is ridiculous! 'Terrorists' are terrifying and realistic as '' predators '', this is so lying and bad in everything that tries to laugh. The part in which the giant T-REX somehow got into the boat and then somehow got it beneath it is inflated and you will see a metal pillar that sticks up where its head is the perfect end. If yours is in bad films, this is a pot of gold, mona lisa of bb-bad !!!
