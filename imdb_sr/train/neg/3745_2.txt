First; It is very tempting to try to describe the way history only from the positions of weapons, call and steel. They tried to make Marxists from economic positions. The reason for the success of the West can not be just stupid happiness, the benefits of domestic plants and animals. We see that everywhere in the world all the benefits and bonuses are completely useless if they are not managed wisely. Japan does not have huge natural resources, but Japan is one of the world's leading economies, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, a country with rich oil resources, there is only a medium low success. Both of these nations had and still have access to Western technology and inventions, but why such a vacuum? At the end of the film, Daimond said it was very important to understand the factors of weapons, call and steel to understand. Perhaps the main factor of the global difference is not geography, but people's understanding and use of things? Mental abilities of understanding. In this case, geography is only subordinate.
