This movie is absolutely ... I can not find a word about waiting ... shit! I mean, when it started, it was like this looks good, and then it was so boring. I almost fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that I caught the late display because it was the ultimate dirt. Ram Gopal Varma tried his best, but the actors could never experience the acting career of the original Sholaia. What was he trying to do? Be like Sanjai Leeli Bhansani and win all the prizes next year like he did for Black? Ajai and that other guy were good, especially the one who played paradise, because of all of them he was the one who was watching. What is Amitabh radio? It destroys its own dignity by working all these stupid movies. First Nishabd then Cheeni Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now I think he has to collect some of his money and move away from Bollivood before he loses all his respect and tell you that he has already halfway his journey. I think that all this is really good for other actors like Shah Rukh Khan who now gets a really good name because of the recent fall of Amitabha. I never loved him because he thinks he was God and that I knew Abhishek would be in that movie. If you want to save your Â£ 17.75 and spend it on something good, watch Hei Babi because it's just the funniest movie ever and it's number one in the top list!
