The film is about two stories: one is the political murder of a girl, the other is a higher-class political party. The crossing point is the character of the relationship with the public played by Al Paccino, because he is a witness to the crime and the assailant of the evening. If the scenario is horrific without proper dialogue and overriding any sense of drama, Al's performance is unforgettable: how many people can be as convincing as a powerful and fearful man (like "Kum") like here as a little servant (see also "Donnie Brasco"). In fact, the big young lion has become tired old. This transient era is very touching, as it makes the audience think about aging. But his slowness is just make-up because he can regain his energy on the ecclesiastical scene. > Maybe it's a good thing that the movie is so awesome because it puts light on Al's talent!
