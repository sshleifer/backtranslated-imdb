Dark Volf (Quick Overview) Let's go straight to it: This is a disgusting piece of rotten roadkill with cows on it. It's just a horrible movie. It's a urban wolf movie with some of the worst actors imaginable and a story that's as bad as any stupid stupid from the 80s high school drama film. Worse still, the poor Kane Hodder was deceived to play the gigantic fallout of the werewolves. Kane f * cking Hodder. Someone is trying to ensure that playing Jason Voorhees is the culmination of his film career ... Anyway, the former Jaime Bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a waswolf. It's kind of a shitty police drama with the worst in-the-world in the world. But there are moments of almost unbridled nostalgia. But that's all. Want to know more?

It is good only for fanatics of the horror who want to see the small moments of nudity surrounded by unbridled visual vomiting. 2/10 <br /> <br /> vvv.ResidentHazard.com
