I usually like lesbian movies even when they're not very good. I guess I'm biased! But this is just a pit. Yes, the landscape and the buildings are beautiful, and there is a short but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise this film is just a complete waste of time. Annamarie alternates between smoking and getting high / stoning / sharing on any medication or drink at hand, and Ella inexplicably sets this abominable behavior throughout the film. At no time do we get any insight into why this is, or even why Annamarie is so depressed and withdrawn. If at least there was some kind of closure in (potentially romantic? not even know!) The relationship between these two, there may have been some sort of satisfaction. But although Annamarie at one point asks Ella "why do you love me?" Ella does not admit it. It is never quite clear whether this is more than a lesbian on bad behavior on a boring journey with a real woman. Even the interactions between the two women and the local people who meet on the journey, which could have been vivid and informative, are instead plain, fatigued and generally incomprehensible. In the film there is a good joke, although I'm sure it was unintentional. Women travel in a two-seater Ford Coupe with a medium-size luggage compartment. However, when they set up a camp, they have huge tents, beds, sleeping equipment, and even a table, chair and typewriter! On top of that, when they embark on a ferry, we see a bunch of luggage, probably their, probably carried in a little Ford's suitcase! And through the entire movie, we never see a gas station, or anywhere it looks like it would actually be anywhere to buy gasoline. They travel mostly through the endless miles of deserts. So, where did they get fuel? There may not be too many lesbian movies out there, good or bad, but there are many things better than this, and very few of them are worse. Leave this in the stand.
