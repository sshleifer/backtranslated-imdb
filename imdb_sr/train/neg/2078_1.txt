Yesterday I went to watch this movie and although I did not have much hope for this movie, I was still bitterly disappointed! I really can not believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this movie ... it was bad !!! The story was embarrassing and the acting was terrible (although it had great names like Uma Thurman). This film relied heavily on its special effects ... but they personally did not have any influence on me. I honestly wanted that I never watched it and strongly warned everyone not to see this movie. It is a total loss of money and in the end you will be disappointed. My advice is to save money, go shopping, relax, do not go and do not watch this movie ... You will live to regret it!
