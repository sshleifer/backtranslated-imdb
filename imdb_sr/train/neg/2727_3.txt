This strangeness in the new DORIS DAI COLLECTION does not have to be turned on because it's only in the movie for less than 30 minutes. What she does is glow when she is on the screen. The film footage near is just an excuse to show some Varner contractors day. JANCIE RULE shows the promise and the damage that did not become a big star. RUTH ROMAN deals with the role of "go-getter" with self-confidence. Better if this is colored. The position of the Travis Air Force base with some of the latest projections works well. What's best in the movie are some wonderful musical interludes. If you've enjoyed the THANKS FOR GIRLS AND HOLIDAY KANTA, you will love this one.
