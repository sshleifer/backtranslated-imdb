I watched this with my girlfriend after he tripped as he closed the channels. I guess we both hoped for some happy family sweet Christmas movie, but they were extremely disappointed. The actor who plays the soldier, seems to have any emotions, his face looks the same, whether he sows the Christmas tree, looks at the girl he loves to love her boyfriend, or when he is happily surprised by the girl you He loves, he's a horrible actor, and none of us did anything except to laugh at him. Then there is a cute blonde girl, blessed with the ability to count points and cheat on her boyfriend, what a catch! and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more points. So, this is basically a story about a guy without any emotions or feelings that falls on a guy who counts points and cheats on his boyfriend, as is predictable, and really wasting time, you do not get anything by watching this , except for some strange laughter, because everything is so rough. I love when her father says she only eats french fries, not French wine, and everyone laughs, it's a peasant attitude about which this film is about, moreover, if my dad's dad heads me, said I'd like something to him or not, but not our veterans' army, no, sir, everyone is going to farm him. The film is what the First Blood would have been, that John Rambo burnt out as the biggest weakness in the world.
