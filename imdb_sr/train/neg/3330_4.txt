This film contains o.k. the result and the bad performance of David Muir as dr. Hackenstein. Initial and final credits show with most actors and "special effects" that this is a low-budget movie. In this film, there is nothing you can find in other crazy scientists, horror / comedy or low budget films. Not especially for any lovers of bare scenes or for lovers of bad films. This movie is simply here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are not really excited. If you are curious as I am and can find this, you will understand the truth of one summary.
