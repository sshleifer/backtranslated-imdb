I usually have no problem getting away from a bad movie, but this was a unique case. This film was so bad that I was actually going through the whole thing, he almost prayed that he would have one minute of a good movie to justify the hour and a half that was lost. Needless to say I was brutally disappointed. Situated in a beach house where a group of friends from college celebrates a holiday, this film suffers from many problems, which is not worth seeing. First, there are cavity holes. Secondly, a very small number of C-lists (I do not even dare to call them B) actors can behave cheerfully, so all scenes that have potential fall out. Thirdly, the speed of the film is very upset and unpleasant to watch most of the time making the building uncertainty very difficult, which leads to very little surprise for the audience. Fourth and most important, the ending is completely anti-climatic, partly because it ends (it happens / when the killer turns out) and partly because the dialogue is just terrible. For film credit, it's the only movie I'll ever say is the worst movie I've ever had a scene, and I've seen a lot. So, just like a bad joke happier that is not heard, the next time someone asks you whether you want to know the secret, you will shout, no, you will not really do it while you are running in the opposite direction.
