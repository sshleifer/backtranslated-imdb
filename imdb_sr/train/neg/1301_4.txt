Recently I saw it on the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2009. This is the feature-length directing debut of the veteran Dutch actress Monik van de Ven and on the basis of my observations should be her last. I hate movies that are so incredible to virtually separate each scene. This film immediately leaves you scratching your head. how a young photographer and his girlfriend working for an international humanitarian organization are starting to ride through the Taliban-controlled mountains that lead a conversation about their love when a rocket stops the truck in front of them. They come out of the vehicle to watch Taliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades to kill all five people in the truck. Bob (Valdemar Torenstra) begins to record all this when one of the insurgents who snaps his hand on them killing his girlfriend sees him. since they can not be more than 50 yards from the distance of the hand throw, but somehow they get out. His girlfriend was blowing up in the air and taking pictures of the moment of the killing of a shell that kills him and wins the prize as a photographer of the year for photography. Every scene and situation in this movie are just as funny as it opens. The following year, Bob came on a mission for National Geographic on the Dutch island, where he met Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and got into her underground world of international drug smugglers. Avoid this movie. I would give her 4.0 out of 10.
