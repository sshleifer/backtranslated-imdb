I can not believe that those who praise this movie here do not think about another movie. I was ready for the possibility that this would be horrible, but the script (or lack) is a film that is meaningless. On the plus side, the general level of craftsmanship by the actors and technical team is quite competent, but when you have a sailor's ear to work with you, you can not make a silky purse. The fans of Ben G should keep each other's film in which he was. Dorothy Fan fans should keep Galakin. The fans of Peter B should keep Last Picture Shov and Target. Lovers of cheap laughter at the expense of those who demand it, should be kept by the stunningly terrible books of Peter B, the Killing of the Unicorn.
