This is one of the hottest transcripts I've ever seen. If they want to make a bad story film, they should refrain from giving him the title of a good book. There is hardly a connection between Wolf's book and this film except the title. I do not mind changing it if they help the story take place on the screen. At least the changes should not harm the final product. The last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing. Actors are wrong. The director and / or scriptwriter apparently could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or to preach unbelievable sermons. If you've seen this movie and you did not like it, try the book. If you've seen this movie and like it, read the book.
