This movie is really boring. It's forbidden in the Chinese movie and I see why. Not because he is critical of the communist regime, but because the film is of such a poor quality. I would never like to pay the money to watch this. I love movies by Chen Kaige and Zhang Iimou and I'm disappointed that such a bad movie could come out of China. It seems that they completely ignore the audience and the director seems to have made a movie for himself. The snapshots of a person standing there and doing nothing for a minute are hilarious and there are many. Cinema and video quality are incredibly bad. I looked at this movie on Net and it seems like people really like this movie. The only explanation I have for this is that some movie lovers think that if the film is not in English, it's automatically good. I do not see the reason why people would like it. This is not an artistic film, it's a waste of celluloids (that is, if they were actually filmed on a movie, they are not)
