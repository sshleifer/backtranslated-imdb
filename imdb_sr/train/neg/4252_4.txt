*** Possible compounds *** When I saw it today, I expected it to be, not too high, but not low. Although I did not expect it at all, it seems to me that filmmakers could not decide for a film. At the beginning of the film, the film is a bit mysterious and somehow exciting, but it will soon change into some funny scenes - very obvious scenes ... While I was watching, I almost slept several times. End is the happiest of all though, almost spraying / comedy ... I'm not saying that there is no good scene just that the movie never becomes a "whole". 4/10 Movie-Man
