It's been a long time since I last saw this movie so badly ... The acting is very average, the story is terribly boring, and I have no say in connection with the execution. She was completely unoriginal. Oh, and this is a comedy like Clint Eastwood's pregnant Schvarzenegger! One of the first scenes (the one with a television show - where are you, hell?) got right - actors had 80% of the faces - forgotten actors. If they were hoping to re-launch their career, then I think that could never have happened in their CV! The scenario had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors, nor the director (who the actor and obviously should not hold the actor) pulled it. Fred Durst was the only one who looked better than everyone else. I'm sorry, but if you ever think about it - I recommend you turn to something less traumatic, because not only is the total loss of time, but also a bad example of what a bad movie looks like.
