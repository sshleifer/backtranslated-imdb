Unfortunately, the only spoiler in this review is that there is nothing that could ruin the film. Even if B. Mattei never did any masterwork he used to do his job with a bit of humor and insanity that he did to the funny Eurotrash director. But the last 10 years seemed to have lost him. This film is just empty, nothing that could awaken us from the deep sleep you drowned after the first 10 minutes. No sex, no blood (it is supposed to be snuff?), Without actors, without dialogue, equally as bad as a 90'TV movie. It's worse than his last cannibal and epic zombies. So, rest in peace, Bruno, in any case, you will remain in our thoughts, thanks to such unforgettable jewels as Zombie 3, Robovar, Rats, l'altro inferno, Virus, Cruel jaws and several others. So unless you want to you see B Mattei owned by Jesse Franco's new film, pass this one. But if I do not know that this beautiful craft career has revealed his old films and had fun.
