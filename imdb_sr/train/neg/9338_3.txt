Pam Grier plays Coffi. She is a nurse seeking revenge, on drug dealers who forced her sister into a bad heroine. Like all Blakploitation flickers from the '70s, you can expect that racist bad guys will get their real desserts. There were plenty of those films created during the 70's, and were really humiliating both for black and white audiences. This is mainly due to malicious racial animosity in these films and humiliating, stereotyped characters. Especially female characters. Other common topics between Coffi and other films of this type include brutal violence, corrupt police, car hunting, generous abundance of nudity and gorgeous sexual women. Not to mention the urban ghetto inhabited by drug dealers, macro, mobsters and other criminal scum. She was magnificent, she was as firm as her fingernails, and she was beautiful. Like in other films, Pam outperforms other characters in Coffey. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on the screen that these types of films are inconceivable, without it as the main character. If you like Pam Grier, it's better to see her other films, such as Foki Brovn, or maybe Friday Foster. These films have much less empty sleeves than Coffi. The person's pamper in Coffy is too degraded to get bad guys. Pam's characters in her other Blakploitation films do not go down low to get back on their feet, as Coffi did. I would say, just watch Coffi, if you can not see other Pam Grier movies. Otherwise, Coffi is a waste of time. Only Pam's talent as an actress makes watching Coffi tolerable.
