Absolutely the worst movie ever since Burton, which seems to be getting worse with every film he directs. A poor script loaded with clich√©s is just the first of many aspects of this movie. This is a movie in which every time something happens, you will surely hear someone yelling: "He's lost his gun!" or whatever it is known to everyone. Carter is really horrible and Vahlberg, who can not play this and be convincing. Very nice effects and photography, but the bad music in John Williams' mold by Burton's friendly Elfman. Heston appears in a senseless scene to say his most famous phrases from the first film. Very bad results. If anyone else saw there "Sleepy Holl", they probably noticed, as I did, a decline in the quality of Burton's films. I heard that this particular project was produced by another and that Burton was brought in as director, in which case his judgment should be reconsidered. But I think he allowed every possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip; The evidence is in movies. In the movie "Sleepy Hollow" he could not decide what kind of film he was doing, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of British actors (Chris Lee, etc.) led you to think that the type of monster is a ralli movie ( they are never frightening, as the horror fans know). The film could not succeed neither in horror nor comedy because it was so schizophrenic, and no style was developed to equalize both of them. The "Planet of the Apes" is the same, and the result comes more like "Total Recall" or "Tango and Cash" than as a sci-fi. He has also tracked many other "big" directors who try to satisfy all possible audiences. Tell Burton if you're there - pick something up and do it, or use some style to get it all (like in "Mars Attacks" or "Beetlejuice"), or maybe you'll retire, because people love me who are fans of your movies will stop .
