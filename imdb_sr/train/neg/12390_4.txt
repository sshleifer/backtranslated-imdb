After many years of seeing television that was highly censored on television, I was interested in seeing an untreated version. I was surprised that this was more convincing and good behavior than I remembered, but one thing really stood out. I think that other reviewers have mentioned this, namely, what is the nature and motivation of the character of Chris Sarandon? Has he raped other victims earlier? Is it completely psychotic or "average" sociopath? How did he expect to get away with his attack on a younger sister? Is this character credible at all, or is it just a matter of need for higher education? It seems to be almost at the same time an uncomfortably convincing character and that it is too crazy to really be able to retain a teaching job that puts it in contact with young, vulnerable girls. It seems to be the biggest appeal of viewers in general. It has nothing to do with its performance, which is terrifyingly convincing. The film takes an uncomfortable position between pure exploitation and half of the serious treatment of the subject, without compromising it. Not even the worst movie ever made, but not so good.
