This movie was another loss of time ... Why oh, why continue to rent such a shit? Returning to the movie at hand: Cube Zero is probably worth it if you really enjoy the first movie (as I am), and I just want to look at what's happening in the last (hopefully) movie that's been collected just to keep a little bad . actors and screenwriters employed, then this is, of course, a movie for you. But if you are looking for a good movie with good acting and fantastic complication ... * evil laugh * then this movie definitely is for you: -D .... OK lying ... At best, this movie is bullshit. OK, I have to admit that some of the elements were cool ... well ... coolish ... and I laughed a lot of times, shedding the wrong things, but I was still fun. :-) But all in all, a few things that are barely the right category "ok" are not enough to make this movie pay off. Unless you count "Manos - Hand of Fate" one of the top ten films of EVERYTHING!
