Did I see a worse movie? Perhaps only "Manos: The Destiny of Destiny" drags more than "Dukes". It was more fun for me to push the gigantic holes than the film gave me at any time. Let's touch a few ... There was noticeable death and re-birth of the script when Sheev talks to Dukes and they do not respond. He shrugs his shoulders and goes on, because neither Knokville nor Scott knows what he's talking about (neither we do). It was as if the engine had died and was restarted. Several times when General Lee flew through the air was not so exciting. Nothing I did not see on the TV series. Very little chemistry between Knokville and Scotta.

The rest of the time seems to me distant and compulsory. Brutal, terrible accent (or lack) of Seann Villiam Scott. Were bad jokes supposed to be dear? I wanted to disappear. Jessica Simpson beautifully meets on the big screen. She actually felt like one of the better actors in the film. This tells you how this film is horrible. She's a goddess. During the peak of the film, I rejoiced that Boss Hogg and the bad guys settled the entire Hazzard Countie, starting with Villie Nelson and his assistants. It would be enough nuclear bomb.
