I just lost 2 hours of life looking at this foolish plot. I could make a better movie with my camera. How do actors act in these films? Pornographic films have better scenarios and effects ... I wish I had you 2 hours ago ... The only good thing in this movie is the acting game. Although, their acting skills in this could not raise this film to passable, the rest was just OUR bad! It's the type of movie I would recommend to torture prisoners to scare them. Even worse, I've seen a translated version of this movie ... Imagine a bad movie ... with even the worst translation ... Iikes!
