Something about what to sing was produced at Grand National Studios where James Cagnei was working as he was in dispute over a contract with Brothers Varner. He made two films for this B studio, none of which was ranked high in Cagnei's points. . Two things that immediately come to mind are Iankee Doodle Dandy and Parade for the leg. Two smaller films are The West Point Story and Never Steal Ani Small. Sam Cagnei said he never watched anything but his retired musical. So why are there so few? Well, this was wrong. The action of Something that sings about concerns for the hoofer dealing with the band that he discovered and gave a film contract. There are common complications with the abominable studio head and the wretched press agent who play well, by Gene Lockhart and Villiam Fravle. His contract calls for a clause without marriage, so Cagnei and band singer Evelyn Dav are secretly married. Then we get a complication of the studio romance with the leading lady Mona Barrie. I think you can figure out where this is going. The most disappointing thing about something you sing is the lack of dance numbers for Cagney. Shortly dances at the beginning and end of the film and nothing in the middle. Evelyn Dav had a nice voice and charisma of sandwich with ham. She got music numbers like they were. I'm sure the film audience paid their tickets to see Cagnei Dance. In addition to giving him some dance numbers, a female dance partner would be good. He danced well with Ruby Keeler in the Footlight parade and with Virginia Maio and Doris Dai at The West Point Story. Did not have Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Povell or Ruby Keeler available? From this did not come unforgettable songs. And Dav's voice is narrowed. She has a voice from Sophia Jeanette MacDonald, who was so dishonest with the swing band. No wonder Cagnei went back to Varner Brothers. But they should have given him decent musicals.
