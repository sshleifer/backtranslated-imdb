What an empty and lack of great performance of the classic novel. I would like people to stop playing with classics when they obviously have no idea of ​​the true intention or the originals. This version does not differ. I felt that the version of Ralph Fiennes was a lot worse, though the casting of Juliette brioche as Kathy had to be the worst decision to throw EVER ... anyway to this version. The goal is to make the story relevant to the contemporary environment and musical style. It works in both, but in high art is a thread. Dead view for the rainy day maybe ... The direction was average and the editing was the ultimate. Above the old Quinni. Deepak Verma makes a big turn as Hindley and is actually one of the Britons who lost talent. Part Heath played with great charm and belief and I think that casting is the strongest point of this project. Even if the more talented director would make better use of the facilities he had. It was clear that he was the director of the hire and did not embellish the project of the passion he deserved.
