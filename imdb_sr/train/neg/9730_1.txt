Now I hired this movie because Brad Dourif was in it. He's a great actor, BRILLIANT in everything ... except this movie. And I think that was just because he realized how this movie was silly and did not bother with a good performance. This film is an unintentional comedy. Some of the lines just break me. And there are some lines that make no sense, and it seems that Tobe Hooper only throws lines without thinking about the plot. Oh! BTV plot is BAD! But that's one of those films that TAHT BAD is actually sick of watching. I recommend this only to BIG Brad Dourif fans, or fans of any other actor, because the plot is pathetic.
