The team (Gari Daniels) desperately wants to break into serious television coverage. When the job he prays goes upside down, he is fired. His beautiful but empty girl (Elizabeth Hurlei) says the sioners. On his return home, Tim was surprised to discover that his house had an unmarked visitor (Christopher Lloyd) from the planet Mars! Calling him Uncle Martine, Tim soon tries to help his new friend manage life on earth. But Martin is in trouble wherever he goes, from the bathroom to the laundry room and more. Lovely Lizzie (Daril Hannah) finally sees the opportunity to make time with Tim, but the direction of true love in this case does not go smoothly. Soon, everyone on TV will play Tim, hoping to talk about a real alien. What does a man do? For those who loved the old television show with the same name, Bill Bikbie and Rai Valston, this film is not worth tying the boots. It is indeed, undeniably terrible, without complication and reliance on the supposed special effects that also fall. Daniels is fine as earthly, but Lloyd is just as awesome as an alien, pretending to be a storm. The rest of the actors are adequate, as are costumes, set and production details. Even if your children see the cover and pray for this movie, make sure they select another movie in the video. Be sure, children and adults will find this film colossal bored, so opt for Night at the Museum or Around the World in 80 days.
