Looking at "Kroko", I would like to leave the cinema for the first time in my life. I would not recommend you to watch this movie: straight major characters - absolutely no development eg. A crocodile, metaphorically German problem remains a pure metaphor without the possibility of a positive engagement despite several chances to do so. Uninspired actors, a non-evolving plot. I suppose the movie tried to conduct environmental research, but it failed: the camera looked more climatic than motivated. The pictures were low - contrasting, gray and dark - I'm sure I'm deliberate, but the components did not contribute to the convincing impression of the social milieu. The story, however, had a certain potential, it could have made a good short story.
