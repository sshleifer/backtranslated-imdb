Maybe it was not my genre, but the plot was horrible as Nancy Alen and Linda Farentino acted. C. Tomas also looked uneasy in the role of being misled here (while on the marijuana? Why this should have been included? This weakened plan). Also Farentin's character. It would have been better if she had more respect for the relationship. Will the film try to tell? not much.
