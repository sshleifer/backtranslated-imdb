OK, for a long time I was a big fan of Black and I was thrilled after I looked at this movie. Let's call it problems ... First, this movie has a lot of the same crew as the first two. It is also called the PREVENTION of the original black stallion. Why can not I correct the name of Shetan's dam or its color? In The Black Stallion Returns, we learn that Sagr was a black mother and that in this film is a gray sausage Jenni?! VTF? And it was set up in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I could have made a mistake, but the first one was set in the 1940s when the ship collapsed. Time does not sound quite right. Also, as a stupid, at the beginning of the film there is a frieze that should be Shetan's father ... after further perception, it seems to be casting. Ben Ishaak is the only character remaining to make this film in any way related to the previous two. Maybe it's a sweet family movie for some, but it's my biggest film disappointment in the year.
