When people from Cinema Videos collected their fine collection "Slapstick Enciclopedia", a multi-screen selection of silent comedies, someone decided to launch the first show with ONE TOO MANI (1916), an opaque pharaoh on a reel that featured in Florida very young Oliver Hardy. As the party was better than anything, this decision was unfortunate, because ONE TOO MANI is a very bad movie that almost discourages the viewer from looking further. Like every typical farce, this includes a deception-inspired greed, a panic when plans go wrong, and complications that escalate to an absurdity, but unlike good ones, ONE is unconnected, unbridled, and completely annoying. It's hard to say at this point whether the hopelessly confusing action is the result of a lack of recordings or incapable filming of the film, but regardless of the cause, up to half way even the surest viewer has no idea what are characteristic relationships or what's happening The only interesting point here is the 24- old "Babe" Hardy, which looks much harder than it would have happened a decade later when he teamed up with Stan Laurel, but who is still full of youthful energy. At the introductory scene, awakening with a hangover, Babe performs a very athletic turning back from the bed. Believe me, it's funny like this movie. If you read this before looking at the first tape of Kin's "Encyclopedia of Slapstick," I suggest you move quickly this and skip to good things.
