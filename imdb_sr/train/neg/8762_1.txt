The scientist (John Carradine - unfortunately) learns how to bring the dead back to life. However, they return with marbles. In the end, all this leads to a disaster. Boring, fully anticipated exit from the 1940s. That frightened me when I was a kid, but I'm bored now. I had to fight to stay awake! With one exception, acting is terrible. Such absurd boring actors! Hopelessly. There are some good things about this: Carradine, in spite of the script, actually gives very good performance. And there are some a bit of bitter moments that include the spirit of the Great Dane that goes through the walls. There is also one of the worst looks of the knockout in the history of the film. However, none of this is fun enough to expand. Avoid.
