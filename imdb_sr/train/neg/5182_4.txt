Like most festivals, Hamiltons is interesting to watch a movie that has all the ideas and little performance. Though impressive due to the apparently low budget, the film stops in its final turn and becomes horribly long during a drawn-out and obvious conclusion. The film talks about the family of murderous exiles who are trying to survive after their parents died. They take people away, they take blood from them and feed something locked in their basement. There are some nice, darkly humorous performances from Mckellhar and Firgens, and the rest is just so-so. The film is never real or disturbing. But, in the first half, a strangely humorous and dark mixture is inserted, which is a surprising achievement. The next half is not as successful as it was in the forgetting of the film with unrealistic turns in a funny, self-confident finale that transforms the entire film into extreme crap. It is a pity that there is no doubt that some talent has been involved in this production and, although deeply flawed, remains genuine and creative. It's a shame that when it comes to delivery, it's completely broken at all levels. ** / 5
