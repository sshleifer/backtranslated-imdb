This film is at best central. Angie Harmon is ridiculous as a hammer bag. Her hooky behavior from "Law and Order" is transmitted in an unsuccessful attempt at comedy. Charlie Sheen is the only one who came out unharmed in this terrible anti-comedy. The only positive thing in this mess is the marriage of Charlie and Denise. I hope this effort gives better results.
