Not one of the best pokemon movies. Two legendary pokemon come in the story. You can see how much Celebi can be strong, although he first turns evil. Suicune also appears, did not look so powerful. You have a lot of strong pokemon, except that taranitar? Some fighting scenes with his pokemon may have done better. Ash and Pikachu meet with a much younger professor Oak, though they do not understand it. The mystery I thought he had in the end, but she did not come near. I saw this in points. Do not expect much here, the worst in the current series.
