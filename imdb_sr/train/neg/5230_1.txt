Although Robert "Knok" Benfer has his fans, I'm not one of them. His films are educated and amateur, and not very funny, unless you're a 14-year-old with an underdeveloped sense of humor. He certainly is not known, because immature fans would like to believe, disturbing people in Wikipedia, or casting votes for ratings here in IMDb. He is certainly not profiled by large media houses, which is a great deal about his "glory" and his creation. curses and learn to write some real funny material before you seriously understand it as a real entertainer. However, from this moment on, he is only a child with a camera and it shows.
