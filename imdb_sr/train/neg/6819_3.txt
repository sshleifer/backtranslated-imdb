In this film, Joe the Sand hits basketball. joe pesci ... And if we are consistent, the rest of the scenario is equally amazing. Sands is a funny guy, who saves this movie from sinking behind a cellar, but other roles were pretty bad. The father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people, which was not even well-played. Instead of being a man of archetypal negativity, he looked more like an amorous android programmed to earn money at all costs. then there is a symbol that is assigned to sand as a girl or something ... even I do not remember ... she was so forgetful. Anyone who evaluates this film above 5 or 6 is a paid member of a type of film studio that attempts to raise the reputation of this sunken film, or at least one of those million media that can not be effectively criticized (you know, people who feel bad if they give anything below 6). Keep up ... far away. and I'm ashamed of a central comedy, where I saw this movie. they usually choose better.
