OK, plain and simple, if you're a fan of other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD) MAINTAIN THE LEGENDS. It is, without a doubt, the most devastating TR game. It looks very nice, it sounds very nice, but it is completely unfeasible and I gave up myself. I feel like I was robbed by Eidos. It is very simple. TR was a PC game above all. You control Lara using the keyboard. In 6 Tomb Raider control games were standard. The AODs were 'sticky', but still the same general control sequences. In the legend, her movements and methods of control have completely changed and she is completely uncontrolled. I saw comments in other places from people who say "Use the mouse". No, why would I? Others say 'Use gamepad'. No, why would I? Others say 'But this is the standard for controlling a third person for years' Well, I do not care, it's not the standard for any other TR game, so why not mix it. Oh, I know, because they do not care about their original, loyal fan base, they want to cash out new kids who have not heard of the series until the movies have gone out and made a lot more money. Pathetic. My advice to every serious TR fan is to stay away from this game, and if you buy it, please complain to Eidos. I've seen a lot of other posts, mostly on Eidos forums, from people who told them how much it's garbage might be listening to.
