Special effects? Okay. Scripts? Terrible. No plot. No depth. Does not make sense. This film gave Superman as an insignificant hero, a hero without archetype. In the original film, it represents America in a cold war. Here, he is just a Hulk. Of course, the actors were fine. Kevin Spacei was a good choice, among others. It still does not solve the problem that this film had no depth. I can not see how anyone can come to something meaningful from this film, when Superman is created on a daily basis to be a significant hero not only in comics, but in people's minds. This was a real loss of money considering how many directions this film could take. Only a few cases: Lek Luthor could have been a negativist of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism, and on and on and on. He was just another Hookman incarnation. Superman? What was he standing in this movie for? Nothing but figurines of "savior". Wait till you get to the Dollars Theater if you see it at all.
