It's nice and fast. There is no way the actor who plays the Mat can be eighteen years old. However, the most important thing is that he behaves very convincingly for eighteen years. Must be the merit of his audition to convince them to throw him. Soon I accepted him as a naive young village boy. As he was the best performer, most of the others were also very interesting. In particular, the interaction of police officers was naturally and well balanced, and it worked very well. A more key is the style of the whole thing. It is very smooth and vibrant, and the backgrounds are atmospheric, especially due to the fact that all colors are extremely rich. Gangland is recognizable to foreign audiences, but still manages to be distinctly Australian.
