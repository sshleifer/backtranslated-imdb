I'm not sure this is a spoiler; maybe it's a public service. If you are one of those people who are focused on instant gratification that skips outright loans, you will miss the final line of the end of the voice of the announcement announcer, which states that the US has just surrendered to Nazi Germany on May 7, 1945 until the end of the Second World War. . Here are just a few problems with this conclusion: 1) The older viewer must perceive the equivalent of two or three more UNHOLI films in their minds in order to fulfill the yawning of the abyss between film events and this stunning conclusion. 2) The average man will really break through to not "see" how one of these UNHOLI populate the voids created in his head for free, instead shelling the time and money to see this UNHOLI from the video store (or cable). 3) This set of credit for imaginary news can be the first information to which some younger viewers exposed the Second World War, leading them to the conclusion that George V. Bush is the last heir of the Nazi throne.
