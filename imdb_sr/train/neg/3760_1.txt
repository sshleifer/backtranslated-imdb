This is the biggest piece of lama I've ever seen. It's unusually bored I'd rather sit on a seminar on creativity than I saw it that I knew it would be bored as it was. Even 40 seconds of hot chick bikini with a big duck does not buy anything from below 1. The reviews of this movie that claim that this movie is "inadvertently funny" are absurd and it's simply wrong. Not one thing is funny in this movie. The first 50 minutes pass through the forest by talking about things they would not understand, nor care about it, and it's just as lame when people begin to die, because you do not even know who people are because they are so UNINTERESTING. To be honest, I did not look it all the way, but that should say something about how horrible it is. The worst film forever. Immediately after I removed this dirt from a DVD player, I began to scratch it on cement in front of my house, not wanting other blockbuster clients to fall into the same error I made to rent this movie. Then Zach entered his trousers. Thank you for your time.
