I saw this film in the class of English afternoon and I was surprised how bad this version was. Do not misunderstand me, George C. Scott was great as Scrooge, but the rest of the actors did not work so hard. Sometimes I could not stop laughing stupid acting and repeating the line: "Happy Christmas to everyone!" The other time I almost fell asleep. The film is based on a short story by Charles Dickens about a rich man who does not think Christmas is anything other than crazy. After 30 minutes, the rich are visited by three ghosts, who urge him to celebrate Christmas. I can not understand how this film, with such a bad scenario, is written in five. minutes, can be so well rated. Instead of this piece of garbage, I recommend you, Bill Murrai comedy Scrooged. It was at least funny ...
