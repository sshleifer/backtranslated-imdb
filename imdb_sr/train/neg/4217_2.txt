It was recently on AMC's live movie classics and I had to laugh. I had great hopes for this adventure that follows in the spirit of "Voiage to the Earth" Core "and" Misterious Island ". I was very disappointed not only with acting credits, but also with a stupid story written by a five-year-old comic book. Be sure to see the wires that hold onto the wings of Pterdactil when they catch the "Ogar" of a semi-modern pre-modern man who is a friend of lost adventurers. The completion was left open to further review the same effects in "People That Time Forgot". Do not waste your time.
