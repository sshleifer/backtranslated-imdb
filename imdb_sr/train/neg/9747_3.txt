Okay, first of all, this movie is bullshit. But, let's see why. The claim that the machine is capable of transforming matter into energy, that it is stored, and then transported and re-collected is the least intriguing. But that's all up to this assumption. Instead of embarking on what might have happened if someone made this kind of machine, they would smash the damn thing. This could have been a good premise. To live with the responsibility of this kind of power, and to deal with the constant temptations, ie. Invisible man. But no ... they break the damn thing. And Lembach wants to go. Then the doctor runs things together, and tries to be transported. Only to be fooled by his beautiful, but stupid secretary. What would have happened if Lembach had not decided to leave. So now he wanders the earth by killing people because his little experiment failed, and they did not give him money. Vah. Then, in order to make the film even worse, the British relationship between two semi-competent professors was hired to help him. Between the sessions she loves, they try to find him while he kills half of London. All this could have been started by not breaking the damn machine, which would never have happened if Lembach did not leave. This film tried to give him 2 honest honors for the effort, but it would be better not to break the damn machine, making Lembach by leaving, which he tried again. Damn it was Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
