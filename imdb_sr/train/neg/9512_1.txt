I can not believe it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I laughed a few times. (probably because it's stupid) If someone paid me to see this movie again, I would not. the plot was so terrible, it did not make sense, and the acting was so bad that I could not even say if they were trying. that movie was a horrible rating: F
