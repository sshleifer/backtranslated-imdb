I recall that I was forced (yes - literally PRISIL) to see this film from the South Baptist Preacher when I was a child, and even then I liked his horror. It is intended to scare the poor natives to be "saved". The only thing that "saved me" was the fact that it was finally over and I could go out and have a real life. See the chapter on this film in the book by Sarah Diamond "The Politics of the Christian Right." FASCINANTAN. And certainly more interesting than film!
