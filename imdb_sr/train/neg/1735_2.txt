I have the feeling that the manufacturers of this mess made the most sickly, funnier western ever made. "PAINFUL" is the best word I can imagine to describe it. On the plus side you have a nice color photograph and a nice and well-spoken Rhonda Fleming. My sympathy goes to Jack Aubuchon (who played the rich), who acted well enough in a boring role, written so cruelly that no actor could give a pleasant performance. The production values ​​were pretty good, which only illuminated the terrible story and scenario. Things I hated: Stevart Granger looked as little as a Western figure, what with his British accent, neat tailor's equipment and foolishly blindingly always white-tie-knitted around the neck. It became a tedious way in which the citizens and his son were constantly bothered and insulted by Granger, and he never spoke or answered. I know we need to stop believing and appreciate the Westerners as a symbolic morality, but this shattered the spell with her funnyly unrealistic and predictable, the worst at the end where Granger miraculously, rapidly and independently grew the dynamite around the canyon through the cattle of a bad guy, and then Granger to plant in the perfect place so that he can shoot from the dynamite from a very long distance to create slides to bury and frighten cattle and bad guys, seemingly destroying them, except for the two main bad guys. The next worst is about the plot, full of soap operas. Nothing in the movie seemed convincing: I could not believe what it was about. A bad guy drove his herd to the market and wanted cows to eat some grass; I do not see why something could not be worked out. Do you need a dispute over land ownership? Do not try to see it.
