Almost two people play, and as such a dialogue and performances of the leader will be important. Neither one is particularly good. It may have been stronger, in fact, that it was first made as a game for two people, and then it was turned into a movie. In any case, a vampire that looks a bit autistically becomes stuck in a striptease (as a result of watching too much pornography in his shitty home). He wants to tell him his day. It would be better for him to find someone with a day job, or someone who stands out in painting with words as a poet, but then he may not have a hot soul. doing whatever he wants (and not very good at it), he intends to feed it at 6 in the morning, at what point the sun goes out. Much has been done since that time, despite the fact that he also says that he can go without feeding, it will only make him hungry. In addition, he claims that he can not let the stripper go, because he knows about him, but he allows many other people to go and learn what he is. There is a lot of inconsistencies. Why this vampire decides to live in a house that is so badly embedded that the light from street lamps and adjacent buildings is poured as if it were day, I'm not sure. All the time in the world, he would have thought he'd done a better job, or he had a little better place. He's obviously not a rich vampire. This is allegedly a remake, and I am curious to see the original version of this, Dance of the Damned. Although it was directed by Katt Shea and the other films she directed for Corman (Stripped to Kill, StK II) were pretty bad.
