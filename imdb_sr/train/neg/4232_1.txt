Karl Jr and his father are now leading the army on a remote island. They caught three guys who stumbled across the island. After a while, I'll give it back. (good survivors) This one has uninterrupted blood, blood and bloodshed, which would be good for either of them to look realistic, or if the production did not look like it was made with a week-old lunch money (maybe I was overly stunned there. just a couple of days). Terrible synchronization did not bother me so much and I doubt I was really drunk, some of them may have been a bit humorous .... maybe. But, as it is, in only 78 minutes the film still felt too long ... Oh, I do not know ... 78 minutes. Do not waste your time. My Rating: F DVD Ektras: Bonus Movie: "Zombie '90: Ectreme Pestilence"; and Trailers for other Shock-o-Rama films
