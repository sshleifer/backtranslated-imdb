"Ghost of Dragstrip Holl" was one of the many 50s movies that talked about young people who came to supernatural. In this case, teenagers can not pay the rent for their hangout and be thrown out. I can not go anywhere else, decide on the obviously haunted house. As you have guessed, when they arrive, some weird things start to happen. And there is a turn in the end. There's nothing in this movie that you did not see in other movies, but it's still a good party. My favorite character was a parrot. Well, let me rephrase: he did not speak as a character in Quentin Tarantino's film, but he said things that we do not expect from a bird. The film is pure hockey, but harmless.
