Inappropriate. The PG rating this film gets is another big misstep of the MPAA. Vhale Rider gets PG-13 but this movie gets PG? Please. Parents can not be deceived, take a primary school child into this film is a big mistake. There were countless times when I felt uncomfortable not only because humor was inappropriate for children, but also because it was completely unusual and unnecessary. is still a horrible movie. Casting and the overall appearance of the film are the only rescue graces. Beautiful Kelly Preston and always cute (or in this case hateful) Alec Baldwin are good in their roles, although Preston is almost too beautiful for such a role. Children are conditioned by actors and this is especially the case with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the movie that watched me and did not throw things on the screen. Have I mentioned that in this movie was a huge cat talking? Mike Miers is absolutely sad. I did not like Shrek's voice, and I really do believe that Miers should not be allowed to return near children's movies. His show "Cat" is a tattered version of Fat Bastard and Austin Povers. for one day, he destroyed 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and quarrel. The cat in the hat is perhaps the worst child movie ever.
