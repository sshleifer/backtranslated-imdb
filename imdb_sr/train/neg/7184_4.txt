This was not a very good movie. There were many incredible and predictable things that happened during the film ... but I think most critics miss the point why this film should be enjoyed by a wide audience. THIS FILM IS PROVEDED BY MAGIC JOHNSON! Is not that enough to inspire us to look at this film? The film made by the former NBA star does not come every day, you know. Beautiful stupid kids in a big house that is cut by an ax with a psychopath. Every clich√© jumped out to trample. Teen sec. Everything was produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can not say enough about this movie! Teen drug use! College Hijink! Everything was produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! Iippeeee!
