Daddy's girls Florence Lavrence and Dorothy West get incredible news in the local post office, unaware that they are being persecuted by the burglar Charles Inslee. In the meantime, Father David Miles received a message (from young Robert Harron), why his father must leave home; So, when young women return, can they be? home alone. As the bed of vulnerable couples in the evening is lowered to the evening, the local "Big Blacks of Black and Tan" starts; And, the dark-haired drunk is an additional danger for D.V. Griffith's dynamic duo? <br /> Mr. Inslee has one of her better biographical roles, stealing a movie from The Girls and Daddy. Ironically, the director of Griffith appears as one of the black faces on the "Black and Tans" ball. "Biograph Girls" Lavrence and West suggest later "Griffith Girls" Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in "Orphans of the Storm" (1921); And, they are exuberantly kind in bed! The racist tone is unfortunate, as the story of a burglar who is bought by rescuing his potential victims of greater danger is intriguing. <br /> <br /> *** Girls and Dad (2/1/09) D.V. Griffith ~ Florence Lavrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
