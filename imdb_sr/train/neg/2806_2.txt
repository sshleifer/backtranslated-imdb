The worst kind of movie. Basically, the US Declaration of Independence was replaced by a plasma screen and this has been cheating on museum security for several days. Eh? Plasma screen that would theoretically work in less than 2 seconds from this battery, assuming it has enough low internal resistance to deliver the needed current, which you would not. > It would be possible with about a dozen large batteries and inverters, but this system would not fit into the enclosure. I'm sorry I'm anal, but it's not even close to be acceptable. The rest of the film was not much better and I wondered why the budget could not be donated for charity or in me.
