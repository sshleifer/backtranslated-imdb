I never understood the appeal of this performance. The acting is bad (Debra Jo Rupp is an exceptional exception), the complications of most episodes are grumpy and unkind, the dialogue is weak, jokes are uncomfortable, and it's painful to try to sit even up to half an episode. Moreover, the link between this show and the '70s is extremely weak from the style of dress, and the scenery and background used for the show - it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old, incomprehensible, clich√© scripts that modern comedy wears are as if they were showing a performance of twenty years ago in the hope of getting some nostalgic viewers or something like that. And "Happi Dais" and "The Vonder Iears" use the same technique much more efficiently and are actually pleased to look against this terrible, pathetic pronunciation for the show
