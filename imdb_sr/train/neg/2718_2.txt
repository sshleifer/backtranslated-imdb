This is the least terrifying film I've ever seen. As a blob manages to eat anyone, the film's mystery is the greatest. The blob moves so slowly that o.a.p in the zimmerframe can escape. Krugga has a great piece of happiness that comes across a typical woman of a horror movie that instead of running runs half an hour so that it can be eaten. If you have not seen this movie, I recommend that you do it, because it's too funny to take it seriously.
