Those who are familiar with the two previous Cuban movies pretty much know what they can expect: a small group of people trapped inside a bunch of mines of captured rooms, paranoia, bad acting ... This one is a little different. About half of the film goes out of the cube, where we can watch people see people in the cube (or at least five). I assume that Cube Zero is trying to explain what you are doing with a gamble, but you really do not know much more than what was covered in the first two films. Of course, there is some sort of explanation, but it seems pretty poor compared to what was suggested in the first movie. Cube Zero looks pretty cheap (like its predecessors) and the fact that it shows more than just a couple of empty rooms just emphasizes that feeling. I was also quite sure to say that there is no risk that any of the actors will win any prize in the foreseeable future. However, they have returned Cube 1 traps (which I think are almost the same, which is a little embarrassing). I know that many people appreciate this film and its relationship with the first, but I feel that this is a completely unnecessary contribution to the franchise which was not so great for the start.
