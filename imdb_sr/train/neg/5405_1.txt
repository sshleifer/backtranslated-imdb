I got it like a Turkish movie and I was not disappointed. The acting - all in all, although many were in other films, it is clear that they had to work so badly on the whole throughout the entire film without accidental release from the head. Plot - To be generous I could say that the scriptwriter initially began to complicate, but he did everything he could to ignore him. the plot broke faster than the Chinese computer Scrip - now it was a horror of nature. she failed to run with any rhythm or reason. most lines of characters were at best pathetic for imbeciles. the script worked hard to make sure that no character was able to be considered unforgettable. I watched other films in which the statistics were more interesting and memorable. Special Effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! They were short bus specials Directing - until you could think of your own directing ability to copy the style of your favorite director, otherwise you will only make the breakdowns. It's good to know that your friends / family gave you 10 stars for this movie
