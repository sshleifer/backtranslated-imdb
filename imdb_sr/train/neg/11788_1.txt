This was one of the worst movies EVER !!!!!!!! It was so bad, I laughed through CELOG film! The action was SO cheesi; especially the place. This movie turns out to be a catastrophe at the end of the world to save eels! I mean, come on! And I swear ... I think they are using SOCK PUPPETE for eels! And there was this terrible scene of kisses in the middle with two main characters who divorced. How predictable! It was so terrible that my mom, my sister, and I could not finish that, and when we finished it, it was a year later! The second time we watched him and finished this time, we commented on MST3K during the whole movie. Make hilarious comments, watch this for sleep because of laughter, and I mean the HUGE smiling. Also beware of scamming. Metaphor that explains this film: This film is a very shallow field full of dolls cheese and socks!
