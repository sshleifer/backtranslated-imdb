This movie is really crazy. I really can not say anything nice about it, apart from the moral truths expressed at the peak of the film about neighborhood people taking part in the fight against crime. In addition to all this, the film had nothing: no good recordings, no good acting and no good scenarios. I'm giving this film F and 2 out of 10.
