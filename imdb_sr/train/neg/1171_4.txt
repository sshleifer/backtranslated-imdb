I can hardly believe that this is an inert, sharp and badly set film by a director whose other works I enjoyed. The experience of sustaining DAME and DUKE (and no other word, but "permanent" will not) left me in a moody mood, a state that was released only by reading the IMDb user comment by Ali-112. Not only did Rohmer try (with success) to see us through the 18th-century artistic genre of France, but, as He pointed out, he showed (by the cost of alienating his audience) the effects and class consciousness and the revolution was inspired by the eyes of an incomprehensibly elitist woman of your time. The director has achieved something indisputably difficult, but I wonder whether it was worth the effort he was supposed to do - or to watch the boring results of his work.
