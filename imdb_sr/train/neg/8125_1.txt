"The Bat People" is a really bad movie that earned a MST3K treatment just like the second movie "The Creeping Terror". In it we are in some kind of mountain terrain full of bats. . We see that many things happen, such as bats that fly and attack things, hunt for caravans, accidents in emergency services, and more! All this, plus a cheesy mediocre in the 1970s (hey, you mean "Mitchell" here!), Making "The Bat People" is actually one of the best recent episodes "Misteri Science Theater 3000" made in the series! Movievise, that's terrible. It should be avoided as a plague, unless Tom Servo and the Blood see with you. "Bat Bat" - more like "Bad People !!!!!" LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 today !!!!!
