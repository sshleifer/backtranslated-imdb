Svaize does not seem very convincing Alan Kuatermain. Compared with Stevens Granger; growing up was my ultimate hero in films like 1952 "Scaramouche", 1952 "Prisoner from Zende" and 1950 "King Solomon's Mines"; Patrick Svaize failed. Even showing the older Alan Kuatermain by Sean Connery in the "League of Ektraordinari Gentlemen" was very good in otherwise great failure. Also, Alison Doodi misses the mercy of Deborah Kerr as the leading ladies, and last but not least, the impressive Siriakue in the role of Umbop, it's very hard for everyone to fill up their shoes !!! For someone who was disappointed with Richard Chamberlain's 1985 version, I recommend that you do not get a hand on the Granger version.
