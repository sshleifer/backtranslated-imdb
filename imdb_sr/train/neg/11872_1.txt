The only way this family drama is that parents misjudge her message. SPOILER: keep deer for a year, then kill him for eating after killing his mother and initially pontificate about taking responsibility for his actions. They blame bears and deer for "bad behavior" by eating, not taking any responsibility to use adequate locks and fences or even learning to shoot instead of licking animals twice and letting them stay.
