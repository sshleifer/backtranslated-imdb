'The Vampire Bat' is certainly interesting because one of the early horror films of the 1930s, but taken in isolation, is all a bit cramping for any true praise. The film is in one European village, sometime in the 19th century, where a number of murders are attributed to the vampires who are suspicious to locals. There is a very similar feel to James Franklinstein's "Frankenstein", which relates to the introduction of Lionel Atville's Doctor Niemann, along with his misconceptions for scientific advancement. used as a red-haringa because of the suspicion that it falls on the crazed peasant Herman (Dvight Frie), providing an excuse for a mafia fighting with torches to go on a rampage - as if they needed one. This is one of the trio of early horror films starring Lional Atvill and Fai Vrai (also 'Doctor X' and 'Witch Mystery Mystery'), and like their other collaborations, the film is suffering from a bad attitude comic relief and the inclination to turn from horror to the mainstream elements of the thriller. Taking into account the context, 'The Vampire Bat' is still weak and performed. All we have left is the poor Frankenstein imitation, with vampire elements that are just a device that pulls fans of Drakule. But for the title of the movie, he would torture himself even as a horror and it is worth noting that director Strauss worked several years later on Blondie films.
