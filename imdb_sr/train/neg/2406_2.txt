From the mind of Harry Alan Tovers comes another piece of film sludge. Allegedly based on H. Rider Haggard, the only similarity that Haggard carries is that it is happening in Africa (although there are dinosaurs in Africa - used by our fearless adventurers to pull their canoes!), And Some characters with the same names. Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) went on a quest for treasure, armed only with a medallion, and ended up just where there is a mild, clean chance. By the way, they meet a wide range of extremely lame monsters, pick up a French chef, and McCallum has an affair with the Queen of Phoenix. It's so funny, it's a joke. That's the only reason I did not give 1.
