Do not bother. A little prosciutto could go a long way, but all we get is a clean ham, especially from the Danube. The action is one of those episodes of a bumper car ... the vehicle is thrown into another and everything changes direction until we start to scratch our heads wondering if it has ever been complicated. Gina Phillips is actually good, but it is difficult to play through the mysterious Dunawai who plays Ladi Macbeth lost in the duck of Mark's brother soup. Ah, Gavran ... he's an actor now. And there is a cousin who just lies and lies and looks witty. Or Dr. A dread that is full of darkness and does not have any working medication. I'm one of those crazy people who just have to see the movie to the end. Forget the Raven, "Never again."
