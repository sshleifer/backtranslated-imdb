I saw Dolemites and also (Avenging) Disco Godfather, two more fine pieces of blakploitation canons from our friend Rudi Rai Moore. But this film, The Human Tornado (called Dolemite 2) will always have a special place in my heart. For pure nonsense, lack of skills in film production and absolute enthusiasm (frankly a bit too much), The Human Tornado can not be surpassed. The starting scene sets the tone. Our old friend Dolemite is spreading with a white woman, when some racist local policemen fall into the house for no good reason, and do not you know! A woman in bed with Dole is none other than a sheriff's wife. Her cry when she sees it: "He made me do it!" Dolemitin Cry: "& $ * @ $ Are You Real?" Subtlety was never its strong side. Expires? Kamey is very young Ernie Hudson (from Ghostbusters fame), continuity mistakes (characters looking in one direction, and the other in the next, Dolemite's suit changes colors in every shot of his nightclub), and Queen Bee is a demonic eye on her first scene. But the real joy here is Rudi Rai Moore himself. Did the man really think he looked cool in this movie? I certainly do not know why, but you have to admire the pure enthusiasm that he has. Whether he jumped completely from the cliff or barked to his gang in the rhyme (for example: Quick! In the cave! I have a plan to let that mother $ * @ (% and dig my grave!) Man commit certainly, he goes over times, never more than ever before doing kung fu, and a superb battle is recorded at high speed, but occasionally it slows down to put Rudi pose and squeeze her teeth as if they accelerated the movie as an effect or if they really wanted to believe that he was so fast.In any case, "Matrix" is not. Human Tornado, similar to the original Dolemite, is a noncompetitive Ntan film of enormous proportion, but at least it's fun, and of course you have to give credit to those people just do not toliko.UÅ¾ivajte with my hearty recommendations.
