Irene Dunne finished her famous career with this film. She had to come up with a scratch, like a classical actress she was, not in this unforgettable, almost unknown film. This light comedy is fine, but nothing special. The first half is far better because it's pretty stupid in the second half. Perhaps Irene saw the manuscript on the wall and gave up. Even her high voice bored a bit here. She is said to have been unhappy with this film. You can see why. The story reminded me of a television sit-movie from the 1950s. Speaking about it, I thought that David Nelson from Ozzie & Harriet was in this film, but it turned out to be very young Richard Crenna. He looked and sounded like Nelson. All in all, so at best and the sub-pair for the end of the great actress.
