I liked Chiba at Street Fighter, and I realized hey, no matter how much this movie will be stupid, I'll at least see him kicking him, right? Wrong. This is a dull, gloomy mess of absurd speech, half-written scenarios, and absurd intrigues. There are several action scenes of any kind, even less scenes of martial arts, and some of those that have been recorded and edited so bad that you can not even see what is happening in the world. Dub is also terrible, and maybe the idiotism that this film is best illustrated by the fact that it allegedly has an Italian mafia ... EXCEPT THESE SUITS! Avoid plague - you would better see martial arts by looking through your local preschool karate class window for five minutes.
