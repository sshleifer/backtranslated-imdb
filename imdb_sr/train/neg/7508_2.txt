I wish Spike Lee had chosen a different title for his film. "Summer Of Sam" gives the impression that the film about the notorious serial killer, David Berkovich. It's not. It's a true, earthly portrait of street life in New York during the hot summer of '77, when Berkovitz terrorized the city. The film follows several young characters from the Italian-American neighborhood and their reaction to Sam's Sam Threat. There is Vinny and his wife Dionne; There are Richie and Ruby, and a few other characters. The problem is that these characters are not nice. They are routinely boring and sometimes unbearable. Then Lee points out his great energy, chaotic lives, filled with rage, lust, and general turmoil. There are at least two long-lasting battle scenes between Vinny and his wife, a redundant disco dance scene, countless gabfests ... I was constantly wondering: where is the film editor? In the meantime, with all these groups, the film goes through a chance to convey any real feeling of fear or fear resulting from the evil of the son of Sam, which is too much in the background. Lee is more successful in showing a different kind of threat, which stems from neighboring vigilante groups. The performance is equally good. This, combined with disco music from the 70s, and with much attention to costumes and production design, make you really feel like you are in the Italian-American neighborhood in New York in 1977. The atmospheric authenticity of the film, however, is not nearly enough to compensate for the bulging, overloading scenarios of the lives of grossly irritating people.
