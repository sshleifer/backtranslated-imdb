CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS ... OR YOU CAN NOT BE SPOILED !!. Five times over the eyes can be summed up in one word .... Amateur. This movie is trying to be different from most of the 'Blair Vitch' movies ... it does not work ... it just ends up watching and feeling that someone has a cheap video camera, a van and decided to make a movie. The story has no explanation, the protagonist has no real motivation (and looks like a lesbian wearing a suit in relation to five girls) and there is no violence to talk about ... only the sounds of screaming and screaming. The whole movie takes place in a van, which means that a decent scene is not taken into account. Five girls really do everything they have been given, but in general they come across as pretty scary actresses ... although with the material it's difficult to assess if they really can ... spend the whole film screaming, skuealing and vhimpering .... so much so Half the time is difficult to understand what is said and the cameras are so bad that it's actually difficult to say who said it. This video is portrayed as a violent film about torture, but it's actually only five girls in a van that screams in horror ... which literally sums up the entire movie ... then we come to an end after 5 hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive ... with one minus finger. The only thumb up (catch him ... finger ... LOL) is for the poor actresses who tried and probably lost their voice (and their pride) after they filmed this horrible movie. You do not judge this by poster ... you will be very disappointed.
