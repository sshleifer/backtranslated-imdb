For years I remember reading this show "Trouble with the Tracks" in the TV Guide. CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6 o'clock! I lived about two hours drive north of Toronto and we could not get CFTO, but you know how it is - we always want what we can not have. Well, I knew what I wanted and I wanted to see what it was about "Trouble With the Tracks". Did she have a pretty girl in the lead? Was there a nudity? Was there uncertainty? Was it a comedy? It would be good if there were some promotions of the show. At least I could know what I miss. But not! The mystery led me to the fact that CTV, CKCO, picked up a re-transmitter in Viarton, Ontario, and began broadcasting "Trouble with Tracks" at the same time as CFTO .... Saturday morning at 6 o'clock! One Saturday morning I got up and turned on the TV at 5:59 and finally I saw what Trouble with Traci was. Yes, "Trouble with Traci" was that Canadian content was stuck in a safe place from 6 am, so that no one would ever see how horrible it was. after that, but many would say that he "died" the first time he appeared in this show. When I first saw that cold Saturday morning and relaxed in bed, part of me died.
