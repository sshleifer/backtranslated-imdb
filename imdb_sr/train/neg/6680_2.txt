Vov, what kind of snoozer. Definitely one of the worst bacon films. Bad behavior in combination with a formative, if not incredible scenario, makes me want to spend the time I lost on watching cable television. I can not say much about it, the basketball scout is too tied to the recruited person, which belongs to some tribe that happened at the edge of the war, and by chance, the (spoiler) basketball game is decided. Grade: F +
