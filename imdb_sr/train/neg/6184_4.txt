Brainless movie about a couple that looks good but without a brain and decides to live their dream and lead people to diving tours. The couple almost instantly makes the wrong choice of customers and they interfere with some people who want to bring back the things we see falling into the ocean floor during the opening of the credit sequence. A great look at the video film could have been much better that it was not so interested in a good look. The performances are useful, and the plot is actually not bad, or the director and producers will not redirect the action to make sure we see many nice people in bathing suits (or in what I presume to be the reason for the "unassigned" "nickname of a few short-lived naked breasts." The film never it does not create any tension or rises above the level of an unforgettable TV movie. If you get the chance to see this, you will not dig your eyes because the candy is nice in the eyes, but we really need to stop manufacturers from making movies that are justified for paid vacation.
