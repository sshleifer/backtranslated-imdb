For me, this is a story that begins with some funny jokes about Frank's fanatics when he's traveling with the stairwell and sitting in business meetings ... The problem is that you will watch this movie for an hour of the same fantasy / funny situation again and again and again. This is predictable. It's more like a TV story where you can go and go back and do not miss anything. I love Felika Herngren as Frank, but this is not enough even when it is a comedy that must have more variation and some kind of message to its audience .... <br /> <br />
