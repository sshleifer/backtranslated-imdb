As has been countless times said, "The Hills Have Eies 2" is NOT a remake of (generally neglected) sequel in the mid-1980s at the original Ves Craven from 1977. But in order to restore this postmodern continuation of the official seal of Diminishing Returns, Craven (a double threat with his son, Jonathan) decided to film a movie of the same quality - in simple English, HORRIBLE. The former director of the music video, Martin Weiss, takes the reins from Alexander Aja and apparently is on the way to his head - he is still wondering how anyone could make a movie that can be seen from Craven's writing on the screen. Not only are the characters (in this case, a gang of folk guards (vo) sent to explore the tumultuous hills of the original remake) totally disgusting and prone to really disturbing genre traps (they play without irony, watch out for it), but they constantly break up jokes that are not funny . After seeing their complete incapacity during exercise, their fate against reflexive, wandering cannibals is painfully obvious. Only this time - as in the original 80s - the script is so simple (actually barely exists) that every potential sub-text is excluded in favor of increasing the role in repulsive shocks (we are treated as a childbirth) -murder during the opening of the loan, plus free rape for those who did not eject DVDs in the middle!). Even mutants in this trip are monsters without a personality without memory - sticky makeup FKS looks like the rest of the movie trying to hide the face of shame. I really wept on a ludicrous 'surprise' at the end of the otherwise awesome Aina film, and the producers literally went to the break at the end of the "Hills 2", setting the stage - VERY inconsistent setting up the stage - for a third. The sequel ... however, Cravens and Veisz made a movie that was so cynical as a bastard of what the 1977/2006 versions were doing to be hard pressed to find the audience after this offensive shamrock in the face.
