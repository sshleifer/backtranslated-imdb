I've never seen this movie, but I can tell you something about its production. While working in 1988, I was comedian / oldies, I got a call from a production company. They asked me if I would write and record a little to get into the soundtrack like sounds broadcast from the television (the TV screen would never have been shown). I said that I wrote a parody of 50 clips from science fiction fantasies, rounded up some sound effects and invited another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the female part. While at the time she was in the air, she dressed a long song, joined me on the microphone in the production hall, and we shuffled the voice in one go. She giggled and then returned to her performance while I was mixing in a stupid sound effect. We would never do that we knew that the Voodchipper Massacre would be such a party - but, again, we were not paid for our efforts either! - Gary Therouk
