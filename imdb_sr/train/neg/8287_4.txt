This is largely a television version of the story, the film begins as an episode of 'Xen ...', with a little meaningful dialogue or character description. After a while, it becomes more and more essential, but all the characters are still cartooned. Salma is an exotic beauty. Richard Harris is evil and sexually suppress Frollo, trying to catch a walnut in Salma. Other characters, including Kuasimodo, are quite forgetful. It is also a kind of liberal version of the story, Frollo is a threshold of the ideal of enlightenment, as abbot in the name of the rose, and Quazimodo is a champion of freedom. The dark side of Kusa's character is ignored, although he pumps fluid into people. He is really just an outsider in what looks different and enjoys playing with bells over the average person. Perhaps the movie is intended for children, but I doubt it, since Frollo was cursing to change the desire to spit his monkey. Somewhat uninteresting and forgetful, but not terrible, and sometimes fun, displaying a story.
