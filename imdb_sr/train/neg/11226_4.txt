I'm kind of torn to DARK ANGEL. It seems that the film is a "love" tribute to the greatest pin-up that he has ever lived-but there is so little real content that the film itself is practically meaningless. I can not really see what the motivation or "point" of this film is - since there is very little biographical information in the narrative - so those who do not know much about Betti will not know much more after watching DARK. ANGEL or ... The film basically records the last few years of Betty's career in modeling slavery. Almost the entire film consists of "repetition" of some of Betty's "famous" photographs and loops. These reconstructions take up virtually 75% of the time they are showing the films and practically do not give a glimpse of Bettie as a person. The film briefly deals with its short-lived legitimate actions, and its subsequent decision to leave the "business" and become religious - but all this is largely overlooked in favor of showing long and exhausted repetition scenes. ... TAMANI ANGEL is not a horrible movie - it simply has no content. The other problem is that the actress who plays Bettie just looks like her more distant shots - up close is not-go. The other thing that irritated me was that Bettie, although she made several toples of modeling footage - the only nausea in the film was a short segment in the zoo during the final credits. The film itself is obviously extremely low-budget, but it does what it can set up and costume within its limitations - so I'm not there. The acting is pretty wooden and unforgettable of all involved. In fact - for me, it was the most memorable in the whole movie, I noticed during the final credits that the actor who acted the real name of Irving Duke Duke Flisvatter. No joke - check the list. I can not say that I recommend this too if you are not the real Bettiefil kit and you have to have anything to do with it. And if you're so bad - then you have to look for treatment ... 4/10
