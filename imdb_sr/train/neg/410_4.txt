Unfortunately, one of the best efforts in the field of special effects has been rendered completely meaningless by being set beside a stupid, stupid and equally meaningless complication and an inadequate, clich√© scenario. Holl Man is a pretty useless movie. Practically all that is seen here is done to death - characters, ideas and action sequences (especially shaft lifts!) - with the only truly intriguing element of the film is an impressive special effect. However, this is the same effect done over and over again, and the end of a film that has been done until death. I was hoping that before seeing Holl Man, the theme of an invisible man, which in itself is not genuine, would be the basis of something newer and more interesting. That's not the case. It's been a while before the film turns into an overly familiar bloodbath and a mass of inefficient histrionics - a bunch of cliches accumulate so quickly that it is almost impressive. Bekon does a pretty useless job, and his auxiliary head barely tries. Good points can be the passing result of Jerry Goldsmith (but without competition for his better efforts), quite interesting use of thermal images and special effects. I was tempted to give this film three out of ten, but the effects pushed Holl Man's credit to one degree. 4/10
