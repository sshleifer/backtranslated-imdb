!!!!! COSTS ARE SPOILERS !!!!! I'm sure this project started as a screenwriter screening campaign on avoiding clichés in horror films: The female protagonist - Check Bad things happen to drug addicts - Make sure Heorine throws out a bad guy - Check heroin does not notice that the villain has recovered unconsciousness - Check the box in order to see that a recovered criminal appeared behind heroin - Check Unfortunately it seems that someone has sent this list of clichés to a film studio instead of using it for time. Dear God, if only the transport in London was regular as the clichés appearing here. In fact, there are so many cliches, and all this was before someone was thinking of details about what the homemade swimmer was or how long he killed people in the underworld. I believe that this is the result of a human experiment and maybe it was only that night that decided to avenge humanity, but it is so unclear that it makes no sense. Do not be completely negative. producers thought they would film a movie that this year will clear Oscar and there is always a market for horror films. Likewise, I doubt that it cost too much of the product and had one eye on the DVD market, and not in the cinema distribution, and I will say that it is slightly better than the DEATH LINE from 1972, which also had a killer cannibal who was hiding in London's underworld. only when you think that all clichés are used in this movie, another cliché comes to pick up its ugly head
