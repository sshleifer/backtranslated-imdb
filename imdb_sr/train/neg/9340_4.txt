This is one of the most exciting movies I've ever seen. Usually Roger Ebert does not let me down, but I feel cheated after I've seen it. Movie. The only excitement is to see Elizabeth Bank in her bras. This is a sad statement about this movie. There was plenty of promise, but it was like a dry push of a transvestite. This is just an absorbent thorn. I can not express enough of my bitterness as I went through this movie and I hope that I can warn you about the same disappointment.
