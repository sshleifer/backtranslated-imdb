This film was the longest movie and film that took the record. He must have had 30 actors. After JAANI DUSHMAN (2002), I guess no one had the courage to do something like that. is based on Kargil's war, but the problem is that there are too many characters, and the romantic backgrounds and songs of many characters are boring. Even when there are too many movie freedoms like killing people with knives, it's amazing <br / > Director of JP Dutta pale in front of the border Music is OK </> <BR>> Among the huge actors, Ajai Devgan is tall, Saif is very good in his work and also his first film with a karen, Abhishek is nice Manoj Bajpai has his moments Sanja is futile, Suneil is fine Aksha Khanna has a good part of his rest is passable Early good, Esha is fine the rest is passable
