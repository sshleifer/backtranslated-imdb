I bought this video pretty cheap ek-rent, thinking that the cover looked pretty nice. And it was nice, but the film is trash. I can deal with B-class, sometimes I even enjoy good B romp (for example, 'Surf Nazi must die' is a classic example of how a fun genre can be), but this is just a bland bland. Incredibly boring scenes were overwhelmed by a good healthy cheap pornography and funny horrors of dreams. This movie has little to offer.
