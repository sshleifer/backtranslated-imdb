This was the worst movie I ever saw and I saw many bad films. First I'm from Kansas this film has no trace of truth in it. It's like they took the BTK name and made up the rest. On top of this, it seems that someone is like I only got $ 20 here to take it and make a movie and oh do not worry about researching btk at all just invent something. No one should see this film seriously. Slaughtering cows and forcing victims to eat things and describe slaughtering animals. Produced for TVs are much better and more accurate
