Veteran selections Bruno Mattei is again on this erotic thriller that clearly responds to 8MM Joel Schumacher. But, as expected, Mattei makes his film about a small budget - so it seems somewhat unusual when it's newly opened. Hijackers belong to an international organization that directs movies about burmutics as long as exclusive clients pay well. The search for her daughter leads not only to mother across Europe, but also to prostitution. She goes to bed with some types to get traces. When finally he comes in contact with the organization led by the mysterious doctor Hades, it turns itself into a great danger. There is not much good to say about this, although it begins to promise. The problem is that the film is not so sleazy or explicit as it could be expected of the director who recorded movies like BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (first published in Russia!) It's not cruel enough or contains the amount of nudity and sex to really keep the attention of the viewer. The action is not so special, except perhaps for surprisingly many different locations across Europe. The end is very disappointing. The acting is not remarkable, except Anita Auer, who plays Dr. Hades: It looks and works very creepy. You do not want to get acquainted in this way in the dark alley (or your bedroom). All in all, SNUFF TRAP is just talking to Brunei Mattei's film collectors. But it's good to see a man again at the helm: it was his first thriller since 1994. giallo GLI OCCHI DENTRO.
