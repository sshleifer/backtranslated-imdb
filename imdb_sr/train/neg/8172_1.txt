A candelabra killer is on board and two quarrels can be his next source of protein in this cheap basement on Friday, a cheaper thirteen clone. Literally nothing interesting in this case, murders are surprisingly rare and when they happen, they are completely amateurish. It also adds ghosts to the mix without any reason. I felt exhausted after looking at her as if my brain was sticking up and I dropped my nose. And the worst movie of Donald Jones remains undoubtedly. If you are considering renting for a new Red DVD DVD edition for Code Red, do not bother! My Rating: F
