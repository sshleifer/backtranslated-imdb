I wonder how much this film actually has to do with the 1984 film Bachelor Parti, starring Tom Hanks. Is this film even an official sequel? This movie is missing in every department and you obviously better not watch it. For comedy, this movie is simply not good enough or funny. It basically relies on their stereotypical assessments, not on films that are really good, original and funny. Of course, there is also a very small story and a film about bare breasts by the scenarios. You just wait for things to finally start. Somewhere in it there is a major lineage of the line, but it is so terribly unoriginal and executed so badly in a movie that it feels more like something does not exist. I suppose there is a message and a moral story somewhere in it, but this is again so terribly unoriginal and badly done in the movie that it just does not work. Basically is a typical teenage comedy, lots of sexual jokes and nudity, just without the teenage main characters, making the story even more sad and distasteful. The film makes some really mischievous jokes, which are wrongly set for any kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to watch this. 3/10
