This film is exaggerated, predictable, pretentious and hollow to its core. The settings are a faithful era, but self-conscious in their increase by prolonged exposure. Holding artifacts stops the action and clois almost the same as an empty dialogue. Tom Hanks looks like he sleeps in a dream like Bruce Villis in Hart's War. Tom, you can not give the depth to the character simply by being empty! The content did not guarantee Paul Nevman's acting acting. This is a nonsense wrapped in an atomic bomb.
