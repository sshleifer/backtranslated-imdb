WE ARE FUTURE FEATURE Image Ratio: 1.33: 1 Sound Format: Quiet (Black & White - Short Film) <br /> <Flat 'n' Ollie mingles with several flutes (Kai Deslis and Vera Vhite) after going to the theater that burns in their absence! Needless to say, their tyrannical wives (Vivien Oakland and Bess Flovers) are not entertaining ... Leo McCarey's comedy set up a narrative frame for the masterpiece of Villyama Seiter SONS OF THE DESERT (1934) , with L & H playing the worshiped victims of the circumstances, forced to tell a monstrous lie that reflects spectacularly. Much of it is very funny, especially the scene in which Wall was teased by Deslis, which led to a violent push and pushing game. However, some funs are undermined by Oakland and Flovers, playing their roles perfectly flat, which adds an element of inconvenience to the scenario of 'henpecked husband'. Originally published in the UK as VE SLIP UP.
