When I went to watch a movie, I did not see the trailer of the movie, but I based my decisions on the friends' opinion. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie just falls on my face. It seems that the film wants to integrate both laughter and love into one, and that is trying. The love story in the movie is right ahead (luckily), but it takes too much of the film out of what makes Rock a serious and mild one. After all, the film is primarily destined to be a comedy, where laughter should be primary concern. Not much in the movie. The action is also quite uninteresting as a whole. Some parts are completely discontinued. If the auxiliary act was ridiculous, they certainly did not do a good job. Several angels from heaven tried to make a few jokes, which were dry and boring. A pair of undermining Roch's first incarnation was also mild. If there is one thing they did right, then they made Rocka funnier in comparison.
