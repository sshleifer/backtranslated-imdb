A dedicated fan of TLK films, the first being a turning point, and the other probably the best sequel that Disney has produced, with this movie ... Now I do not argue with animation, voice, music, but this is no more than Timon / Pumbaa screws into the atmosphere TLK . While not bad, it does not add anything. Basically, this film is a big joke ... and that is all that saves him. Make a real TLK3, Disney! The potential exists. 4/10
