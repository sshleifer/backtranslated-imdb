This movie made me very angry because the main characters or all the characters had a southern accent. I live in Iova for 29 years and I know that people here do not have a southern accent. This film is about a guy who deals with the target and I do not know the real plot or what the movie should be about. There are some pretty graphic use of drugs in it and it's really offensive, so you see that these people use meth like sugar. I lost my brother for the target and this film is bothering me from the stomach because it glamorizes the drug. The film seems to look cool for drug use, but in the end I was happy when the guy almost crossed the state border. I also know that most women experiencing traumatic rape do not want to make love with their boyfriend or husband the next day. The film is wrong in all directions. I suggest "basketball logs" if I'm going to suggest a movie about drugs.
