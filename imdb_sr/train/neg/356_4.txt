The shape of the film is uncertainty. There are surprises, twists, turns and excitement. Occasionally, this is really a movie "on the edge of the seat". But disappointing and seriously disappointing. The sorcerer of this work is not credible; his character is not held together. I refuse to "spoil" the film, but I will just say that the person who meets at the beginning can not be the one we see in the end. Another great disappointment for the movie is that - finally, it becomes a bit more than a bloody slasher movie. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the "Friday 13" movies. It's not that every movie must always be completely tasty, but this film occasionally drops. Although the movie shows the magnificent Sean Conneri, even he does not adapt to his usual standard, and often only seems to walk through the steps.
