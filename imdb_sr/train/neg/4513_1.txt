Although the book was not entirely accurate in the actual situation, it still had a sense of Japan. It's hard to believe that anyone who was involved in making this film was ever in Japan because he did not feel the least. Almost everything was terrible. I admit that the actors were mostly pretty good, but they did not have the chance to save it. Before the film began, I was surprised that there were only ten people in the cinema on Friday evening after the film was opened in Japan. For 30 minutes I was stunned as they stayed. I stayed so I would have the right to criticize him. The entire film was interrupted by my groans and a suppressed laugh of disbelief from my Japanese girlfriend. Everyone I saw coming out of the cinema looked as if they were confused and disappointed on their faces. For the creators of this film, you owe me two hours.
