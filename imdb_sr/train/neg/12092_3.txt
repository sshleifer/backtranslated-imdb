I can not fail to recognize Haneke's extraordinary skills in creating a movie. For example, I value his retention on non-reflective, natural days-illuminated settings as a powerful way to impose a strong sense of realism. However, as far as the content of this film is concerned, I am very sorry to see that in the 21st century there is still a need to pathologize relations or feelings that underlie domination (and / or BDSM practice). The problem that the main character has with her mother is incredibly actual, such as the alienation and misunderstanding that Valter feels (I do not mean the frustration of a lover who does not return in the same way, which is understandable; he looks at her as if she was crazy, or like a monk, come on!). I do not think the D / S is anything new in the world and I think it's pretty stupid to treat the subject as if it was something "weird" or pathologically; it's not. In general terms, films dealing with this topic are really lagging behind in time. So, I consider this film to end up as a program film, concerned with very obsolete psychoanalytical theories (right?). Is this almost embarrassing?), And this does not actually relate to the life and experiences of those involved in D / s relationships (personal experience, forums, irc chatroom, even recent study studies will show it).
