I think the scarecrows are creepy, so it's a pity that this film does not do it anymore. A bunch of robbers rescue the parachute from the plane to a huge field with a scarecrow. One of them disappeared with prey and so it remained rotten while the inexplicably evil scarecrows came upon them. The act is hammi and the scarecrow is uncomfortable (when moving). On the positive side, the director gets some uncertainty from a static scarecrow. As Alfred Hitchcock says, "a bomb under the table goes away, and that's a surprise. We know that the bomb is under the table, but not when it will go away, and that's uncertainty."
