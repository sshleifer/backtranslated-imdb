Although the production and direction of Jerry Jameson are definitive improvements, "Airport '77" is not much better than "Airport 1975": a smooth, commercial waste (this time literally) a decent actor. Jack Lemmon is a pilot-packed plane that has been abducted by art thieves and crashed into the sea (all publicity claimed that it is near the Bermuda Triangle but is not mentioned in the film itself). When rescue boats arrive to draw a plane out of the water, we see all their cranes falling (pretty blind) into the ocean and it's hard not to laugh (imagining that cranes bury the plane, passengers and banned letter). NBC broadcast what looked like a "cut-off" with at least an hour of extra shots-mostly flashback-that were put into action with all the subtleties of the Gilligan Islands episode. The most exciting moment is a plane crash, and some of the players have a little fun: Lee Grant is a disgusting drunk, Brenda Vaccaro, stupid stewardesses, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland flirting the old men. Nevertheless, personality conflicts and restless military details ultimately raise patience. ** from the ****
