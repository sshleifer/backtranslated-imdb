This is absolutely the worst piece of shit I've ever had to watch - it was actually so bad that I just watched it :-) CGI is sooo bad and funny it is! It's not even close to the crappy CGI animations in Spavn, how bad it is, har har har ... this on DVD, but I suppose it will get more money out of it, because the cost of making it can not be more than a few hundred dollars. It's so terrible that Classroom Kindergartens could have made it. Take a look and laugh!
