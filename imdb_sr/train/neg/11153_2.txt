The second in a long line of shifts made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling the story. Within 15 minutes, the entire premise is set in only a few rows, so there is absolutely no mystery, which eliminates the whole aspect of uncertainty. The only semi-competent actor was killed for 10 minutes in the film, so we stayed with the stupid characters that run around working nonsense. Low budget films can not afford expensive special effects, so CGI parts are not surprisingly striking, but at least they were a valid attempt. The suit of the creature is terrible, as it can be seen when it falls on the pavement, and the director continues to emphasize the eyes, which are not even red in the mirrors. The dialogue is clumsy and uninspired, and some lines resemble Aliens or Terminator. The last order of action takes place at the police station, also by the Terminator, where they all hide in the office with glass coatings in which Darkwolf does not break. In the end, the girl calls the hero a "good patron," but he also gets his partners, the original Protector, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen police officers who were all killed without a good shot, regardless of the silver bullet arsenal and automatic rifle . But here are the real fight for bad writing: They could kill the beast right after the start, when she held the stripper while she flickered with her red eyes. Instead, they arrested him?!?
