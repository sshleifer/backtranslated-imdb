I can not believe this film has ever been made. I think the director is trying to make it an artistic one, but that only worsens the situation. The zombies look like they've done too much makeup for the eyes. Zombies are in the movie just a few minutes. Finally, there are a total of five or six zombies, definitely not a nation. The best part of the film, if any, is certainly a merit because the painful experience is finally over. Again, to repeat other user comments, Voodoo priests are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie. Also, there is a scene with a snake and a Romanian girl who does not make any sense at all. Never explained.
