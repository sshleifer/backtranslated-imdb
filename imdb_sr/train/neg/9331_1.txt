Are we talking about the same movie? This film is totally ridiculous, the plot is disgusting and completely without logic. It's a typical DVD / TV movie that includes all the necessary ingredients for a horrible movie experience: Excessive acting was actors, side steps of complications that remained unexplained, GIRL SHOW TI \ t, why?), People do not react to things like in real life. I will not even bother you with details, it should take all night. Well, all right, only one: if two people were killed in front of you while walking on the street, one of the victims practically dies in your hands, his blood spreads from the wound on your head all over you, would it be your first concern? be; "Oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!"? My thoughts are about Harvey and his lost career.
