Do not waste time and money on this movie. My roommate rented it because she thought it was another movie called Descent (a movie about some passengers who are trapped in a cave). so we decided to look at it anyway, thinking that it can not be so bad. Was. I can not believe that this film was really produced and published to the public. It was so terrible that it was almost like a scene of an accident in which you want to distract the view, but you just can not be alone. Frankly, I feel emotionally. It's from a semi-low budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy she's going out all over the porn tune. And it's really not good. I passed from the hatred of a woman rapist that I almost feel bad for him. Almost. All in all, an awesome movie that is definitely rated as NC-17 for a reason. Do not spend money. And do not let your children watch you.
