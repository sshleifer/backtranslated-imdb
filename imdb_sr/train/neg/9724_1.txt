Poor Tobe Hopper. He directed the classic "Tekas Chaimsav Massacre" of all time. Since then, everything he did was horrible. This is probably the worst ... and that's a lot of talk. It's about a man (Brad Dourif) who has the ability to ignore things (and people) ... or something like that. It's hardly the original idea (someone remembers "Firestarter"?) It's a real mess ... literally everything's wrong! Pathetic acting (even Dourif!), Asina's script, louise of production value, fucking special effects ... everything is bad !!!!! He must miss ... not even good for laughter.
