99,999% of pure shit. And the other .001% was a short moment in which I thought the blonde would split. The dialogue was legendary bad. The action was exhausted and there was no sex (the mentioned blonde is modestly dressed, unfortunately, the whole movie). CGI had a dubious honor that it was the worst I've ever seen on the movie, and the anachronisms were numerous and great. The acting was central even by Ben Krst and Marina Sirtis, the only 'names' in this film. And Marina Sirtis looked really, very bad. I saw that the high school game is better. This is a movie that MST3K has progressed. The heads should be rolling in the Sci-Fi because they let this vapor bundle in the air.
