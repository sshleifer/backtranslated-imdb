The indecent, boring and unrelated supernatural "thriller" in which student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is a constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident, claims the life of her boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck). > I can not tell you how bad this is ... nothing of any significance ever happens, nor is there any real fun value. I did not like this film in this movie - all of them, unfortunately, are unconvincing (again, their roles are not good). Promote this as a horror movie is a joke. Where are the fears? No sense or uncertainty - there are several good songs, but that's all. How has this project got green light? Writer-director Steve Carpenter has no visible vision or talent that I can feel. Worst of all, the conclusion really makes the whole movie meaningless. The alleged "kill cut" that I watched is 86 minutes of pure boredom. 1/10
