Pathetic ... worse than bad TV movie. I can not believe Spacey and Freeman were in this movie. For some reason, the character Morgan Freeman constantly speaks and speaks a "pussy" when it refers to a ninx girl. Morgan Freeman calls the wife of "pussy" just inconvenient ... What the hell are people behind this movie of thinking? Too many holes for works you can imagine in combination with a horrible acting game, confusing camera angles, lingering scenarios, and inexplicable background music made this film absolutely unbearable. ... well ... it's really shit.
