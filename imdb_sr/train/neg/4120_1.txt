An absolutely horrible movie. Ameteurish is not funny at all. The main character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very boring. Editing the E.T and Star Wars is simply stupid. Actress Iilmaz Goksal is the only one to think about this film. He should master his English and move to Hollivood. Hollywood can not find an actor with its qualities. Except Goksala, this movie is a garbage. Director Ghana Mujde is a strip author and this film is his worst written work to date. Cem Karace Music is the second plus of this loss of money. The actor Sumer Tilmac also has a presence. An actor playing three sons has no talent whatsoever.
