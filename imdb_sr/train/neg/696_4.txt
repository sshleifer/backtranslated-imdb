Eh, it's not a pretty good shot. Such an act, effects, decent, but familiar and non-inventive sound background. There are three deaths in the immediate vicinity at the beginning of the film that make up a pretty good scene in which everything seems to go. In addition, there are many characters wandering around, not understanding what is happening, or chasing for red haringam; more killing time than people. There are other deaths, and the killer is a killer of equal opportunities, not biased for any realization. The killer likes other people to kill innocent people. Identity is not revealed to the end, and the motive is fairly thin, and I really do not care. Allegedly, the film unfolds around Christmas, but this is not a major factor. One scene is illuminated by Christmas lights, that's all. The film is pretty dark with a muddy picture most of the time, at least on the video cassette I watched. Some of the dialogues have lost a bit in some of the first scenes. The end should have been stronger than it was. We think we understand what happened, although there is a chance to do something else.
