This could be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not see how this could ever be described as a horror movie, or even a thriller? It's more like a dreadful drama. Scary music is EXCELLENT, but as there were no fearsome situations, the director thought it would be good to use it for everyday activities such as staging or walking stairs. The film had so much potential. they had great cinema (sp?) and interesting characters, but writers seemed to assume you already know them. they would be subjected to specific activities without explanation, or even the notion of what they thought. This is simply one of those movies that talk about one thing and something completely different.
