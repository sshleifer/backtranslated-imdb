This movie has some beautiful sets and Albert Finnei works great like a ruthless father. The film fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is too nervous as a daughter and can not coincide with the much more shaded, mature vision of Olivia De Havilland in The Heiress (1949). The film's feminist conclusion also contradicts the strict conclusion of the novel, the Washington Skua, whose author, Henri James, savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this film very disappointing.
