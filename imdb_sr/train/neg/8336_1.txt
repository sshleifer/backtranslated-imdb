How did they do it ?! Presenting itself as a comedy, the incompetent "$" is essentially two hours of people who murmur fragments of sentences. Usually reliable Varen Beatty looks drunk, and usually hilarious Goldie Havn behaves as if he were depressed. As for Gert Frobe, his most famous role - Goldfinger - was infinitely more beautiful than his character. Even a tip with a bottle of champagne LSD can not save this litany of worthlessness. Do I compare this film with Plan 9 from the Universe? I would not do such a thing even if someone paid me. "P9FOS" was idiotic, but he finished hilariously; This is an idiot made and causes you to feel like your brain just melted from your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Havn compensated this when they acted in "Shampoo," but then they acted in the terrible "Tovn & Countri". Maybe it just should not play in movies. All in all, I'd rather take off my skin than to look at it again. Terrible. Perhaps you should handle it with Jackie Chan. Then I'd pay to see him.
