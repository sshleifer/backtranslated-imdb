This move last night was on TV. I guess it's time to fill, because it was bad! The film is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the beginning and somewhere halfway. (Not bad tits and ass though). But the story is too funny for words. "Wolf", if that's what you can call it, it's scarcely shown to completely save your teeth. When it's completely visible, you can clearly see that they had some trainees working on the CGI, because the wolf runs like running in a moving lane, and the CGI fur looks like it's wax, everything is great :) <Movie It's full of blood and blood, and you can easily see who will be killed / cut. Even if you like these films, you will be disappointed, they did not do a good job. They do not even start with the actors ... Very loose lines and girls shout at everything every 5 seconds. But again, if someone asked me to do bad things, just to give me a couple of dollars, then hey, where to sign up? Overall bored and funny enjoyment.
