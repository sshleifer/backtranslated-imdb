Kareena Kapoor in bikini hmmmmmmmm. Akshai Kumar ... Anil Kapoor .... Maybe Saif .... <br /> <br /> Akshai Kumar ... Anil Kapoor .... Maybe Saif .... <br /> Kareena Kapoor in bikini ..... Good banner .. Kareena Kapoor in bikini ..... No good reason that you do not see this movie .... <BR>> Or I thought so ........ Did not people make JBJ ... <br /> <Why do I forget about it? For all the criticisms, the first half of the movie is not so bad ... There are some intrigues and I expect a soothing sorption irritation, which I am guilty when I see GUI RITCHIE FILMS AS A LOCAL FUND AND SNATCH . Kareena Kapoor screams in a very lean model in some way. <br /> <br Akshai Kumar is Akshai Kumar, because only he can be. Anil Kapoor is boring, but somehow ridiculous, FORWARD TO MAKE A LOT OF THOUGHTS. Saif is Sidei ala Main Khiladi .. once again. Occasionally she laughs a few smiles and several geese during the love story of karen-saif (karen in the rain, behind me on my bicycle). OR THE HIGHEST MAKES MORE THAN ITS SUPPLIERS ..... WHAT OTHER HAVE ALL MORE UNIBEARABLE .... <br /> <br /> It was almost a joy when the interval came, not only because of the wet ramps because of what people thought were things that would come. WE ARE ASSISTED TO SUPPORT THE MUSHROOMS OF MUSHROOMS THAT ARE HARMFUL TO WORDS IN WORDS. Saif is suddenly a seam as a comedian ... <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> Saif is a sudden seam as a comedian ... EXECUTED SEXY CAREEN LOOKING FOR ANOREXIC, YOU ARE CONVINCING ANOTHER LAST FOR THE SERVICE EMPOWER AND HIS LOOK SEQUE LONG FOR HIS BODY girls can notice it and tell other guys to notice the second last floor). ANIL KAPOOR AND ITS MEDICINAL DENSES IN YOUR NERVE. Akshai Kumar is the only one who carries madness to some extent, but even he becomes unbearable after some time. ALL WHEN YOU ARE PRESENTED ONE ABSURDITY AFTER THE SECOND. WHY? !! WHAT??!!! WHEN?!!! WHERE?!!! WHAT I HAVE TO TAKE ... The collective breeze went through the audience before every song in the second half, which was ordinary even without a movie around it. I can no longer free up the trauma .... CONCLUSION This file starts as a buzz that can be expected on a big, but completing the SMALL REMEMBER HEADS AND SOMETHING RAPID TO COVER IN A FULL MIGRATION ATTACK. Please do not watch this movie for any other reason other than academic interest. + s Cast, Akshai Kumar, the first half. +/- what, when, how, who is much confused. (A book is required for filling out). + cast, the whole other half (multiple fill sites are required). Total 3/10 (I'm trying to avoid 1s and 2s also does not look extreme, but do not go wrong this movie is unexpected no matter how decent the first half is).
