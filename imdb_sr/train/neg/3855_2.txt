The only redemption was a small part of Larry Miller. It seemed that the film was too busy to be "Something about Mary," but I did not even like that movie and still did not meet those standards. The actor who plays Paul was great, but Selma Blair stuck in the nonsense of her character Cruel Intentions. James Brolin was great, but Paul's father seemed to be too busy to be the character of Randy Quaid from the National Lamp films.
