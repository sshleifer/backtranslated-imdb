I saw this "hot" movie when it came out in 1986. He had Ks rating for a short scene about oral sex, but he played in mainstream theaters (it was "art" film). Apparently this is the first movie ever to show a reputable actress in an explicit sexual scene. What I saw was a boring story about high schoolboy (Federico Pitzalis) in love (understandable) with an older woman (Maruschka Detmers). As already mentioned, Detmers is very nice with a good body, but it also gave very good performance. Pitzalis was (to put it mildly) quite poor. No wonder he never shot another movie. Nevertheless, despite the infamous sex scene (which is explicit, but rather short), this stupid story is boring and boring. The good work of Detmer just helped to a certain point. I mostly looked at the watch that patiently waited for it to end. If he had not had that sequence, this film would have been forgotten for a long time. Boring and slow. You can skip this one.
