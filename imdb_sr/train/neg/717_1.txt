It should have been a parody of the LOTR-Trilogy. But this was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad scenario, all bad. This is my personal opinion. I do not doubt that there are people who will like that sense of humor, but there have been better parodies to movies from famous directors such as Mel Brooks or Zucker Brothers. I'm working at the cinema and DVD store and the success for this film was similar in both areas: in films this was a nice (but not great) success in the first two weeks, but then, when the criticism from those who saw him was not Good, the film fell very quickly. DVD sales were good for a short time, but then no one asked for it. In the last ten years, the two worst films I've seen are Ring Thing and Torkue. I can not decide which is worse, but I am happy that there are so many good films that I do not have to think too much about this issue.
