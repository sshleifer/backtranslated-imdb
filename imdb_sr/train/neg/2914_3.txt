The title above is used to present the Gen film to its audience. The gene is about a young doctor (Doga Rutkai) with a sick mother. The film begins with her leaving her mother to start her new job. As she drives, we realize that she is not as close to a house as a hospital in a remote area. As soon as she enters the hospital, she sees the dead body of the patient. This is the beginning of the nightmare for the next few days. Two policemen come to the hospital to investigate suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are interrupted due to bad weather conditions. All their communication with the outside world was also interrupted. There is no exit !! In those few days, there will be more horrible murders. Now everyone is suspicious of each other. In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It could have been very scary. Of course, there are positive sides of the film. I really like the beginning of the movie. Especially when she drove to hospital and the first moments in the hospital. The actions are fine. Some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and intimidating. I think the last shock should be transferred to the movie. What I'm saying is that it was a good shift, but instead of eventually ending it as a parody, we should understand that it comes when we see what's happening. The director had to explain everything, which I think was not working well. And the most dangerous patient in the movie should be at least 48 years old, but his body looks so young and convenient for someone who spent most of his life in this hospital. In the end, I would like to say a few things about the director. I'm sure it will improve. This is his first attempt. I recently learned that it's only 21 years old. This made me more positive about him and his future films. Still, I will not rate this movie * from *****.
