There was a great movie about Steve Bull. Unfortunately, that was not it. Denzel Washington - never-fading actor - is unable to convey the great charisma that Biko had. Ateneblot's great scene masses are funny. There was not such a massacre in the Soviet, three neat lines of children (some working carts!) Merry marching into the arms of soldiers. While Biko is dead, the film quickly descends into a farce. If the fight against apartheid was anything, it was the fight of black people, but somehow we all should have been caught by the escape of the white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Voods was a decent man and he would first say Biko was important until he was. The accent of Penelope Vilton is pure Hampshire and seems not to be aware at all of it is in South Africa at all. at all. Voodo's family dog ​​gets more lines than black maids. As the family ran away from the women I saw, the film was, incidentally, one of only a dozen black people in a large, full movie, whispering: "This is like music." She had a point. All in all, this is a film of a benevolent, somewhat incompetent white liberal about the struggle of radical blacks. And indeed, South Africa needs benevolent white liberals just like a hole in the head.
