This bad remake of the classics from 1963 begins quite well, and then confuses uncertainty with confusing and meaningless special effects. For example, in the original, one of the coldest moments is when Nell and Theo lie next to each other in two beds listening in fear of the sounds that are outside their room. Nell tells Theo to let her go because she hurts. Nell then looked over Tea, a few meters away, and he realized that Teo was not holding his hand. In the latest version, Nell lies alone in bed, when she suddenly dives and slides on the floor. Only when he tells the invisible force to stop dragging it, we will understand what happened. Can someone explain what Nel's last words mean - "It's about the family, it's always been about the family"? One of them is performance by Lili Tailor, but even this can not save the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones once again proves that there is little depth below her beautiful exterior. In the original, Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian conviction. Zeta-Jones, however, has to write it, for example, asking Nell if she has a boyfriend - or a girlfriend.
