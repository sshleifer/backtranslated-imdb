The meaning of the expanded preparatory phase of this story of the Star is born to make the final success even more exalted. Summer Phoenix is ​​very effective as an unarticulated young woman who is imprisoned in her, but never asserts her as an actress on the stage of a growing glory that transcends and profits from this detachment. Even in the long scenes of Esther's acting lessons, we never see how she implements teachers' instructions. After suffering through Estherin (to a great extent self-inflicted) pain in exhausting details, we do not get the convincing meaning of her triumph. . However, the causes of this pain (poverty, quasi-autism, Judaism, sexual betrayal) never come together in a coherent whole. A 163-minute, simple action movie should be able to swim out its free ends. Esther Kahn is still not ready to go in front of the audience.
