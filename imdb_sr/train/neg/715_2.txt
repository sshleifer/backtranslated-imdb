It sounded like a really interesting movie from a musical. Nazis, occult, government conspiracies. I expected to find a budget version of DaVinci code or Bois from Brazil or even Shockwaves. Instead, you get something completely different, more psychologically, something more than David Linch. It's actually a plus. But the way in which the story is told is just terrible. Character Andrienne Barbeau begins with a movement, a bit shy and scared. She does not work well, even in her age, although she certainly did try. The actor who played the son obviously thought it was a comedy. It seemed that most other actors thought this was a campaign, or at least acted as if it were, and not simply being weird. The only one I thought was really good was her daughter, Siri Baruc. Another great thing is pacing. It starts very slowly. So slowly you can be tempted to turn it off. But then it becomes attractive for some time when the suicide of a daughter and a consequence comes. But soon afterwards, all of this becomes a messy mess. Some of it was intentional, but much was just unnecessarily confusing, monotonous and poorly focused. It's slow, boring, no character is nice. Excessive use of pictures and sets. Some of the movies you see are troublesome. In this viewer it does. There are a few nasty moments, and especially a nasty Nazi image and credit, but the rest of the film is mostly tired.
