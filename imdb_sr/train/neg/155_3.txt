It's not as much a movie as big budget children's television. As far as I know, the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate grains. It seems that this theory is confirmed by the fact that it is called 'insomnia'. When I mentioned for the first time that civilization was destroyed by insomnia, I thought "Vov! Nihilistic martial arts movie!" but there is no such luck. Though you must consider it an experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by the old long, white eyebrows. Zu Varriors has the same amount of sense if the subtitles are turned on or off. That's not a good sign. I found that special effects are somewhere between Reich Harrihausen and Xena: the Princess of Warriors. Primitive.
