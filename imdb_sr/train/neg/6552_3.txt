Cash (Now the game of Khristine Haje for Angelina Jolie) has left the post apocalypse of the devastation (after her patron died of age, said the patron was played by Elias Koteas, a really decent actor) and now she finds people wandering ruins in search of cyborgs for trade in metal waste and cash. She runs a group of burnt cyborgs (This includes Villyama Katta, Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against the bounty hunter on Richard Linch's head. Malcolm McDovell has two minutes of screen as Linch's employer. Ciborg 3 manages to be better than the other two entries, but it's still pretty boring. The problem this time is that ideas with potential are never used well, action sequences are routine, and the name of actors such as McDovell, Katt and Galligan do little work. Haje is a really heroic hero, and Linch is too much above the top (as usual), and the film lacks inspiration or ambition to be fun-bad as a funny predecessor. (The one with Van Damme, the other is just boring.) It also disappoints the angle of science fiction that is almost aggressively opposed to any good idea that it has. As an action movie, it's routine and numbers of B-movie stuff and it's competently made, that's the only positive thing I can say about it. 1/2 of 4- (Poor)
