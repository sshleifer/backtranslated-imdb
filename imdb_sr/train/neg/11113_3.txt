I often feel like Scrooge, tapping movies that others like about - or, I'm writing a review to balance unjustified raves. I thought this film was almost inconspicuous, and, unusually for me, it was fast, not only through boring, clichéd dialogue, but even boring, clichéped music numbers. Whatever the originality in this movie - an unusual domestic setting for a musical, a lot of fantasy, some animation - is more than compensated by a script that has no meaning for thinking or thinking. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailei look like good people, but I can not wear a movie as a team. Neither is really charismatic or has much sexual attraction. Both are mild. I like Billy Grey, but his character is pretty much one note. The best part of the film, for me, are the beautiful June Haver costumes and a great body.
