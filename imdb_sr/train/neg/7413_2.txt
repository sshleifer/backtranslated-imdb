I just finished watching, I can not say I was impressed. It starts from pretty good, visual and atmosphere gives a creepy feeling like this type of film should. But everything ends when the first lord's monster appears. Not only do you recognize them from the band lords, they are seriously maladded in the film. Sudden-day monsters with leather jackets and piercing were 80's. As for the story, it begins like similar horror films, people trapped in a hellish hole. But there is no clear story about why and what is happening. The lines are thrown on the lines of possible reasons, but the lines never meet and end up to the mess. With all the money spent on this movie, with an intriguing start and some good effects I thought someone would better take care of the product. I wonder if the Lord has made this film just to prove that their costumes can be scary (unless they are). So, the film gets credibility for visuals, I think that money had to go somewhere. But the rest is an unpleasant attempt by the rock band to make their stage performances wondrous.
