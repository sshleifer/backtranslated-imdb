As a great fan of David Mamet's films, and especially his first film of the House of Games, which also featured Joe Manten, I expected great things from this film. Instead, I found myself irritated by the superficiality of the film and the lack of credibility. Racial defamation is thrown without any sense or significance behind them, in the hope of establishing a racial tension that never came to me. Identity is completely reevaluated and people become "heroes" for no reason. Because of taking the oath as a policeman, the main character refuses to carry out a relatively small action that would not hurt anyone and could save lives, yet he performs another action that is very violent and VERY illegal, but nevertheless rejects the juvenile. procedure. In addition, a very incredible backdrop involving a man who killed his family was introduced only for the planned point that was only advertised with the help of the script, and the police responded to that event and stretched over reasonable limits. Needless to say, after expecting another exciting thriller David Mamet, I was extremely disappointed. 3 of 10
