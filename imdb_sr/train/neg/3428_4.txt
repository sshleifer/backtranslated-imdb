Well, if there were no Ethel Waters and seven-year-old Sammy Davis, the younger (here charged without Jr.), Rufus Jones would be one of the worst teams of Afro-American stereotypes for the president. from an early epoch of talkies and therefore it would not be worth a look. Ms. Waters is great here singing "Am I Blue?" and "Underneath Our Harlem Moon" while Mr. Davis tells us how his childhood experience in shoving prepared for his superstar the status of an adult. He is such a good dance dancer here that I thought for some time that he was a small person with decades of experience. So, if you are willing to ignore the negative connotations here, Rufus Jones should give some good pleasure to the president. P.S. This is the fourth time that I saw today and heard the song "I'll be happy when you're dead", which you made on the movie, this time from Davis. It must have been a very popular song about this time.
