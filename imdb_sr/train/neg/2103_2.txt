White Lugosi is an evil botanist who sends bridesmaid poisoned orchids on the day of their wedding, steals the body in his fake ambulance / morgue and takes him home to help his little assistant remove glandular juices to keep Belina's wife eternal young. Some other actors who play detectives are trying to solve a terrible, horrible mystery. White Lugosi was nice, but you can say that he needed money. This film is terribly horrible, and most actors would better hold waiting packs, but the plot is wonderfully funny. Tell everyone what's happening in it and they often laugh very much and ask to see a movie. I got a DVD in the discount store 2 for 1 pound, which I think is a fairly accurate estimate, everyone who pays more for it would be out of their minds.
