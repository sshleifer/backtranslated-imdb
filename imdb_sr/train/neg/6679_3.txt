Manoj Agraval after the failure of PARDESI BABU (1998) returned with this movie The film has a Govinda in 8-9 role, as well as his father, mother, grandfather, sister and later also have masks <br /> In short, he is a useless detective who sends his friend's case to get evidence against his wife, whose photos he loses at the airport while flirting with Raniem. It's being reckoned as a sardine on a plane and again as a girl The funny part is how easily and for a short time it works? Then she turns into a French singer and enters the TV to get evidence of lol, and then as a maharastrian (that inside the TV itself) The rest of the movie has the same wrong identity and ends on a predictable tone. There are some funny scenes like Govinda smashed African and many other portions. The direction of Manoj Agraval is fine Music is fine Among the actors Govinda again proves to be one of the most respectable actors. tastic though he did such a role before he fit into all excitement and roles too well here again even though many hiped 6-7 roles do not actually fit into a movie Early looks thick, teams are good with Govinda thatz It She's Nothing great and went on we are doing this kind of role Among others, Nirmal Pandey is as usual John Lever is out loud in time and ridiculed in places in one role and irritated as older Tinnu Anand is OK Satish Kaushik is hilarious, Paresh is OK
