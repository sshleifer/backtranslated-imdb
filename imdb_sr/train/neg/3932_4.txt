This solid little horror movie is actually one of the best Rennie Harlin. The story is a pretty routine thing, but the atmosphere is what really makes it alive; In fact, the story of ghosts is almost conceived. The real horror comes from the captive environment itself, and Rennie H. does not save any details in showing us how bad the conditions are in this ruinous, leaking old hell (with the sadistic manager!) Viggo Mortensen is as good as the usual in the main role, supported by some very authentic prisoners (there are no beautiful boys in this acting club .) Fans of horror should check this out.
