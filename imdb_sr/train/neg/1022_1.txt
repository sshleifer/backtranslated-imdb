Beginning with the poster (with only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the entire movie was a fraud. One stereotype after another, this film was nothing - or at least nothing new. After 10-15 minutes, you realize that you just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J reciting their way through another cop. city, all secretly supported by the backbone and the city, under the watchful eye of a hot-shot politician. The Almighty and supranational organization is called FRAT and guess what? have a shot in the crazy and beaten at will - suspects, girls. FRAT police officers are corrupt and greedy, and in the end they make mistakes that are revealed by a young and talented (!!!) journalist. An hour later, after a series of incredibly bad recordings and more stereo lines, everything ends happily and we get the last line: you can not win the system. Bah! I do not see this film scrap. Freeman and Space have barely 10 minutes!
