What a mess! Why is this film made? This, and other films of his "caliber" should be teaching tools on how not to make a movie. Children may like it, but anyone older than 10 years can or will not approve. Worse yet, it was the fact that such talents as Vhoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl were completely lost in a film unworthy of any kind of information.
