This film was terrible. and not in a good way, as some claimed. First, the main character is a very unattractive gingerman. Second - VTF continues with this love. The plot, basically, is: the boy wants sex, buying a van (which, by justice, is pretty cool). Unlikely, since he looks like a newcomer he gets a lot of chickens! And it does not work with anyone. Then he reached a very hot fish and realized that he loved this stupid bird that was hard to play. Then he pulled off racing with a boyfriend hot chicks. And a bumper van. At that moment, Danny the devil saves the day. Although he did not have to, because he overturned the van, he first crossed the border. I gave this 2 * as I'm ready to assume there is some sort of 70th subculture "Vanning" I do not get, and also because it's about 70s.
