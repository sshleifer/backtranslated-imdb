Although Bette Davis worked as Mildred, I felt that the movie was not the best thing I saw. At the end of the film, I felt as if something was missing in him. Bette Davis still performed the perfect job and made me hate and pity her all the time. Leslie Howard is very good as a loving Philip Carey, and so I pitied him throughout the film because he was in love with such a terrible lady. It's so sad when he finds himself in love with bad seeds. Especially if someone like Philp Carey, who is a sensitive person, although pathetic. Finally, the acting was what went on, not the plot. The ultimate scene was particularly good, but I can not give it. Although others might consider this film to be good, I was the one who found it so. I should recommend this film to those who like bad seeds to see what can happen if they fall in love with this terrible person.
