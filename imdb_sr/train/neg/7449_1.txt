A very disappointing version of Lorne Doone. Too many missing characters, without romantic scenes, change in story line, too short, looked low budget. There is hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you are not familiar with the novel. In some scenes, Lorna seems to have a cold wound on her upper lip. I'm sure that makeup is best to hide it. I guess they did not want to stop the recording until it's over. Most likely why this movie did not have a scene of kissing. Just one disappointing scene of kissing at the very end. Lorna Doone is a great epic story and should tell her the truth. The Lorne Doone version of 2000 is twice as long, romantic, much more comfortable and more truthful to the book.
