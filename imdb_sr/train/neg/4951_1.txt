I commented on this when he debuted for the first time and gave him a "thumb in the middle" review, noting that I would give her the benefit of a doubt beyond the first episode. I've seen a total of six episodes up to this juncture in June 2006. And as a lifelong Batman fanatic, I can say without hesitation: this show is the ultimate crap. Everything is fine. All. Passing through poor animation and design, the stories are ridiculously intricate and without any characteristic development or obvious interest of the writers of this shit to give any substance to any stories. And for God's sake ... Is it just me, or is the Joker in EVERY EPISODE ?? Is Gotham a part of the legal system that is turning? Or, again, there is only a complete lack of interest in writers to invest any effort in other villains (see "no character development", above). And to make things worse, each Joker story is the same formula of three parts. 1) Joker gases people. 2) Joker is moving to extinguish the whole city. 3. Batman saves the day. Pfeh. It was an episode I saw that was not a story about Joker. The title escaped me, but the villain was that wicked Cluemaster ... "Think Thank Thunk" episode with a quiz. It was the worst story about Batman I've ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than "I have Batman in my basement." I can not say what I feel because it's probably against ToS, but it starts with "B" and rhymes with "fastarding". Thank God for the existence of Timm / Dini / etc. era Bat-fun, return from Fox and Kids VB days. Things that are good, and I needed to know that, they just can not last forever, unfortunately.
