I could not wait to get a DVD after I heard about the movie so much. What a disappointment! This has become one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. There were so many characters introduced, some like the others, that it became impossible to follow the story. I could not understand how George Clooney got the actor's film award because he was a little involved, at least in the first half of the film. My wife and I gave up after an hour of trouble and stopped the DVD. Maybe I was thinking about quick forwarding to see if the end is better, but after so much confusion I decided that the chances of improvement are small. The associate told me that much of the film "meets" at the last minute or less. I was glad I did not spend another hour waiting. I gave the DVD the next day.
