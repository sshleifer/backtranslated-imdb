Kuite unimpressive. "Knitting" are pretty predictable, if you've seen films in the past ten years, and a few bit of interesting parts (in which someone uses the context to make a decision) there is little and they miss them a lot of blow because the secret is "secret" br /> (spoilers, variety) The act is decent enough. The story is simply not interesting. The whole premise of "still awake" becomes annulled by the things of the astral projection (not contagious). The surgical scene is initially tense, somewhat uncomfortable, but then it becomes extremely banal. It's not terrible, but not unforgettable. The least interesting role of Terrence Howard so far, as far as I've seen. <br /> <BR> All in all boring.
