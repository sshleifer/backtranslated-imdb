I gave Timecpu the perfect 10, I gave 1 The story is very boring, and has only a little bit to do with the original Timecop. Many things from Timecop have been written off, and instead they have put on new nonsense. This story takes place in 2060 (if I remember well), but for some reason the journey is time dangerous now: confused: The action scenes are nothing to luck, so most of them are not ... only the first one is excellent ... and there are not many action scenes, and they are all quite short. At one point of the story, the main character travels through the time about 5 times within a few minutes ... do not wait, do it twice ... In short: Do not waste your time watching this movie, it's not worth it
