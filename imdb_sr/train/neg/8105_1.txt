Sharp, yes, but I call them as I see them. I saw it in the late 80's, and it was really one of the scariest, boring movies I've ever forced to watch. Yes, cinema is wonderful. Settings in the Czech Republic are really astonishing. The political background is tempting, but unlike similar "historically set" stories (for example, Dr. Zhivago_ (kv)), this has failed to make a policy relevant to the story or even interesting. Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this movie manages to make even "erotic" scenes plodding and slow. I am romantic, but this film was so boring, I began to hope that the Russians would kill them all and stop my misery. I'm sure to read the book, the story would have a little more sense. However, life is too short to spend more time on this.
