Basically I picked up this movie because I saw the brilliant remake of Zatoichi and was in favor of another renewed Samurai story, which was also played by Asan Tadanoobu. These two films are worldly separate. Zatoichi added humor and depth to his characters and undermined traditional Samurai movie clich√©s. Goyoe goes deep in the other direction. First of all, I hate films in which other characters inform the audience what the character is, instead of developing the character during the film. "You can not decide whether you are a monk or a warrior," says almost every character in Benke's presence, but that inner unrest is barely transmitted within the very character. Instead of developing character, we get swollen, boring, bloody battles. Asana's character is underdeveloped, even he seems to be bored and he does not know what he is doing there. I know that it usually looks distant and cool, and that's part of Asan's appeal, but this film does not serve him. Many camera movements are disgusting. There is a scene that lasts forever in which the camera revolves around the main characters while my wife and I do not feel like vomiting. The place is ridiculous and quite anti-climatic. It's a pity that today's very good samurai films with this kind of budget are not made in Japan. Colors, landscapes and costumes were great, but the rest is just a long waste of time. I'd rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth.
