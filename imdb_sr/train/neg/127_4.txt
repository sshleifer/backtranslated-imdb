From my video store I hired "AM AM CURIOUS-IELLOV" because of all the controversy surrounding it when it was first published in 1967. admirer of films that are considered "controversial". I really had to see this. The action is focused on the young Swedish student of the play Lena who wants to learn everything that can about life. In particular, he wants to focus his attention on making a kind of documentary about what the average Swede was thinking about certain political issues, such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. Between asking questions to politicians and ordinary Stockholm residents about their opinion of politics, she has sex with her teacher of drama, colleagues and married men. Before, this was considered pornographic. Really, the scenes of sex and nudity are few, even then they were not recorded as some inexpensive porn movies. While my compatriot thinks it's shocking, in reality, sex and nudity are the main thing in the Swedish movie. Even Ingmar Bergman, who surely responded to the good guy John Ford, had scenes of sex in his films. rather than shocking people and making money to appear in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-IELLOV is a good movie for anyone who wants to study flesh and potatoes (without the intention of playing) the Swedish film. But really, this movie does not have much complication.
