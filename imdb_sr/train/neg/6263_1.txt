"Nightmare Veekend" Henry Sale is a broken piece of sludge from Troms. It's a minor, messy and stupid low-budget horror movie about some teenagers who spend a weekend in a villa. A professor's evil assistant mami girls in a bizarre scheme. to perform terrible experiments. Using an implant from the brain transforms your victims and their dates into zombies. "Nightmare Veekend" is a totally clever piece of garbage that contains lots of nudity and some cheese up, not to mention funny music. It's horrible and the script is completely incompatible. Why is such a piece of shit widespread beyond me? Avoid it as a plague.1 from 10.
