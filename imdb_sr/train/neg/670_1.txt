Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Substance) who is being run by a psycho-killer who is trying to kill her on a prom night. And thus killing her family, friends and her enemies. Now, before I start, let me tell you that you are tired of PG-13 horror movies that have not been scary lately. Are you tired of the stupid dialogue 'Oh my God' and you're talking about girls. And are you really tired of the girls in relationships and then you cry. And the last thing you've been tired of is that the US is processing Asian, Japanese, and Chinese films. It's a pretty big sum for Prom night, but I still have not finished reviewing. The only reason to see 'Prom Night' is to laugh at killing. If not, do not watch Prom night. You never see how it only kills an audible screaming and you see blood on the wall. By the way, death is repeated as 24/7. So, not only are they not frightening, but also disgusting. When I met an actress, I think I was ready to throw it. Too many conversations with girls, too much talk, and lots of 'Oh my God. This is our graduation. ' I understand it's fun, but it's serious to be too demanding that I do not concentrate. If I put Prom Night on the list of the worst movies from 2008, and if I did not see other movies, I would be the first one. I will not be surprised if it is posted on a DVD for cheap and fast. Seriously do not spend your money or time for stupid acting, cheap scares and 'night to die' when watching a movie. 1 star of 10. (PS If I could give a movie zero star I would).
