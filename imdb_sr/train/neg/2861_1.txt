I can not believe I spent my money renting this movie. I thought it was a porn movie when it started and it was never better. The act, the music that drowns the actors. Terrible. Save money! You must read the film as long as you know that the music will be suppressed. I never got a role in the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show that cows and pigs were slaughtered. What does this have to do with the "real" BTK killer? I understand why there were no famous actors in this movie. The script would have rejected me on the first page of the reading. You'd better look at dry paint.
