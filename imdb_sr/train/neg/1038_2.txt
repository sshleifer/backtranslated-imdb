Raising the winner of Vargas is just a bad movie. No denial or ad-dollar did not support publicity with the change of this sad fact. by making a bad movie that cynically mimics the principles of the current "sharp film making". Maybe she does not know anything better. It's hard to say. What is not difficult to say is the result. Apart from several viewers who will intellectualize the bad filming of the film in an attempt to pseudo-realism, few will enjoy it. I know I'm not. Take advantage of yourself and download this movie.
