I got a DVD from the library in anticipation of getting a good idea of ​​how things are going on in the background of big opera production. I must say, I was very disappointed. The subject had so much potential. Sets in Vagnerian production must, if necessary, be elaborate and impressive, and the story behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience. Instead, what we get from a pendant of clips of people moving around large portions of the landscape, somewhat help along with comments that have failed to keep my attention. I found myself listening primarily to background music from the opera. I was impressed with the bare effort required to put such a production - which was quite good and the next time I'm in the opera, I'm sure I will remember that part if this video is - but the feeling remained a bit tricky. due to lack of detailed comments and explanations.
