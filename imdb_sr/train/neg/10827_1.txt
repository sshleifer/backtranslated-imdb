This ambitious movie is most affected by the illusions of the great writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson. Highly derived from much better material (Altman's "Nashville", Lumet's "Mesh"), this sloppy elephant lasts too long to not create. A few wrong road trips (shameful musical interlude, biblical plague) do not help. Neither unequal performance level. Especially bad: Villiam H. The Macchi, whose character and story could easily be completely eliminated; Julianne Moore, because of her unbelievable fear. And how many times do we have to see John C. Reilli's Sad Sack shtick ("Chicago" and "The Hours" will be enough)? Tom Cruise is well suited to comparison? His Mizogin, the Holy Roller was quite fun. Speaking of rude mouth, the script was so full of "F" bombs that they lost their influence in a short time. Do not even talk about this horrible soundtrack, full of disturbing and boring vocals Aimee Mann. Her extended performance "One", the maudlin number to start, led me to interfere with the beginning of the film. I should have paid attention to the handwriting on the wall and I was saved for another three hours, until then I was pushed to the edge of hell. One of the reputation features I have not seen in other reviews is the best performance in the group, the unknown Melora Valters in the role of Claudius, a damaged cocaine that was prone to self-destruction. Its credibility has outgrown all the others. This film was taken seriously and simply did not know when to finish it.
