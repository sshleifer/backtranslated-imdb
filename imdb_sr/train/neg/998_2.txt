It's pretty bad when a generic movie synopsis has more information than a movie. A long summary of the summary of the summary on the movie page contains details that I could not see from watching a movie. I found myself continuing to support him to see what details I missed and who could tell me what was happening. Woe, no success - this film omit the monstrous parts of the story, if you can call it a story. As if they were trying to deceive us thinking that there was some sort of film here, shooting enough, so there is a similarity of the story and the rest leaves our imaginations. Nevsflash for the creators: I paid to watch how you are doing the movie. I can sit at home and imagine complications and stories for free. And Rosario Davson? This is someone I've never paid enough attention to putting a name on my face, and I see why. She had one of the most pre-eminent performances I've ever seen as the lead figure in any movie, A or B. I thought she was OK, maybe she did not want a role, she just got a big deal for a movie that was not in? Wrong. It is listed as one of the manufacturers. The next time you make something, do not post yourself as a leader if you can not act. If you can, then create a decent character to become. Also, someone here mentioned the white / latino question - yes, I hate to say it, but this movie is seen as an act of revenge against white college men wearing baseball caps. This is what happens when there is nothing in the film that would oversee the guards of Latin characters. Adrian's character looks like a nice jerk that is not better than the antagonist of the story. Regarding the character of Maya, she did not look like the right person. Anyway, I'm ashamed of Hollivood that this movie was even filmed.
