Out there is a good movie about a guy trying to get the girls into their new van, in order to get them out. The only thing that this film does not perish is the presentation of out-of-fade in the United States in the late 1970's. Apparently it was made by amateurs. It's garbage, but I liked it! I must admit I'm a fan of the 70s! I hope this one will be at the bottom of 100 IMDB! 2
