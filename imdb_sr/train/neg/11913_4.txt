Good idea, poorly implemented. Although it could sum up 99% of SciFi channel movies, it's true here. I love films that slowly reveal a good story about the back, and I love action movies, and I love all the main actors, so this could have been great. However, despite good acting, this film fails due to poor writing and directing by Bill Platt. This film does not. It was made in such a random way that you know that the words "another draft" are not in the Bill Platt dictionary. There is one scene that is completely unnecessary and can be removed without anyone noticing. This scene even starts and ends with a car ride, so you can cut from one scene to another and never miss a pointless scene in the middle. This film also had a strange habit by explaining some details while explaining others, some to the point where you can hit the whole "plot" forwards. She also had the habit of breaking the fight early, probably just because you could not afford it. There are also some funny bad scenes where the "plot" is revealed on the computer and the last battle with "toxic glue" (seriously, what is it?). If the fan is Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because it's okay. She manages to get out of her "Roswell" personality several times and make a good wife (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character that plays in everything he has ever done since playing K at ST: TNG, so this is nothing new.
