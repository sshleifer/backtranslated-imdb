This film was absolutely horrible. I can not think of one thing about it. The holes were so big that you could drive Hummer through them. The act was soo stunningly bad that even Jean Claude should be ashamed, and that does say a lot! And dialogue, What kind of dialogue? To think that I was the admirer of the first (I use this comment loosely, more like guilt than anything else). This movie is Goldberg in it for loud !!!! Nothing good can come from this movie. What makes this movie even worse is that it's so bad that you can not even watch with a bunch of friends to make fun of it !!! This must be in my top 5 worst movies of all time. 2/10 because it's hard for me to give 1.
