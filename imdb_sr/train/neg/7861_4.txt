The premise of this anticipated sequel was really good and, after the great success of the remake, I expected a lot of sincerity. The situations are stupid and out of understanding, and the acting is really terrible. This way there are no cute characters or violins unlike remake. Also, blood is not so abundant and when it's really bad. I mean, there's a SVAT team that catches a family of cannibal mutants. You must expect something different! When I watched it on movies, I wanted my money back. In any case, this is a clear example of how fast films show themselves as mess and show poor quality in all aspects. A disorder that has ruined lovers of a remake like me. That's why the sequels are never welcome; At least this film is not as awesome as the 1985 sequel.
