I was just looking at the first 30 minutes of this and what I saw was totally shit. The scenes I saw were as bad as Ed Wood's film. No, it was a hundred times worse. Ed Vood has the reputation of the worst film ever, but that's not true; The idiot who directed this garbage is the worst director ever. US policeman has German accent! The "police station" was a table in the warehouse with the inscription "Police Station" hanging on the wall. There is the first fight in which the strikes are obviously missed around TEN FEET. He told his policeman to wait in the car. Then he leaves the warehouse and carries a bag. The police partner thinks that something might be wrong, his partner may be a bad cop that kills those women, but he is not sure that this is because he is - he's a jerk! The dialogue is completely stupid, acting is terrible, and the characters play in the dumbest way I've ever seen on the screen. It's completely obvious to the partner of the police officer that he illegally seizes the women and shamrocks and takes them to the warehouse and returns to the car with a body bag inside him, and yet the partner, who is there all the time, does not know what is happening! The director of this film is a total hack. In 30 minutes I stopped the film because I could not stand it anymore. It must be one of the LARGEST movies I've ever started to watch and I will no longer be wasting time writing this review. Absolutely worthy.
