This film, allegedly a thriller, had about five sub-plans that developed simultaneously to the climax at the end, but it ended up more like a yawning. Writing was banal, the pace was slow and unrelated and the characters were annoying. George Clooney seems to be entering the gym, Met Damon drowned him, and others seemed to read their lines from teleprompter. The worst part of this film was that it was carefully crafted. It was politically correct and it ended up saying nothing about big business, oil and the Middle East. I've seen documentaries that give more excitement. Watch only if there is nothing else.
