I was looking for a copy of the Forest because I was looking at the special VH1, I mean "Where are they now," and saw the video box on the screen during the segment about actor Corki Pigeon. He played the spirit of a male child in this terrible horror B, but I remember him from his character Freddy on the television show Silver Spoons. This movie is a big disappointment. There's nothing here. It took me four months to watch it from start to finish. I constantly stopped him in the boredom, put it aside and forgot about it, then stumbled onto it and again tried to pass through it. Obviously, the angle of this film that was supposed to separate him from his colleagues was a supernatural element, apparitions. And obviously, it does not work here. I can not stand men's tracks. I was constantly expecting to look at the palms during long dialogues to read the fraudulent lines. The situation at the beginning where couples decide to go to the camp is separately awkward and stupid. I suppose the only positive thing I can say about this scene in which a man falls and breaks his legs, you can see how the bone floats out of his body. There is pretty good makeup there. Man, I'm really looking for positive now, huh. The only other non-budget horror movie at such a bad level as this would be Home Sveet Home.
