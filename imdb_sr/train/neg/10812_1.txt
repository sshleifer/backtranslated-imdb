What a pathetic movie. I will not waste much time commenting on it. I'm still trying to get back a few hours that I spent on it. Allow me to just leave - Shak does not have POSAO if he is an actor or singer. He is totally free of talent on both displacements. It is a pity that many more talented people get lost in cinema halls and karaoke bars, while Shak uses his name as a basketball player in order to unintentionally throw in movies and cut CDs. The film was a pathetic non-talent which is Shak.
