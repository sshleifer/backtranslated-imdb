This is a pretty pitiful thing about the broken, stolen and different codes of the Second World War. The acting is what I expected of this actor MGM "B" actors. One great caution. Jean Rogers, who did such a good job playing sexy Dale Arden in the first two Flash Gordon series, is terrible in this film. Her character is extremely boring. Absolutely never gives up on her conversion. We should believe that during the height of the world war in what would obviously be a Top Code code, it is allowed to enter and exit from any office of its choice, even if it has no official function. From this point of view, I am sorry that I have ever seen this film. It has forever changed my perception of Mrs. Rogers. Talentally, it is extremely light. Lee Bovman is his usual self, which means he is only adequate. <br /> <br />
