I was very excited about this movie. It's a good family movie; However, if the editor is Michael Landon Jr. better done montage, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes outside the context. I hope there is another movie from the series, they are all very good. But if others do, I'd better take care of editing. This story was everywhere and it did not have a center. Which is unfortunate because other films from the series were great. I enjoy the story of Villie and Missy; Both are great examples. In addition, the romantic side of the viewer always enjoys good love.
