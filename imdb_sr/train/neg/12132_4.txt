Three low-life criminals, led by Matt Dillon, are caught in a late night break. They flee, but quickly cross the roads with the police, who are just accidentally in search of a terrorist. Of course, the police mistaken a band of terrorist burglars, a real terrorist got out, and the burglars were forced to stand in a small dive bar, taking hostages, unaware of why the police wanted them to catch them. And guess who else he chose at least as a shelter for the night? Unbelievable? Absolutely. And from there it goes downhill. Spacei has gained a great deal of acting talent; Matt Dillon, Faie Dunavai, Garry Sinise, Viggo Mortensen and M. Emmett Valsh, but all are lost. Mostly because after all the characters are stuck in the bar, everything they do for the rest of the movie is a quarrel. Infinite and infallible. Long before the end of the film, you stopped worrying about what was happening to them.
