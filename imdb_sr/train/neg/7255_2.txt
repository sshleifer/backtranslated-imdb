I was not particularly impressed with this film that has luminous music and lasts only 40 minutes. Thank God, for I fell asleep. I'm excellently using a photo in a time interval to show the passing of time in the movement of light and shadows, people, water, clouds, etc. Unfortunately, that's all. My advantage is for this predecessor, excellent Koiaaniskatsi made in 1983 in 87 minutes and prove that the sequel can be better than the original, Povakkatsi was made in 1988, 90 minutes. Try them both.
