I am a great book admirer and Orwell is certainly my favorite writer since I was studying Animal Farm at GCSE. I bought a DVD of pure curiosity, Burton is an actor I highly appreciate, and when I heard he played O'Brien's role, I swung it. I watched the trailer on DVD first and some fears began to appear, mainly in connection with the frankly terrible "Thematic Song", listening to Eurithmics mechanically shouting "1984!" Again and again in an electronic shock is as bad as it sounds. The acting as a whole is pretty good, Burton and Hurt play well their role and the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth towards the end can be felt, especially in the terrible room of 101 rooms. However, this is where the film is down. The film spends too much time focusing on the love affair between Vinston and Julie, which is not really what Orwell wrote about. He wrote about a foolish future, about how Ingsoc builds human beliefs, and then breaks them all on behalf of him as he liked the Big Brother. Film skips what is essentially the most important part of the book, Vinstons faces his position in life and the world, and his education through O'Brien. The comment on the IMDb currently states that the film is holding the book is completely inaccurate. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, they do not bind the Goldstein Brotherhood and admit their crimes. There is no obvious mention of the initial cases in which Vinston finds an article with Unpersons, but this is mentioned at the end, if you have not read the book it is completely confusing. Terrible scenario, which some extraordinary procedures can not save. It seems that Michael Radford has completely missed what Orwell tried to do, and the electronic sound record is truly awesome.
