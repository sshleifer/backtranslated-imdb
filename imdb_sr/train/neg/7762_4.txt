Given that John Doe obviously inspired the creator of Kyle KSI, I expected his pilot to be very interesting. However, I probably had too many expectations because I was pretty disappointed with that. The first protagonists turned into a freak that had a crazy idea to present their incredible knowledge to the audience in the public space. So after that scene I started to worry that it was just fun. But the problem is that it got worse because no other figure was properly introduced. They were too focused on John Doe, which made the story much less intriguing. I was a bit disappointed with the performance of Dominique Purcell because I discovered that he did not make a convincing John Doe. Another problem is the police story. He really felt like a deja vu and was not a pleasant feeling. This leads us to the worst problem in the episodic format. I could already see the fillers coming one by one. So I was very disappointed and did not recommend it to anyone. Given how badly it was better to understand why the show was canceled. In a way, I have the impression that it missed the goal by developing characters that would help the protagonist find his identity. It's sad because there is potential, like the people he met at the club. The quality of workmanship was also pretty good and the casting was right. But I will never know if it's better, probably not, because I do not plan to watch the next episode.
