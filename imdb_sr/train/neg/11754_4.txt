I must admit that I am a great fan of this performance, so you have to know how disappointed I am when I was watching this movie. First of all, the plot was horrible, I thought it would be more interesting, as if to see what happened to Arnold's fathers, or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, the maniac wants to destroy Arnold's house, among many other places, so many people are trying to stop this. I must admit that, after all, it was not so bad, but what really was shattered is the steps Arnold and his friends make to stop this maniac, they become friends of spies; they drive a bus (based on video games, forgive), and on top of everything, make super-moves on the bus, things that many people have already tried and died, but not Arnold, Gerald, and Helga. They are video game experts. Honestly, my mom, my sister, even me, we were really disappointed after watching this movie, because it was the worst way to end a really good cartoon movie. I must admit I enjoyed "Hei Arnold!" It was one of my favorite cartoons on Nickelodeon, but after this shit of the film, I'm not quite sure if I'll watch "Hey Arnold!" as I watched it in the past. Another thing with Nickelodeon, with that huge amount of dynamite, I assure you that no single street would explode, I think the entire city could explode, oh, and please, if all of your future films from good cartoons to be like that, do not do more movies, you give bad critic to cartoons that were once good. Honestly, I think this was the worst way to end this show, a good performance has turned into this shit of the movie.
