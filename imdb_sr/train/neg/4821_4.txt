A fictitious film (it states that it is based on the story, although it has a "documented" credit) about a group of scientists who go into the wild of Canada to try to find the Big Foot. device). His great science mumbo jumbo is mixed up in a really boring film of crowds wandering around the wild. There are some attempts to create tensions and fears, but to be honest, there is nothing worthwhile to see outside some great shots of the wilderness. This is the perfect definition of exploitative film, promises you a lot, a look at Bigfoot, but in reality it brings very little. Recommended only for insomnia
