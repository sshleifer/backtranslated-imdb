Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi channel (although I think it's called Sifi now?) The original movie I've ever seen. But I've seen one or two since then, and I can tell you they were stupid, but this really scratched the bottom of the barrel. CGI is doing bad, acting is bad, the script is ridiculous, and what's happening at the very end is unexpected and not in place (if you've seen Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean; put the spoiler into my review). In addition, there was one music melody that was used in almost every dangerous sequence. It was really stupid; they played it again and again. And definitely not original; I know that I already heard it somewhere (I can not remember where). This should be avoided.
