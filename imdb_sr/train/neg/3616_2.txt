If you just look at the cover of this movie, it's cool. DON'T. The movie itself was sleeping. She was slow, she had minimal violence and poor use of uncertainty. The acting was the bottom material and the action, although it would be cool for another movie, it was poorly displayed. They even kill the only cute character in the whole movie! I give him 2 out of 10 because the only thing that's been good was the plot at the end. In addition, you may want to save yourself from this movie bin.
