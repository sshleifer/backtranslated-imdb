This thriller with TV is just a conversation, a little action. He is working hard to set up his tricky action, but writing is so confused that exposure is still blurred at best. In the end, I did not know more about these characters than at the beginning. He has a quasi-scenario of "Ten Little Indians," but he casts it halfway in favor of Salli Field's illumination and its discovery of a killer. The field turns into nonsense here, which I rarely saw from her. Early adolescence is good, but writing quickly turns off the course and eventually passes over the top. Many hysterics, and constant thunderstorm effects (which does not add anything). Interesting failure by producers Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg. With all this talent, can not we just give us something more than a script of full red herring and Salli Field hiding in the wardrobe?
