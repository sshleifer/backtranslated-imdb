In this unusual apocalypse, the world is suffering from a double monster of zombies and vampires, but it seems that nobody is too concerned about this in this Z-class film that is less like the famous short novel of Sheridan Le Fan, than my mother's lasagna. recipe. Previous visitors still run petrol stations, and doctors are still doing house-to-door interviews, and helpful policemen still appear with radiator fluid only when you need it. The plot, and I use it freely, involves a father and daughter trying to forgive a "general", whose daughter is missing, in a church to kill a vampire who, very conveniently, travels with her father and daughter. I must admit that a moment or two of true humor can be found among the vast parts of unintentional humor. The film also boasts enough nudity for a boy of fourteen years old to be interested. Any older ones are careful.
