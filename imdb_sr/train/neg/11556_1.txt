Oh, you Italians! Assuming that films about the aristocrats with strange fetishes, castles drowned in the Gothic atmosphere, and relatives who pound the glories that try to grasp the heritage, are inherently interesting to everyone! If you've seen a movie of this type, you've actually seen them all (the favorite MST3K "Screaming Skull" fits the mold) ... and "The Evelin Night Out of the Grave" is a formulaic, -Number, and boring as hell. Even the sumptuous Erika Blanc is lost here. Zero / 10 <br />
