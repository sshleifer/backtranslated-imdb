No, basically looking at something that does not make sense. To not spoil the movie to people who really want it, take a look at a movie I will explain to you. Normal everyday women, walk the street and find themselves driving their own car. She follows her and during this period there are numerous events that involve her and her family. Especially I looked at the commentary on this film, as it is terribly written. The act was great, the events were great, but the story did not bring it anywhere - it could have been added terribly and turned into a worldwide epidemic. I'm not sure what the writer tried to achieve by doing it, usually at the end of the movies, most of your questions get answers, but this movie asks you: What happened and 1 hour and 20 minutes went for nothing. /> Spoiler Starts__ They had this area between 2 dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would come to our world and kill us. This has not been elaborated in detail during the film, and you never know how it happened or why it was, or when it happened. Nothing is explained during the film. The main character should not be the main character. At the end of the movie, the guy who finally takes everything out and runs away (the boy's boyfriend) should be the main character, but unfortunately the movie ends 20 seconds after. I bought this movie for $ 10, threw it right after ... do not waste your time. I really hope that nothing similar happens again.
