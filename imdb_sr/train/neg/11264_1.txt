I have not yet decided whether to replace Anaconda as "the worst movie I've ever seen." Even if you ignore accent accents, low production values ​​and terrible camera work, this movie has nothing to do with it. I just went to see her while I was reading the book and I wanted to see how he would do a complicated action in a two-hour movie. The simple answer is - not. The characters appear with little or no explanation as to who they are, and then continue not to play a valuable role in narration. Even the main characters act for no reason, so when the film reaches the peak, you do not care what will happen to any of them. I can accept that books should occasionally be rewritten to fit in the movies and that it may be unfair to judge this film against the book from which it was adapted. But after my friends and I left the cinema, I had to spend most of my time at home explaining what was supposed to happen. Even changing the true meaning of the title of the book "Rancid Aluminum". squeezing it into another piece of meaningless voice just to allow the movie to have a cool title. Real disorder film from start to finish.
