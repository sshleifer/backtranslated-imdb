This film was slower than molasses in January ... in Alaska. The person who put it to the test should receive a reward for success to put each of the 30 seconds that went down for review. I had to wake up the people I watched with them, several times. After finishing it, I felt bad to wake them up. Much of the film is taken in the hope that something will really happen, but nothing will ever happen. It was easy to lose the trail of national motives, and the characters were flat and irrelevant. By the end of the movie, you just hoped that everyone would die. Everyone runs around, whether they are despised, petty or poor, and usually all three. And worse, we watched for a minute or two of extra features, just for the bumps and thumping you understand, and all we've seen is that people were complacent about how socially aware. If they spent time on a movie that worked on their backs, it might have been worth watching. They brought me in anticipation of excitement '24. 'I got a social awareness lecture through the shiny eyes of Sandman.
