The perfect murder was frustrated when a woman (starring Marie Ellen Trainor, the former wife of Robert Zemeckis, who led this episode), who kills her husband with poker, has an accident to receive a visitor while preparing to move her body outside. She escaped from a crazy lunatic dressed in a Santa Claus suit (played by crazy defiant Larry Drake). She takes care of her life as she tries to find a way to hide her husband's corpse. She decided to use the ax, after she overturned the Santa Claus killer who missed several opportunities to cut off her wife's head, to kill the killer for killing her husband. The Santa Claus killer locks in the closet and chases a woman's daughter while trying to desperately get rid of her in order to save her child. This epilepsy of KRIPT'S TALES only recovers tired materials that include the old "Santa Clause Killers". adding frequently used (add nausea) to the woman-murder-her husband-for-man-she-is-vara-routine. In essence, Trainor tries to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body that kills, while at the same time maintaining a safe distance from the maniac. There is nothing refreshing or new about this action, which mostly goes through the movements. None of the best shows.
