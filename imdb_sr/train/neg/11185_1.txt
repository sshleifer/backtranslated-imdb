Yes, MTV really has a way to sell Daria. What started as a smart teenage upset - "comment everything on shit and make the viewer feel better about her teenage life," which is now mutated in "how to deal with your problems." I watched Darie all the time and I loved her. Now, sitting here after watching the so-called "movie", I can only wonder what the meaning of this is. Daria tells us how to lead a life in college? Sorry? did not Daria make every episode that is what you like to do in order, as long as she is fine with herself, regardless of what the rest of the sick sad world thinks about? This whole thing reminded me of the scene in Realitate Bites, a film channel that first shows the documentary.
