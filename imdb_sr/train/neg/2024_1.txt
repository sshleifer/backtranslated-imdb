Trying to cash in on the success of Deal or No Deal and 1 Versus 100 comes this chrome excuse for the fun - Shov Me The Monei, in which 12 sexy 'dancers' shimmi out in a brilliant red whore. The competitor is given the beginning of the phrase, such as "Which team lost ...". with three choices, A, B or C, each ending the phrase. The competitor has three chances to answer one of these three choices. The host - Villiam Shatner, in his disgusting stupid - asks the contestant whether he wants to "lock the answer" and when the contestant says he chooses a "dancer" who shouts "Show me the money!" It opens a scroll that has an amount, and if its answer was correct, it adds that amount to its winnings; If it's wrong, the amount is deducted. (So, theoretically, it's possible that a competitor in this gloomy debacle really ends up with Shatner money.) There is also a "Killer Card" and if a contestant chooses a girl who has that corrupted scroll, but he answered correctly, nothing is happening. If he wrongly replies, the game goes to sudden death and must answer another question. If he misunderstood it, he goes without anything. Before she goes to commercials, Shatner shouts, "play" and Shatner, a competitor and 12 dancers shaking prey. At the end of the show, Shatner asks the ladies for "the last dance" and they all shake it all up. I give this show a maximum of 6 episodes, at what time I hope this will be pathetic. the excuse for the game will be displayed at the door. (It could have been worse - they could somehow bribe Cuban Gooding Jr to host, although I bet he's a better dancer than Shata, as they call him today.) 7/08: Guess what - I was wrong! It only took 5 episodes. There is hope for the world.
