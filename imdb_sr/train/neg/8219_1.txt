I am the type of person who always goes into the horror section when I choose a movie, so I chose five over my eyes, I was horrified by this film and thought that there is no story and no sense to enjoy, it made my skin crawl and think that people like watch films that just incite violence, because it was a small budget and a lot of trash! I think I could do better. I think it was the worst movie I ever saw in my life and I should not be bothered with watching actors who were stupid cameras was a horrible picture was bad and the sound was not over, I think it was a bit a bit like a splash that It designed and did not work at all.
