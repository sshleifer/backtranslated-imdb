The only reason I gave one of the 10 was because it was not allowed to be given a zero of 10. This was the biggest waste of time I've ever endured. In about 75 minutes, you are subjected to the BEST act (and I do not mean it in a good way, like in the KILLER NERD that had a terrible acting) and a plot that is not only funny, but also has NITRO. with a massacre. The reason I even rented this piece of shit was because it has a massacre in the title. It was said that there was only one murder in the whole film and it was pretty poor. Spend more time watching kids fighting and working in the backyard than anything else. Speaking of children, the actor's boyfriend is probably an irritating childish actor since the bobs from the house next to the cemetery. Did I mention that it was also recorded on the video? If you want to throw money for more than an hour of your life, then be absolutely careful. But if you enjoy hard-earned dollars and time, then get out of here.
