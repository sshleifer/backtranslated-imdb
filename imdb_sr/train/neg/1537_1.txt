A really bad shot on the video "movie" made by not one, not two, but three amateur video cameras. nakedness. Have the blood secured from latex-cut off hands that were bought at the Halloween store. There are lesbians and whores, but there is no nudity or sex. Lesbians spend a lot of time in bed, but they just talk. It seems to have no editing effects - fade, erase, etc. > Terrible music of bad heavy metal bands whose web pages occupy most of the final credits. They did not even try to put brown makeup on their necks, hands, or wrists. I guarantee that a 10 year old with a video camera will compose a better movie. rent or watch this movie, except as an example of how to avoid making a low-budget video.
