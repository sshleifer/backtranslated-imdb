Ummm, please, forgive me, but was not more than half of the characters missing? In the original novel, Valjean is a man who is in prison for 19 years for stealing bread and trying to escape several times. He interrupts the parole and is tirelessly pursued by police inspector Javert. By the way, there are many characters that were not in this version. It's worth mentioning Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Toardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche and Enjolras. The only character with the same name is Javert. I was confused and frustrated during the entire film, trying to see how this was in any way related to the epic novel by Victor Hug.
