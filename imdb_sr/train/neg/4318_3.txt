I thought this was one of the most depressing holiday movies I've ever seen - and others are THE THE Christmas Christmas VIFE and JACK FROST. All three films are about death. If you like to be fundamentally depressed, then be sure to watch this movie or anyone else. In this film, the acting is good, and some of the landscapes (except when people die) is beautiful. But, I'm worried a clinically depressed person might accidentally watch a movie and do it yourself! Despite the ending of "happy ever after", most of this film is a terrible catastrophe for another. And, for some crazy reason, I do not want to be depressed when I watch a Christmas movie (I know it sounds crazy - after all, it does not say your eyes, and you feel unclear what the holidays are at all about?). For more exciting viewing experience, try out the forgotten HOUSE WITHOUT Christmas dishes, Christmas CAROL or Christmas story by George C. Scots - unless of course you want to be poor.
