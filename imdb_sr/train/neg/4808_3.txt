Okay, I've seen many movies dealing with witches and occult, but this one was just strange. This movie begins as a cult of witches led by very bad Orson Vells who plays a role (could not bring someone who looked and acted more like a Satanist) just did not belong to this movie at all. But, in any case, Cohen takes a new member and stabs a doll that resembles someone and makes her a wrong fight. The lady who got an abortion and her husband go to a place called Lillith to work, and the lady in the meantime sees the image of her sister or anyone else who calls her and warns her to stay away and never use her power there or will die. The couple, after settling in a strange city, found that all the inhabitants were all witches, and she became curious and scared of all her neighbors and friends. Then strange things start when a lady finds a funeral that takes place on a hill that suddenly disappears (it was creepy), as well as watching a boy belonging to Orson Wells in a playroom, who later asked the lady to help him return to life. The lady is soon trying to escape from the city, but only to find her trapped in the trap of her inhabitants and forces, and she finds it to ignore all that the spirit tries to warn. This movie is ok, it has its moments of uncertainty, but it really could have done much better than there was Orson.
