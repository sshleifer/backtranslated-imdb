This film has a beautiful landscape. Unfortunately there is no complication. There must be a conflict to make a plot. He did not have this film. He spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever do any activity in her. The image tries to be artistic, but does not pay attention to the basics of witnessing the story. If you love the landscape of Montana and fishing in the fly, in this movie you will find some value, just do not expect the story. It's gone.
