Although it makes an unusual good joke, humor is generally quite dry, while panel members often drag faces or resort to rough language and wait for the audience to applaud enough with jokes. The second comment says I do not think this is the best thing RTE has ever done, really dry and sarcastic. Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, there are several truly fun intelligent gags that would sincerely laugh at you loudly. It seems that comedians persuade well-known names, and do not estimate the quality of speckles that are not so good. All in all, it's average with some good laugh, but it can often be quite central. It's not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens stuff. I think Benni Hill is funnier.
