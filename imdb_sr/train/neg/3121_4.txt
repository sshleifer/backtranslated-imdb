This movie is bad for garbage. It has a terrific taste, and it's a pedestrian and unconvincing in the script, albeit allegedly based on real events - it adds nothing but makes it more disappointing. The direction is not well done because the scenes and dialogue are out of place. I'm not sure what Robin Williams has seen in this character or story. To begin with, Williams is not convinced as a gay in breaking up the relationship, nor is the link itself interesting. Worse still, his character is forced by a ugly pedophile story that is basic and there is no room for action. You have an elderly Rory Culkin who tirelessly pronounces "d_ck_smker" - in a good party - which is boring enough and then laughs from Villiams' character. You finally have Sandra Oh as an advisor to the angel guard Villiams and thrown into the explanation of the whole fiasco to the end. Tony Koleta's character is simply uncomfortable and he is again riding his sixth Sense performance with a worse direction. Very wrong.
