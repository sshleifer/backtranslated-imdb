As said, visual effects are astounding. They take their breath. I personally use Blender and graphics as if it was not easy. But that's all this. Not only is the operation confusing, but the general conflict is not clear. For example, in the first scene, Prog and Emo try to get away from who knows what. It seems that the conflict between man and nature is here. Later, when they enter the room of the abyss, Proog explains that "one step is out of place and (dead)". There is a more precise conflict between a careless man and nature here. As the movie progresses, it is clear that there is a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly there is a conflict between man and man when Proog, nowhere, kills Emo. Progo immediately changes from a caring guard who takes care of a lost child to a "sick man". He issues us. Not only is it depressing, but we do not care, as there is no conflict between thoughts and actions of a character. It's not a story about someone, through a struggle, which is getting stronger. It is depressing and did not indicate because there is no great truth about the human soul or the world that came out as a big drama. In my opinion, the film is seriously underdeveloped in all aspects. However, the graphics are stunning, but the movie is much more than ordinary sweets. There is no truth, no struggle and no surprise. In conclusion, an undeveloped film without a point. ... but the graphics are good.
