In addition to acting, Meril Streep, which, as always, is important, I avoid this film because it has the quality of the film about the film of the week. But it's worth watching if you bear in mind some of the underlying points: How do people submit media surveillance and how they are treated differently? In the film, the issue of credibility is different. The Australians are different from "us" (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) automatically come to this with the air of "strangeness" about them. The couple involved is religious (different from most cultures) and Adventists (different). So, their lifestyle and way of thinking are suspicious. Dingoses are different animals from other dogs, so we are confronted with strange issues again. The real story is, therefore, how society (and the world) treats different people, who have different accents, different beliefs, than we do and how we treat what they say are suspicious. It's hard to hear the phrase "Dingo took my baby!" without laughing and there are humorous posts, unfortunately, all over the web about it. But in the years that followed the story and the film was discovered (as you will find in the web search) that much more children were dangled by dingos. A study by dengue experts has shown that it is not only possible, but also most likely, that the baby took a dingos (perhaps a couple), to get out of the clothing eccentrically and eat it in moments without a trace. Still, what remains is the question why people have been defending dengue when it is found to endanger children, rather than killing dingo to save children, because the female influence is so cold that it is considered to be guilty and still. Questions about wandering, with or without a movie.
