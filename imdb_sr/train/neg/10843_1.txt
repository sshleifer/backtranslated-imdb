This may have been made for hell, but that was probably the worst movie I've seen for years, the best thing about the whole DVD would be the case !!! I'm surprised that people took time to do something so stupid and to spend money on it, I'm glad I just rented it. I suppose that the true fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and Gothic to take care of it without taking any CGI or any other effects for this thing, I hope that Alek Chandon learned a lighting lesson and a SFX in order to make a better movie future, that is, if it is still in operation. Notes for customers this is extremely disappointing, DO NOT BUY!
