I'm sorry, it's not good. It starts interesting, but loses its way for several minutes in the movie. It does not help much that none of the brilliant actors (Kuaid, Glover, Ermei, Year, etc.) provides really good performance. It could be due to the fact that I saw a synchronized version (German), but Dennis Kuaid's character was particularly woody and boring, and Danny Glover does not really make a convincing bad guy. Moreover, the character of Jared Leto does not really contribute to the story (apart from saving one main hero's life at one point, but this scene is necessary as a submarine windshield wiper in the first place ;-) <br /> <br /> <br> Talking about unnecessary scenes - the main complaint is actually a clandestine and clich√© story: a detective (of course!) He has to solve a personal matter with a criminal and (of course!) He is suspended from office. his personal confusion. The killer (of course!) * Wants to watch and play a game with a cat and a mouse with his opponent for years ... I do not know how many movies he builds on a similar story - most of them are better, however, the shop has holes in abundance and many completely incredible and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute at all or work well (for example, a truck stop or a car on the edge of a cliff, etc.). On top of everything, the ending is trying to be genuine and exciting, but It's totally ruined in that respect. We saw a lot of better finals with a similar kind of ultimate fighting-on-the-train-in-lonely-winter-landscaping ... In the end, apparently moving a gathering of parents and a child ... at least.
