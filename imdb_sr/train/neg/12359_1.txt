I thought this was a really horrible movie - I came across a few times to yelling at my TV. One or both gay male leaders were wrong; there was absolutely no chemistry between them, and Richard Ruccolo looked like he'd rather have loved a dog. The film covers their long and tedious courting, emphasizing every breakdown and makeup, but not elaborating the reasons for the details. These reasons would be for some interesting characters, not for fighting or make-up in bed (lame even if you liked the movie). Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine like their characters, but do not make a movie worth renting. Save money.
