Another British romantic comedy that appears to have a hungry appetite worldwide. This weak effort is an unintentional parody of the genre - all the classic clich√© scenes are here from the ridiculously developed misunderstandings to run after the outgoing trains to declare love. The characters are one-dimensional caricatures, except Love-Hevitt who manages to bring a certain cohesion to the film. Things threaten to fall out of control in the credibility department as the movie progresses; our benevolent suspicion of belief finally collapsed during a meaningless ending. If you are looking for Bridget Jones, Notting Hill you will not find the kind of experience here.
