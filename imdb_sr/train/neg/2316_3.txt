Having read for many years about how this film is excellent, as Ruiz found among French critics (especially the Snob Cahiers audience), when I finally looked at him a year ago, I discovered that this was rather disappointing (but then, I guess the expectations were high -. Filmed in a saturated black and white technique, this deliberately cerebral film (made for TV and mercy, only an hour) is told in the form of conversations between art experts and narrators outside the screen thinking over a series of images (which are shown in the style of the believer) and trying to find if they have some traces of hidden political crimes (the terrible film Kate Beckinsale Uncovered has a similar argument.) Borgesian is the word I read a lot in reviews of this film, but I would say that almost every Borhes's story is more interesting than this movie.
