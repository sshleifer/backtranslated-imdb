Rounding out the schedule of "Our Gang" from 1929-30, "A Tough Vinter" has two stories. First, Vheezer and Mari Ann, at home alone on the winter day, decide to make little tarts. Mali Vheezer transmits Mari Ann's instructions from the radio cooking show. Problem: Vheezer transmits information from various shows and Mari Ann ends up putting soap into micro! Funny moments happen when the rest of the gang appears to pull the taffy - and it ends in the house! The second story speaks of Stepin Fetchit, a neighbor / master of the gang, and his interaction with the gang. "Heavy winter", as far as I know, is never shown on television, although it is available on home video. The reason for this is the characterization of Stepin Fetchit, which shows a somewhat cunning and slow character. Producer "Our Gang" Hal Roach called Fetchit a "skillful comic" and used the "Our Gang" entry as a pilot for a Fetchit comedy that never saw the light of the day. It is understandable that Fetchit's characterization today is offensive to many people, which explains why the film is put on the shelf. Although there are some funny moments with both Fetchit and Taffy, "Heavy Winter" is a tiring meandering effort. If it came out of this movie, it was Hal Roach Studios that became confident and experienced in the making of speakers. The sound in the movie is good, and some of the sound effects are very fun. That is why this film partly opened the way for excellent films "Our Gangs" from 1930-31. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
