Vhev. What can be said about Gimkata that is not already? This is nothing but pure halar from the beginning to the end. If you want a movie that will keep you on the floor as you laugh, this is the perfect movie. From Cabot's wild style of jeans / sweaters to Parmistan (and that's four billion different ninjas), everything about this movie stinks to shit. in Bruce Lee's death game, he once again shows his complete lack of direction. A few other people you most likely will not recognize will also appear for your enjoyment, from Buck Kartaliana to Tadashi Iamashita, although you will not remember them or worry about them after the film is finished. > It is allegedly based on a book called "Terrible Game", which, if I could find one trace of its existence, anywhere I wanted to know, to see where this went wrong. Instead, the book is obviously the fruit of Gimkata's imagination. Probably something that Clouse invented to sell his lame idea. Pick up this and Iakmallah it for yourself. It's easy one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and that's enough.
