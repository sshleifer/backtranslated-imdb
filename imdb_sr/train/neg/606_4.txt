The potential was there. I saw Creep and thought, 'Oooh, this is getting interesting' a few times. However, somehow some interesting lines of plot were unexplained or ignored, as if they had never happened. The main character was irritating during the entire film, and at one point both me and I shouted that we wanted her to die. There are some really dreadful / frightening moments, but this is largely overshadowed by the moments that made me upset. This is another of those horror movies that appear and intrigue you for a while, but eventually leave you frustrated and a little confused by what movie creators are trying to achieve. The movie is a bad guy, but when the baddie is more sympathetic than the protagonist, you know that you are at a loser.
