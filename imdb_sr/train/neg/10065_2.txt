Much worse than the original. In fact, it was * painful * to pass, and barely kept the interest of the six-year-old. The presentation of some new Pokemon is a bit interesting, but the story is extremely thin, the dialogue is still bad, and music is central. Instead, watch the TV show - it's much better.
