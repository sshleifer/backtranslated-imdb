I heard about this movie and I knew it was not really good. But I began to watch a movie (on my movie channel) and I was interested. This could be really bright, dark black satire on today's media. The small features in each competition were good. It's built on something I do not want to miss. But when the so-called shov begins, everything becomes incredible, cheap and pretty stupid. Here's where the writer should add something that would make people think. But instead, he is wrapped up and assuming people are stupid. The ending is so bad that I give it to him. Even if the film starts promising.
