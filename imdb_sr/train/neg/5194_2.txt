Do not misunderstand me, I want you to see marijuana legalized as much as next. I'm going to turn now. However, writing was unrealistic. The mother of PTA is dealing with drugs, but she is determined to get drugs into the hands of a minor. Give me a break. The complacency of the very handsome character of Mari Louise Parkers was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not at all cute. Basically, the lines of complication did not go anywhere. I understand her only TV country. Lying was obvious. Marie Louise Parker should be great mum and I should have believed in this .... WHY ???? I just got a feeling that I was preaching a play that resembles shadows. It's like saying that it's OK to cheat your wife, but with someone with an adult status. OK, it's not exactly the same thing, but I think you people understand my point. This saves things for children is wonderful for the campaign's traces, I suppose, but it does not keep water in the cable series on the suburban mother, as a local dealer.
