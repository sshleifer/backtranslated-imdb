Primal Species (1996, Dir. Jonathan Vinfrei). The military commando must now think fast, if he wants to prevent the extinction of a human species, instead of reptiles. That's pretty much. The acting is acceptable only with a few characters. The story is bad, and the whole movie based on the army and the Marines tries to kill dinosaurs. This film came out three years after 'Jurassic Park'. Instead, this film seems to have come out 13 years before 'Jurassic Park'. Dinosaur costumes are so badly made, and I think costumes. It's obvious that people are dressed and this film does not try to hide it. The scene when the dinosaur passes down the hallway is created in a way that it looks like someone is driving a creature. That's one good thing that comes from this movie. Short working hours. At only 1 hour and 15 minutes, it does not spend too much of your life, but you're still trying to avoid it. - Officer (Brian Currie)
