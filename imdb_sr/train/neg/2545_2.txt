There's a laugh in this movie, that's for sure. Michael Keaton is a talent and was once fun (before he decided he was a serious actor). However, what troubles me so much in this movie is how practically all characters are useless. Apart from the main two, they are all jerks. I mean, these losers in a small town are just as clumsy as you. Just watch and think, man, these losers should be unemployed. Moreover, an American factory worker is portrayed as lazy and ungrateful. That led me to wonder if this film was made by Japanese nationalists. Oh, of course, in the end everyone gathered together as one, but I just did not enjoy the journey to get there.
