I saw this film and others. Trinity is my name and I think this is worse than the first one. I have no idea why they even made another movie, it was silly and senselessly sorry to say that I have them all. I've been sitting through them several times and still makes me turn it off for 5 minutes in the movie. I like Terence Hill movies and I love Bud Spencer, but this movie just drove me to the wall. Had he had a different story or at least more complications and more comedy, it could have been fun and worth the $ 5 I spent on buying all the movies. But you make mistakes, so I would say to save money and not to watch this movie or any of those who follow it, believe me in this.
