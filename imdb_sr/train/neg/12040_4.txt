I do not know anything about Ilijada, so I can not comment on his accuracy in this story. However, as a stand-alone film, this was very boring to me. The battle scenes tried to be great and spectacular, but they were obvious CGI. The act is bad and no doubt Brad Pitt was thrown just to attract the ladies. But he does not make a good warrior, he is too beautiful, I'm afraid. The good thing is in the design. This movie looks good with impressive buildings and castle walls. I like a movie that at least tries to emphasize characters' characters, but it seems that this movie is completely ignored. We hear American, Scottish English everything except what you would expect for a film about an ancient Eastern civilization. All in all, I do not recommend that this movie befriends the family. It's too long and the young will be bored. Adults are ok if you do not care about the lack of realism.
