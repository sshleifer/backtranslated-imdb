I just watched this movie and I have to say that with such a great premise and great talent this party just lies there !!! My friend borrowed this film and I looked at him open mindedly mainly because he had such a high praise for the story. Well, the film started with Kevin Costner as a fighter pilot retiring ... why? Why did they make him the pilot of a hunter? It will be allegedly hired by Anthony Quinn's character to be his new pilot ... well, we never see Costner going near the plane for the rest of the film! Costner meets Texans (James Gammon) who sells horses to a great Mexican businessman and Costner to drive. Not knowing what had happened, Gammon was approaching death, and Costner took him to a meeting, which was accidentally a coworker from Quinn! But none of this comes ... Hope, Zilcho! Why did they have Gammon's character? Why did they sell horses with Quinn's associate, if none of it came? Also, after they left Costner for the dead, they became the character of Madeline Stove with a whore, and then attacked one of Quinn's people who paid for the order ... she stabbed him with her knife and the next thing she she moved to the monastery! There is no explanation why she was moved, or when it was done! Too many talents lost on such a bad letter and bad editing !! I watched it just because my friend owned it and let me watch it ... I'll throw him to him for 2 hours that I lost in my life watching the damn thing!
