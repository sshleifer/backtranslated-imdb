Has anyone else felt betrayed like me? The first hour was pretty tight, but the last one. Oh my God. It seemed to be predictable and cheesy. It is not grand and epic, as it was a whole series of shows. Most of the reviews she read, but I really do not understand why. Earlier I seriously predicted this general end of VAI, but I pulled it out because I thought "No, they would never do it, it's FAR too crazy." I can hardly bear it. I feel so unhappy. I think I will go to sell each season. Please. Change my mind. I want to love this. So bad. Somebody tell me why I'm wrong. Great shov. A terrible place.
