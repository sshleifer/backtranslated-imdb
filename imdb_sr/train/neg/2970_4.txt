I am a fan of Batman and TV. I loved the show (new and old) and I loved all the movies. But this film is not as big as some people hoped it would be. In my opinion, it's a great downturn. I think the problem was that he did not have a drama. Batman: The Mask of Fantasy and Batman: The Return of Joker had a lot of drama. and Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero also had some drama. Also, I think this film is light for Batman. The only scene that looks a little dark is the big fight with Bane in the end. Anyway, that's fine Batman movie. But I would just rent it.
