Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a big problem in his hands. The serial killer, Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober), for whom the psychic extraordinary Tess (Traci Griffith) helped him capture him, resurrected with the First Power (... given to Satan after he was executed in a gas chamber) and can to possess the bodies of the weak. Somehow, Russell, who joins Tess (who has an understanding of what) will have to stop Channing or many women will continue to die in his bloody hands. They will seek help from Sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen) who tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic Church of the First Force, but denied access to weapons that could stop Channing. the heart of Channing liberating the world of his evil. He will take it anyway and provide a helping hand to Russell, who will need all the help he can get when Channing kidnaps Tess who is preparing for some sort of Satanic ritual / ceremony. In the film, Micheltie Villiamson, always a reliable welcome actor, gets a Russell role partner .. so you know what will happen to him. As with movies of this type, everyone around Russell dies, but when he tries to kill Channing, he only kills the weak army of another poor soul he owns. Pure occult trash .. door to finish. Phillips and Griffith are trying to give it to them, but in this kind of film they have no chance. Kober, who is usually always effective as a heavyweight, is really delivered nothing more than a stupid criminal who jumps into the air and throws up the jokes of jokes.
