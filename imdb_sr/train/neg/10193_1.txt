With this film, Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all the movie power, while the film clearly states that his work is "objective". Obviously, it's not. For one reason, many scenes "shot with a clean chance" are obvious settings (when a poor goat "accidentally" falls off a cliff, you can really see the smoke of the gun on the right side of the screen!). On the other hand, his concealment of an important information: the people of Hurdes were as they were for a certain reason, which is just indicated in the film. It's a choking, a disease caused by a lack of iodine (salt). This dullness is the cause of their cretinism, and that Bunuel only took the time to do his research (hell, if he checked in the medical dictionary 'Cretinism' that found a 'dullness'), maybe he ended up telling the truth about these people (and still, suspicious). Instead, he constantly judged his film, speaking of them as "jerks", again and again, dramatizing action, setting scenes for the creation of spectacles, all this highly unacceptable for the documentary who claims to work for all-encompassing objectivity. Bunuel constantly speaks in this film, not giving any word to the people he is recording. He speaks for them, and even for them, JUDGE. This work is wrong at the root, according to ideology, and it is a pity that is considered a great film.
