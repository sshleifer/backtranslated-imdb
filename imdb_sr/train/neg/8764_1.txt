This film was absolute torture. First of all, it's incredible 4+ hours! True, the Kargilsky War may have had several points that were captured and fought, but none of these battles must be shown. Maybe this is a documentary film, not a commercial movie. It certainly did not look like this, because there was not enough background information and there were some shortcomings. Battle sequences were so badly derived. I am terribly disappointed with the man who gave the well-created sequences at the border. Each battle was the same as the previous one. It was so predictable. (This can be a spoiler.) The entire army marches uphill, five or five soldiers cursing every five thousand times (they also use the same curse each time), one of the main actors is shot, someone shouts for the stretcher, the actor says: "No , do not carry stretchers. It will take 6 people from the battalion, "and then the actor dies. This same thing is repeated over and over again. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. The performance of the film is too great for its own good. Despite such a long film, none of the characters was well developed. The actors had the least number of roles. They are all dressed up and presented as the same. The two cried synchronized. It was so funny. They shifted their hands and heads at the same time, then they drooped together. The list goes on and continues. I know that I forget something else. Anyway, I think I've broken enough film to get the picture.
