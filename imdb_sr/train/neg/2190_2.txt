** Possible lighters ahead ** Jason (aka Herb) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who, along with his wife, Leith, is involved in the worst car accident on the screen ever. Leith is cut off and her doctor returns the cut-off tin back to her house and rejuvenates her head in her lab. The exterior of the house was allegedly filmed at the Lindhurst estate in Tarritown; Scenes in the lab were obviously recorded in someone's basement. The wrapped head is held on "laboratory equipment" which is almost cheap for Ed Vood. Some of the music libraries - the highlight of the film - later appeared in Andy Milligan THE BODY BENEATH. Lajt's head has some heavy metaphysical discourse with another of Ever's cover-up, a mutant attached to the closet. In the meantime, a good doctor passes through the straps in search of a body worthy of a brave noodle of his wife. The ending, in uncut prints, is characterized by some of the most recent moments when a monster with zucchini appears from the closet in order for the film to be welcomed. This thing took three years to get rid of it and then the audience gave a bad reception that was richly deserved. In addition, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE AND FEW OTHER, 1959, was to be declared the Year of Turkey.
