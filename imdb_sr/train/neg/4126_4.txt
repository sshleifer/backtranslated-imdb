Absolutely nothing is happening in this sloop, unpleasant, excitement-less thriller directed by Amenabar is a common associate Mateo Gil. The film, which in some way deals with the effect of boredom and pursuit of excitement, does not really provide anything and looks like a drill in boredom. The only mild uncertain moment is the peak of the film, which takes about 30 seconds of the whole agonizing 100-minute minute, and is solved simply. The land lacks sophistication or credibility, and although the idea is original, the way in which the story unfolds is arbitrary, and every device for drawing or twisting is the result of external interference (deus-ek-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him and does not force him to show any initiative or resourcefulness. If you are fans of this genre, watch "Tesis".
