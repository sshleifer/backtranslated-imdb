I guess the reason why this film was so good at the box office is of course Eddie Murphy. I think this was his first film from Beverly Hills Cop and was hot at the time. Given that one made more than two hundred million and it was R, and this made about 80 million and was pg, says it was not so popular. I've never been a big fan of Eddie Murphi, so that's probably another reason why I did not care about that at all. This is Eddie like some sort of finding lost children. He has to find a golden child or the world is in terrible danger. The plot is very bad, but it's bad than it can be compared with special effects. I've seen better things since the 70's than some of the things that this one offers, Rai Harrihausen has done better things. However, the main reason why you see a movie like this is because of Eddie, unfortunately he is not very funny in this, and it seems stupid to put it in the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" scene. I guess they hoped for fish without a water effect, but I just could not do it.
