My roommates and I almost shortened the TV with a number of saliva we did while we watched this hilarious piece of pseudo-zen dreck from the 1970s. I've read about this camp for years and I've scanned my local TV shows late at night in search of this elusive bunch. A few years ago, our local ABC partner was famous for showing cool flickers for his film in late night weekends (ie "Frogs", "Lepus Night", etc.). Then one day it happened: at 1:40 on Saturday night (more than 5 years ago) there was! We had over 15 people and the film did not disappoint! See it! Andi Griffith as the dumbest and most unlikely bad guy of Jae Davidson in "Stargate"! See it! Villiam Shatner deals with a variety of things on the top of a head that barely resembles a human hair (or anything organic for the thing). Hear! jav droppingli inane 1970s psichobabble which makes "Chicken Soup For The Soul" sound like BF Skinner Feel! The content that every decade was better than the 70's. For those who still read ... the shop surrounds a bunch of middle-class middle class - holes that choose to suck up to their --- chief boss (Griffith) by joining a dessert race in California and Mexico. Everyone wears leather jackets, they look at Christopher Street more than anything else. By the way they stop at the Cantina, they drunk, they blow their joints (Robert's "Mike Brady" Reed blows the hinge is an image you will not forget), start the fight, try rape, and you just behave like a bunch left the suburban middle class. Although I have an excellent copy I recorded from TV I WANT, this would be posted on a video so the entire world could enjoy half-hearted nonsense.
