This film is made from untidy rubbish. Sometimes I love romantic comedies. Watching the good is like eating ice cream for dinner. It's not something you'll be doing all the time, but the experience is so pleasant that you can ignore how crazy you are. This film made me think about how stupid I was to continue sitting all the time. Everything about it screamed cheap. It looks as if they have pre-set up the movie at certain points that have been so washed out. It boasts both raw CGI and worthless sets. I know that you can usually expect some complication problems in comedy, but you usually do not care because you laugh. This movie is so inconvenient that you actually sit and wonder about an incredible series of coincidence and totally incredible behavior. Events are set in the film only to move characters from one scene to another or to allow exposure. Of course, this is how all the films work, but you should not notice that this is happening. Inelegant. It's the term I should use. In the film, there was almost no one who would be really cute. I did not care who would end up with anyone until everyone else was away from me, and I did not have to listen to them anymore to talk about it. Why would the only really cool feature in the movie, Paul Rudd character, want to have anything to do with the completely cowardly, snitching, controlling freak Eva Longoria was playing? Likewise, almost all the characters involved have consistently chosen the thinnest solution for every situation. A real man pretends to be gay for five years just to hang out with a woman she's attracted to? The best feeling they could have thought was to catch up with a happy ending of the same shame where he met with Rudd's equally boring liar, a kleptoman's sister? Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive, attractive women. Maybe it will find something better to appear on the road.
