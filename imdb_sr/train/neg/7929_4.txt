I guess if you're in sci-fi and horror stuff, it might be interesting. The acting was fine, but not great. Two pregnant girls should have fifteen years, but they are obviously played by older actresses who then turned out to be twenty-one. The action is fine, but the story moves a little, leaving you guessing whether you are in Boston or Pennsylvania. Apparently the priest uses varp speed between them. The Catholic Church is portrayed as a secret that explores events that only happen to those in that faith. What if these two girls were Protestant? Would Catholics care? That's why something is invented. Who knows, perhaps the Catholic Church may also learn what the Bible teaches. If you miss this, do not feel that you have lost something.
