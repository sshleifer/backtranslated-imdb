A very strange, but occasionally elegant exploit film without a real story, but uses it from its stunningly beautiful actress and a handful of beautiful, terrible effects of makeup. Daniella is a beautiful girl of twenty years, carrying the trauma of rape at the age of 13. The nightmare and hallucinations of water are further in the belief that the reincarnation of the female ancestor is said to be a washbowl. He kills his chick during a night encounter and gets him in the hospital. However, she is running away again, and more and more men are escaping at random while on the run for police detectives, doctors and relatives. It's nice to watch and listen (a really good sound record), but the absence of action and continuity are becoming very irritating. Luckily, the leading lady Annik Borel rarely wears clothes and fills the boring moments by dancing naked around the fire. The film is too long, too weird and too forgetful. The biggest surprise comes in the end, when suddenly and suddenly, director Rino Di Silvestro tries to convince us that his film is based on true facts. Yeah, right...
