The secret deal is even worse than the typical "evil white male corporate capitalist" movie of the week. This film is less pleasant than toothache. Jai Leno can play. He is good at his underrated debut film, The Silverbears, in which he produces performance in accordance with his character requirements. This film is so bad that Lenoin's character, a devoted cricketer, is less boring than Morita's character, a foolish fool.
