This film is incarnated by a bell, flat 11/10 on a scale of personality. The accusation of accent as well as the tense of spandex cardigan pants are just amazing. Ianks, although the right Scotland can be equally colorful, if you ever go there, do not expect them to be given the opportunity to "sail" controversy with the local population. Also, do not try to influence the local thinking through otherwise the art of tapdancing. There are several infectious singing and dance scenes, but the plot is too cheesy and linear, and the dialogue is often too weak. I also suspect that anyone would want to get stuck in a Scottish village in the 18th century, in a time lag, and not in gay New York. Perhaps it was not such a great sacrifice for that priest that he had left Brigadoon, perhaps he was just trying to get out of that dump. Watch out for a nice alternative picture of the reality of the Christopher Streed Dai-parade in Scotland would look like LSD. Besides, I would recommend it to Hollywood musicians only.
