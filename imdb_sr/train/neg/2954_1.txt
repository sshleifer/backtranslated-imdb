I watch a lot of bad movies, LOTS !!!!!! It's kind of a hobby, really. Almost every Saturday, your group of friends and I gather and watch garbage from around the world - anything. Turkish super heroes, vampire movies from Brazil, Italian gorillas transplant films, Kevin Costner films, ANITHING (except perhaps Raising Helen), but I have never seen THE LARGEST movie of THEODORE REX. Never. Even fun is not bad at Ed Vood - it's just SUCKS. This film was known in Hollywood at the time it was shot because Vhoopi took off his gloves and made it known to journalists and everyone else who would listen that she hated that part of CRAP - she tried to get out of the contract, vhined, she moaned but still they pour her fat butt in this skin skin tight futuristic police uniform that is horrible to see, iikes !!!! And you can only see her sculpting during taking - she does everything, but not looking at the camera for her agent in order to scream at him. The dinosaur has about three facial expressions, and the scenario is so awesome that the third class could do a better job if it promised cookies.
