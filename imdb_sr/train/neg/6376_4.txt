Jennifer Kassi (Gina Philips of "Dead and Breakfast") returns to her home in which she recently inherited her late sister, without the knowledge of the grandmother (Fai Dunavai) who still lives in her. Jennifer decides to sell it because she is terribly needing a lot of money for grandma. It also begins to have troubled nightmares of the mysterious raven. In this film, there was really no one to deal with. Jennifer seemed cold, remote, unsentimental and narcissistic, while Grandma seemed defiant, sad and narcissistic. The film is good and well made, but without anyone to sympathize, it was hard for me to worry about what happened to them. My class: C-
