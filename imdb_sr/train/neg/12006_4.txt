OK, the director is processing LOVE Actually, director Nikhil Advani, after debuting with KHNH, works for his other half and awaits waiting at 3:30 pm + a film that loses patience, time.etc The viewer looks like 3 hours of sleep watching this movie OK, they had 6 stories so it was necessary, but why? 6 stories? We have a story about Anil-Juhi convincingly but boring, but the TV series do not show such a story? We have a story about Govinda-Shenon that is funny and works well Akshaie-Aiesha story is again convincing, but soon becomes dull, and the focus is on a comedy that is too slapstick boring comedy We have the story of Salman-Priianka, which is the worst, not only actor's terms, it makes no sense at all. We have a Sohail-Isha story to make you laugh and trick works sometimes due to boredom you have set up most other stories. We have a John-Vidia story of a good story in every way. But then when the stories come in pieces, the viewer is bored and sleeping, and the climax is not particularly appealing. The top story of the story of Salman-Priiank Nikhil Advani behaves well in some places, some stories are well-processed, but weak in Music (SEL) is good, but too many songs Cinematography is beautiful, each story is given a different appearance, texture and works. Actors Govinda rocks, after returning with BB, actually makes you laugh and love it in this movie despite its age and weight. Looks like a form and tired John points out in his work, Aksha Khanna turns into a change Sohail Khan is too superior and Isha has nothing to do Anjana Suknani is laying off Priyanka and Salman deserve a reward for this movie that you are shocked? Salman Khan does not only behave, he just says as if he is in a dream and that false accent that the god Priyanka turns into such a standard you feel like throwing something on her, she is fixing towards the end Vidia Balan is good , Juhi Chavla is okay Shannon is fine
