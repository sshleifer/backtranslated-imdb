This, no doubt, is the most stubborn "chick" I've seen for years, if not ever. Writing and characterizing are so full of stereotypes that the film borders with a parody. Before we left the theater hour and five minutes into this catastrophe, we were subjected to the following topics: having a baby will solve all your problems, "performer types" are misery, and musicians can not be good mothers if they throw their dreams on more conventional way of life. What a loss of a talented actor and some great sets and costumes. When Natasha Richardson told Tony Collette she would, if she did not live in more lives, end up - shake - "herself!", I felt nauseous. I can not believe this movie has reached the theater edition. From such "female" cable channels, which I always go through when channel-surfing, we expect this kind of drive. I am a woman and older than 35, so I should be part of the target audience of this film, but the boy, "Veƒçer" missed the target.
