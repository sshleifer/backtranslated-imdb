It's not just about the action that makes this movie a momentary exclusion for a boring audience. It's a horrible course with a horrible script and bugs left and right that makes this too agonizing for watching. I'm sorry, but I do not see the "fun" in this. Just the excitement of pointing to a lot of mistakes and stupid single-liners. So I wonder how stupid directors think about their production company when this film was first introduced. Probably stupid like that sheriff who got into a truck full of antifreeze with a bloody bloody wound. Ups! Did I forget to mention this sheriff who is not only a bad actor, but can he take off the impact with antifreeze that socks exposed meat? I guess he somewhat forgot when he won a not so exciting victory over the snowman.
