This film was supposed to be a movie hit, and it really is. This is the type of film that is made by eating popcorn and watching great graphics. Bearing this in mind, the film brings, maybe not as good as the ultra-colorful Iron Man, but good enough. In addition to the action for popping popcorn and special effects, the film falls from the cliff faster than Villa E. Coiote. Many viewers, including myself, will complain that most of the characters are seriously changed, but this only makes the movie a bad adaptation, not a bad movie. This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons. Manufacturers were more focused on being an eye-catching than they did to the mind. Characters that have been long awaited and promoted have been reduced to 4 scenes. The main characters of Volverine, Victor Creed (they were never called Sabertooth in the movie) and Colonel Striker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Liev Schriber. The other characters are thrown aside to make places with all the important sweets. Volverine's character was fully developed after 30 minutes, as did Sabertooth, although Victor finally draws some surprises in the film. The "final boss" of the movie is a weird and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is. Film makers obviously thought that everything they needed to do was create a crazy character who could do everything he wanted and hit the popular character's name. Very disappointing ...
