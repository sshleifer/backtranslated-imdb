Cole, a space prisoner in a space prison, is able to take away a space shuttle and escape to the forest of America, where he and a new friend try to escape from the kibbler's killing machine. Best film career by Fred Olen Raia, "Hollivood Chainsav Hookers", this one can not but feel like a bit of a disappointment. None of the actors really distinguished from me, the film is fine for a non-discriminatory viewer during the rainy Saturday afternoon, but that's pretty good for everyone. My Rating: D + <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Shovtime Thriller
