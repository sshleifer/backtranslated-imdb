The first half of this film is pure joy. Roman. Funny. Vonderful performances. A close brother and sister living in Manhattan fall on the same woman! Adult. Bright. Vitti. What more can you ask. As a romantic comedy, it begins to refresh. Going to the unexplored territory. And then it breaks. It goes from a universal adult comedy to a story of how it comes to age, which has been made many times before. What a disappointment. As a film, people begin with such a promise. Why is it necessary to turn into such a pedestrian movie "I am what I am". The recording of Hose Graham's jumping in the air to celebrate "his happiness in finding herself" highlights the banality of the last part of the film. It could be magical. In the end, he was the same old man.
