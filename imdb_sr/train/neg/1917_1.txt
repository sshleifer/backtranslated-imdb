This film, though not completely bad, was to be recorded where the events occurred. Grand Island, Nebraska was devastated by not less than seven tornadoes on the night of June 3, 1980. The Grand Island is located in the almost waterless valley of the Platte River in the district of Hall. The producers of this film shot in trees covered by Ontario Hill and moved the whole event into a nonexistent city named Blainsvorth. The Great Island people bravely survived this terrible night just to be forgotten for a bad movie.
