It's almost like two films - one literate and engaged, another stupid and clich√©. It's really a pity that all the problems are not elaborated in writing, but since most of the B-films are written and produced, this is not too unusual. That's a real shame, because that could have been a very good movie. First Good. The film is genuine and includes switches of code VVII. This is quite fascinating and I loved to watch the leading man (Lee Bovman) go through his steps as a master code-breaker. In fact, the first two thirds of the film were very good. But now, for bad, the film went too long and lost the couple about 50 minutes. In addition, the role of Jean Rogers as "girlfriends girlfriends" must be classified as one of the worst written and disturbing roles in film history !! For any clever move made by Bovman, idiot Rogers stepped in to mess things up like some kind of wrong "comedy." If her role was intelligently written, the whole movie would immensely improve! Instead, looking at it, it's hard to figure out how we actually won the Second World War !!
