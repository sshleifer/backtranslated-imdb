Pay attention to all crazy scientists: if you want to transform your son into a genetically mutated monster, you must give him a name that is more terrible than "Polo." I do not care if he's a scary shark with a hammerhead with teeth with sharp daggers and the ability to snap into water as well as dry. Give the kid a more valuable name like "Thor", "Rock" or "Tiburon". Because even if she ate me, I'll probably just sit and laugh, "Ha! Take this! Paul Monster splashes me to pieces !!!!!" This is the worst part of this film, this shark is called "Paul" throughout the film. What could have been a decent, horrifying horror movie seems crazy. It's not that there are no other camping and fictional parts of "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy". Scientists spend the entire film wandering around this island, and suddenly one of the girls crazy wander from a walk in a lush forest, and only has to pour water on her feet to live itching, which of course allows "Paul" to "get out of the water and kill her." The only thing SciFI Channel did in this movie was to let the hottie live. But it is a small silver coating in a otherwise disappointing movie.
