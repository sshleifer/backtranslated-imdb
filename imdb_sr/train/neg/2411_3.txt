Hood of the Living Dead is a young scientist named Rick who lives with his brother in the city of Oklahoma where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets. One night, Rick's brother was hit by a gang that was driving down the street that had previously fought with him. Desperate, Rick calls his scientific partner to bring the latest formula on which he works, which brings sick blood cells to health. The formula has not been tested on a man, even on a dead body, but Rick is determined to revive his brother. It gives the body a double dose of the formula, but nothing happens. So, Rick calls 911 and the body is taken only to return to life and honor human flesh. Now Rick must find his zombie brother before the entire hood is turned into a neighborhood of the dead. The cover of the living dead is one piece of garbage. The action is a direct vengeance to Resident Evil, the acting is just terrible, especially since Rick falsely cried for a brother, the pistols are so fake because every time the guns are fired, they send sparks, and the makeup is only lame. It's just fake blood covered with the face of the actors. Zombies have also been modified. They run, they cut, and they have to be shot in the heart to die! The zombies should only fight, bite, and have to be shot in the brain to die! This film is so horrible that this is the only real moment of this film. Hood of the Dead Dead gets 3 out of 10, a bit of fun here and there, but only works as a small budget.
