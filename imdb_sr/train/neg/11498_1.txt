Gadar is an example of one of Bollywood's worst films ever. Director: Anil Sharma, who prefers filming a film period in the film. The songs were boring and not exactly the song you want to listen to in your car, full of power. Sunny Deol is known for making dumb movies, where I am losing 100 bad guys. He even hit the metal gate of the prison (Indian) and hit a car that was moving away (Teesri Aankh). I can give you another 50 examples of the shameful action of Sunni Deol. But I'm sure most people already know that. Sunni gives a pathetic performance that repeats the same kind of role again. A man who claims to be fighting for his own country, using violence. Amish Patel's hand is dead sexy with an incredible body to love bones. But even she could not save the film from a disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes as it usually does, there is no film in this movie. Maybe because she played the Muslims, but she does not act like one in the movie. All in all, this is a bad show to the end, I'm sure it will appeal to some people who like to see how the Bollivood actor has won 100 guys. Give me a break.
