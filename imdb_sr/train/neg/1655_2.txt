This film really shows age. The print I saw was terrible about age, but it's possible that there are better prints there. However, this was not a big problem with the film. The problem was that although the film was born in 1933, it was essentially a silent film with just a diamond dialogue (just a few sentences) in the movie in the most amateurish way. Sometimes the backs of the characters turned or talked over their faces - all in a pathetic attempt to hide their lips and "clam" (?) They hide the fact that the movie is synchronized. Well, the truth is that this Czech movie had to be synchronized in many languages, but to do it in this way it was really dumb and obvious. It looked cheap. All in all, the film looked bad and foolish. It really is a pity, because there was a good story - a young woman who marries an elderly man who is either gay and / or not interested in women. But in the 21st century, few people would be ready to sit through this archaic disorder. Even with a few glimpses of naked (and somewhat grainy) Hedi Lamarr, it's not worth the noise that accompanied the film when it debuted. Even until 1933, this film was badly made. The only interesting thing about the movie is to see how Lamarr looked in 1933 compared to the glamorous picture Hollivood created when she came to America - she looks like 2 completely different people. incomplete look and technical inferior film, I do not see how such bold comments have occurred. For technical problems, the movie can not evaluate 10 or anything near it.
