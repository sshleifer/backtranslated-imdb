The social comment was exaggerated, and the mystery itself was built and resolved through a series of incredible coincidences that were completely incredible. Nothing has changed in Fitz's personal life over the past decade, making it far-fetched. I even had difficulty figuring out why she regrets her stay in Australia compared to the ability to solve the mysteries that she has in England. Can not you get into the Australian police? It seems to be a highly articulated place to engage in a crime investigation. These latest episodes of the original series were pretty melodramatic and incredible, sometimes bordered with stupidity, and this pick up that cloak. rather than returning to the focus of the series one. USA.
