1 out of 10. This is a movie that you can not believe that you've just lost 2 hours of your life while you see the role of a loan. I honestly think that I could make a better movie about Vampire ... and I do not know anything. The only thing that not only is bullshit (harder than the Vampire) is Jason Scott Lee .... his character is at least a bit cool, has some mystery, and hits a little ass.
