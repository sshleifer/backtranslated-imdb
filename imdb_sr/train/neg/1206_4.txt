This idea of ​​long lost mirrors is sometimes available on the web. I bought a copy. Well, of course, acting is terrible and the story is childish, but it has its moments. I think the people who searched this also know the previous story. It was made by the cinema owner for an extremely low budget. But for me, he certainly did not spoil money on props, but on makeup. Make up for this kind of movie. Zombies are visible and blood is intact. The only problem with such films is the quality of pelicules. It's terrible, fortunately there is no hissing to the sound, but sometimes it's too dark. So you have to look clear to see the blood. In a strange way, they tried to sell this as a real, not a nasty one. Speaking with the voice tells you at the beginning of the movie that a character and a man who appears with green flashes, who tells you that it is on the road, is kept. Of course this does not work, made me think of Kanibal girls, it's a boring bell when the red things started to run. They had an original idea, Cannibal Girls was made a year earlier. Do not go to the story, go for zombies and notice the mistake of continuity. When a girl and a boy make love, first take a bra, then make love and suddenly her underwear returns ... try to do it, or I'm just a little out of the net, ... eat ugly corpses
