Fred Olen Rai is a bad director, even when it comes to film director B, but 'Haunting Fear' is probably one of his better movies. Yes, it is massacring a great story about Poe 'Random Burying' and that, it's a bad pace and uneven, but it's also pretty fun. Scream Kueen Brinke Stevens is better than a beautiful, fragile housewife whose worthless husband (Jai Richardson) plans to help her because he needs money to pay off a gangster (played by Robert Kuarri). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many soft-core films in the early nineties, actually gives the best performance in the movie as a slutty mistress. You will also enjoy the small roles played by Karen Black as a psychic, Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berriman in a beautiful hat in one of the best scenes. The end did not make much sense!
