I saw the early screening of this film in New York and I, together with my friends and almost the entire audience, were very disappointed. The film was not so bad that he was good; She was equally lifeless as a victim of a snake bite. Samual L. Jackson looked surprisingly tired of the majority, and the effects of the snake were weak. He reminded me of one of those SciFi movies, except that the sound of this movie was not funny or even silly. Everything seemed to be worn out, straight and open. I'm shocked to say that I think Anaconda was more fun. It's easy to understand that SOAP realizes that it's a piece of * and plays with it, but what a movie fails to start is a script that has any fears of uncertainty. It's the worst kind of lame movie.
