Others in the Vacation series are easily the most disadvantageous, as Clark Grisvold wins the journey for the entire family to Europe. No taste, below the humor that worked so well for the first time practically nonexistent here. That mistake certainly lies with director Hackerling, who is obviously not nearly as good as director Harold Ramis and very inspiring script that has only a handful of decent lines scattered all over the surface. Chevi Chase is injecting some form of life into the process, but it just is not enough and very funny Eric Idle is completely lost in a minor role as a very unlucky Englishman. Some potentially hilarious moments are not shown in full potential and leave the viewer the hardest. All the images of the Europeans are one-dimensional and almost not ridiculous (like the English SOOO). Apart from a few scenes, barely one can spot the laugh and end one in a complete slapstick. But if you are a fan of Chevi Chase (as well as me), the movie is visible, but no more than that.
