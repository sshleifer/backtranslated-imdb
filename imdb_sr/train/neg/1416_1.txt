Strange ... I like all this film crew and movies with dark humor; but I did not like this! It's terrible, horrible and certainly not funny. Damage can not do the whole film plot, also disgust. And it was really boring. Long empty moments fill the film; could be removed. It should have been in a different shorter format. I might have expected too much from the crew - such as keeping the movie lol -. It is also filled with excessive cliches of characters and situations ... I do not understand why people like ... "Poetry," "hope"; No, Mom, I did not see anything like that! All in all, it's empty and rude, poor and hopeless. Oh darn this one ........
