If I could give ZERO stars for this, but unfortunately I have to give one ... There is not one scene that I could laugh ... but the game did not make me laugh too. So if you are a sick retarded nation, go to your local cinema, watch this movie and give it 10 stars, as some people have already done. For me ... in the movie children were killed in order to achieve humor ... a good taste crossed the edge ... this was the third time that I was wasting time seeing Boll film and it was definitely my last! 0/10 ... I'm ashamed of being from the same country as Uve Boll! PLEASE PLEASE TAKE YOU FROM PICTURE!
