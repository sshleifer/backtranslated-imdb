I am 17 years old and I still love most Scooby Doo movies and old episodes. I love movies from the 1990s, and recently we have been treated as one of the best direct DVDs for Scooby Doo's coming of this decade, Scooby Doo and Goblin King, which I did not expect to be as good as it was. Anyway, back to Get a Clue! I watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what I saw, I was not impressed. First of all, I hated the animation. It was a flat, empty and very Saturday-morning-standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some of the shows that I really hate had a slightly better animation. Worse, Shaggi and Scooby looked like aliens, and I really lacked Fred, Velma and Daphne, because they added many old episodes, when Scooby Doo was positive. I also hated the change of character, because it seemed to me that instead of solving the mystery, Shaggi and Scooby now play superheroes, something they would never do in movies or in Scooby-Doo where are you? shov. The topic was not very good, I can not even remember, and the jokes were poor and fictitious. Although, I admit that there is a very talented voice, that they had better material, and that they were not told that it sounds different from the original voices as humanly possible, what they did, I can add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was terrible, and I'm not trying to discredit it, that's what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethani Cok
