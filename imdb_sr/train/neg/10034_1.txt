If there is one movie that is worst this year - it's TASHAN. The first promotion showed that the movie will be a boring film by Dhoom 2, and I knew first that it would be a bad movie, no matter what. But it was a Yashraj movie Or maybe watching a cheerful promotion But this film gave me a shock, it was even the worst then Dhoom 2 and what I was expecting Saif's first introduction that was boring Then Saif-Kareena meets, Kareena is so artificial and then Anil Kapoor God, what's he doing in such a strange movie? What is the role? What is he doing? His first scene is fine, but then his act becomes repetitive and he overacts Then Akshai came to give some nice scenes, but then the film became more boring and with all outdated things Romance from childhood, overdose of children's stage scenes and all boring scenes Completion is another joke Vijay Krishna Acharia would get 3 more films to direct, if this film worked, it's a strategy and nothing, just money nothing else So Vijay is another addition to their list Musicians (Vishal Shekhar) are regular performances by Akshai Kumar down Ace in the film as a breath of fresh air, he actually provides some interesting moments. Saif Ali Khan is irritating, Kareena is equally bad. unexpected and spoil the shov even more Vacation is fine
