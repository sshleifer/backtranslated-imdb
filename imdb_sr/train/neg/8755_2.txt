This film was at the very least terrible. I was hoping for a much better vision of "High School Musical". The whole movie was a complete rip "The Simple Life", only it was not to realize the shov. The act was not good at all. Amanda Michalka had moments when she was not so scary. On the other hand, Alison Michalka was bad. Chris Gallinger, who played Amanda's love interest, played French, but he had a terrific accent. One good thing in this movie was completely cute Michael Trevino, who played Alison's interest. Just something to keep in mind, that this film was broadcast before "High School Musical", probably would not look so bad. But that was not a comparison. <br /> All in all, I give him 2.
