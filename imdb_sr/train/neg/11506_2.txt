This film story is bad enough, which can happen in real life. I do not understand much when they show us this bad movie. I say it was bad because there is some reason. 1. If Madonna was rich and can do everything she wants, then why did she fall in love with this bad guy? 2. How is the script of the story so bad? She was so rich, she could do anything she wanted, but she dared not divorce her husband, which is very impossible. The words that I love do not mean anything in this movie.
