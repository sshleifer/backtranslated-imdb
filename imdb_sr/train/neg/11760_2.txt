Amen to Magsel. There was a lot of confusion. First, how do you know which movie you are buying? Henry Cele plays in each of them. I bought this movie thinking that it was a miniseries ... WHAT IS YEAR !! It would be a comedy, but for a girl who was raped. David Hasselhoff (spelling?) Is OK for popcorn TV, but he was not convincing in this film (where was his English accent?) And WHAT IS A LOVED PRECIOUS ??? The movie was supposed to be about the rise of a young man to military power - not a captain of slave ships engaging in an English girlfriend looking for her dad ... If I paid more than $ 7 a movie, I would have to call police - because it would be a crime!
