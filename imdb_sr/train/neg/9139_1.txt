I do not know what this film director Sam Mraoviƒç has done to some extent in the small aspect of this film. Usually I say this is a movie that should not exist, but this film can be the most important of all times. This film should exist exclusively in order to be undoubtedly the 'worst film ever made'. I've seen bad movies in my life, but this somehow breaks what I thought to be bad in something much more difficult to imagine. believes this is a great movie. Oh vau ...
