I saw this film several times at various short film festivals and always gives me the impression that I saw a movie trailer! For a school film, it was very well produced and directed, but the story ... so it took something else to be a bigger and interesting movie. A character named Tim Vatcher needed some approach. This is something missing in some Portuguese short films - the script is always superficial. But still ... this movie I liked ... Parabeni! (Congratulations!)
