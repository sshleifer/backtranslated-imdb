This early John Wayne Lone Star of the West has something more to do than the olyane Wayne worked for Lone Star by then. First, he has his old friend Paul; Fik, who is a much better actor than the standard Lone Star criminal, brings so much needed professionalism to the environment in place of the usual undecided readings that are often delivered in these oaters. The plot, the wrong identity, the robbery of wages and murders, is torn and superficial as you would expect to be in the low-budget western since the 1930s, but Wayne is well-linking the look, the comfortable charm and the way the line goes a long way to make it more enjoyable. Fatty, stubborn Eddie Chandler is not quite convincing as Vaine's female "partner," and there's a thorn about something that happens when Chandler and Vaine enter the fight with fists that become fatigued. On the other hand, Vaine's love interest is played by none other than Marie Kornman, a small "Mari" early "Little Rascals" of fame. She grew up a 20-year-old now, blond and sweet as a button. Most of Vaine's leading ladies in the Lone Star / Monogram "B" was pretty colorless and colorless, but Mari is happy, sweet and, yes, sexy. There is a scene in the store, where she works, in which Wayne asks him to bring him a bottle of "nerve tonic", which is on the upper shelf, so that he must climb to the ladder and climb to the top. shelf. Wayne is approaching the butt as he rises up the stairs, and again as he descends, and then a few minutes later, when he asks to climb up and get another bottle, he is surprisingly handsome for a film made in 1935. Try to hide the fact that she definitely checks her tongue. In any case, it's interesting little "B", it's not great, but it's not as excited and casual as its LoneStar production of that time. The final fight does not go well, and Chandler is a little irritated after a while, but everything is worth looking at, even if only to see the cute and sexy Marie Kornman.
