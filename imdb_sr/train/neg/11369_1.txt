It's pretty funny, I hope that many people are exposed to Muslims living throughout the United States, U.K and around the world. Religion has over one billion followers. I was born and breaded in America and through my religious teachings and teachings I learned to care for my country and work on contributing to society. I am very committed to the teachings and teachings of my religion that are emphasized through life in order to be educated and prepared for success through education in order to contribute to the world. I know many Muslims from all over the country and traveled to countries like Pakistan. I have not yet met a person who believes that we should hurt anyone or accept any other religion other than people in the media ... I wonder why ... It is also sad that these extremists are those used by the media to represent the entire religion. His religion is a billion people, which is less than one percent, I am sure that other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the KCC, the IRA, and many more that are a simple small percentage of extremists who use obsolete and non-literary excerpts from respectable books in order to realize their vengeance, personal or business thing through their so-called religion
