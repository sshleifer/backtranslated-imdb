The whole film should last 45 minutes - maximum. Although an interesting concept / theme, it actually did not develop as a story. Once the initial idea of ​​a brave (stupid?) Bomber removal specialist (Cowboy?) Is introduced, which happens very early in the film, the rest is repeated. The characters are not explored, and the aspects of location and politics are ignored. There were nice insights into the terrible difficulties that the troops face in such an environment abroad and the difficulty in distinguishing between friends and enemies. But the way the unit worked stretched out beliefs! Individual performances were good, and special effects were adequate, but insufficient to overcome the basic lack of content.
