I watched it today, partly attracted to the acting star, and partly because I enjoyed many other films of this kind. However, this should be avoided. There are dozens of bad scenes in which continuity simply does not flow, the challenge of the pool at the start, for example. The battle scenes with the indigenous people are just as good as you remember in those old black and white Tarzan movies, you know where you see spears flying through the air, and the camera cuts out a dead cousin lying motionless on the floor and adorned by his thigh. Is that the current death? There are also quite unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the plot, such as a little girl who is saved while collecting flowers. The really bad animated clay toys are too painful to watch. If you see this film, crustaceans moving at around 5 km / h are the highlight. Somehow he manages to get David McCullum to give him. As if there is no time to get out of the way, as when the city's obelisk collapses, the native has all the time in the world to make a step to the left, but not he screams and falls on it. I only give 2 for Ekland. And why does the Mccullums voice develop stuttering as the movie progresses?
