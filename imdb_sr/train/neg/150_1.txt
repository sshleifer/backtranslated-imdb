Dude, really !!!! where have you been for the last 20 years, this is shocking in all ways, horror? This is a joke, there's nothing wrong with being a low budget, but this is a laugh. If you want to look at the classics, Freaks by Tod Brovning, the victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, the Immortal Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Golem and the passengers of Ghost Train, you can not compare it, it gives it a bad name, bad acting, bad scenario, etc. The total struc- tures of money and free time, they watched a lot of movies, they were terrible my favorite all the time, I really am without a word, I have no more say that please do not try to look something so stupid, please understand
