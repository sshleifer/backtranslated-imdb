Markiz De Sade, Egypt, ancient gnostic cults, Robert Englund in a double role, free sex and nudity, murder and crime ... on paper Tobe Hopper's Night Terrors sounds like it should be a fun and fun movie. . It's not. It's a trickle of less, incoherent ruins that bring some fun. Basically there is no complication beyond some vague things about the cult that follows the work of De Sade, who for some unclear reason feels the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her. I think that's something with gnostics, but who knows what the writers thought. The biggest part of the film is a messy mess because the heroine is exposed to various wonders, dream sequences and erotic encounters, intertwined with England's scenes as a captured De Sade in the 19th century that chewed the landscape. It seems that the producers were trying something seriously, but whatever their pretensions were, they were buried in nonsense, bad acting, stupidity, and a false head. No too good points. Robert Englund is fun to watch, and as always the main actress, Zoe Trilling, although not very talented, is also attractive in various stages of filming, but watching Night Terrors is a job. At least I looked at the film from "When You Are a Criminal Like Me" in the Australian Guide to Evaluating Certified Movies that was on the front of so many VHS cassettes from the nineties.
