I had a video about it. And I think that was my fourth attempt to succeed in watching the whole movie without sleep. It is a slow motion, and the idea of ​​a Central Atlantic platform, which at that time may have been revolutionary, is now only a large, large jar. Apart from Conrad Veidt, the rest of the actors are quite forgetful, and things are really interesting only in action until the end. When the water started to leak, it even awakened me on one occasion. But let the man pay off. No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt. He does not twist it between indexes and middle fingers like lower mortals. He holds it in his fingers while the old pearly brown shows us. There are several scenes in this film in which smoke reaches the sky on a dark background and looks very artistic. But he does not talk much about this movie if all of this impresses with tobacco smoke.
