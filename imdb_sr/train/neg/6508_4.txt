This is the kidnapping of the old Frankenstein premise. A distinguished scientist was killed in a strange accident, and his father, a well-known brain surgeon, saves the brain. Then it is placed in the robotic body of its own design. His brother, an electric genius, gives the 'wheel' an incentive for moving the thought into motion. The whole project goes bad, when creation becomes dangerous. Special effects are underdeveloped. Scenario is missing. And it's funny that this is not a bit scary. Well, very young children will think it's good. If you're awake at three in the morning and this happens ... night, night. The main characters are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrei and Ross Martin. Ed Wolf played Colos.
