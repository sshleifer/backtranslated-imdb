Whoever thought it was a good idea for a movie TO A FEW Home Alone should look at the head ... The same plot, a different kid, more villains (which leads to more endless nonsense in traps). The other two films were bad enough, and that's where the bottom appears. People can watch other complicated films as they are all identical.
