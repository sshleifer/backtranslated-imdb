I was shocked with the funny incredible plot of Tigerland. It was a liberal fantasy about how the army should be. The dialogue was hard to swallow along with stupid things that allowed Colin Farrell to extract his superiors. I kept thinking, "Hey, there is a reason why the training camp is difficult." He should have conditioned soldiers to fight and turn them into a cohesive unit. "" There is no place for self-confident attitudes and people who do not follow orders I cheered that Bozz kicked his ass in the ass because he was dangerous for his soldiers. I would not want to fight someone like him in the war because he was more concerned with people's feelings than for what was necessary to protect his unit. - <br /> - <br /> <br />
