I absolutely love the 'Tokic Avenger' series, but this poor offer from people from Trom did not make any sense, and that kept me constantly. One nuclear power plant that is leaking (and growing) along the grass) young people from the Tromwell High are crazed, prompting them to join gangs, have sex, explode and whatever. There is also some type of monster in high school ... my God, this movie is a mess. The actors have pretty much stopped their efforts after this and should. (Intentional) exaggeration has begun to go on my nerves in about 5 minutes ... Disappointingly. 2/10.
