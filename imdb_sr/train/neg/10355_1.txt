I love this book since my fifth grade teacher read our class years ago. I read it to each of my 3rd and 5th grades in the past 18 years of teaching. Apparently, the film was made in the past, but I never managed to find it. Well, my students and I were so excited when we heard that Disnei brought Madeline L'Engle's excellent book on the screen. As I watched the movie, I had the most hope. As the film continued, I became increasingly desperate. They did it badly! I've never been so downplayed by the favorite adaptation of a book on a movie. I understand that movies can not strictly stick to books, but they do not have to change things for that! Most, if not all, leaving the book were completely unnecessary! First I kept my mind on myself and I just listened to how my students are discussing the film. Well, I'm not just me. Almost every one of them felt the same way - he was cheating on the great story Madeline L'Engle created so skillfully! Why, they wondered if Aunt Beast looked like Cubak from a movie about the wars of the stars? Why was Calvin's hair not red? Why did a lady who did not have a real "artificial" outfit that was such a smart game on her behalf? Basically, we all wondered why almost every detail has to be changed? I've always dreamed that this movie could be wonderful. I'm still waiting for that movie. This was "Borrow in Time" only in the broadest sense. I'll write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take over the assignment!
