Of the ten actors who featured Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Love seemed to be the most distinctive, but in this scenario, the audience is far ahead of the famous detective. After all, when the jockey, Douglas Volton, stares starkly into the universe, apparently hypnotized, and says something like: "I have to ride and be killed," I felt stupid that nobody picked him up after he was killed. The police thought it was a suicide because he said they would do it! After the slanderous horse is owned by Gene Lockhart killed and killed, Frieda Inescort is doing the same, saying she goes out to be killed and then fatally jumps off the bus. I laughed when Love finally shouted "I got it", as if it was a revelation. However, the culprit was cleverly hidden and there was considerable uncertainty when that party began to hypnotize Love to make him jump from the roof.
