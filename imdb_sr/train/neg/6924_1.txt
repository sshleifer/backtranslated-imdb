If this film was worse, it would be directed by Uwe Boll. This silly mess makes Ed Vood look like Hitchcock. It's been a long time since I saw this pile of mating, but I remember I wanted to make serious injuries to all participants. As anyone can give this film more than 1 star, it amazes me with the kindness of all those who watched this bite. I give him one star because he has no lower rating. All copies of this film should be burned to the ground by salt and stored as a landfill for the most toxic waste. No, one copy should be kept under ultra high security and shown only to film makers as an example of how it should not work.
