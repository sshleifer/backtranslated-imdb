This movie is not funny. It's not fun. It does not contain any one second of originality or intelligence, nor does it tell you to take the least interest in characters or situations. In addition, there is a film about minors as something that has been remembered lately. It's as if a group of 14 or 15 years old high school students who never met or had any kind of relationship with a real girl sat down and wrote a movie based on their wrong fantasies about how to be an adult man. . This film is boring, disgusting, and sometimes abusive and disgusting. Most of all, it contains one or two moments for which you laugh. It also seems to be twice as long as 85 minutes.
