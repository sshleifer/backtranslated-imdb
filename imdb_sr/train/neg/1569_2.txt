A bad plot, an incredible car breakdown and helpless stupid characters. At first I thought that this film was born in the seventies, since the quality of the image, as well as the story and drama, was taken from the old episode of Kojac. When I checked and discovered that it was actually made -97 I was stunned. This is by far one of the worst and smallest (thriller) movies I've ever seen. If you read this, consult if you see that you are wasting your time when you could make something more exciting, as if looking at dry color.
