This is certainly one of the barest movies ever made - even for Fellini. The only one more bizarre is his SATIRICON. This is a two-and-a-half hour of rioting through the weird night gloomy world of decadence, abundance and sexual challenges. Sutherland makes unusually incalculable Casanova and strange events in a series of unconnected vignettes taken from the autobiography of a great lover, failing to include the viewer. Artistic design and bone design are nevertheless EXCELLENT. The academy did not miss or appoint a former, but she did justice to rewarding OSCAR for the latter. Also nominated (unusual) was an incoherent, pointless and almost invisible scenario. Imagine!! The video on the video takes only 150 minutes, 16 minutes less than the original time. This viewer was grateful.
