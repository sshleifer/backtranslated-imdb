I did not see this, and I do not plan to watch this movie or any other that involves Lindsay ...... unless, even while "poor little rich man" does not correct his life for a period of 2 years, starting with her most recent arrest in July 2007. In fact, I do not know anyone who went to see ANY of Lindsay's recent films. I'd rather imagine that 2007 will be the highlight of the high water in her career in the film until she cleans her act. All recent commercials have only hindered her career in making films, if she has any further tendencies to make more movies. Now Lindsay will probably have to go for auditions and really compete for any role. Her reputation is currently "poisonous" and quite possibly could have a negative effect on the sale of tickets to any film in which she is located. Sooooo .... now Lindsay will have to deal with "would not be wanted" ... will he be able to deal with it? I wonder, will even Jai Leno want Lindsay to return to TV show? <br /> <br All quoted is just my OPINION. I do not have information inside.
