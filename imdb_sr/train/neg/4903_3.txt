I'm never a big fan of film production in Taiwan, unlike Korean, Hong Kong or even China. A powerful acting characteristic can hardly be found in them as clearly shown in this film. I do not consider myself an audience that is hard to please because I am, actually, a fan of indie movies. However, this film shows a weak action and a slow pace. I found myself lost in the middle of a plot. The act certainly does not do better. The feminine acting is the same as "acting excessively", trying to be lively and cute. Although I must admit that it is a pleasure to watch. Isabella Leong, on the other hand, plays a more appropriate role as a confused, sad, sad, extremely reserved character. All in all, I think this film is a disappointment.
