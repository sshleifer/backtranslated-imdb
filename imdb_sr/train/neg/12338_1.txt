I saw this movie initially in the theater, when I was 10 years old. Even at that time, "humor" was slightly offensive to my adolescent intelligence. or jeff Goldblum I would be jerking around and I started to feel very uncomfortable, and even a bit sad. As long as I did not recall the existence of this film today, I was not sure why I felt so. Apparently I blocked the memory of this film, but my negative feelings towards the two perpetrators have remained. Obviously I forgot that I saw this film, but I subconsciously mourned the parts of my soul that were stolen, not EATEN from the creator of this inhuman work. I was not brave enough to watch him as an adult. I suppose, as part of the process of healing, I should probably look at confronting this fear of childhood, so that I really can put it behind. Some regression therapy and / or hypnosis may not be a bad idea.
