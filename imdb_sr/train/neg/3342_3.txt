I did not expect much from the film by director Sidney J. Furia and starring Dolph Lundgren, but I certainly expected more than that. A user's comment on a single liner - an action movie of the second gear - did not seem too bad for Lundgren. On the other hand, I would not try to watch this movie if its rating was below 5.0, but hey, the film had 5.9 out of 10 results, which seemed pretty acceptable for this kind of production. Now I understand that 37.5% of people who rated this film 10 (excellent) obviously advertising stunt because DETENTION is regularly garbage Nu Image you've seen earlier, over and over again. <br /> <br> Lundgren does not assure that the former army turned history teachers into coarse school. His acting is simply horrible, insensitive and fictitious. Lundgren's inability to behave becomes more visible in scenes with juvenile delinquents. Either great actors or, in comparison with Lundgren, look great actors - just because they look natural and convincing. DETENTION has some elements that could be interesting for this low-budget movie - closed - for high school high security for the weekend, four teenagers in detention with a war veteran teacher and a group of merciless criminals who are trying to get in - But the story (something like the DIE HARD BREAKFAST CLUB, or is it PANIC ROOM?) is full of incredible situations, lots of cliches and stereotypical characters. And let's not forget that Dolph Lundgren is the lead actor. Alek Karzis and Kata Dobo play the love couple Bonnie and Clide and deliver the most impressive performances in the film, even if it seems to be a low-budget version of Sam Rockwell and she, Milla Jovovich vanna-be. In a film in which everything fails, their craziness and style have provided enough fresh air to prevent my interest falling to a zero point.
