We bought this movie from the Poundland store. We searched for more inspiration, because we previously bought the movie No Big Deal, which was processing it. We expected this film to be very inspiring, so we can process it and put it on the tube. Still, this was shocking. BORING is the main thing that comes to my mind. Bad effects and scripts are not enough to watch it. It seems that the main female body was thrown at appropriate moments in a pathetic attempt to interest the viewer. However, you are just wondering, did they blow up the budget to get rid of it? If so, I would ask for a refund! It looks like a home movie, the recordings do not even match with each other, and the camera work is so amateur to make our processing of bad films professional. I can not believe this is sold as a product that can be sold. It is ONLY LIABLE AND ANGLE to watch. Actors are bad and there is no professionalism about it. There are no words to describe how terrible it is.
