This movie is not very good. Actually, it's the worst Elvis movie I've ever seen. There is very little complication, mostly entertainment, beer and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are lost. I do not know why they did this movie. It might be said that Elvis was futile, he is much, much better in "Follov That Dream".
