If you try to build tension in the movie, it's always a good idea not to build it out of the total boredom point. Unfortunately, Brothers Butchers have not yet figured it out. > This movie is bullshit, unlike most of its characters (if you did not realize that the vampires were in the first few minutes, and the shame is for you), the preference that accumulates an abundant supply of 'no one knows where I am' cheerleaders and homosexual drifters that are convenient and fast food, behind their isolated doors. The only small thing about the originality of originality is how these vampires become vampires in the first but the rest is funny and messy. They are forced to be regularly raised with sticks (unlike roles) because of their tendency to fill the cellar with bloodless corpses, they are not really too bright. If they were to feed their victims, they could start their own small farm of blood and reduce the mortality rate, which would allow them to calm down and get tension. Why manufacturers thought it necessary to introduce incestuous twins and homicidal gai older brother I'm not sure. He added a zero plot, which was unfortunate given that there was not much complication for the start and that he did not have a shock at all. No one was told why parents died, unless it was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks. Obviously, the social worker was informed about the family for some reason, but again, the viewer was asked to write his reason. The only well-rounded character was the youngest brother who appeared as Pugslei from the Adams family. Indeed, he was too rounded, he looked like a child who inadvertently drifted away from the class of heavyweights to a very bad horror movie. Oh heaven, he had. Never mind, dear, take another donut with a delicious blood center.
