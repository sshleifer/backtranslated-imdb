In fact, I went to watch this movie in the theater, but what a complete loss of time and money! Bad acting, I'm sorry I have to say, it did not help me enjoy this pretty sticky scenario. Some friends told me to watch this movie, because James Redfield, the author of the book, is very strongly involved in the script. They really enjoyed the book, so the film had to be perfect. Maybe I was hoping a bit too high, but I absolutely hated this movie! It was predictable, too sweet to the point that I actually went, I had to vomit the worst of all that would be a sequel! Make a world service and stop this repulsive crusade.
