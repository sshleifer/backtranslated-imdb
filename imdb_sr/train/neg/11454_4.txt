So I had a poor expectation for this film to start, but it did not manage to satisfy either. While there were some funny parts, even one or two laughed at loud parts, this film was terribly missing from what I would call good. the funniest jokes were unexpected and very soon ended, leaving us to sit and go "VTF just happened?" In addition, there were several jokes that just dragged on and continued. the part on which he fell down the mountain ripped me. also, editing was really lacking. there were some bad scenes, but it seems to be a style today. It smiled at me, but I would not look at it again, and I'm very glad that I was waiting to rent it. give him a chance, you might enjoy it, but do not think you're in something that's about a 40-year-old virgin, or Superbad.
