The character of Jack Jack, Tim Dingman, "Dreamer" in Envi, finds wealth and success in the idea of ​​aerosol spray "Vapoorize", which, when sprinkled on a dog's balloon, appears to have disappeared into the air. For a moment, I was hoping that Vapoorize was the right product, so I could spray it on this "stinker" movie and make it disappear in the air. Although Envi is not the worst movie I've seen in the past 12 months (this honor goes to a cat in a hat), it gets the honor of a close second. It's not funny, no sad, nothing. Real "Stinkeroo" !!!!! 0.2 out of 10 !!
