From the introductory dialogue and the scenes, I knew that I knew I was on the wreckage of the train. I did not want to watch, but I could not turn around. If there was no better eye of this film, I would give one star. The fact that the interaction between characters and behavior in relations has so far been unexpected, added with a bad direction and a terrible story make this film nothing more than a low-budget disaster. Money definitely is not a necessity to make a good movie. But this movie does not work so horribly that there was no way to recover. If you have been stuck in the forest, your best childhood child is dying of unknown illness, other friends are dying around you, in a strange state. A.) Get away from all and try your happiness on your own. B.) Have sex with a friend. C.) Take a hot bath and relax your grief to turn shaving your legs. D.) Just in the head of his best friend from childhood and life-long falling in love with a spade. E.) All of the above. According to Eli Roth, none of these answers is so far. In fact, everyone is convincing and well represented in cabin fever. A complete lack of reality and an illogical attempt to explain what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film into a garbage can in your local store. Stay away. Stay away.
