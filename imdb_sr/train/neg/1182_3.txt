This film is more than a badly made fetish of pornography, and this tells a lot about the similar shame that was made in that period. This was recommended by my friend as a "unique film experience". He was right. I suppose he meant it as a joke. Not disgusting, not even shocking. Only central acting and bad attempts at shocking art. Little value of the camp, although I do not believe the creators of this film intended this. And yes, as the previous reviewer mentioned, it's sex with a guy in a bear's suit. Do not spend a lot of money on this. Try to borrow it, if you have to see him. Or contact me, I will gladly sell your copy for half a price. Perhaps I will have to see another movie of this director, because it seems to have a certain succession. But if it's something like this, I'll regret that I left for two more hours.
