I wonder if it makes any sense in this film. It's a big joke. Good ... His fun ... You see the dumbest story played very seriously in the form of a movie .. I wonder which audiences this film is basically targeting. ) play a surrogate mommy for the happy Salman / Early couple who want a baby, but I can not. I wonder how it would be that this drama was a real takeoff from the real life of the couple. for her and Salman. She cares for Priet and tries to push her husband Salman to Preiti, so they can have some kind of romance. When the audience will be fed to Salman's nakhras. Although it's a good past, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.
