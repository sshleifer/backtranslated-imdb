Ohhh man! Now I'm talking about it! Regarding bad / raw horror, this film was really in its class. A real gem! First, the film was not originally in English. That's fine, because the voice dubbing was really extraordinary! This is my favorite passage from the dialogue (and there's more to where it came from)? "I feel a little better, I'm just thirsty for your blood!" <br /> <br /> And what a drama! Here's a recapitulation of the interaction between the military and the scientist? Scene 1 ?? Scientist: "Can not you do this? It will be a disaster!" - Military officer: "It's just a science fiction" (then he continues to cause a complete disaster just as the scientist predicted). Scene 2 ?? Scientist: "If you do, many will die!" - Military officer: "You do not know what you're talking about." (he does it and many die). Scena 3 ?? Scientist: "Do not do it? It'll kill everything!" - Military officer: "It's nonsense" (then he continues to kill everyone) Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (get an idea). If this was not enough? there were several scenes that really stood out as an instant classic! In one scene, the army has literally 10 guys who target a weapon in two unarmed men. The leader shouts: "Go for them!" and all 10 guys from the army, one at a time, throwing weapons and fighting two opponents! Instant classic! And do not worry. No attention is devoted to details! This movie even had hip-hop / upbeat '80s music from the keyboard / synthesizer to set the mood! And believe me? I understand that this review could contain some spoilers, but there are so many good things in this episode that I just scratched the surface. The film of this caliber comes out only once in a decade! The real experience of watching movies! Masterpiece! Wow!
