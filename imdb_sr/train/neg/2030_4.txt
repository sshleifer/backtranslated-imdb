Comment "eliz7212-1" hits the proverbial "head on head" for this party program. But this is the joke of seeing William Shatterer's "cavort" and "dance" (yes, "" dancing words are necessary for what Bill does). This show would be a great skit on SNL or MAD TV - and it evaluates several stars for a single view, or so you can see Shatner, who seems to have taken a "camp" to new heights - whether in the role or on himself. But the guy is ridiculous. Girls who are in the cabin spaces with game data scrolls will be pretty happy when this turkey is canceled - unless there is a revival of the whiskey-a-go-go genre, with a resurgent demand for nice young women to play once again in raised cages. I watched the first competitor, who was boring, and literally "dumber than: post," yet through pure luck, he went with a quarter of a mile or so. The second competitor, something more intelligent, but who would be lucky enough to get $ 1,000 for Jeopardy, got a card that requires a response to a special question - which he did not know, and thus left with syllables. This handful of games, which hangs and sometimes rewards large sums for everyday individuals, are certainly cheap efforts, in general, to try to please the viewers. Even if the host is well compensated, and they give six digits in the average episode, I guess income costs can be favorable - since you do not have a sitcom where several stars got six or seven digits, per episode, with some big residual jobs. But I assume that even they will be better over speed. This has already reached this point. I think his offer, especially with James Spader and others at Boston Legal, should have given us a satisfactory offer from Bill Shatner. Again, the above rating is simply suitable for displaying Bill Hoot and pranz, maybe for a while; It should be enough.
