I read in the paper that V.Snipes has been broken so that it is no wonder he would have participated in low-budget projects like The Contractor. Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here he plays in a cheap action movie that was filmed in Bulgaria (we should believe that London's location, as it would only buy a complete moron), is one of 1,000 other films: retired special forces, a good guy is recruited by the government do a wet job - after that the government wants to get rid of it - a good guy gets out after he killed the bad guys (was it a spoiler? guess not!) Star of the movie: the girl (Eliza Bennett) surpasses all the other actors! One star for her plus one star for candy Lena Headei, makes 2 stars. Only for the nasty Snipes fans!
