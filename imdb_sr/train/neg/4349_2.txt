This movie is horrible. Carlitos Vai (1993) is a great movie. Goodgfellas is not just one of the best crime films. This film should be closer to THE STING Part2 or maybe a fast zone. Remember those gems! The only reason this film was made was to use the cultic tracking of the original. This film did not have everything De Palma, Pacino, and Penn did so hard. It was not a sympathetic character, and that's the fault of all those responsible for it. I hope RISE TO POVER wins every RAZZIE, maybe even maybe to invent some new categories to allow it to be a record holder. After watching this S @ * T FEST film, I sat and watched the original Carlitos way to get a bad taste from my mouth. After watching this, I would like Pachanga to come and throw me out of misery.
