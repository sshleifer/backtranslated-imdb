This is for Zatoichi's films, because Star Trek films were in Star Trek - except that in this case each of the originals was more fun and more interesting than this great, great re-work, and better made, if the substance is more important than surface. If I had never seen them, I would think it was nice but empty; Since I had it, I thought his style was inappropriate and his content was insufficient. The idea of ​​reviving character in a larger, slicker production must have sounded good, but there was no purpose in it, except hope for money; It's just a show, which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the world of characters and fails to accept the character somewhere where it has not been (also, the actor was not the best). I was hoping to see Ichy in the late stage of life, in a story that will gracefully see and draw some conclusion from the whole experience; This only rehashes pieces from other films, seasoned with more sex and SFK violence. It's not the same experience at all.
