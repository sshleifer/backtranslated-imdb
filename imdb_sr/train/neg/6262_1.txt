I agree with those reviews I have read here, and I have no say in defining this kind of Turkish like this, but despite everything, I can still find the reason that such films exist. Do you remember those happy days in which the video was a successful business, and made a lot of movies with the only reason to fill out video store shelves? this film comes from that period and I can imagine that it was the only reason it arose, and the same happened to many, many, many other stinkers. Do you remember "Rambo" imitation? and so much Z Slashers?, I still feel nostalgia for that period. I can say about this film that I did not waste my time watching it because I pressed the rewind button in advance for the first fifteen minutes, only to find a very funny scene in which some guy pushed the ax to the heads that exploded because, as you perfectly notice , made of plastic. And around the end, well, it was so badly recorded that I could not understand what happened. It's the same, I did not follow a non-existent plot at all. But the boys, Video-age was a great year in spite of such films.
