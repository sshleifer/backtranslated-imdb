From the star "MITCHELL", from the directors of "DÅ¾ojstik" and "Angel's Revenge" !!! These are tags that would otherwise prevent me from watching this movie. And the worst is that all the above statements are true !!! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker eats all five minutes in this movie. It's like a bad remake of "Coogan's Bluff"
