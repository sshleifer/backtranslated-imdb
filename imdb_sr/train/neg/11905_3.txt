With a tendency to repeat itself, Wenders has been consistently disappointing since it was hit "Paris Texas". The land of abundance is no exception. Taking into account the fact that I was expecting an average mediocre film even before I entered, it appears that venders ambition always get the better of him. Now he's shot because his films are heavy and bombastic. <Br /> <br /> I was not sure if I watch a comedy that mocks Central America or a thriller. The outcome of Diehl's character is completely predictable. Venderovo insistence on layering many scenes with a rock song is also very boring. He covered the holes in his script and directed the jazz scene. <Br /> <br /> I'm sure many people will consider this film important and resonant, but in all honestly, this clumsy and didactic effort just talking is interesting that Wenders said that during the development of "Paris Texas" had a lot of help from Sam Sheppard with the script. Yes, it was the best Vendersov and should realize that he now needs a good screenwriter. His films from the past 15 years + were a total mess.
