This film was bad from the beginning. The only purpose of the film was that Angela wanted to get a high number of bodies. The acting was terrible. The murders were very bad. Like when Allie filled the toilet, I guess she was in a deserted cabin. But when the end of the film comes and Molly and the other guy are in the cabin, you see Allie that Angela has definitely gone for her. The part that really brought me was when the black girl and Angela were in a hut, and Angela took the guitar and jammed it. One was a terrible acting and two why not turn around and hit the bitch?!?!? Then when Molly is persecuted by Angela if you have neighte why not just turn around and stab it ??? So stupid. This film is sucked ...
