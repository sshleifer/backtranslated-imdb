And this is completely in the category of "terribly bad" - ie. Students who were drunk from movies would be hired to get them. I was at the SciFi Film Festival and all I remember is a wave after a wave of hysterical laughter while this film is premiered. Other critics will better describe the fecal nature of this film, and I felt so bad in the poor guy from the production house that appeared, obviously to measure the reaction of the audience. What he got was a sci-fi equivalent to a drunken student audience, and after a "serious" anime movie, I think it was "heavenly blue", the audience was in a dark mood, and then this movie opened in a few seconds everyone in the room rolling around the islands. I will record the worst parts; Script: The funniest and worst part of this movie, kneels along a linear and predictable road, with occasional ill-conceived. Nonsense, but eminently funny. Animation: Badly done, and compiled, if you can submit a gray background and gradually skimpier costumes for heroin (I know I can!), Then watch the installation where the "trasforms" of the Swedish peasants in LADI DEATH! Characters: Therefore, a one-dimensional painful, there is a short play (with lateral lines of dialogue) and a little light shines on the real motivation behind some of the main characters. So, in short, if you have a captive audience and a few drinks lying around (try and check for an alcoholic to alleviate the pain), then insert this film into a DVD and come to the mental circuit of the "mysterious scientific theater 3000 ". There is no other motivation to watch this movie, except to laugh at it, and it's not intended to be a comedy. DO NOT ONLY watch this movie. It might be even more boring to watch a solo from the "New World" with Colin Farrell because you will not be able to laugh at laughing with your friends or two.
