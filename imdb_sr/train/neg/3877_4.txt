I was only the second time to watch "The Unbelievable Man Melting" and was even more boring than when I first watched him. I do not understand why he became so "cult classic" when he was so boring. The introductory scene looks promising, when a fat nurse drops a can of blood and runs for her precious life. After this, everything that really happens is that a melting man moves around some forests and houses, and has his own memories of life as an astronaut. Makeup is pretty good, and its melted rogue face looks pretty real. There is a cool scene in which a man's head is cast into the river, and floats until he gets to the waterfall where he falls on the walls and scatters. Although it does not get much moisture, most scenes are recorded in the dark and you can not really see what's happening. There is not much worse, at least on the Vipco DVD I watched. No, the incredible man who melts is not so good at all. I'll give him marks for the cheese factor, but that's all. If you want a true cult classic, check out The Deadli Spavn!
