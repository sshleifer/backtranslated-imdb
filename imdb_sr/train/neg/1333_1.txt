I was completely disappointed with this film. I read some other reviews and had much higher expectations. I expected a drama with more intense character development. But that never happens in a movie. Daniel-Dai Levis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviewers would like to believe. I thought he was repeating the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. I would rate his performance 6 out of 10. Actress: 6 out of 10 regimes is 5 out of 10. Script is the worst: 2 out of 10. I deleted the movie from my DVR for 70 minutes. in the movie. Much better films than this ...
