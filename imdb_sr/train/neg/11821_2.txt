Encouraged by the positive comments on this film, I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad error. I've seen 950+ movies and this is really one of the worst of them - it's terrible in almost every way: editing, pacing, story, 'acting', soundtrack (the only song of the movie - a chromatic melody of the land - it does not play less than four times ). The movie looks cheap and nasty, and it's boring in the extreme. I was rarely so happy to see the end of the movie. The only thing that prevents me from giving this result is Harvei Keitel - while this is far from his best performance, it seems that he is at least a bit trying. Only for Keitel's obsession.
