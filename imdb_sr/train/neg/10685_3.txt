Predictable, scanty and poorly written. I have been mindlessly thinking that such a prominent person would not be involved, unless it is deserving. I assume that the competition among the players is so intense these days (and will only worsen) that it can no longer be chosen and chosen. Early we got a hint of who was important in the assassination, and since then we have stolen it. The film did not have intrigue, which gave us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder. Some of the discourses, frankly, were unpleasant! It's hard to believe that anyone would think, let alone, commit to spending tens of millions of dollars to make this move.
