The killer, a Cannibal rapist, was killed by a crazy policeman at the scene of his latest assassination. In his tomb, a cult was planned to bring it alive by writing to the grave. This, of course, works, and he wakes up with the exhaustion of the penis, and he returns to his old ways of killing with a new zombie look. Two policemen, a little crazy about the city and having a problem with drugs, are returning to the case. Two of the original members of the cult are also trying to stop the killer by resurrecting another kind of dead thing. Thinking that they were being left, but from the grave comes a plastic doll for babies that was used in the original resurrection. It sounds a bit confusing, but not just garbage. The acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy who plays Dr. Vincent van Gore in the faces of the up series and he's just as terrible. as a boring cop in this movie. Another policeman is struggling to pull out his terrible lines. Now I'm on a budget with a low budget, but this film is horrible. If it was not very easy on the eye and their nudity, I would probably fall asleep. It's a little bit worse, but it's never more than some of the animals put on the stomach of the victims. Zombie makeup on the other hand looks great, and his long-legged penis, used to rape his victims, is sometimes ridiculous. There's also a half decent scene in which the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll with the voice of squirrels is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a movie. It's just a plastic toy on a fishing line. The end is extremely bad. He would expect the killer to put a lot more fight than him. God knows how they earned enough money to continue. 4/10
