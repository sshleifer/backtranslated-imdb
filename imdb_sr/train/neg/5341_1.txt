Filled with fine actors, I expected much more than "Deceiver" than it was shipped. The plot is extremely fictitious and manipulative. Many memories only contribute to confusion. The credibility flies through the window and ends with becoming unbearable and completely ridiculous. I would strongly advise anyone who loves their movie actions to be based on something that at least can be avoided by "Deceiver" because you will be very frustrated. Perhaps I am not strong enough to get it, but my suspicion is that many others were completely confused by the story and in particular the ending. The blurring of the boundary between reality and lies simply does not work because the whole movie made no sense. - MERK
