The Omega Code was a model of cinematographic inconsistency. There was little (but precious little) good acting, primarily by two prophets and Rostenberga, who appeared only once and did not have lines. Otherwise, the acting was very bad. The plot line was rather weak and only partly based on a questionable biblical interpretation. Certainly not one of the best years.
