Basically, "Caprica" ​​is a story of Cilone origin. The premise of the performance is interesting. However, writers follow so many stories and clutter it with too many POV characters that hold back the storytelling. The action moves at glacial speeds and disperses what kind of tension it might have. In any episode, little or nothing is happening. Daniel Graistone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor who works on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip. Unfortunately, his only working prototype runs the AI ​​version of his dead daughter Zoe, who died in a suicide bombing caused by the soldiers of One (STO), an underground monotheistic extremist group. Joseph Adam (father of the Commander of Battlestar Galactica Adam) is trying to keep his family while searching for the AI ​​version of his daughter (who also died in the bombing) in the Macchiavellian virtual version of Caprice (which resembles the 1930 Chicago) . Apart from emptying writing, Caprica suffers from a similar problem as many of the stories of origin. We already know how this ends (ie, the Cilonci develop their own civilization and fight against humanity).
