I am a great fan of the 1930s and I'll watch everything I see on Turner Classic Movies, which is new to me. So I gave this video, after all that big Harold Lloyd competing with Chaplin as a great comedian of a silent film. I watched much less Lloyd's silent films then from Chaplin's, but I must say that I am a much larger fan of Chaplin. In any case, this film has fallen so flat that I have not finished it. I can understand why his sound career was so limited that he did not get very good material for work. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbot and Costella, The Three Stooges, Martina and Levis, The Mark Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy, you're boxing a bribe (or violence as a whole), this one is very forgetful. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou how I really enjoyed him in the Paths Of Glory, but his role here did not do anything special to me. Maybe they should have entered boxing earlier because at least half of the movie (at least it seemed to be so) before getting in the ring. I can say that there are many Lloyd fans here and this will not be a popular review, but I have to evaluate this in comparison to what was there at that time, 4 out of 10. I love old movies because they may not be looking at another movie, very flat. For an alternative to anyone who really likes or wants commonly known comedies, I recommend "Kelli The Second" made a few years earlier, others no longer become a boxing comedy with Patsy Kelli and the supporting role of Charles Chase. Both are shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.
