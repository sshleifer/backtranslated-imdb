Well, it can be very short. This is a wrongly balanced, unconvincing movie that could be a bit better. It seems the script does not know which way to go ... from the funny to the seriously serious ... it's a bit stupid. That plus too many sentences we heard before "the hacker is in Florida, or not, he's in Madrid, he's not in ..., he screws up the signal." 4 of 10
