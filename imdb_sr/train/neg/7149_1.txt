Whoever wrote "Redline" as a big movie about a car, Daniel Sadek must pay it out to promote this ultra-shy blazing bunch of amateur shit. Simply the worst automobile movie or any movie ever made. This makes Shovgirls look like Citizen Kane. Take every hearty clich√© from the 80s TV series, put some really shattered special effects and lame characters without any relevance and you have a living proof that Daniel Sadek should not write scenarios and produce movies, but you should to stay in business with real estate. This is such a poor film with such a miserable plot and the most unusual action footage ever. What hates me is not that the creators of this movie are idiots, but think that the movie will become an audience that is enough idiots to embark on this shit.
