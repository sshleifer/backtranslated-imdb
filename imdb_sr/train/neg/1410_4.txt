The still-famous but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) did not record for four years. When invited to take part in a new project, he was struggling with the clumsy rook of the director to leave him in a poor Latin neighborhood in Carlson to investigate the work of a small supermarket manager. He sees the beautiful Spanish cashier Scarlett (Paz Vega) and attracts her with his ability. His driver never returns to capture him, and Scarlet takes him to the actor. But first, she has an interview for the secretary's job in the construction company and the actor helps her prepare; Then spend a pleasant time together. I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, meaningless "10 items or less" is absolutely disappointing. It seems that this low-budget movie has no story, and is supported by chemistry and improvisations by Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega, and in fact nothing happens in 82 minutes. The ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous, as Morgan Freeman returns to his silver spoon world and tells a simple worker that he will never see again. Was he afraid of having a love affair with her and destroying his perfect world with his family? Or has a clash of classes occurred, and he realizes that his noble neighborhood would not be adequately a regular worker in the lower classes? My voice is four. Title (Brazil): "Mind Astro Em Minh Vida" ("The Star in My Life")
