Although casting for this film was wonderful, especially Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, the quality of writing was so bad that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this movie worth watching. My wife and I decided that the reason we watched the whole movie was that it was like a wreck of the train and it was almost impossible to deter. Perhaps we "hoped" that the message would finally become apparent, and that we would be able to extract some meaning from this effort. Unfortunately, this did not happen. Of course, the audience could "grasp" this tangled story, thanks to the genius of the human brain to come up with an absurdity. The writers, however, Nothing has made this innate need easier for us to find meaning. It was obvious that those who were involved were simply going through the movements of their crafts, and that every essential passion for the characters or story was either secondary or non-existent. Unfortunately, movies made for television seemed to have been transmitted over the years. While conveying a message to the audience may have been the primary interest of writers in the past, today's writers and producers seem lenient to their audience, concentrating primarily on manipulating us to "stay in the tunnel" through continuous advertising that appears just because movies were made such as Surrender, Dorothy.
