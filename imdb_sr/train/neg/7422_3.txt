Well, I could get into the plot, but that might be just me. The camera's reckless movements from time to time, however, this film has a charming vintage quality. The acting is sometimes sincere and fun with the occasional order of the robbery where the scarcely dressed ladies are located, which was nice. The highlight is confused and unconnected, but still ... a mistake icing, but Stella Stevens. Stops are interesting, especially since the 70s in Las Vegas. In the end there are several trembling handheld cameras, which are speculated for a moment. But I do not think I'm gonna catch a DVD yet.
