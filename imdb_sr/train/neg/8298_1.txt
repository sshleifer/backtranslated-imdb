This film was not really fun, certainly NO VHERE as original or good as a Christmas story. Characters (except the youngest) try to mimic the previous actors, and they are decaying. Village peasants are out of nowhere because they were not part of the first movie. This is really exhausted, maybe it was good with the original acting, then again perhaps not because the story is so weak. Skip.
