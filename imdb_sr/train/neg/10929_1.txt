This film was still the most beautiful Mormon film. That made RM & Sons of Provo look like well-made films! It should have been ridiculous of what I was told. The best part was the best actor in the movie - Travis Eberhard - if he was not in the movie he would probably not have been made! He ruled! 10. It was not funny 9. It was 8. There was Thurl Big T Bailey, whose character did not make sense 7. He was made in Provo 6. He did not laugh Brokeback 5. He had Larry H. Miller at 4. It was the first movie Clint Howard was not ridiculous at 3. Garry Coleman chose the perfect movie 4 back 2. They should have acted in Surreal Life 1. It was made by Halestorm Entertainment !!
