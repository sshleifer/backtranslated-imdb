while one of the "stars" of this film does not necessarily give me insight into the sages, I know a lot about what was first ... and what ended up on the screen. I remember seeing the original cut of the "incoming freshman" and I was very pleased. It was funny, sexy, rude, all the main requirements for a drive-in movie. you must remember that this was shot and released before all the other ... houses of animals, porks, etc. ... so that in this way this film was in front of its time. For any reason, the film was assigned to the main distributors who edited half the original movie, and then arranged in (should I say "mix?") the most challenging scene ever. fat boy, people with goat's head .... what the hell is all about ?! I am sure that it was added to the additional T & A, but it was so slow, that it caused something that was happening before it started to creep up to squeak and painful stagnation. but all in all, it's fun memory for me ... especially in that I can say that the worst movie I've ever seen ... I'm in!
