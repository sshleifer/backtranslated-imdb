Probably one of the hottest movies ever bad, poorly written and poorly written. COUNTRY Five students who stay during the holidays close the bedroom, but someone has a design on them and begins to kill them. After one, the main suspect is the creepy guard John Hemmitt played by Voodi Roll, or it could be one of five characters. ACTIVATING Not so bad that it's not that big, except Daphne Zungia who dies like that. too fast and she should have been the main heroine, and the rest is quite boring even though Laura Lapinski's main character sometimes has her charm and in the end you are sorry for her. MURDERS can not really see why they forbid this, the killings look fake, one guy has a cut in half at the beginning, which looks really fake, but the rest are pretty nasty as one girl gets a car over the head , one girl gets her head on a car cooked alive, and the other burns alive. TOTAL Not exactly slasher cage I was much better
