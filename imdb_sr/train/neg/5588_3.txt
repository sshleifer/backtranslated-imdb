This is an attempt by both authors, Edgar Rice Burroughs and film authors, in the Arabian "Tarzan Monkey". However, this desert film does not show anything of the magnificence present in Burroughs's more successful adventure of the jungle. The focus is on love between the handsome English noble Jon Hall (like El Chan Lion Chatham) and exotic Arab beauty Kathleen Burke (like Princess Eulilah) with a vengeance that matches their need for a merger. At the opening, it is stated that although the fault is inappropriate for the behavior, the mother has a mother - but she never enters the picture. Unfortunately, "The Lion Man" worsened and seems to be missing a video. <br /> <br /> *** Lion Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
