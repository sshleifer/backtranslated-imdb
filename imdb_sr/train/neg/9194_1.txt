Okay, first of all, I'm a big zombie movie fan. I loved all Romer's movements and fully enjoyed the re-creation of Dawn of the Dead. So, when I heard every critic who was following this film, I was an optimist. I mean, critics hated Resident Evil, and although that may not be a particularly good movie, I enjoyed it if not because of the fact that it was just a fun zombie shot with half decent plot. This, however, is pure shit. In the film are inserted horrible dialogue, semi-complicating plot and video game scenes. Who in the right mind thought it was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the term freely) I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnov as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name casts originality through the window, in his performance you can see that he knows that he is in a terrible film and that he could best use it. Everyone behaves like Shakespeare's. And I can add very badly. Basically, the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you are. See it with your friends and be ready for many unintended laughter. <br /> <br />
