It looks like it's a bit on the middle path to take care of Rhine. Or he loves himself, greeting his sincerity, the liberal point of view and fine acting, or he despises his obvious propaganda, central dialogue, cardboard characters and overall tendency. In this second category I am very much, and I found a film and a play, - in connection with the activities of European refugees in Washington during the war - crushing bored, worth mainly for acting, and even then only occasionally. That author Lillian Hellman was on the side of the angel irrelevant. Her plays were written for people who divided her attitude and rarely explored ideas that the author and the audience did not already have, except to point out how "the other side" is terrible. Even when I find myself in a hundred-fold agreement with what she has to say, like in Rhine, I still can not stand the way she says it. Her characters are unreal, and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain possibility for the way people talk, she does not have real glow or originality. She really has nothing new to say. I completely agree with the long-term dismantling of Hellman reputation that the deceased Marie McCarthy made several years ago. For those who think the theater is dead or in extremes and crave for good old times, I invite you to watch the Vatch On the Rhine, equally as bad as the Angels in America, which only shows that the theater had one leg in the grave 60 years ago years.
