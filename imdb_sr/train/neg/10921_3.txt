I often watch watching bad films, and original movies from science-fiction channels are one of the best sources for these movies that you can find. As such, I'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when I saw Sands forgetting. The acting was an unusual sub-pair, as opposed to the desperately shameful screenplay of the sci-fi that is usually ready for us. There are several stories that were made by people you would most likely recognize, although you may not know their names by heart. The special effects of CGI are minimal, and as such, one of the greatest sources of comedy in the science-fiction function is missing. Of course, there are some funny moments like when a guy breaks a bulldozer, or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save the girl he knows a few days, but all in all, it ends up just not rolling on the floor with a laugh, and I I think it's a big disappointment. If I rated him on a 10-star scale that was made to judge TV footage, I would probably give it 4, maybe even 5. The real shame I might have to wait for next sci-fi original movie in order to make a good laugh, and I really hope that this film is not part of some overall increase in quality in sci - original movies.
