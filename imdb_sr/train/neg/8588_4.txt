The revenge of Sith begins with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting and then becomes really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and stupid machinations that tortured the rest of the series. The only thing that improves the procedure is slow - and I think slow - building up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when it finally comes, everything is fine. It's not big. Not even good. But pretty good. This film is greatly praised because it does not fall into the sky as the previous sequels. Instead, it's just bleak, boring and routine. But you must say, wow, that CGI environment is really impressive from time to time. Is the quarrel with the light? They are all messy. I think the dark side caught Lucas when he started these pre-cakes and nobody noticed. This will make a lot of money, but thank God for completing this once-honored franchise has been beaten enough. I saw the show at 12:01, and after that I heard a group of very young children who said it was great! But everybody older than eight years all muttered the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was boring. I just thought it was better to see the birth of Darth Vader. That's what we all said.
