Camera Operation - Why does the camera work in this movie so nervous? This is boring and confusing. Editing - flash photos were too short. Many other scenes were also too short. It just blinks. Sound - background music was too loud and covered the voices. It should not be rolled back and repeated to catch what was said. Does not anyone check these things and makes them do it again. In the future, reduce the volume of background music. Is the adjustment of the relative sound level editorial work, Julie Vong? The action had an excessive amount of free ends. The basic story had the potential. I think the film took more work. Did it hurry? Maybe they were running out of money. Like many films, it started to be great, but it just cares about it. I really do not understand this, you know that you have a storyboard before it comes into production, so why not all the adverse effects in the screen of the script are created. I'm sorry I'm so critical.
