1914 was an incredible year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in films and appeared in more than 30 films! Although most of these films were not particularly good, they gave him a chance to slowly evolve his person on the screen. However, with this film, the famous character "Little Tramp" was still in development. Charlie looked the same way, but his character still lacked the sweetness and competence he later developed. Instead, Chaplin often hit, shot or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason. As for this very small movie, it's interesting to watch for actors. Although they do not know them today, Chaplin plays together with Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Svain - all of the most popular stars from Keystone Films. The problem with this movie is that, although there are some nice scenes, the shop looks very vague and improperly developed. Chester and Mabel arrived on the track (a very common topic in Keistone productions - it must have been located near the track). Charlie and Mack appear and sneeze. Mack is being persecuted by police because Charlie beat Chester and steal his girlfriend. Ultimately, for no apparent reason, the cops took Chester and Mack - leaving Charlie with Mabel (which, strangely, did not seem disgusting to Charlie's insidiousness). A huge silent comedy or film historian, this is a film that is not forgotten and which is important only in the evolution of Caplin. What he and other actors really do on stage, although not unusual for Keystone, is not particularly funny when seen today.
