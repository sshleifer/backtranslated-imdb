The film begins with a beautiful song It looks like a thriller, and Arbaaz Khan is walking around in a suspicious way, but then suddenly we are forced to comedy With routine stupid idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal act as adult children Their scenes are the first funny, and then boring. There's a boring plot of Tanushree's brother who was killed. By the end, the film is trying to become serious with the villain who kidnaps our heroes, but it's even stupid here. HERA PHERI and wait, there's a long haul in Paial's house. The movie is so boring to fall asleep. The direction is very bad music (Pritam) is a routine other than the first song The cinema is bad, the movie has a cheap look in the whole. Rajpal Yadav is good at his first scene where he goes to pay rent and I was happy that the actor is not loud and on top like other movies But no, He becomes his usual self and irritates most of the time Tusshar should not speak in the movie, his delivery is terrible Sharman is saving Lacki grace, He is the only actor who behaves very well in this film. comics as an adult, but does not impress much Tanushree is as bad as ever Arbaaz Khan is becoming smaller and more common Paial is not an actress Murley Sharma is horrible
