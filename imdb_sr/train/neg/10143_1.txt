FLIGHT OF FURI takes on the role of the worst Steven Seagal film I have ever seen ... So far. It's terribly bored without any action scenes of any interest, Seagal is not really trying on it - he's fat and his voice is once again called. The co-stars have nothing better, because they are quite burdened with third grades. Keusch's direction is very poor and is not surprising that he is responsible for a few more Seagal stinkers (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE) Scenario Co-writer Seagal is self-confident. According to IMDb $ 12M was spent on this boring old tosh burden - If these figures are correct, I feel a great tax gusle like no one has spent it. LETO FURI is actually a remake of the Michael Dudikoff flick BLACK THUNDER - which must be better than this tripe. It has no redeemable quality, Give it MISS! 1/2 * from *****
