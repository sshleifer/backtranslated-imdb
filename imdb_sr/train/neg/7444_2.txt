If you are not petrified by the Russian people or the boar, this movie is a snobbest. In fact, I fell asleep about 40 minutes and I had to fight against the urge to simply leave the theater. I wish I had it. Losing the perfect Saturday night. Even "Silent Hill" was more terrible. Even Pan's Labirinth was more scary. I am still unclear about what should have been scary in this movie. To begin with, I am very suspicious of films that use "pidgin Russian" as this did in the opening credits. I'm ashamed because I brought a group of my Russian friends and we all squeezed. Oh my God. Hmm. Well, fortunately for me (and probably you) this movie has already avoided my brain and I just got out of it an hour ago. So I have no specificity, only blurry images that do not go anywhere and hope that anything will happen. Perhaps I have seen a completely mutilated version of this movie because I can not believe I got such a great criticism (which is why I saw it) and ended up so completely devoid of Horror or Suspense as well as overall fun values. I give him 2 because, yes, I fell asleep and I wanted to leave after 40 minutes, but I woke up and I did not leave.
