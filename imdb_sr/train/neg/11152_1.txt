Why watch this movie, if you have great movies. It's a total waste of time and money. The film is so bad that I felt bad that I wanted to watch it. Everything in it is bad. The actors were bad. The script was really bad. The story is stupid. And the worst CGI EVER. The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club. One interesting thing is that there is a character that we want him to die, because he is so stupid to be saturated. /> NOTE: If you want to see a good movie, this movie is not the right choice. 0-Stars of 10
