What is this? That's one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. I do not understand why people on this site love him so much. Its meaningless and naked for no reason. His worst Resident Evil then. I do not recommend it unless you want to watch chess, bad acting. Watch real horror movies such as Stephen King's, The Shining, Jurassic Park (some kind of horror), JAVS, etc. It's bad like Crudi vs Gaison. The attack of killing tomatoes is better than this shit. Oh wow meat eats zombies. How many damn teeth movies we need. Skip this. <br /> <br /> * outta ****
