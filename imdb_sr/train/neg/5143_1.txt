Even if 99.99% of people watching this movie are Brazilian, I will keep pace with English because it is the language of this website. This film is a piece of cr. The worst act I've seen for a long time. The children are terrible. Especially a boy. This was the first time I saw anyone with lesser facial expressions than Arnold Schwarzenegger, and a single tone of voice, as a 5 year old kid reading in front of the class. How can someone so bad be the main actor of the film? The story is so shallow that my daughter could have been better (she is 3 years old). It's so simple it can be written in a napkin and apologized in 3 minutes. There are only three possibilities for someone to enjoy in this movie: 1) You are pre-teen; 2) Globo's nonsense is so brainwashed to think that everything that has the Globo seal is terrible; 3) you have severe brain damage. Avoid at all costs! Shame on the Brazilian film scene.
