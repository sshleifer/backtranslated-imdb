Although I watched "Gimkata" on the theater back in the '85, I could not think of anything, except for the unclear images of Kurt Thomas to run and fight in the background of stone walls and disappointment around the end. > After I read some other reviews, I picked up a copy of the recently released DVD to re-enter the Gimkata world. It turned out that this is one of those films that were made during the 1980s, which would go directly to the video today. The movie starring Kurt Thomas, a gymnast, champion Jonathan Cabot, recruited the sky to infiltrate the Parmistana nation to enter and hope to win the "The Game", a suicidal bloodsuck sponsored by Khan who encourages his people to yell sounding like " Strong power. " The goal of the mission is the Star Wars system of defense. Jonathana trains in the martial arts of Princess Rubali, who never speaks or leaves the house. Once dressed, he tries to fit in with the local people wearing a bright red sweater with blue and white lines. Needless to say, Cabot fights and fights for his life on the stone streets of Parmistan, on his way to a meeting with a fate and a game. Clouse, who seems to have never been on the set. The so-called script is only this side of the incompetent. See other reviews for many vikers. The city of the lunar has a few good moments, but it is eventually destroyed by poor montage. Place ... meh. There is still a good action adventure call here. The Hong Kong version with higher action and faster pace can be pretty good.
