This film is a weird nonsense movie set up in Japan about a dysfunctional family that ends up with a weird violent guest who just leans and watches four family members in the worst case. Nothing is sacred in this film, with sexual drugs and violence that go through that border. I'm surprised he passed the censor. All in all, I think it will attract only those who should not be encouraging, and not any suspicious messages for us to be considered by others. A film that fosters the worst elements in society and in any case is the ultimate dissolution ... Disappointment from a man who made sublime films dead or alive and auditions.
