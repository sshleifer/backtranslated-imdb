This was a weird film about low life in New York and orientation around the main character (title starring Brad Pitt) who thinks he is a musician of the type Ricki Nelson, except that he does not have a real talent. It's very fun to watch until a profane New York woman with a terrible accent does not get into the picture and take it. It destroyed my film. It must have been Katherine Kiner, who usually plays fierce women. Pitfalls on Pitt - exaggerated Pompadour - was fun to watch. I can imagine that Johnny Depp better played this role. One last remark: it is strange to hear a film made in 1992 (except Voodie) with only mono sound.
