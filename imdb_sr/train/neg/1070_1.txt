I've seen some bad films (Austin Povers - Spi Vho Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this film is so horrible, so boring, I walked halfway and I could not stand watching the rest. A pity. Praising talents such as Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz, and Robert Duvall and telling John Grisham what went wrong? Branagh is a great lawyer who has one night with Davitz. Her father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hangs his cat, etc., etc., so that Branagh sent him into a madman, and he immediately escaped. Somehow (I could not figure out how) Robert Dovei jr, Daril Hannah, Famke Janssen, and Tom Berenger are involved in a story that moves slower than stationary. I wanted to love this, and as a great fan of the Grisham, I read everything about this film and (a fool) I expected something interesting. This is the best BEST movie I've ever seen and I want my money back. * from the *****.
