I finally got "Starlight" last night on television and all I can say is. . . vov! It's hard to know where to start - unbelievably powerful special effects (check the laser beams that fire from Villie's eyes!), Awesome action, heavy dialogue, unadjusted use of stock footage, or the air of serious pretentiousness that entails the entire production. This is a truly unique experience and we should all be grateful for it. I nominate Jonathon Kaia as the real successor of Ed Vood!
