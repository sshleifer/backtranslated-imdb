"40-year-old Virgin" exists in a world that I do not understand. The world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to "go" and broadcast videos of his naked donkey in the store and not to be reminded. A world where it's really ridiculous to drive in a drunken state and break into cars of other people. A world that seems to be a good boss to sexually harass his subordinates. The world is full of angry and insulting stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And the world without fun jokes! I'm totally shocked by the seemingly horror of the viewers who loved this movie. I thought every scene was a bad sketch for Saturdai Night Live - not so funny to start, and extended beyond any rational thought. The wax scene on the chest went to FOREVER. The characters, except Carell, were completely one-off. And the romantic elements are totally fictional, especially the scene in which Keener finds pornography in Carello's apartment. It was just embarrassing. I also found the "Aquarius" sequence completely boring and exaggerated. I hated to hate hating this movie!
