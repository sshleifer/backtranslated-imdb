I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as for her talents as an actor. So it was strange to me that she appeared in a movie that so distorted the facts. The salvage of her character from the South Pole was made by a Canadian charter company from Edmonton, Alberta, who flew Canadian designed and built plane, Twin Otter. The trip was denied by the Air Force of the United States, Navy and the Coast Guard, beyond their ability. A few years later, the same company organized a similar rescue to bring a man out of the base of the South Pole. I feel that the movie pretty much represented a very burning topic and documented a very brave woman who faced a daunting task. I do not see why manufacturers would consider it necessary to ignore the courage of rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as US soldier Hercules.
