I've seen the movie only recently, although it appeared in 2001. I was hoping to see a fun movie, but to tell you, Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. "Princess" is not very talkative, as you may have noticed ... She reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme, who was just staring to make his point and then defeated the opponent. During the entire film I waited to hear at least one confession of what she liked, why she fights, who she loves and whom she believes. I waited in vain. Crappi movie. Crappi dialogue. Do not look at it if you do not want to be bored! It's so bad, that I finally wondered how I managed not to scream with frustration for 1 1/2 hours. Close by. I'm giving 4/10.
