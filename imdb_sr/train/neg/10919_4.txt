Fan lovers pretty much hold Amitabh Bachan's Mard in high regard, but I think it is very overestimated. Manmohan Desai had previously worked on films such as Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie and I saw them all I liked, so I had very high expectations before I watched Marda and was bitter dissapointed. My main complaint about Mard is to feel like Amar Akbar Anthony Part 2, maybe Mr. Desai has lost his idea after all that used that formula for years and years. 1. Above all, some members of the acting team are recurring from the AAA, for example the police inspector brought by Amara, a Muslim who brings Akbar, Nirupu Roia and a few others. 2. In AAA Nirupa Roi loses sight, Mard loses voice 3. In AAA's famous song (Shirdi vale sai baba) in Mard, we have Amitabh singing Maa Sheravali. Seeing AAA more than 1000 times, I immediately noticed it. My other cramps are that some situations look ridiculous, real Manmohan Desai left the brain at the door, but with Mard I thought he went too far. My last remark is that in comparison with the songs in the previous films of Manmohan Desai, video songs are rather disappointing. I know there are many fans who swear, but I did not like that. In fact, it hurts me to write this review because I am a big fan and I love his films since my childhood.
