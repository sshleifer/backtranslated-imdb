Cheap story and acting. No good line, even a line that is bad enough to be good, and not a memorable delivery. Even the one who appeared on DVD showed how many actors were incompetent and how fun it was. The esoteric and occult basis was apathetic inaccurate, and the antagonists were not creepy or convincing. The "homoerotic" phenomena were meaningless and disgruntled, and were limited to youngsters who stroked their chests while they were boxers. I do not have enough gaius to appreciate it, but a small action could at least keep me and my girlfriend awake.
