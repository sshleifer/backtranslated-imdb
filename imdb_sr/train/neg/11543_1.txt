Although I often use this site to see how other people evaluate what I think are challenging or simply enjoyable movies, after last night watching this "movie" on Film Four, I felt compelled to write something, even if it just helped me clean up One more time. The movie may have been the most recent experience I've ever had - the main characters played by Danny Dier (23? Are You Sure?) and Gillian Anderson (who will always be Scully as Leonard Nimoi will always be Spock) he did not have the real essence of them - I'm not sure that the first half hour of the movie did not make a final cut, but surely in a movie about a revenge that you would want little empathy with the victims ... I do not care here. In fact, the only person I looked to worry about was a dog, while the deer came close. Both animals were operated by Dire (sic) and Scully, which were quite terrible. I guess you're as good as the script you gave, and I would like to thank writers, producers, directors and all actors for losing 90 minutes of my life and some perfectly good currents.
