The gospel of Lu was a great disappointment for me. I received an e-mail from the theater and showed that this is an excellent and inspiring movie. There was not much or inspirational. Cinema was pretty suspicious with the whole movie. Many scenes were streaks that were made in a way that sometimes he could not say what it was about. Voices were often distorted for no reason. And many of the people in the film were pretty preoccupied. The relationship he has with his ex and his son has never been clarified. Likewise, the whole movie has one way and then suddenly BAM, he is healed and inspires people. It seems that the entire film shows that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life, making him live his life the way he lives, but when he changes, he does not leave boxing, teaches others how to go. Thumbs Down.
