I recently watched the site that contained films in the public domain. In their long list of films this film was made and I thought I had to hallucinate on such an offensive title and premise. But, no, it really was. And since the movie was only about 27 minutes, I decided to try. If it turned out to be some porn movie, I would stop watching. Instead, it turned out to be the most colorful film I've ever seen. The Danish production team tried, with a budget of about $ 49, to make a film about Star Trek about a team of very gay men traveling in the galaxy and wiping women's oppression killing all women - as they continued to work the Earth! And in any case, they met their exclamations and thank you now, gai people on the planet. Subtle, this is not. With some of the most reprehensible and minor names of the characters I've ever heard, I do not think I can write them on the IMDb without removing the reviews! However, despite the utter crap of all this, it was unusual to look and worth a look. But, as I have already mentioned, because of rude names and unusual themes (although there is no nudity), it is a movie for adults only. By the way, this film left me with a 1001 question about who will do it, why is it and who is the target audience?! It may not be the absolutely worst thing I've ever seen, but it's probably the strangest and perhaps the most compelling!
