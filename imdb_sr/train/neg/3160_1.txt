You know that you are in trouble watching a comedy, when the only entertainment parts of the animal whale. It is a shame that the parrot, Cat & Dog, was only in support, and not the other way around, because the people in it were pretty rude. Being I, Paul, Eva, Lake (what's that name), Jason, and Lindsay, I'd forget this acting lark and do something else, because you're all funny as you're looking at dry colors , and the terrible actors to lift. The main head of the movie is one of the characters shouting, I'm not Gai, which is funny as if you did not, maybe you would change your mind if you had to suffer the three bosses, boring and dare to say Very simple water women in film. The worst movie I've seen for years, and I hope I will never see it anymore anymore, although I do not expect it.
