I guess this movie attracted me also because of the sound of the story and the leading actor, so I gave him a chance, from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically, Heath Ledger was set up by the police, especially the supervisor of Francis Hare (Geoffrei Rush), forced to go on the run by forming a gang and go against them to purify his and his family's names. That's really all I can say about this story, because I did not pay the utmost attention to being honest. Also starring Orlando Bloom as Joseph Birne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as policeman Fitzpatrick, Kerri Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Brovning as Grace Kelley and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger is a pretty good performance, for what it's worth, and the film has its attractive moments, especially with the fight in the gun, but I can not say I enjoyed it because I did not watch it all. Okay!
