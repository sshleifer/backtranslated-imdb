(Couplers) <br /> <br /> I was very curious to watch this movie after I heard it was clever and funny. I had to stop halfway for the unbearable boredom that I felt. The film idea would be acceptable: showing the way in which the relationship between man and woman develops, through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience. What made me do not like the whole movie were two things. First of all, the film was so grounded that it looked like that, describing the problems that the couple must solve on a day -During the day, he became ordinary and boring. Second, total disorder of production, with dialogs that are barely understandable. Damage.
