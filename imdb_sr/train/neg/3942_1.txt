My God, what a horrible movie. The film has included all the right people, unfortunately not worth watching. I've seen it free in a local library. If I paid to watch this, I would be even more upset. This film is incalculable. How Tarintino could have been involved in such a slow, unpalatable film. No wonder it did not get much distribution, everyone who was involved must be ashamed. I can make a better movie with date dots and my toe. It's more than boring, I really hated him. Tarintino just lost my standing in my eyes. This must be some sort of sick joke. Do not bother with this movie. If someone even suggests to watch it, kill them.
