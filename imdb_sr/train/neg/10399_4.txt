One of the main drawbacks in this film is that, although mockery of pretentious iuppies is satisfactory, it fails to realize that the filmmakers themselves are guilty of being one of those who deserve to be laughed. One of the characteristics of these types of iuppies is the misconception that they (iuppies) are the only ones who are sophisticated enough to understand art. While the film ignores this feature and instead focuses on their misunderstanding in eating, it seems to me ironic that only people who enjoy this movie can boast the same imaginative taste in movies as the characters make in the choice of dinner. If these pompous characters in this movie had a video library at home, I would bet that the American psycho would be one of those movies.
