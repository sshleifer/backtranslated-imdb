I think I've seen all of the Grisham movies now and in general they are all very bad except The Rainmaker, but this one is so bad it's incredible WARNING BREAK It's one of the those films in which the character plays stupid irrational things that no one would ever do. He is a lawyer for God's sake. Why when his children disappear, he does not call the police. Oh, yes, that's because all the cops hate lawyers so they ignore him and let him be attacked. waiting for a hearing. Why drag your children halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home. The police are not trying to find a refugee mental patient, they do not strive to interview his daughter. Concerning the funny ending ??. In short, stupid, very unrealistic and completely wasting time. /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst movies ever recorded.
