I was also intrigued by the high (8.5) rating for this film and I was very disappointed. I just saw a few good foreign films and I was looking forward to doing it three in a row, but that was not the case. I went with a friend who speaks Spanish and who felt the same. There are not many complications, if any. I do not need this in the movie, but it has to somehow entertain or bring me. The best I could say is that he wants to be an Altman-eskue movie, although with an extremely small ensemble. Of course, there are moments, but a few moments are easily diluted with 97 slow minutes of nothing. I do not understand the high score for this movie. I give it 3. <br />
