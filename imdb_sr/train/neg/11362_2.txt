"Fli Me To The Moon" must be the worst animated film I've seen in a long time. That's what he says because I took my son to see every animated version for the last 4 years. The story is to be generous ... banal. The loud acting is terrible, Too sweet. Humor is of the Romper Room. The animation is passable for the Nickolodeon cartoon type, but this is posted on a large screen rather than on cable television. Some of the scenes had a slightly stimulating image, but we saw it much better in the past. Also, I question the insistence of filmmakers that the characters leave the screen, not in most scenes. Although interesting, it became tiring after the 3rd or 4th time. It seemed to me that the creators were indifferent. I'll say it though, it had a pretty cool soundtrack. And for my record, my son was not too crazy. Bad movie.
