I had a lot of hope for this film and so I watched it with a lot of expectations; basically because of Kamal Hasan. He is an incredible actor who forever marked his steps in the sand of time. But this film turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After watching this movie, brutality and violence in tenebra and orange clock look much better. The protagonist, Raghavan, is a very brave cop. Who is in charge of investigating brutal serial killings. Raghavan effectively finds a link in this case and is close to solving killings and puts psycho-killers, two mentally disturbed but brilliant medical students, behind bars, but they escape and re-enter murder. Finally, Raghavan kills them both after he spared many innocent lives. Two psycho-killers are those who will keep the audience from going to the theater. Murders and sexual abuse and rape were presented very explicitly, and the film could survive. Even imagine that teenagers and children will watch this movie in the theater and some kind of image they will have to paint in their minds, they are certainly not beautiful. The director, Gautham, needs to understand that he also has some obligation to society and his audience. I'm sure I will never go to a movie that looks like Gautham's name on the production list.
