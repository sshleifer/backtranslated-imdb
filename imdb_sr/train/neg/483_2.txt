I did not think that the French could make a bad movie, but I, obviously, was very wrong. As already mentioned, this film essentially uses its title character as a starting point; her depiction of life and persons have little or no relation to the right of Artemisia Gentileschi. The scenario is terrible - pretentious, stiff and rude - and its copying of facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that makes too much money for living by distorting, not convincingly, history. With some rather decent scenography, the physical charms of Valentine Cervi are the primary advantage of this film, and it is obvious from the very beginning that the authors of the film were aware of it; they do not waste time finding different "erotic" sequences that have much more to do with titulation than with complication or character development. Unfortunately, the attraction of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of fictitious sexual arousal can not and does not support this film. The acting is incomparable, and the result is too general despite the interesting actor. Cinema is fine, but there are some nice colors, but there are some pretty funny sequences that use the effects of a distorted lens more suitable for a freakout movie from the 1960s than a costume drama. In any case, the script leaves the camera to be frequently held on Artemisia's body, and very rarely in her paintings. All in all, almost complete failure. It's not intelligent enough or tasty enough to be a serious movie, and it's too slow and pretentious to work as soft-core pornography. The French can still miss it!
