At first, we began to see the beginning of a secret tip of some sort. Everything seems promising from the start. With some supernatural elements, the secret becomes more interesting. The main character who looks like a good guy is in trouble because of his claim for money that is right (temptation) and other factors. You really are sympathetic with the guy and you want to know exactly what's going on. Usually, the person in his situation would have several options. Somehow there is no option. In this film, it seems that there is only one solution, even when it is clear that it is not his fault. She sees characters talking about the church, prayer and God from blue. And they give the answer to his problem. At some point in the film, it should be clear what this solution is. Let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Since it's always helpful. But was it really necessary to conceal this message? This religious element has ruined my viewing experience. Although the message is good, its simplicity can not escape the fact that in real life more has to happen to solve the problems presented in this movie. The mystery presented to us is never resolved. Instead, you are forced to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot. Do not be fooled by Malcolm McDowell. Once a brilliant actor is adequate, but if you watch carefully you will see that he is not serious at all. He must be desperate for money. Otherwise, what would have the actor of his caliber play in a movie like this one.
