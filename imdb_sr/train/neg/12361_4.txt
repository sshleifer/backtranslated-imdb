I've seen this recent Voody Allen movie because I'm a fan of his work and I'm trying to see everything he does, even though the reviews of this movie have led me to the expectation of a disappointing effort. They were right. This is a confused movie that can not decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a romantic fantasy or a drama about a middle-aged middle-age crisis. Alisa (Mia Farrow) is a troubled middle-aged woman who is married to a great fortune and leads a life of unsurpassed luxury with her rather annoying husband and their two young children. This pretty terrestrial concept of action has been revived with such incredibles as an old Chinese national healer who makes it invisible to some magical herbs, and the spirit of a former lover (with whom he flies through Manhattan). If these additions sound too fantastic for you, what do you say to something more prosperous, like an affair with a saxophonist? I was never quite sure of what this confused confusion was trying to say. There are only a few really fun moments in the movie, and the end is really absurd touching Pollianna. Instead, hire 'crimes and violations', a superb well-made movie that thrives in a combination of comedy with a serious consideration of ethics and morality. Or return to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan".
