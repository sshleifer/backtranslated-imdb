Mari Pickford becomes the head of the Scottish clan after her father's death, and then she has a romance. As the colleague commentator Snov Leopard said, the film is quite an episodic to begin with. Some of this is fun, as Pickford switched his clans to the church, while some of them are right there. All in all, the story is a poor, especially recycled, fictitious romantic line and its climax. The transfer is so dark that it's hard to appreciate the landscape, but even if this is taken into account, it does not look like the best work of the director Maurice Tourneur. Pickford and Tourneur once again collaborated in a slightly more affordable "poor little girl," who picked up Pickford as a childish character.
