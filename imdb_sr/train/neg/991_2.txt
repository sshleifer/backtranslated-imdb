If you want to watch a good movie about how women can fight a sexual assault, then this movie is not the movie you want to watch. It was a social commentary on a woman who was a victim and struggling. Spoiler: Rosario Davson turns tables on his attacker. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorted to the use of vigilantism. It essentially annuls the judicial system. The film "Accused" was a much better film, since the victim uses the judicial system and wins. What does "descent" mean to victims of attacks to resort to violence? Is the victim better than the charge? Not!!!
