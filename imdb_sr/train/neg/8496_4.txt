Have you ever seen a movie made entirely of long shots? Not? Me neither. Well, I finally saw one in "Spring in my hometown," and I have to admit, now I know why people do not. The technique is "artistic", but certainly not ripe for public consumption. The technique is very wrong because the viewer does not have emotional attachment to the characters, and maybe it is the entire director's intention. I do not know, I can not read my thoughts, and I certainly do not know enough about the director to make a decision. But one thing about this movie that is painfully obvious is its funnyness. anti-American feelings. As an American, I am well aware of my country's participation in the Korean War, and I am very aware that we have not always been angels, but a curse if I take a version of this type of how things are happening. According to that blind fool, the Americans were not just at the root of the war, we were CAUSES of the war, and almost alone we destroyed the country. Anyway, Mr. Director. I suppose we would still make this film in Communist Korea so we did not mix, did we? Talk about forgetting your history. This is almost the same as turning the Nazis into "good guys" as they transform allied forces into "bad guys". This film is so historically naive and so inaccurate that it's almost unpleasant to watch. For a man who comes from a land owed to his being by American interference, he certainly comes as tall and powerful and condemned.
