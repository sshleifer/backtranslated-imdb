I must tell you now, I am certainly not the authority for Bollywood movies and I've seen only a few. However, if you have never seen it, do not start with this! I really enjoyed those I saw before this, but I could not stand this. I also have to tell you that I can not finish this movie - it was so boring. Then why was it so embarrassing? 1. In the film there is a figure called 'Rambha'. He is even more boring than Jar-Jar Binks - which I would never believe would be possible. He is so @ @ ^! # Boring! He spoke in a falsetto voice and I think it should have been comical relief. Instead, he only grabbed my nerves and wanted me to die ... slowly! His voice, his manners and his disgust - he simply did not silence and dominate every scene he was in, and he had to die! 2. Heroes had the incredible ability to easily avoid AK-47 bullets. I do not kid you - there was a scene in which a few unarmed boys took over a small army of guys with these guns !! And again, and again, they avoided taking one bullet and beat the ruffles !!! This made Stallone's actions in "Rambo II" mundane !! 3. The film was so loud, in your face and intense - it practically bleeding my brain! It's like the movie was made by people under the influence of a target! Crazy camera angles, INTENSE music and action, action, action ... this movie is clearly designed for someone who can not record a complicated movie and wants almost 100% of the action. 4. The two main characters and their actions and motivations did not make sense ... nothing! Perhaps, if you are the hottest action and amateur fan, you can submit this film, but as far as I'm concerned, I see why it's on the IMDb's notorious bottom of the list. Wow ... this movie is bad and very bad !!
