This is very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate. It looks like it was shot at a backyard in California, instead of where Jack Slade lived and died, Idaho, the Territories of Colorado and Montana. He fictions everything that is known about this mysterious "bad man", "good man". The script is terrible; There is very little direction and bad acting. Dorothy Malone is completely lost as his wife. Mark Steven never knows how to display this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a good leader of the stage. He was scared by local residents for his drunkenness. If he was drunk, he would begin to fight and cause other problems in Virginia, Montana. To make sure that they will never be terrorized, the defenders licked Jack Slade after ignoring their warning to leave the city immediately. This is a horrible movie. I can not recommend anyone watching this movie except to see how Hollivood throws history at will, even to this day.
