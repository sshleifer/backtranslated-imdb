Another film that relies on a gnarled, exhausted clich√© of a mad scientist who is crazy. The film revolves around a surgeon whose life-style is to bring the dead back to life. I know, I know ... you never heard it before! Of course, as all these films go, the experiment goes very, very wrong and creates a maniacal, blood-stained creature. For this promising setting, you would think it would be a little tense. Wrong. Like many films of this era, the idea is good, but execution and script are central. It's not the worst horror movie I've ever seen (no, Abominator: Evilmaker 2 still takes a cake) ... but none of the gems.
