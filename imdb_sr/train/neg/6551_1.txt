Study in bad. Bad performance, bad music, bad scenario, bad montage, bad direction and bad idea. The pieces of pike do not come in any cheese or unintentionally more fun than this ... stuff. By the end of the film, you remain wondering why they were tired at all. Poor Malcolm McDowell, did he miss money or something? Still thinking about it? * SPOILER AHOI *: If you have not died of laughter in the first thirty minutes, until the moment you see a cyborg populated city called "Citovn", you will. Avoid this, my friends who love the movie. Avoid.
