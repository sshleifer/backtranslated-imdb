In Theodore Reek, the poor Vhoopi Goldberg is set up as a tough policeman working with a pathetic dinosaur on the case. The film tries to be ridiculous and tries to make a story about abductions and much more, but it never does. The film is far from ridiculous, and the story is ridiculous. I voted 1/10
