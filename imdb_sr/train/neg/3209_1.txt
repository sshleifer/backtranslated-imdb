I also saw this incredibly bad piece of "anime" at the London Sci-Fi Festival. If you have to watch this thing, do it with a large audience, preferably after a few beers, then you can collect something from it. I discovered that the dialogue is ridiculous, in my mind is the introduction of Cremator. Animation is terrible. It is poorly designed and poorly implemented. It may be a good idea for manufacturers to employ at least one person who is not a color blind. Nothing else can say, this film is a failure at all levels.
