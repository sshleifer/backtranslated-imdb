I should not even have to watch this movie, because it's not actually a horror movie - and therefore it's not worth the attention of dr. Cheesea. At least not horror in the usual sense. It's certainly a horrible assumption that you're wasting your time watching this shit. That's why I turned it off after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise, when the clock showed that only 45 minutes passed. Yes that is correct; In simple terms, this film is b-o-r-i-n-g. The "Red" had a lot of flaws, not everything unique. In particular, it seems to me that the main problem with the "religious" subordinate of horror films is the reluctance of Hollivood to engage Christianity under his own conditions. It's quite possible to make really horrible movies that are also orthodox. Just ask Villiam Peter Blatty. In fact, without orthodoxy, such films are just something that goes to the grocery store of filmmakers (usually boring and illogical) imaginations. Think about it. If somebody made a film allegedly about, say, physics, but not only did he err on the basic laws of physics, but he based his entire action on his misstatements, he would soon be tired of the resulting nonsensical complication. The same goes for these types of movies. In other words, the "Order" (and many similar films in front of it) fabricate from the whole fabric of things about the Catholic Church and Christian faith and try to build a plot of these inventions. It's not surprising that the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid. This movie has an extra interest to be interesting to see how your nails are developing on your feet. Avoid this pile of mating.
