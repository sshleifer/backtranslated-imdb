Seriously, I read some reviews about this movie, and I have to ask you, did you people watch the same movie. Yes, I give directors a lot of credit that I can recreate in 1930 in Los Angeles, but what then? No character is cute, the story looks damnable, Karen Black is simply not a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is just crazy. (and his character "Homer Simpson" makes me want to make an animated version. D'ooh!) Then you had a creepy boyfriend, freaking Billy Barthi, and so on. This is one of those films that love movie lovers, while the rest of us watch each other and go: "What the hell!"
