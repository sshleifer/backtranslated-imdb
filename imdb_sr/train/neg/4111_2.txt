Think about the non-budget version of the Chinese Syndrome led by a film student who is idolizing John Woo and will get 'Pover Play'. The idea was good, but execution, acting and dialogue absolutely killed him, not to mention the ridiculous amount of violence and sequence of disasters used to compensate for the lack of content and the development of more interesting parts of the film. This is a story about a journalist who is investigating the disappearance of three members of the guerrilla activist group that mysteriously disappeared after breaking into the premises of the plant suspected of causing the earthquake. A rather cavalier reporter who faces what should have been a merciless bunch of CEOs of the company is rushed to town (along with everyone he is talking to) to "clean up" everything that could confirm evidence of plant mistakes. Unfortunately, there is no real sense of urgency, because the characters interact with a lot of indecision, along with idiotic dialogue and a lot of terrible acting. Not to mention, the viewer, who can only be attracted to the film because of his genre action, is forced to submit counting of the body and a ridiculous amount of violent shootings and a scene of a disaster in an earthquake. All the focus was put in the wrong place to apologize for compensating for the lack of direction and a more interesting series of events that were supposed to trigger the story. Perhaps it was far better that the filmmakers focused more on the thriller, and paid more attention to the development of the corruption aspects of this story. Horrible criminals, naive reporter, and those who try to warn reporters of misconduct. It's a formula, or at least it would be fun.
