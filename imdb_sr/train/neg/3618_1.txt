Cliche-story of the upcoming divorce - or is it? - through the eyes of a 6-year-old child. Cowardly dialogue, cartoon characters, stock situation, zombie red-haringa and, worst of all, absolutely no payment, either emotionally or dramatically. The true sign of a bad narrator - when you can not create any satisfactory dissolution - just finish the story. I'm forced to ask, "Why did you think this story is worth talking about?" Good, but lost, debut actor Anthony De Marco - the rest of the actors were, at best, forgetful. And they wonder why no one is watching indie movies! This is ninety minutes of my life. I will never return.
