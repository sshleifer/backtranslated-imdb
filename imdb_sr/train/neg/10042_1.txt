Such a long-awaited movie ... But he disappointed me and my friends who went to see the movie the first day .. It looked like an action movie from the trailer, but it turned out to be a comedy (a bad comedy). But one thing that deserves recognition is the acting of these professional actors, they have played their part of the film well. Good acting, but I do not think it can save the movie. India is beautifully captured. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladak?) They were saturated with color, okay. However, the way the intrinsic beauty of these shooting sites made me discover where these places were and when I could go there ;-) Action sequences were recorded very seamlessly, no one can from the head and they used Akki (akshai kumar) very well, but they could have been much better ... Animation is the worst I've seen in recent movies (90's movies had better animation, I guess (the starting scene in which the car is falling 'it would be better to say' road to the lake '). The name of the movie is mentioned almost every 20 to 30 min, with can make sure that the audience will not forget the name of the movie.
