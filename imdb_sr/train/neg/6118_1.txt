This is not a good story about Tarzan's epic. There is only one reason for this film. John Derek wanted to show his beautiful wife in a shirt! Bo Derek at '10' was at least a witty film and there was a reason for nudity and sex. This film is nothing but soft pornography. If you are in that, then, turn quickly and skip the rest! This film (like Bolero) was again a means for Bo Derek to show his terrible acting. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but her poster is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than this; This was one of his few mistakes! Do not waste time on this movie ... buy a book instead.
