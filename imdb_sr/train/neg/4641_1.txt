Sometimes I enjoy really bad films ... to those who occasionally appear when people (even talented) associate with good intentions to make a movie and for whatever reason it turns out to be a disaster. Films such as "Killer Assault", "Plan 9 from the Universe", "Manos-Fate of Destiny" and "Heaven Gate", etc. When I heard that this movie, "Rachel's Attic", many considered it as one of the worst films of the decade, of course I had to see it. Boy, I'm sorry about that decision. This movie is out of the bad ... it's so bad it's not even as comfortable as a common bad movie. Acting, recording, script, etc. They're still worse than porn movies with a low budget: the sound is extremely terrible, the "plot" is completely incomprehensible, "acting" is ridiculous ... it's a complete loss of all time and money. At least a porno movie has pornography to break monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare has a boy who clutches a rotting apple and a teaspoon of a "crazy hat". Lighting does not exist. Many "scenes" are unfolding in half or full of darkness, which is probably just as good. "Writer-director" (I'm free to use terms), David Tibor, tries to turn into binding scenes ... but the results would be ridiculous, not so pathetic. There is some nakedness, but it is from such a non-expressive quality that actually acts as a sexual supporter. I could keep on forever and not to blame all the failures and disadvantages of this really terrible loss of the film. For God's love, avoid this wreck of the train. I know that despite (or perhaps because of) my negative comments, you may still be tempted to see if this piece of garbage really is as bad as I claim it is .... but believe me in this .... worse than I said, and you will absolutely, positively regret the experience (and costs, if you spend money on buying or renting).
