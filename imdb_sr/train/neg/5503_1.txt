I grew up watching the original TV series in the sixties and one thing I can tell you immediately, there is no comparison. This film was totally hilarious with the flying suit that was alive. A Marsman who had different shapes. Special effects that looked like something a little child would have created. On the contrary, characters originated in the original and the viewers developed a sense for the Team and Uncle Martine. The only highlight in this movie, that, in fact, was one, when Rai Valston finally came to the end. He wore dark glasses and mentioned life on this planet for 30 years as a kind of homage to the TV series. But even true uncle Martin could not save this party.
