To be honest, I heard this is pretty bad before I decided to watch it, but I never allowed others to influence my viewing, in fact I'm more inclined to watch something out of the guts !. Bullvhip had one thing for me before watching, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those beautiful eyes were in it, I was immediately interested. The picture is not very good, and in fact it is very morally suspicious, all the characters are corrupted and invented in one way or in the form, all motivated by greed or egocentric victories, everything is good and good if the surrounding film can despise the worthy people in the crowd and despise the worthy people tense climatic image. Unfortunately, no, and after finishing your eyes with sugar, you can not shout that you were cheated by watching a pretty bad movie, no one in the acting team came out with any merit, and the main man Gui Madison is painfully woody in extremes. Even lovely Rhonda can not force me to recommend this to anyone, 3/10
