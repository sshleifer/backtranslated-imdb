Wow ... what would you do with $ 33m? Let me give you the choice; you can either a) dismantle it and eject it into vc; or b) make a film based on the premise of Vhoopi Goldberg as a hard-walnut futuristic cop in partnership with a rubber dinosaur that uses terms such as "I did not push the trumpet" and raspberries because this funny. That's right, you would choose a multi-merit option - rinse the VC. This must be seen to be believed. I can not even find words to describe how bad this movie is. It does not even fit into the category "so bad - it's good." I actually have it on TV while I write - and while I was watching, I felt the need to get to the IMDb and register a disgust. Since the Jurassic Park was made a few years earlier, how was it on earth that the audience would tolerate a man dressed in a rubber suit? The working group should simply walk and damn the consequences. Everyone who is concerned will go to hell because of this criminal waste of money. I have to stop writing - soon I will crash.
