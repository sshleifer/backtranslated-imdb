This film was long-lasting, with no climax. People who ultimately think the sword in the end is just as big, must either be mindless, or not. Often this film became softer. I'm not saying soft films are bad. But no matter how sweet you are with sugar, there should not be room on the t-bone chopper. This film should have been about the vendetta for crimes against culture, but ended it as a petty quarrel. And only one of them knew what a sword was; The character of Tim Roth (and yes, he plays well). Rob Roi was a weak "hero" without knowing how to use a sword, and the way he "beat" was a disgrace. As a drama, this film had its periods, but the best performance in it must go to the nature of Scotland. This is a short breath that is not called "soap" in my book.
