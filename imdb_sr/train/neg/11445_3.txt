I've seen a lot of shit in my day, but goodness, Hot Rod takes a cake. I've seen a free screening in New York a couple of nights ago. I can only hope to show a fun version to the payers. The big laugh was rare, the plot was uninteresting, and the characters were at best one-dimensional at best. One peak is a hilarious dance scene with Adam Samberg. It was priceless and it was the only scene I was honestly laughing at. Besides, I can only remember coincidence and dead air. SNL & Samberg fans can be disappointed. I know I expected more than that. But briefly, I definitely would not recommend that I attend a free show or pay to watch this movie.
