This film is not as good as all the Christ's films I've ever seen. And I'm pretty amazed that in this story, Pilate wants to end Jesus, when the Bible (as well as other films) says differently. He also misses a very important question: Resurrection. No other film does not skip this very important part: the faith of all of us Christians is precisely in this event. As Paul says in one of his letters, "If Christ has not risen from the dead, our faith is futile." A very impressive scene for me in this movie was to see the remains of palm trees on the streets that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. Finally, contrary to my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus was not a myth. In fact, he was also JEVREJ. There are many documents (religious and secular) that prove the existence of this exceptional man (or I would say, God has become a man) who truly changed mankind. I strongly advise him (since he is a historian) to read about Joseph Flavius, the brightest Jewish commentator of the first. Centuri.
