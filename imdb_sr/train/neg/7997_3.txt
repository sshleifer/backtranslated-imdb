Even for the tired film model as the natural and human cycle that prevailed in the 1970s, the ants were in poor condition, although they were in no way effective (though fun for reasons they did not intend). It's sooooo absurd. Obviously, these ants bulldozed near the inn have been poisoning waste for decades, and have now adapted themselves to the transmission of toxic bites - hundreds of these bites are fatal. Watching the actors of some glory clumsily falling in the midst of tiny black points is painfully funny in a not so good but very bad way. So many scenes look ridiculous: a boy trying to fall into a container while being attacked, Suzanne Sommers screams in horror while resting in bed, Robert Fokvorth and Linda George breathe through the pieces of the wallpaper, Bernie Casei plays the gam legs, and the list goes on and on. The presented danger ranges from ants that crawl from the drain to the black lines of the ants to all the walls. Actors for film are not bad on paper, but none of these actors seem to believe in the material. Poor Mirna Loi must sit in a wheelchair through this horror. I hope she has found good money for money, because it is obvious that this is the only reason the woman from her pedigree would be in this nonsense. Although it's a pretty bad movie, he can be seen - once for me, and there are many of those bad film quality from the seventies - actors who started to feel shameful, feel like TV, and that the horrifying creatures of nature refresh on a man . This time, a man has to push his hand in an aggregate of ants to get hit. Really awful.
