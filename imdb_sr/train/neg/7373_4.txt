I do not know what you're watching for Steven Seagal movies, but I watch them because, no matter how stupid, they're always good for laughter. Why would you rate this film as one of 10 based on synchronization, when is such a thing exactly what makes such a movie cult cult favorite to laugh at nonsense? Attacking forces are by no means an excellent movie, but I felt worthy of Steven Seagal as well as many other films; In fact, I did not think it was one of his worst cases. Most of the time had a semi-coherent plot line, and it was mostly exciting. The ending was exhausted, but even it had some inconvenient elements. At the end of the story itself, she did not deliver what she promised, but I actually thought that acting, characterization (if I could use such a big word) and delivered the rest of production values ​​exactly what the real fan of Steven Seagal expects. Seagal himself was just that man with a stone face, a no-nonsense, which we expected, and the rest of the actors supported him well, and he never met him. This, people, is what Steven Seagal does. Deal with it. Or even better: laugh at it. 4 of 10.
