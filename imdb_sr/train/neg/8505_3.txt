"Semana Santa" or "Angel Of Death" is a very bad movie. Mira Sorvino plays a detective trying to find a killer who shoots lightning in people. Mira has an Italian emphasis that occasionally falls. Could not she just speak English? All other characters have a forced Mexican accent that hinders. The dialogue is very bad and the delivery is wooden. Cinema looks nice, but it's not enough to save this bug. THIS FOLLOWING PART OF THIS REVIEW INCLUDES SPOILERS !!!! During climax it seems that the criminal will get out, but then he comes back down the stairs to shoot him and make a cold feud down the fence. It only shows that this script has no originality. AVOID!
