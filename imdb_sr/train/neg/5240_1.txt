As soon as the screen hits, it destroys all intelligent life forms around! But on behalf of my producers, I must say that it does not belong to any famous film category, deserves its new denomination! It's a "Neurological Drama"! It mourns and depresses every neuron within the brain of a person. It's the closest thing you'll ever get to a stroke without getting into it. It puts you without words, all of you are ruined, your mouth opens and remains like that, and the strangest symptom of everything is that you want to blind yourself and ignore yourself. There is no small feat for such kind of "movie". The only word that only comes to mind is that I've finished my temptation is OUTRAGE !!!!!!
