Friday, Step 13! It's officially a worse movie than your hate series. I won this film at a college competition, and that was a waste of money even if it was free. Jack Jones plays a really terrible singer trying to find murderers or something like that. At least I did not bother at my thirteenth. I'd rather pull my nails out, but to see this again.
