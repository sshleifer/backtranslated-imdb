What a poor excuse for filming the film, Nev Zealnd. I'm ashamed to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and currently plays on New Zealand Satellite TV (August 2006). The actor is made up of a large number of local soap stars. The boat is, in real life, one of the inter-island ferry that daily travels between the two main islands and even has a company logo (dolphin) that is still on the whole set, including the ship's funnel. The ship should be a cruise ship between the United States and Mexico. It has obvious signs of rust and age, but it should be a luxury boat on its first journey. One of the scenes shows the snowy peaks of the southern island of New Zealand in the background for God's sake! It must have been very cold in the US / Mexico area! The story is poor, the acting is weaker, and New Zealand / American accents simply do not work. I expect that the New Zealand taxpayer contributed to the cost of producing this film and that it was a loss of money that was better spent on actual production. I know high school students in New Zealand who can make better movies with their mobile phones. An asshole: A truck with a mark on it is in the truck and they put the Taco company on the door of the truck, probably to look like it was American. But some of the signs are at the top of the labels - you might think it would be noticed in the props section before you attach it. I would like to continue, but it is simply not worth the effort in any way.
