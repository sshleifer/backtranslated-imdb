I'd like to give this film a zero, or even lower, because unfortunately that's what it deserves. Honestly, I never get out of the movie, but this one was so terrible that I could not stand it for a minute. Please, please, for the benefit of humanity - skip this film. If you want a hot lesbian movie that you really can indulge in, that's not it. <Br /> <br /> There are unattractive, unappealing track, the wind structure, hilarious dialogue and absolutely unconvincing in every conceivable way. . At an absolutely basic level, it can not be fun. Everything about "Mango Kiss" is so scenic, it's VORSE more than any student film I've seen. through narration. The script writer may have written a novel because they insisted on TELLING everything instead of SHOVING. You should just assume that Lu and sassafras best friends and have a special connection, although there is no development of character that would illustrate. Also, this movie continues to introduce new characters after the first five minutes, but not in a natural way, but in the context of the frozen characters with their name written across the screen. There is no introduction, no development of any character. We do not know any of them. This is the best amateur movie I've ever seen. <Br /> <br /> I am a gay woman who watched this movie with my roommate (other gay women) and we both thought this movie depressive team Queer Cinema. I'm beginning to think that lesbian and gay films are very similar to Christian rock - no matter how horrible it is, people will still go for it, and advocate it, no matter how poor quality. Please do not rent this! Instead, let us encourage the production of qualit gay and lesbian films by renting "But I'm a cheerleader" or "Fire" or "Heavenly Creatures", rather than swallow mindless tripe targeting the gay community (ie. Queer as Folk).
