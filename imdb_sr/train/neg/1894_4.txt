Although there are Fliing Guillotines as part of the title of this film, it has nothing to do with the original Fliing Guillotines (1975) and its sequel to the Fliing Guillotines II (1978). Two originals are masterpieces of kung-fu film and still stand out as a classic. This is a much worse copy of the original, and even as a regular kung-fu movie, below the average. First of all, this movie does not have much acting. This is one pointless battle for another, and the flying guillotine does not even play a major role in them. The story is about some Shaolin monks who are searching for some criminals who escaped with the holy book, and the evil prince who owns this book is part of the plot. The same evil prince has plans to hire priests and use flying guillotines on them. There are four films with flying guillotine as part of her title. This is in my opinion the least quality. The design of the flying guillotine in this film differs from the other three, indicating that this film produced the second entity from the other three. poor production. It's best to skip this and look at the two originals.
