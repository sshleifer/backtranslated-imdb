I do not envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Veisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black for this movie. In a word, it's boring. Perhaps a fact that is too predictable, more than the exploited role of Ben Stiller or a non-funny scene, make this movie something to be forgotten. Even the appearance of Christopher Valken ends in a pathetic way. I was very disappointed. I love Ben Stiller's acting. I loved it in most of his films, the last I had seen before was Duplek with Drew Barrymore and it was not so bad. About Jack Black ... Well, apart from High Fidelity, I've never seen him do something good. What about Rock School? Oops, scary.
