"It's not like that great mechanical toy," one character says early, commenting on "Jams". Well, "Blood Surf" would just want the beast to be as convincing as the "Javs" shark. In other words, the digital special effects of this film are TERRIBLE. No acting or directing is much better; It seems to fit more to deodorant or commercial tire than to horror movie. The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre, but for the audience. Saying that you "like" this movie only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this shit, further destroying a bad genre horror. (* 1/2)
