Simply put, this is a simple and one-dimensional movie. The title, The Rise to Evil, should tell you that this will not try to be anything deep or that it will do a lot with Hitler's character. Instead, from the first minutes of the film where we see Hitler watching the evil with the evil music in the background, we are given a look at Hitler who presents him as a cartoon, apparently exhausted from the TV show on Saturday morning. The film really wants to say that Hitler was evil, but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was evil? Finally, creating it as a one-dimensional character evil is both boring and confusing (one must ask how incomprehensible, phicicotic character in the film, cold-bloodedly convince the nation to follow it or be called Man of the Year). This film had a great opportunity to take on a character who committed some of the most terrible acts in the 20th century and tried to get into his mind. Instead, he basically just says, "Hey! Hitler was evil! I just thought I'd want to know ..." over and over again. The big irony is that the film is still attacked because it represents a compassionate look at the character. Give me a break.
