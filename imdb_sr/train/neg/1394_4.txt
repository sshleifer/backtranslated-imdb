"The brain machine" will at least put its brain in a busy attempt to understand what it is about. For an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and the environment, four subjects of different origin and level of intelligence were selected. Since the only common denominator among them is the fact that each of them has no known family, it should have been a tip - none of them will be missed. The whole affair is under the control of mysterious crawling. as a general, but he seems to take the direction of a senator who wants to remain anonymous. Good call there in the Senator's section. There is also a mysterious guard that the camera is constantly zooming in, which later claims that it does not take the direction from the general or the "Project". Too bad that he was not more effective, he was quite easily overcome before the kablooei was gone. If nothing else, the film is a real treasure trove of technology from the 1970s, which is repeated by recording phone numbers, computer-sized rooms and a teletype machine that will not stop. Perhaps it was the basis of the alternative title of the movie - "Time Varp"; nothing else would make sense. As far as I'm concerned, I would like to take into account the title suggested by the experiment of the murdered Dr. Krisner under the title 'Group Stress Project'. This also applies to actors and movie viewers. Follow right above the head of the general in the pool when the agent asks for his weapon, and the microphone is visible above his head for many. You may wish to catch this movie if you are a fan of Gerald McRane, could he ever have been So young? James Best also appears in the unusual role of the mysterious lieutenant, but it is not called by the Father. For a little bit more in his alley, try to get rid of The Killer Shrevs from 1959. At least it does not turn out to be so seriously understood.
