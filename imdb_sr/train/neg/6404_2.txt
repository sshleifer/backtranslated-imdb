Spoolers ... if such a thing is possible .... . . . . . As a fan of Robin Williams, I felt I needed to buy this movie as the first on the screen. Wow ... I could not imagine a film that's more interfering. In essence, the movie for another carries a bad joke that your Uncle Artie will tell you after dinner and dramatize them. Robin Villiams plays a lawyer in a 30-second skit. <br /> <br /> I'm all for rude humor, but this humor was not pleasantly vulgar, or nervous ... it was just dying. There are no movies that could be used, except for the fanatic of Robin Williams, like me, who simply have to have every piece of the movie.
