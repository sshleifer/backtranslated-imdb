A very "straight" beautiful old woman, desperate for money to save her house and property, grows "in the pot" in her house, smokes it with a few old friends and then sells it. It is a story for this low-key comedy, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation and some of the humor that brings the difficulty. For most of the film, it works. Humor is not of loud diversity, but it entertains you around an hour and a half, so I think it serves its purpose. There are fun moments and Brenda Blethin's fun to watch in the main role. But the end really destroyed the "sweet" movie with offensive bad messages that only the ultra-liberals of the film world would like to happen. Like most people, I'd rather have a happy ending too, but it should not be all hot and fuzzy for those who violently violate the law. Here, too, are typical (1) out-of-wedlock children, but this is not a problem and it is considered to be fine; (2) the clerics are portrayed as morally weak people; and (3) even a stoning doctor! Hello? And the reviewers here blow up Hollivood? This is evidence of how secular society has lowered standards in the United Kingdom and Europe in general. Hey, people: at least have a trace of morality, not just Timothy Leary "If you do well, do it" message.
