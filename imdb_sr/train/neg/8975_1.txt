... he said that the couple came out of the cinema as I went in to watch this. Hmm, it's not a good sign, but who knows? However, different moves for different people. Well no. They were kind. Godard has published works that are passionate (obsessive), entertaining (Band of Outsiders), sometimes both (My Life in Live). This is just boring intellectualism, which is very fast on the nerves. During my performance, literally half the audience came out to the end of the film. If only I was so wise.
