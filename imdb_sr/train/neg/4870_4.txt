The movie is bad. Nothing special - just a movie "kid" without serious things. There is one reason to consider this: talking with animals. Some of them are so funny in what they say, you just can not stop laughing. So if you want to hear a dog in a hunting dog who says "I am Keizer Soze," or some other animal that says "You are a dead cat walking" or many other funny bands, you see. Because there is no other good movie to watch. Vote: 4 out of 10
