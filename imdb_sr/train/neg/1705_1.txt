A terrific amateur director (no, not Todd Sheets), his new friend and sister are exploring the cave. A friend and a sister are falling and are being saved. In the meantime, a gang of horrible actors defend their 'lawn'. Whatever it means. This film and I use the term VERI loosely is so bad that ... it's bad. Humor is painfully immortal, "action" is just sad. Now I've seen some terrible terrible horror movies in my time and I have not managed to get out of my way to watch low budget movies, but I still cry openly to anyone who decides to sit through this. ONLY for the hardest maschocysts among you. but the rest is FAST !! <br /> <br /> My Rating: F
