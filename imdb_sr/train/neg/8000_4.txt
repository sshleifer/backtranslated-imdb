I already know that critics and some audiences say it was satire, there were numerous political and social messages, names related to some other names, etc. I can not do such things (I do not want to work anyway) because I'm not interested, I'm interested in "cinema". As for the film itself, it is again said that the film is smart and dramatic. I could not see anything that we do not see in monstrous films except the scene that takes place in the office in the second half. Yes, this scene is about humanity, but that does not make the movie great. The film is fun (gentle) and exciting at some moments or scenes, but no more than that. As far as the biggest drawback of the film is concerned, these are visual effects. It was shocking, I could not gather for a while, because I expected a realistic monster, because it was not one of the old Gojira movies, it was made in 2006, but it's not. It's like you do not believe there's a monster that you do not care about. If you agree with me about this, I recommend Cloverfield which is extremely realistic. The design of the monsters is not interesting, but at least planned, there is an effort. Dramatically powerful criticism. Some critics speak of it as a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it's more drama than a thriller or action, but that does not mean it's dramatically powerful. I do not want to compare Host with other monster movies, but I'm trying to say that Host does not do something that other monster movies do not work on. Otherwise, some people call the movie masterpiece for sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes, I love Asian cinema, but that's a fact.
