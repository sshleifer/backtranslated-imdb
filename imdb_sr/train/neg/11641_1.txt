Although I am generally the advocate of a well-made film, I do not limit myself to films that run from these borders, and most often I enjoy and admire movies that successfully violate rules. And it is quite true that director Pasolini violates the rules of the established film. But my opinion is that he does not interrupt them successfully or at any real point. Pasolini's work is visually disturbing, but it's a minor matter of what's actually on the screen than about a movie, and the jumps of his films seem to be less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinema. This is valid for DECAMERON. Pasolini was often preferred by non-actors, and although many of the directors did so with a remarkable result, under Pasolini's instructions, his non-actors usually remain non-actors. This also applies to DECAMERON. Pasolines often include images designed to shock, offend or otherwise obstruct the audience. Such elements can often be used with a stunning effect, but in Pasolini's hands such elements rarely contribute to the creation of a film. This also applies to DECAMERON. They let me realize that there are many people who love, even admire Pasolini's films. Nevertheless, I have never met anyone with them, and I could never read anything about Pasolini or his works that made me feel such a taste or admiration for me. Judging by his works, I think that he was an amateur director who did not "break the rules" so much as the choice is, such as the lack of skills - and when the intelligence of his time originally greeted "existential courage," simply by confirming it in bad habits like film creator. His work is boring, striking and pretentious. And this is also true for DECAMERON. It is, unfortunately, true for almost every Pasolini film that my disaster lasts.
