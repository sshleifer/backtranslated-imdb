No, not GVB administration, Decider / Strutter / Smirker - already a mini-series "Monarch Cove". The lifetime had to understand what kind of dog it was, because the series was burned in two episodes at the same time, most of them broadcast between 11 hours. Friday night and Saturday mornings. As for why I looked at the whole thing, I can only pray for the weekly sudden attacks of mazohism. Most actors are strangers that will probably remain unknown. The only two distinctive names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Vard, who turn into the only decent performance (Jones fails to go through the whole series - a happy woman). The department, otherwise pretty old from its day, "bird bird". One main thread of complication - who killed a father of a hero who was wrongly convicted of Dad's murder, but was released after six years in prison - has been so long stretched and so urgently concluded that you will not take special care of him follow. There are many "paired" sex, few murders and all kinds of rude behavior - practically none of them is neither interesting nor credible. Most actors are not particularly attractive and definitely not talented. Writing and heading is in line with the actors. If you stick to the end, the postcard is (very small) hand. DISCLAIM YOUR WARNING!
