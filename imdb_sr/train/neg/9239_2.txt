Heavenly Days begin a serious comedy of a faucet dog: desperately wants to teach us a civic lesson, and will not stop until we pass the final exam. Fibber McGee and Molly go to Washington, where they see the senate in action (or inactivity, if you prefer), spit with their senator (Eugene Palette in one of the worst roles in his career), get acquainted with the gaggle of boring stereotyped refugee children, and meet a man on a train reading Henry Vallace's book. Henri Vallace !! A year later, it was thought that he was close to the communist spirit, but in 1944 he was A-OK. Add some really terrible music moments, lots of scary moments and a boring background for news reporters, and you have a film that Philip Vilie must have prepared for writing Generation Vipers 2: D.C. Boogaloo. Drastically unconscious, Heavenly Days are another reminder that the Devil has all the best tunes.
