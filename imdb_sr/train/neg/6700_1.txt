Although such people normally transfer their brain to Hollivood because of these important issues, Hollywood learning can often look fragmented and confusing. Fortunately, Ed is here to teach neo-hippies in the arts of the environment. Here you will learn art to swing your finger in the face of anyone, without losing your trademark. You will learn how to reject logic and science with powerful arguments of fear. You will learn how to stop any human activity that is not of interest to you by marking it as an entry into planetary Armageddon. In addition to learning how to lie on your face, you will also learn how to reject the accusations that made your way no matter how much you are hypocritical. You will be able to use as much energy as Al Gore, and treat you as if you were Amish.

What is Ed waiting for us in the third season? Maybe they will teach us how to judge while we are sleeping!
