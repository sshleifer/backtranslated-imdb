VOV is all I can say if your reading is either viewed or you are thinking about it. Trust me, watch him! So I laughed at so many parts of this movie, that the worst thing ever made is very funny! I can not believe they have set a school sign! I must have played this scene again and again, so that I would laugh more and more each time. If such a film can be made, it gives us all hope in making our own films. Even the costume was bad. It looked like my 7-year-old cousin could do a better job. I bet he could write and act better. All I know is that I have to look at the other part just to see if he was as bad as the first one. it was a good idea of ​​a horrible horror, but a much better job. I hope there will be another killer movie, not just like this one.
