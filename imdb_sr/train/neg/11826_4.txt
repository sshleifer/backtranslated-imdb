Something is sad when you see someone who is so good at something that is trying to do something completely different ... and end up as a central one. I was thinking about Jordan playing baseball, but the same goes for Steve Martin. This film is pretty good acting and directed, but the script is a stink. Martin did a great job adapting the classic comedy story to "Rokanne", but this attempt to bring the contemporary scene into a Victorian drama stinks straight into the wall of incredibility. If you want to see an old story updated with some style, it is best to rent "Great Expectations".
