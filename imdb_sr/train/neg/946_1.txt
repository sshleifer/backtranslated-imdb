Why is this show so popular? It's beyond me why people like it. I think it's one of the worst sitcomes out there. Because it's so popular, I tried it more than once to watch and I can not pass it through the whole episode. terrible. Everyone goes to the point where it's boring to watch. They speak unnatural voices, use unnatural tones and have an unnatural body language. I saw a better acting in a kindergarten school. On the other hand, it's NOT FUN. The plots are boring. They are not creative, intelligent, or fun. Is not the sitcom funny? Why do not I laugh? In the end, what is the seventeen year old? It was approximately authentic until the '70s when the "Happi Dais" was fifty. OH and what about Ashton Kutcher? Who threw this netalent dude? And now the real movies? Oh, save us all! If people think that this is high quality television, it is worrying me.
