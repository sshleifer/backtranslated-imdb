Two houses, one street, one telephone booth, one vehicle, a girl from the neighborhood, a boy in the neighborhood and a zombie. This list of ingredients should be sufficient for a large horror film. All you need is a blue light, ambient music and ... done. Not in the hands of Dutch director van Rouvero! I like to organize a "bad movie evening" from time to time. The concept is really simple: drink some alcohol, invite friends who love the movie, and dive into the worst possible movie theater. For such a night, this peace of dirt is one of the best. Surely laughter! It is bizarre that van Rouveroi still defends his film as if it was a great achievement. To be a witness, you must listen to a comment on a DVD. Again: do not believe and laugh!
