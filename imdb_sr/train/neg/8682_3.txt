I want to start with the statement that I am a Republican, even if I do not agree with the many things that Bush did in the office. And I love the daily show and Colbert's report. They must be two of my favorite shows on TV. I enjoy jokes at Konan, Letterman, Len, because I admit that V is not the smartest guy ever wandering around the country (I believe it's not the dumbest). It's not that funny anymore. I see where it can be funny, and that's it (he's being ridiculed by our authority that is hilarious.) The comedy is central, but only tries to have fun. I think maybe one special episode, but the entire series is just stupid. It seems that CC only speaks the same jokes that we have heard many times. I really do not see this show that lasts for 1 season.
