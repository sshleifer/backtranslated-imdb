Simon Pegg plays Sidney Yang, a stereotypically clumsy idiot Brit, who works as a famous journalist in this American comedy. After a very happy break, he starts working in a highly respected magazine, Sharps, which runs reliably on Jeff Bridges in New York. That's more The Devil wears Prada than Shaun of the Dead. Unbelievable personal interest is provided by Kirsten Dunst, who works well with Pegg for laughter, but they do not set the screen in the fire with their passions. Sydney goes through some emotional challenges while trying to decide whether he should forget his journalistic principles to get the material in the magazine. Of course, he was finally caught up in the glamor and glamor of the world famous people, especially young starlet Sophie Maes (Transformers' Megan Fox). Fans of the Shauna of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced will wonder if Pegg has ever experienced similar feelings in real life with this movie and to some extent Run Fat Boi Run as one of the best British comedic talents who have destroyed the United States. All in all, this is a forgotten comedy. Please, return to Simon, we can forgive and forget.
