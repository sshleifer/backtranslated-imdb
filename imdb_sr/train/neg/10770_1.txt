It can contain possible spoilers (Not that something in this movie is new or will even gently surprise you) Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they've ever done to oblivion? It is sure that it's cheaper for them, but after a while, would not you think that there is an overall quality and the way people think that they would be lost? House Of Villains is a disgusting display of cartoons that make no sense. Some signs of complete neglect of the previous films in this are: Votes do not even match, and Iago is again evil (From when?!) I know these films are direct to the children, but there was a time when everyone could enjoy Disney movies. Even the music number of the film (which was Disney's specialty for years) burst. I would not recommend this film to anyone, even the youngest. All I can do is if more than one movie of the same caliber is published, it's just a matter of time when some small animation studio will outperform Disney in its overall quality.
