I saw this film not knowing anything about it before hand. The action was terrible, and there was not much information. The film did not have a "battle of mind". The actors just released a bite of nonsense, sometimes they made me gash my teeth in agony as they jerked in. The action was predictable, except that in the end there was a homo erotic scene on the stomach (I'm not homophobic, but it got sick from my stomach), even the end was predictable. And the detective can say that Jude is lion in costume, all from a false accent, horrible dental work, hair for costumes, all indicating that it's masking. The whole movie felt like I was wasting my time out of my life. This film had a sense of puppet show with Jude Lav and Michael Caine as a doll, and the house as a window to watch the show, really in my opinion.
