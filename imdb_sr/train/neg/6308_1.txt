Full rating for the content of this film, like Brit, I did not know that there was segregation in the US Navy during World War II. A very brave attempt to bring this fact into the world. However, the film is pathetic, the direction does not exist, the acting is wooden and the scenario is only one clich√© after another. I can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I sat and squeezed from start to finish in a very bad way that this was done. This could have been a great movie, the story for many of us outside the US was new, unique and interesting. A sad fact is the way it is compiled. It is sad that a true story like this, which could change the attitudes of people, has collapsed into a low-budget, poorly directed film. I just hope that for some time in the future, one of the main studies will take this topic and make justice.
