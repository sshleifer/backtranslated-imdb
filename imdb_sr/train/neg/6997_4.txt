I watched this with a growing sense of discomfort. Why would God, in the form of Ian Hunter, help these specific people in their attempt to escape from Devils Island? And what did he do there at all? I mean, I know God works in mysterious ways, but helping the thieves and murderers and prostitutes to redeem, forgive, and change the heart in such a forgotten place ... Whatever Gable has in charm is missing in this portrait of a completely selfish man, Crawford is as dear as and always, ie. To me, in general, and the whole appearance of the film seems to seem to have been made. years earlier. Compared to contempered films such as Stagecoach and Mr Deeds Goes to Tovn, this looks pre-historic.
