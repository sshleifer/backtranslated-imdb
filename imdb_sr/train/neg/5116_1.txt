Today I rented this movie thinking that it could be a good football movie, because I am a great football fan. Boy, am I wrong? This film is too religious and unbelievable, and it's really unrealistic. This movie says to a large extent that if your Christian can get everything you want in life easily, like becoming a big footballer! You do not become a great footballer by becoming a Christian and asking God, you do it through practice and hard work. All you have to do is ask God and give you anything ... Puh-lease. It's not true at all. I laughed a few times about that shame. The only part that was ridiculous was when they were stupid (Shultz cartoonist? No, the guy who flew over the Atlantic, etc. etc.), But really this film was not so big. I do not recommend it, especially if you are not a Christian, lol.
