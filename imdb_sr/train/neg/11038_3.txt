I've always written this series as a complete stinking fest because Jim Belushi was involved in this, and hardly. But then one day a tragic accident happened. At the end of the game Vhite Sok, I realized that the remote control was somehow on the other side of the room. Now I could just get up and walk over the room to get to the remote, or even to the TV to turn the channel. But why then would not they just get up and walk around the country to watch TV in another country? "Nuts on it," I said. That's why I decided to hold on to the couch and take whatever fate gave me. What fate had in her hands was the episode of this show, an episode I remember very little, except that I once again made a very broad, general, thorough judgment based on zero objective or experimental evidence without anything that would support my opinion and more Once I was absolutely right! This show is a total rough pie! Belushi has all comic delivery of a hologram fog horn. Women are physically attractive, but too much Stepford is to cause any real feeling from the viewer. There is absolutely no reason to stop running from a local TV station with a can of petrol and a flame thrower and send every copy of this joke back to hell. Apart from the wonderful comic styles of Larry Joe Campbell, an American actor. This guy plays Belushi's son-in-law, Andi, and he's gold. How real is he really? Well, apart from being ridiculous, his job is that Belushi looks good. It's like trying to make nipples look good. But Campbell takes him with style. Someone should invent the Nobel Prize for comics in order to win it every year. Without Larry Joe, this show would consist of a slightly executed Courtney Thorne-Smith who hit Belushi over his head with a tug as he intermittently hit his chest and played a straw on the floor of the cage. 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell has been named Comedic Bacon because it improves the taste of everything in it!
