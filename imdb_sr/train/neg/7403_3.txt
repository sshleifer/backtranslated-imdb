This was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's about as much as I can say about it. It starts with a good atmosphere; the hospital is appropriately sterile and alienating, the mood is set to "spooky". And then ... nothing. Well, something. Only something that obviously does not fit ... and there are no efforts to clarify the connection between bizarre, not particularly scary animals, and the hospital they have taken. I mean, come on, motorcyclists? Some band was watching too much Guar. My personal favorite was the demon head, which looks pretty like a middle-aged truck driver who desperately tries to threaten, while at the same time he looks as if he likes to stoop to the sofa covered by Afghanistan, unwind the belt, pop a tin of cheap beer ( probably Schlitz) and watching the game. Frankly, I saw far more terrible trucks. On trucks. Drinks coffee. VVVvoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Terrible! Other monsters are even more scribbled and even scary. At least, on DVD, videos give some explanation of their presence at the hospital ... they seem to have appeared randomly in places, played a metal bin, and made people die a little. Excepting a few good special effects and acting it is not quite terrible given the lack of decent writing, there is nothing. It's just a backdrop movie.
