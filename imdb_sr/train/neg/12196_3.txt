The actors really did a good job - especially to their mother. However, as the film progressed, I discovered that I was watching more because of their acting, not because I was least worried about people. And sometimes I felt nervous about the irresponsible and incessant approach to parenthood that was repeated and shown again. The daughter is a 17-year-old shallow skunk whose main wish is the bedding of famous men and becomes a dance nifet (complete with a lot of "shaking of prey"). The son is a low-self-respecting guy who looks very desperate for a relationship and friends - so much that he later threw a drug party in the movie. Both husband and wife are boring, but rather than to bring energy into their established relationship, they would rather seek new partners (although a woman chooses poorly because she is a man who is "cast" by accidentally gay - OOPS!). I just felt that ALL characters should grow up and that it was difficult for them to take care of such shallow asses. I think that the author's attempt was to show the ultimate banality and emptiness of the capitalist system. However, bearing in mind that these characters are NOT typical of an average Western family, it looks dishonest.
