I am an Irishman and I live in Denmark for some time, so I was looking forward to returning last week so that I could see the intermission. And I'll go to the record: </ i> THIS FILM IS RED. It does not stand there with other Irish films such as The Commitments, I Vent Dovn or Michael Collins. But the film is completely wrong. Bouncing around the camera and constantly zooming, zooming try to give the movie a sharp look as if it's a dreadful drama. But it's not. This is Ireland Lock, Stock and Your Smoking Barrels and should be shot like this. It should have a smooth movement from one to the other. The film just looks messy and thrown together. The performances are fine, given the horrible script. My friend told me it was like they were following Colin Farrell in Dublin for a week. He gives a decent view as Dublin Dirtbag, but it can not be compared with his performances in Minoriti Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. The best performance was from Dierdre O'Kane who plays a sexually frustrated middle-aged woman who just left her bank manager for a younger woman. I think he should leave his terrible standing and focus more on his acting. to even be considered one of the best Irish films ever. I expect the reaction from these comments because most of the people I talked with have said it was great. But before you answer, ask yourself: Would you think so highly of this film that it was set up in England or America?
