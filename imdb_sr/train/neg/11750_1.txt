the guy who wrote, directed and stared at this shocking piece of garbage, should consider the change of care. Yes, Rob Stefaniuk, I mean you! Seriously, who financed this shit? there are so many talented writers who can spend better money. I think the idea is great, but the acting, script and direction is simply terrible! Jokes are not so funny, I understand that they should take Mickey. But do it with style, this movie screams in 1995 on Saturday night live. Why, I say again, why the studios give money to hacks like Rob Stefaniuk - DO NOT GIVE COMEDY The ability to write DIRECT AND STARS IN YOUR FILM. GHOST!
