San from the Maven art house. Preclinated, overrated, exaggerated; pretentious melancholy who not only did not deserve the best picture from 1951, but from the very beginning surpassed the competition. A place in the sun, a Detective story, a tram called Desire, Abbott and Costello Meet the invisible man; If you say '51, it's better than this arthouse crapol. The final ballet is a trap for an intellectual audience, out of place and in the wrong movie. Few actors at that time were less capable (acting) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. My # 12 Worst of '51 (I've seen 201 movies), and among the 5 worst winners on Oscar.
