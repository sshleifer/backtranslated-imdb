First of all I would like to say that if I had to respect this film from 1 to 10 then I would give it -4. It's not that I am a strong critic, only the film is bad. Everything from a story, to directing, to editing is terrible. The story is not even half decent for starters (you can not expect much because it's based on a video game, something that I was not aware that I would enter the movie), but the direction and editing made it worse. The film crashes at inconvenient points and goes into scenes that are completely unconnected with the previous one; Some, like a quick sexual scene in the middle, do not even make sense in the story, seeing the characters do not show any feelings to each other. You could enter this film, expecting to see a bunch of bullshit on the screen for an hour and a half, and you would still be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay to watch this movie, then you lose your money, and if you do not pay anything, you still lose your watch for your life. So do yourself a favor and do not look at it.
