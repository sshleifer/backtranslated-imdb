I said that I want to become a specialist for bad films of all the decades, so I decided to start this film. It was a pretty good choice. I went into this adventure to find some lost gems and incomprehensible masterpieces, but I did not see anything similar in this mess in pastel colors. So far I have not really watched many bad films, but I have the feeling that this is what is called "so bad that it is good," probably because it is so unintentional funny fun! First of all, there are inaccuracies. There are land inaccuracies, physical inaccuracies, and psychological inaccuracies. The latter are especially crazy as Van Damme's ass in that blue spandex. There are extremely sticky lines and I will not even start to talk about some hilarious action moves. It's not a bad act of all involved in that hot mess of film, except in one particular case. Geoffrey Levis looks totally pathetic like Frank, which is a totally stupid figure. And, to be honest, I was really surprised to see Van Damme perform a decent job playing twins. He managed to achieve a different tone and mood in the two roles that were convincing to me. But the film was mostly very bad, and sadly it was produced by a large film studio ... which is now in bankruptcy.
