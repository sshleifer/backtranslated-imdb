** Spoilers contained ** ** I heard from various sources that this film is controversial and that the ending is particularly terrible. What I did not expect was a complete change in tactics from twenty minutes. What starts out as a typical cowboy / Indian western suddenly descends into a very boring romantic comedy about Honus (Soldier Blue in the title of Petra Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen) who escaped Cheienne's cavalry attack. Most of the films then focus on these two unmanaged people, that is, romantic comedy. Donald Pleasance then appears and takes them both for no apparent reason. Then they run away and both appear (separately) at the base of the cavalry before the attack on the Shane base. When Cresta was married to one of the Sheffield bosses, she escaped from the horses' base and joined them. So far, it's so common. Then the end comes. After more than an hour of poor acting behavior, including clich√©s, they will / will not get a story, then the film turns into superb exploitation, including, among other things, the cutting of the head and the child that is killed in the backbone. Similarities can also be drawn with Vild Bunch at this moment of the film, but Vild Bunch kept the same tone as a whole and did not resort to extreme unscrupulous violence. In a way, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry's Last Summer, who also completely changed the shock for a shock. I did not hate Soldier Blue, nor did I find an end that was particularly disturbing, but I realized that it was pretty boring with an unnecessarily violent ending. If you want to watch a movie with a really disturbing massacre of innocents, I'd recommend that you come and see Elema Klimova.
