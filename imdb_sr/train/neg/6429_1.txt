I would personally advise people to stay away from this movie. All in all, it's a borehole for watching and the fighting is poorly choreographed. It's slow and not very convincing. If you buy a DVD release of this movie in Hong Kong Legends, then the only thing to listen to is the audio comment Bei Logan. But in any case, ever since he was a Ninja movie watching. I can not think of one and I do not want to. All in all, when it comes to movies, I have one golden rule: Avoid movies that contain the word 'Ninja'.
