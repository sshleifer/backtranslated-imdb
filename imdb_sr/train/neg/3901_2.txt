The scenario is fine. Although casting is absolutely invisible. No style. costumes do not look like some of High Highbury. Comparing Gvineth Paltrow and Kate Beckinsale, I can only say that Ms. Beckinsala speaks better of British English than Ms. Paltrow, although in the act of Mrs. Paltrow, the nature of Emma Voodhouse itself is. Mr. Nortam is undoubtedly the best g. Knightlei from all versions, he's romantic and is not at all sharp and insensitive like Mr. Knightley in the TV version. The viewer does not even see Mr. Elton. The development of Smith's relationship as it was in the moving version so that it can not be understood where Emma tried to make the Elton-Smith Sword (except the portrait).
