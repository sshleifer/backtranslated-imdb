I will not say this film is bad, but it was not even good. I expected something good, but I guess Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than this. This was completely old-fashioned. At every stage of this film, I was hoping for some sort of thing and what would I get? The girl burns and gets the love of her aunt. In spite of being engaged, they need to get permission for every little move they make. They are so scared even after so many meetings. I expected aunt would be a lot more brutal than that. Everything she was doing was crazy. Hey, we have children, but we do not look at them and we always have tears in our eyes. This film is a dream. A happy family, a cruel woman, a good family, and a man who likes to die. In HAHK, Anupam Kher was the father of a poor bride and now is the other way around. And somehow I knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway, I believe I spent my time. I give her 2/10.
