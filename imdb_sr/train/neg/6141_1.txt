One night I waited for my friends to return to apt and "Gimkata" happened to be on; I watched him too much. It's really hilarious and terrible, really. Think about it this way - if you had some idea of ​​something so bad in your job and continued to perform it in such an awesome way as this, how long would it last? Not like this movie. It had to be seen, obviously.
