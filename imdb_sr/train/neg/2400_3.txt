No, this was not one of the ten worst movies of the 1980s, but certainly it's at the bottom 100 somewhere. This movie looks like it was put on a shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981. In order to explain the special effects before the "American Weeks in London" drama, the disco is still considered cool, and Ronald Reagan the 40th President of the United States? While we are on this, let's not ignore those hairstyles from the 1970s in the fifties and sixties. I saw more than that in "Happi Dais" and "Laverne & Shirley" together. One woman who raised this film to "such a bad, good" category, was too late. , great Elizabeth Hartman, but barely. Biff plays like Miss Montgomery, a high school professor who becomes sexy, a stereotype that is done to death, and Hollivood is still ejected, but even as a "hot girl" retains her mice qualities. Her call for help is proof of that. It also looks much better than Miss Vimp. "Seven dollars in the beauty salon, shot in hell." She did not joke. This does not mean that in other places there are no good parts, they are only a little and far, and I am not saying it just because I like Hartman. By the way, "Teen Wolf" was better than this. "Teen Volf Too" was better than this, which was not very good. <br /> <br />
