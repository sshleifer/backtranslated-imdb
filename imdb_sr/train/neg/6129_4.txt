Judging by this film and the GREAT MAN, made that same year, I would not put Harry Langdon to the top of a list of great comedians with a quiet screen. There simply is not enough. Maybe he was on his way to developing his style, but sabotaged himself by taking his serious first successes too seriously. In any case, all his tricks are reminiscent of larger ridiculous men, but they lack the acrobatic skills of Keaton and the enormous imagination of Lloyd. He also undermines his own personality by dressing and walking like ÄŒaplin's skitical character. His trademarks are child's innocence, shyness of approach, and tendency not to react accidentally by looking into confusion, kicking the eyes or touching the lips with the tip of the index finger. The comedy in Langdon's films is the result of a fate that throws various obstacles on its way, trying to overcome in weak or naive ways or with a minimum of physicality, such as throwing stones on a tornado approaching to drive it, raising a building that collapsed two -to-four or dodge the bulldogs raising their legs by rolling beneath it. In this story, about the son of a shoemaker who joins a racing race to advertise the footwear of a rival company, manages to win with a mere luck. There is nothing here that has not been done much better than the Big Three.
