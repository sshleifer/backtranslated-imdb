I loved this film, I admit. This is the best video I've ever seen. Well ... me and my friend decided to just giggle that we would rent this movie. We knew what to expect and we just got what we expected, plus more. When Saskuatch struck the tree, we literally watched that part about three to four times, it was incredible (hysterical, of course). And why? Oh, why the main character has to roll so much? As honestly, we know that you are in danger, that this will not help much. But really, if this movie is in your local video RENT IT. It's worth the money and it's not even as bad as it's bad, but not very bad. All in all, the complete stunning will be ready for you if you rent this movie.
