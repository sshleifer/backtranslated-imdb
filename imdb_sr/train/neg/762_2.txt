Loyalty to Peter Falk is all that prevented me from this horrible picture (1) deserving. (As far as loyalty to Mr. Falk was concerned, it was what prevented me from watching this film from head to tail.) Even if you forgave all obvious mistakes, this was only the poorest excuse for the made TV. Columbo movie ever. I'm glad to watch it free on TV; I would not like to cough for money.
