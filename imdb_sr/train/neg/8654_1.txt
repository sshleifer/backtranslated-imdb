The film was totally misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was the overflow of Joeseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, the river was replaced by a road, and the boat became Jeep and Valter Kurtz Osama. The claims on the outside of the DVD box were obvious frauds to take this fictitious death of the journalist as factual while some parts have Muslims supporting attacks on September 11 for US actions against Muslims around the world. I warned the Video Store that the film should be removed from the Documentary section and placed in a war and drama field for quasi-fictitious displays of actual events.
