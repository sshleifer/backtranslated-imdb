I saw this film in its own time period, when the baby outside the marriage not only destroyed your life, but also left your child as a bastard. In these days of 'single mothers' it may seem very unrealistic, but it was very true. And I'm not crazy to laugh at someone who was stuttering. Between these two problems I had the difficulty of making this movie funny. Then I did not know who directed it or what a beautiful reputation it had. I knew who Betty Hutton was, and she made me nervous because she was so frenetic. I loved "Bringing Up Babi", but this movie seems unpleasant to me. I'm sure that the blow on some church functions was probably pile up, but I was the one to drink after I looked at this again. The idea that a girl must drink to get married and get pregnant has just added hardship. A whole city could turn to you under these circumstances, so the outcome of this movie is a really funny part. Of course, shoot me, I do not even like "It's a wonderful life".
