Terrible !!! I do not want to be too negative, but this movie has an IK stupid monkey. What a disaster. I just could not believe how bad this movie is. just terrible, music sometimes like a soundtrack for Lavrence of Arabia, I just watched this movie to see how much worse it can get. Some of the "actors" on the side are a total disaster. which can hang down on my body, falls to the ground. Harvei Keitle is an excellent actor, but he knows that he may be involved in a fiasco film in a financial crisis. . . . . this film was to be presented to all students in all film schools just to teach them a lesson how not to film
