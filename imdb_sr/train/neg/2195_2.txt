A brain that would not have died is a horrible movie that stinks from introductory credits. It has all the classic signs of a bad one: incredible line, terrible acting, low-quality sets and lighting. The drawn line goes like this: When the doctor and his fianc√©e are caught in an accident, she gets rid of himself and he lifts his head and takes her to his laboratory, where she places her head in a container with a special fluid that keeps it. alive. I bet that Virgnina Leath, who played her head in a pan, had to spend a lot of embarrassing time wearing that bowl around her neck and crouched under the table. In any case, the doctor is trying to find her new body, and hire two strippers to choose a new body. It's bad all the way, so bad it was torn to the Mystery Science Theater 3000.
