This is another big screen for the American television show of the sixties. It was amusing enough, but it was a lot for the formula. Intelligent Marines land on Earth and meet not too bright people, in his opinion. She gets a girlfriend next to her, Hannu. This is a nice trip for some nice Hollywood stars that I have not seen for a while. Good enough to pass. a little free time if you have nothing better to look at.
