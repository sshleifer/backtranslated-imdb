I've seen it recently and, I must say, I was shaken by the factual basis of the story. However, "Holly" as a movie did not quite succeed. However, I am looking forward to watching the documentaries produced by the producers who organized this project, because I think it would be a much more interesting work from this film. The international band consisted of B actors, but their acting was appropriate, and I must mention in particular the young actress who acted Holly. This was her first film role and she did a very good job, since she is the most demanding part. Ron Livingston was adequate, but carefree as Patrick, an American whose quest to "save" Holly, but Chris Penn was good at his final stint. Unfortunately, despite my mostly positive opinion of Virginie Ledoien and Udo Kier, both actors were very forgetful and did not do the best they did in this movie. but I have to be fair, so I estimate the Holly 3 stars based on his shortcomings as a movie. But I think the topic deserves serious consideration and I am pleased that the people behind this film have made a documentary that I hope will debut on the BBC and other TV networks.
