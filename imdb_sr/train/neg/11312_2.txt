This film deserves recognition for its original approach. Combines the elements of theater, film and epic narration. Unfortunately, it falls at all levels. The greatest weakness of the films is the unwillingness to dedicate anything; she has camp, moralistic and epic elements, and she has never devoted any of them. As for the story itself, Chretien de Troies turns into a tomb on this terrible adaptation that turns a lovely, unbearably innocent Percival into the most suitable and harsh church. This, Francophiles or Arthuriophils. Speaking as one of the latter, I considered the movie an invisible and incredibly dashing, dishonest treatment of a wonderful story.
