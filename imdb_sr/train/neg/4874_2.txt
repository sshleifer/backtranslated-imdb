Too bad either neither the animal nor Eddie Murphy had anything to say. this film is bland. Children's movie? Well, if you're trying to make them sleep, then maybe. It's only 90 minutes of some sharply poor animation of animal lips for jokes that are not funny. And the synchronization of lips makes old Godzille films greatly done in comparison. In the meantime, Eddie "Pluton Nash" Murphi runs with a suppressed underestimated delivery that is painful for the experience. Apparently, he is trying to modify his old manic personality, but what? In short, all the magic and wonder of the original version of 1967 are lost in this re-imagining, or whatever it is. The city wants to abuse some forest creatures and blame them for bad things. Not really. And Pluto Neos can fight with them. Things are in the chain along with some stagnant scarves to a boring, non-inspiring conclusion without surprise. Or some old caricatures of Iogi Beara.
