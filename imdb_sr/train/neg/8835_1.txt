Before I watched this movie, I read a review stating that this movie could be one of the best movies ever! ha ha Scene after stage tension grows fine ... from boring characters in this movie. From a little girl who talks nonsense and tries to drown a little boy, the killer is just running around without any notice (and who was the guy on the beach who talked to the little boy!) .. things just happen and then they leave without answers in this movie . As I watched, the film seemed to go in one direction, then it just does not go anywhere, but in a new direction ... and on and on ... The idea is excellent, but writing is terrible. Every character, in every scene, says or does something so incredible, unrealistic, and the reactions of other actors are simply strange. There are no resolutions about the problems that developed during the film, which makes it a confusing and finally a great waste of time.
