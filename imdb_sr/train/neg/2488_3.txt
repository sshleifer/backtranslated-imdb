What an incomprehensible mess of the movie. Something about a policeman who pulls bullets out of him after being shot and holding them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and the size of a vessel he killed about fifty times) and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who, for some reason, to Mexico. Whether they are intentionally sent there or are really really lost is never clear. And you will never hear another scenario word butthorn. Gary Busei is testing Mel Gibson's role as "Lethal Veapon," and while Busei is a suitable actor, the script curses the whole film to the center. William Smith is once again a Russian soldier, the same character who played in "Red Dawn" a few years earlier. After playing the biker helicopter during most of the 70's, it was nice to see him expanding his line playing communist loads. Unfortunately, he will always be best remembered as a man Clint Eastwood sneaks into "Every Way You Can".
