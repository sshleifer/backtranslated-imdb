Please do not waste your time. This film rehashes the worst of Bram Stoker's Dracula (Van Helsing), Anne Rice Vampire Lestat (rock music and silly biblical references), and Blade (high-tech toys). I really love vampire movies and novels, and there are many who are very good. But not this stinker. Even a soundtrack does not help, mainly because the movie turns ridiculous scary classical music, not the "kick-ass metal" that some have reported. Only a few times I heard some metal; It was mostly tortured violin. Avoid it as a garlic and crust.
