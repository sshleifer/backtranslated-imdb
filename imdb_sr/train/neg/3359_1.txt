They screwed up this story! In the end, Nell is heroic and takes it to save all of their hips from Hill House and a bunch of nonsense like that! They added heads that were chopped, wires to cut the face, and the ceiling turned into a huge hand! What the hell is that? I have and I love the original movie, I read the book and I love it! The reason why the original movie and the book are so great is because they are so scared of you, and you do not even show the spirit. No worse. No ceilings. Only a ghost's spirit can kill a person. They can not kill us, they can not throw us in the room or drag us into the night. Not. They can get rid of us. We subtract all our sense of security. Nell was a selfish woman. She just wanted good things for herself. Yes, she was a little concerned about others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont dare to this great story! I hate this goddamn remake!
