If it smells like rubbish, it must be a garbage. This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Poor directing style Tony Scott is embarrassing already an unintelligible and somewhat untrue story about Domino Harvey's life as a head hunter. The story is completely disconnected and confusing to watch. Certain aspects of the action were ridiculous and completely incredible. It seems that all action scenes were loosely connected with bad plots and terrible acting. Still, Keira Knightley is completely naked in this. It's the only and only way to watch this movie. If you want to see her naked, just swipe the film up to an hour and a half, and catch a lot of nipples. I strongly suggest that nobody sees this EVER! </ 3
