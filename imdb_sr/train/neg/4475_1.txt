terrible, just terrible! my old maid looked at this garbage and it cured me. The book is one of my favorites and it's a shame that some people will never find out how it really is because their first impressions are from such a shake. so much has changed that it is barely recognizable. which confuses me, because the book is read as a soap opera anyway, providing enough food for modern entertainment. It's like one of those Lifetime movies that say "based on a true story," but they're totally fictional. there is not any emotion or depth of the book, just a foolish melodrama. If you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading, I suggest you try the second version.
