In the recent biography of Alec Guinness, I could not find too much about it in Paris with love. I'm sure Guinness has made a movie to get a free trip to Paris. The film has no other reason for existence. Paris, of course, was beautifully photographed by the wonderful opening of Guinness and his son, who drives down the Champs Elisee with Arc De Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately, it goes downhill. Between Ginis and young girls with whom a brief connection in Paris is concerned, there is no chemistry. According to a recent Guinness biography by Piers Paul Reade, Guinness positively liked the girl, believing that her behavior was unprofessional. As for what Odile Vernois thought of her co-star, there was no record. They have as much chemistry as two castrated cats. Guinness has a good moment in a movie that was straight from one of his Ealing comedy while climbing the tree trying to get a badminton ball. But I would not wait for a movie for that. At least Alec from work got a trip to Paris.
