In this film, old Amitabh Bachchan again fall in love with a much younger woman. She meets her at the restaurant. The younger woman, Tabu, flirts with him. He does not know what to do and he asks them to go out. Her reaction to his call is pretty strange. It should have been ridiculous. And that makes me annoy because of this whole movie. It was not so funny. Jokes and scripts were terrible! The only jokes I liked were about the waiter's waist, but after a few times, even it began to be eaten. This was a weird connection! A girl with the mind of an old woman! It was scary! I know that someone can be tied to a child, but this man has conversations with adults with this child. It did not make any sense. Taboo's father is Paresh Raval. He needs to give Amitabh a difficult time, but we all know Paresha, he can not do it. And even the conversation in the end, when sitting around the table, even it should have been ridiculous. Just love movies that are really funny. I suppose I will never watch this movie anymore.
