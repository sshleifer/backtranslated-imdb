You must be kidding !!!! Let's entertain the possibility that Parker Posei is really an actress, not just some role in the "role of the monthly club" of the actors. Really, unless this should be a satire in the language of David Mamet - a crazy, confusing dialogue that alternately appears in the speed of a machine gun or monotonous (I mean Ben Stein) innocence - or a straight, dry comedy; this film must be in the race for the Rotten Tomato Award --- or worse. As if the stiff and unpleasant Posei were not enough, we have a bigger and more unfavorable Jeff Goldblum. There are more wood in this film than a toothpick factory. By adding already bizarre casting, there are also several other roles that are filled with unforgettable actors who look or sound like fugitives from the American Nekt Top Model, Don Pardo, or even a kid who pronounces the word " bio "as" beans ", which only draws attention to the fact that in the film so little likes, we analyze his emphasis on assuming that he is Canadian or not !! I think I laughed from my heart in places that were supposed to be serious, and I seriously understood the sections that were intended to be humorous. Even the soundtrack sounds like the Alaric Jans music caricature for Mamet's "House of Games". If taken as a hoax, the film is almost gone; if you take a serious, self-conscious piece of shit.
