Not wanting to be a killer, Brad Sikes is responsible for at least two boring and clich√©ped films that I've ever seen - that's one of them, and Camp Blood is another. The acting is terrible, the print is bad, and everything about this movie screams "seriously, you can do better". Perhaps this is a challenge for everyone to sow ioutube their own zombie-related crap? I bought this for 1 pound, but remember, you can not put the price on 71 minutes of your life. It would be a good idea to avoid this party, even at a good price in the basement.
