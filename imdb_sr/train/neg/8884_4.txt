"Dominicus" is one of those films for which the "slow-like-molasses" had to be invented. Too many endless and repeating sequences (how many times do we see Robertson walking slowly down the stairs as he hears someone playing piano?). ALMOST was eventually rewarded with a surprising turn, which, unfortunately, was accompanied by another turning-off that only managed to leave a bad taste in our mouth. It's not a very nice movie.
