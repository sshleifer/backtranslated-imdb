The heart of this film was in the right place, no matter where its brain is. "Attack" is basically fake la "Avion!" (two years before the fact - it's nice to go) about what happens when vegetables, or in this case, fruits, attack. Through every kind of movie magic (stop motion, papier-mache tomatoes on skateboards, reverse shooting, people who watch tomatoes outside the screen, people throw a tomato-size basketball to actors on the screen), tomatoes really attack everyone in to his own grip. Then it's up to Mason Dickon (Miller) and a group of spies that I would not want on the part of any government to save the day. Of course, there is also a journalist (Tailor) who appears at the worst moment, dancing and singing army soldiers, Japanese scientists with voices, a guy who pulls a parachute and a samurai sword ... and yes, San Diego Chicken before making a big . The bumps here are not really great. In fact, you probably could better get better after you watched them. Some of the dialogues are unmistakably bad ("Please, pass the ketchup" - do not say anything in front of the tomatoes.) And as for the "puberty love" ... well, I can not blame the tomato for listening to it. What is good about it? Well, I liked the thematic song and the initial credits, and there was a scene with four people on the phone at one time which was pretty well performed. ... that is all. Three stars. It's not a "Killer" comedy, but it's trying. Rock on, Peace.
