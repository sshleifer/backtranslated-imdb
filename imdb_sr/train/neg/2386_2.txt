I missed this movie at the cinema, but I had some idea behind the head that it was worth a look, so when I saw it on DVD shelves, I thought "I have time to watch it." Big mistake! Long list stars can not save this party, certainly one of the worst movies ever. An incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly represented. Perhaps I would have more sense to read Robbins' novel, but if the film is not completely different from the novel, and if Robbins helps in the script, I doubt it, the novel will have to be a painful reading. Br /> I hope that the actors were well paid because they looked embarrassing that in this scattering of celluloid and later in the last time the DVD gap, take for example Pat Morita. Even Thurman has the grace that sometimes looks embarrassing. Take about 98 minutes of your life for something more valuable, such as trimming nails on your feet or sorting a socket drawer. Even when you see it in "below $ 5", throw it in a garbage can in your local store, resist desire!
