This movie had to be the worst horror film I've ever seen. The act was terrible, horrible and cheesy and she was talking about a predictable action! I will never watch this movie again, nor will I recommend this film to anyone. What a waste of time! First, as soon as the film started, I realized what I got into. All they did for this movie was to copy scenes from many other horror films and fit them all into this movie. Telephone calls for a joke, night witches, a psycho and a knife! It's absolutely funny. I was not scared at all during the film, which I thought I should do horror films. As for filming, it's pretty funny how everyone talks about how this film was so big and so terrifying. I mean, you do not realize that the movie is a cheap download from "Scari Movie" for example. At least some of them get good actors there, and then they might be downloaded as a good horror movie.
