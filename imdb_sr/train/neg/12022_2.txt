The idea of ​​a story is great. Unfortunately, execution puts it down. The film lacks the pace, for one thing. It should be an exciting ride, but it's slow and more than boring. I think the problem is mainly in the script and installation. There are not enough obstacles and reversals to shake the tension, and there are also scenes that do not actually move the story very efficiently. major revrite. Unfortunately, when it's a producer and writer and director, this will obviously not happen. Many acting looks like an apartment, and it's up to the director - all the actors have quite competent in other projects. It's a shame, because with better writing, editing and directing it could be a really good thriller.
