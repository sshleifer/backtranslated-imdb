Maybe I'm out of date or I just do not know how Electra is in current publications ... But Electra I read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan. Usually she used others to do her dirty work, and more often she was involved in some kind of double cross. Just when you think that you understand everything, it pulls the wool over your eyes and gets its way. This film was quite weak in the dialogue, the acting was not particularly convincing, and the action was tough. I was really looking for something more like the model of Frank Miller's "Electra Assassin" book. What is much darker than anything in this movie. Special effect where cool, the action was interesting from time to time, but more often than story and plot were slow or illogical. The hand was not scary enough, and Electra was not ... pretty nasty. She's the girl you love to hate ... but in this story, I did not care.
