Inconsistent confusion with gracefully deafening sound, "Soul Survivors" is the latest entry into the genre of horror films "Who Is Dead and Who Is Alive". Two teenage couples, Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel, are preparing to go to different colleges, but before they go to the Thanksgiving break, they attend one last throw at a rave-type party in a burned church at the suggestion of Slutti Annabel ( Eliza Dushku, aka Faith, the second killer of the vampire). Motiveless creepy guys begin to pay too much attention to Cassie (generic Melissi Sagemiller) for reasons that have never been explained, and soon, the Quartet leaves the party. Driving in his SUV, they were persecuted and then walked past those without motives, who quickly and unexplainedly did 180 deliberately in the middle of the highway, causing a fatal and fatal accident as the SUV rolled over the embankment and plunged into the river. Sean was killed (or is he?), And Cassie spends the rest of the film to deal with loneliness and guilt (vehicles) when not pursuing Sean's spirit or being persecuted by those motives of angry lads. Much inexplicable non-conformity follows how Cassie's mental state further degenerates, until we arrive at a predictable conclusion. So, who is dead and who is alive? After ninety minutes of this purgatory, who cares?
