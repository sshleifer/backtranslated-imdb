I think shots and lighting were very bad. When I first looked at it, I thought it was an old version (1956). When I really learned the right year of the film, I was shocked. I did not know that such a bad movie was so recently made. That's really all I wanted to say. This film, however, had a good plan, nothing you could not miss if you simply read the novel written by George Orvelll. All I want to say is, apart from this: I can not believe that this movie may have received so many awards and nominations. made. Well, that's all. So long
