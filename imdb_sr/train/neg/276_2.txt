The characters are clickable and predictable, and all are either snow-white or completely pure. The act is too stiff to be bad in a fun way. It is doubly disappointing if you are a lover of Bette Davis, because her character is not a typically amusing character of the type Bette-Davis; In fact, neither my wife nor I found a movie that would be interesting, mobile or pleasant at all.
