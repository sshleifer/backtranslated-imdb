No matter what someone tells you, there is only the fact that the word "possession" in film circles - such as "what took you to light up the movie?" Religion has nothing to do with common sense. That is, if your head is clean and you are a healthy mind to judge. Star? Story? A unique idea? A friendly movie that kids would love with dinosaurs and blacks? Oh my God! I'm sure it was an "idea," she sounded good. But somewhere in the course of development ... one should have emphasized where the idea can not be turned into a party that someone would like to see or pay ... unless they were deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and saw something that did not stay us could see. Regardless, this is a complete mess. Disorder, mess - sin and confusion. Who cares about the plot (what complication?) Et al. Vhoopie got a salary, but it would be embarrassing for me to take it. I hope she fired her agent / manager / publicist for this career move. Obviously not, she continued to make more bad films. And more bad movies. USA.
