Hi, I am a friend of the insect films, and when I saw Darkwolf's title hitting the shelves, I was like "hmm, a simple and nice name to him at least. But ... I wonder why I have not heard of it before." < First of all, the film starts with boobs. Much sucking. Sisters have invested heavily in this movie. Who cares for the effect of the insect, just pay for actresses enough to shoot in toples! So, about the mysterious character of dark wolves (a little ahead, but to whom it really cares ...) He is your average everyday biker. It does not even look very hard, but as the old wise woman says in the film, "he's far more powerful and dangerous than you ever faced." Just describing her tattooed biker. Pretty original. I even looked at the first time I used "red shiny eyes" SPECIAL EFFECTS! I think of my god, that the effect of "some-plant-red-point-to-eye-with-computer" has been used since the seventies. It looks ugly here! And do not start me with a 3D-CGI insect. As said, like a bad and old video game. And in the end, as I like the inferno films, as I said. They often build their own legend of a werewolf. Darkwolf builds a world of insects, some stupid legends of hybrid insects and an ancient bloodline. BUT. Almost immediately after creating the rules of engagement, "a dark wolf kills anyone whom a girl touched" begins randomly. What just does not make sense, why even try to tell us the rules of killing, when they will not even play them ... Aplus footwork footage is made with Sony Handicam or similar, recording mostly floor and walls. Just add the noise and you have the effect of super insect. The blood is partially OK. But when a wolf cuts out every hand with an open hand, just by placing a hand on the top of the victims, it just does not make a trick for me ... Indeed, who gives money to make these piles of garbage straight-on- video horrortitles, they are not even funny-kind of bad films, only sad.
