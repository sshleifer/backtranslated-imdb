This movie has all the labels of too many cooks that spoil the goulash. Based on Shielah Graham's autobiography, it seems like a force that can not be abandoned well. They could not decide whether it would be Graham's story or Fitzgerald's story, and how much should it soften the pedals of what turned out to be a story. So, a movie that could have been a story about two fascinating (Fitzgerald) and notorious figures (Ms. Graham) becomes a gloomy fragmented soap opera, which she is telling us little about. In addition, there is absolutely no time period except 1959. The clumsy scene follows an awkward scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time passes. However - and this kept the film for me - Kerr never looked more beautiful, and Peck is like always a very handsome man. They really make a wonderful, mature couple, and I just want to have a better material for work. There is one scene that works - Scott goes to Shielah while in a drunken state, and seeing these two normally refined stars striking each other is very disturbing and gives some kind of short-term idea of ​​what's going on in a relationship like theirs. In addition, the film collapsed and did not even come close to the classic staple of other soaps produced in Val 1950 (PEITON PLACE, THE BEST ALL).
