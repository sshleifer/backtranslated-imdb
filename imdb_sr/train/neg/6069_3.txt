It never ceases to amaze me so that you can take a great actor and cast him into a movie like this one. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but he was not even able to save this film. In fact, his character is the same as the one who played in Cape Fear, which was actually pretty good, but I can not stand it when the actors do the same schtick more than one movie. I believe that it is aggravating, and this is the case here. In this film there is nothing surprising, but then the story is told millions of times earlier. Vesely Snipes is your typical baseball player, and his image is manifested through his characterization. De Niro plays obsessed fans, but his role in this movie is less than fun. However, since De Niro is in this movie, it makes him unresolved if you are a fan who sees everything he does no matter how bad. But to see De Nira at its best, see "Midnight Collision," "Good Guys," or "Copan Land," or even go back and check "Such Driver" or "Godfather II". Do not waste time with this shit. My Rating: 3/10
