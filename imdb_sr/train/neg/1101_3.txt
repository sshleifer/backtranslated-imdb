This false trip never comes close to matching with the wit and craziness of the great adventure that these guys took in their first movie. This war is trying to move away from its predecessor to catch some new blood from a joke, but it requires a wrong turn and travel is not interesting or fun anyways. the guys who make a rock concert (and many people look at "free TV" - since when did this happen?) Surely the scenario writer could have made something more creative; see how all the random elements of the first film are neatly connected together in convergence on a scientific presentation. Not in this film, which mostly ended up with Bill & Ted franchise. The joke is over. Grim Reaper is cast into a mix, for any reason. This infusion, as well as the whole plot, is bad and lacks the spice for comedy or audience participation. There is a ZZ Top impression, carved for no reason. Bright, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing really creative or fun. Skip this fake thing.
