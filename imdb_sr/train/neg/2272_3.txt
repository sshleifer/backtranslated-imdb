I'm not a regular viewer of Springer, but I'm watching his performance in short terms and I think the performance is a good pleasure and a good way to kill for a while. Of course, I will watch this film, expecting to see "Jerry Springer uncensored". First, Jerry appears in about twenty minutes from the film. The second hour and twenty minutes is spent on building this pseudo-farce about the trash-trailer, jealousy, incest and fraud. Jaime Presslei (which looks hot as HELLLL) is a whore looking for treasures and sleeping with his stepfather (very unusual looks, drunk Michael Dudikoff, who finally turns off his hero's action as a hero). Mom finds out about the affair, they embark on a fight, they want to take her to the Jerry Shov (that's right, not Springer). And then we have a parallel story with the Afro-American couple. They take him to the Jerry Shov. Characters crash. Blah, blah, madness! Trash was rarely BORRRINGG !!!! I wondered why, hell, Springer had millions of fans, but none of them looked at his film. Well, now it's completely obvious !! Whether you love it or hate it, hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a total mess of the movie (if you call it so). It's so badly arranged, with scenes that are simply not merged, and after a while the shop virtually disappears and it's easy across the map! Imagine a predictable soap opera turned into a comedic farce. With a rare laugh. My only positive note is the hot scene of a girl. It's as risky as it gets. Do not misunderstand me, the scene is pretty risky, but if you look at the whole movie that compares it with the Springer program, this catastrophic farce is extremely disinfected. My score: 3 (out of 10)
