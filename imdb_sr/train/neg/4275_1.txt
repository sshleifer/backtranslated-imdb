I can not understand why many people have praised this show. Twin Peaks is one of the boring titles I've ever seen in my life. Now I've seen all the episodes of season 1, and watch episode 2 of the season. 1) Where is the appropriate induction in the criminal investigation? In Season 1, there was a scene that Agent Cooper throws into a bottle. Can you guess why he did it? He just wants to identify the killer by working this "joke" as he mentions the supernormal abilities of the Tibetan dream. 2) In this show there are too many unnecessary scenes. For example, Season 2 began with a 'funny' scene served by a stupid old agent Cooper with a cup of milk while Cooper is lying on the floor (he already shot from a pistol in his belly.) This old man does nothing else but Saying some stupid comments. That is all. This scene is really boring and long (3 min 30 sec .... It's like hell.) I would read some comics rather than see this show more .
