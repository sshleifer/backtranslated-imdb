Mostly I do not care much about violence in movies, or about a great deal of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. It's all very good with me, and the film brings a lot of things. There are beautiful pictures especially about the lake and nature, a good set of characters, a good direction. This movie could be voted for as a good movie. However, this is broken for two reasons and both of these reasons in connection make this movie simply disgusting. First of all, there is violence that is used against living beings to make this film. Not film violence, I'm talking about real violence. Only violence could be justified if not for this reason number two; The message of the film was not only an introspection of the director's interwoven relationship with women. It's not that we all do not have the right jobs with women (or men). But the conclusion of the film is destroying everything. * The spoiler * Our "heroine" finally dies, (here, with my hand, if I remember correctly, I saw this film many years ago and it made me angry, now the guy came out with a new movie witch is certainly not going to to look at) and is now even more clearly portrayed as some sort of natural demon, the nature that grows over it, especially its sex. Of course, the director is the one who "kills" the female heroine. Women must die, especially if men are attracted to their sexuality. This seems to be the ultimate conclusion. ** The ultimate spoiler * Well, well, it would be anything that could be good to me if the director would keep his look at himself. But use large images, artistic guidelines of cruelty to living beings, just to say that men can be afraid of women, and men are cruel to women. That's not enough. I knew that when I see this film, I will get good reviews for "philosophical, eastern and artistic" and any approach. But for me, this movie is completely corrupt.
