It is incredible that with all the countless crimes that have been uncovered and unequivocally placed on the threshold of Marxism, from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag Archipelago to the Cultural Revolution to the Red Khmer, there are still fans of communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and continue to make propaganda in their favor. It only shows the moral distortion of Hollivood. In this particular film, a psychotic killer is celebrated. Needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic statement were involved. Both the director and the actor expect the audience to sit through this seemingly endless propaganda film, showing the tunnel vision they have in regard to their worship facility.
