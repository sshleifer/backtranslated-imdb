Reading all the comments posted here on the IMDb, this movie seems to be quite nervous, but I did not think it was bad. I saw much worse, actually. "House in which evil apartments" is a story about the spirit of the husband and his wife, Ted and Lauri Fletcher, and their daughter, Ami, who moves into an old house in Japan. Little did they know, a Japanese ninja brutally killed his wife and her lover, and then killed 100 years earlier with a Samurai sword. As strange things happen in the house, the ghosts of the previous inhabitants begin to own the bodies of the living and plan to carry out the bloody killing that took place 100 years ago. I saw this film and decided to give it a chance, on the front page it looked like a decent story about ghosts. It was a routine, and it was runny, but I saw it up in my day. The spiritual sequences were a little exaggerated, we saw the transparent blue colored figures randomly crop up per family and took over their bodies. To be honest, the ghosts in this movie reminded me of the ghosts driving the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. Maybe I'm in mischief, but after watching this, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror movie "Ju-on: grudge" and the American remake of this film seemed to tremble a bit. An old Japanese house where there was a brutal murder, spooky activity, cursing at home, etc. But maybe I'm wrong. Do not try to see it, but if you like such things and accidentally come to the television, you can give it. 4/10.
