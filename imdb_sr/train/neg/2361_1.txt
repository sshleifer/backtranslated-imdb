This film is the worst in the series. Although Nev Line may just be looking for a sale, everyone knows that the only reason he earned more money than the previous was his 3D ending. It was not that the 3-D was also good because it was 3D with red and blue lenses (anaglyph.) It was just a fact that people wanted to see what it would look like. In addition, this film was so badly made! Poor writing, bad characters, bad acting, poor directing. This film attempts to raise the camp factor almost to the point of being like the Loonei Tunes episode. fun for the audience. Just total confusion with some really bad guys who are still trying to play this whole thing as a camp and if it's less than what they probably wanted. I remember most of us who were fans of this series just praying that it would end at this time because of how bad it was. This is one of the films that helped to capture horror from popularity and drive a chir in the belief that the audience really wants to laugh with some stupid comedy rather than see a good and terrifying horror movie.
