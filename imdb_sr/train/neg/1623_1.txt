Based on the television series on the works of the popular author, this is not a guarantee of success. Yorkshire television learned it harder when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books attributed to Dick Francis, three of which were broadcast under the collective title 'The Racing Game'. Mike Gwylim was Sid Hallei, a former jockey who crossed the private eye after an accident in which he lost his right hand, only to replace it artificially. Guilim suffered from an acute lack of charisma (and looked like one of the bad guys), while Mick Ford (who played an irritating Chico Barnes) made me think of a horse ass whenever he was on the screen. For six weeks, this more or less dynamic duo was charged with the village, degrading irregular parcels to repair racing, usually by the same methods - blackmail, abductors, or doping horses. Iorkshire Television dropped money on the show, but without success. Violent, sexist, stiff and repetitive, was quickly taken to the backyard.
