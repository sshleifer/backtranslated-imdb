This movie is like the real life that I think - it does not happen much in the available 2 hours or so, and not many plans of a game or plot are proven by an invisible cast (their invisibility is due to "experimental" lighting as many reviewers state) . Large aperture. It's not a big surprise that Altman manages this - he's a very varied performer (we all loved "Gosford Park", but "Pret A Porter" anybody Kansas Citi? Dr. T. and Women? Aaargh), but the fact that the raw material is the story of John Grisham, and the excellent composition that you will notice through the gathering of the light of your persistent dream - makes this really a masterpiece of a bad movie. And no, it's not "that bad is good." It's just bad.
