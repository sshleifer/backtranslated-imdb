I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I've ever seen. I would recommend this cartoon to people who are younger than 5 years old. I used to like this show when I was 4 and 5, I just watched it when there was nothing. Now I'm still 5 and I'd rather do homework than watch. The cartoon was once a bit ridiculous, but they were not enough to make fun of me. Now I'm older I'm interested in a show that does not judge us. I started watching Dr. Vho (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I'm interested in things that concern Doctor Toga, so I'm not interested in five-year-old cartoons. This cartoon did not last long, it only had 6 seasons, it was canceled because it had few spectators, but some people say that this is because the writers were left with no ideas, but for most others it shows that they have at least 8 seasons.
