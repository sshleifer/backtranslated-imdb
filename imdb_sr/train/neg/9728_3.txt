Tobe Hooper made great films so I was sure it could not be bad. I did not read reviews and tried to watch this unintentionally witty movie. Sometimes it made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes it made me almost CRI for Hooper. I rated this 3/10 because 1990's "horror" movie and many interesting or fun things happened. there. Through the film I thought about something like "They just can not add more stuff to this movie ..." but they are. Some say it's some sort of Firestarter clone, but it really is not. 't. It's based on this idea, but that's all. This is a combination of horror, comedy, strange religions / gods, funny bloody, simple effects, drama, terrible acting, incredible scenarios ... and much more. * spoilers * The story is: The government is trying to create an ultimate weapon that uses nuclear energy or something does not succeed, during the process the child is born for 2 people. When a mother sings to her child after birth, both husband and wife are burning and this is SPONTANEOUS. The government buries the whole thing and leaves this child to live among other people and ... after having grown up years old and realize that he was born with a reason and that he can burn things with his brain. Then everything goes unbelievably messy, nothing actually explains anything and ... Well, when the government realizes "well, now it can set this fire to work," they take him to a normal hospital, where something nuclear-toxic is something that will be used by this man. they could kill him, I can not kill him! .. and argh, I suppose that's enough to say, I promise there's another 100 strange things in this movie. So if you want a good laugh, watch this. God.
