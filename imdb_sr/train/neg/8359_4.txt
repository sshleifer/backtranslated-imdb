Despite some moments in the heavy rain, the encounter with a drunk, and the organ grinder with a monkey and gypsy, and stay in a sanatorium, the Roscoe "Fatti" Arbuckle silent comedy short with the support of Buster Keaton and Al St. John is just fun, though it's rather funny sequence Arbuckle in drag-flirting-in with Buster infection, which is the ultimate in "happy" scenes, especially since this is one of the few times when we saw a large stone smiles and laughter in films! Also, it seems that many scene mounted on a jump, perhaps due to excessive use of the film. However, if you are Arbuckle and Keaton kompletisti, Good Night, Nurse! definitely worth a look.
