First, I would like to point out that I only know about the show because my younger sister always watched. I consider it to be the most beautiful program on TV. There is nothing ridiculous about any joke, and the canned laughter is unbearable. The show would work much better if it was shot in front of a live audience. In this way, laughter would show how "barren" the performance is. However, I give recognition to the acting talents of young actors. It makes me think, however, that they will look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show is. The show is well connected with the total boring voices and style of the CBBC exhibitors. Why are today's young people so much to shout, it's beyond me. That is all.
