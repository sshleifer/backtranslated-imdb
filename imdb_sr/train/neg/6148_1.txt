First, the film was not true facts. I saw a documentary a few days earlier and the film was not like that. First, Nash was a genius in mathematics, and that's what the film should be about not talking about a man who was cured and who eventually found love and so on. There are also many scenes that were simply wrong - the scene in which he ridden a bicycle on a campus occurred in his early university years, and not after that. In my opinion, Russell Crove did not fit into this part at all because he does not look like an intelligent / individualistic guy, so he really could not play one. It would be great if you focused more on mathematics (like Pi) rather than over dramatized love. At this level, ABM was too holistic and too superficial to be excellent. I personally think that he was not crazy or paranoid and that he was on something because people in that caliber know more than "smaller mortals". 5/10
