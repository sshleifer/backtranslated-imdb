The secret is ... this movie hits. I'm sorry, but it was just there. **** SPOILER **** In this bad rifle on I KNOV VHAT DOES LAST SAMMER and SCREAM, Beth, beautifully played by Dorie Barton, joins several friends on a journey through Spring Break. The group rents a fantastic house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation. Then, death begins. The first then the second, and then another of the friends was killed, which leads to a sad and banal climax with predictable results. One note, Dorie Barton is Reese Vitherspoon, the poor, she looks like Reese, she behaves like Reese and can go for Reese in the police squad. Maybe they dumped it like that? Either way, decent cinema and fair play could not compensate for bad dialogue and horrible writing.
