If the writer / director reads this (and I assume you are because you should be out of work now), then I have to tell you - I've seen some bad films in my time, but this gets the difference that it has the worst premise <br /> SPOILERS - Nothing Happens! Totally wasting time. In the end I laughed loudly. NOTE - (If the whole movie was in a coma then the scene on which she sleeps with this guy means that someone raped her while she was knocked out?) Fully garbage.
