I liked how it started, with some decent special effects especially for the movie, 50 years old. There were some pretty impressive landscapes. However, the film is getting very early with some very stupid dialogue, while men all try to flirt with Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius". It was fun to see Francis again, an actress who mostly worked on television shows since this film was released ... and still plays. It was also interesting to see a young Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J Adams"), whom I would not recognize if there was no such vote. I watched half of this film before boredom came almost overwhelming and I had strong desire to go to bed. I appreciate them re-recording this VHS tape in stereo. but it was a bad effort. This is one of those overrated films in which the "elite" think so "heavy" and "provoke thoughts." These are nonsense. It only seemed "intelligent" because the rest of the 50 movies from sci-fi were so stupid. Some, if the early scene looked great on a wide screen, I did not have the time of this writing. Maybe another look - this time at 2.35: 1 videscreen transfer would change me.
