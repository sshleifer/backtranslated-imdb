In fact, this film, made in 1999, has fairly good production value. The actors are attractive and reasonably talented. There is no cluster of clowns running around an explosive, consuming hundreds of bullets, but never hitting the flesh. There are also wild auto-hunters, where thousands of valuable machines are endlessly destroyed. Well, there's a high-tech computer room equipped with what looks like a remnant from the 50's Laboratory for Electronics. And makeup of pancakes on corpses broke me. Not makeup for pancakes in a conventional sense, but what looks like dry pancakes, spilled over their exposed skin. This should support the idea that bodies have been calcified - although the way the virus will realize this exercise is left to a student (viewer). Ah yes, virus. I would like to say that this is not the absolute worst premise for the science fiction, horror flick, which I know, but I can not. A computer virus that is transmitted over a television (or computer) screen and becomes a deadly biological pathogen? Give me a break. Varp drives a la "Star Trek" are one thing, but photons become viruses? This is so stupid that the desired "fear factor" is simply not feasible. Flick could have used one of those terrible sequences of dreams in which the dead were alive, or the cat jumped out of the closet, or something like this, because it does not do the viral thing. One assumes that Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in this nonsense that Lord Oliver gave for some of his later places. He needed money. However, no other comparison between these two should be interpreted.
