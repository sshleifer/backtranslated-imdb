I'm writing this review, looking a few months ago ... the trailer seemed to me promising enough to buy this excuse for the movie. It's a complete joke ... and I literally spit into the face with the classics of the early generation of horrors such as Tekas Chainsav Massacre (1974), who even had the opportunity to compare themselves on the back of the cover. The producer who played Brandon should turn the burger and serve fatty hamburgers .... hell may not even be good at all! Lighting was bad and bad, and sometimes it was impossible to look at the actor's faces. I do not even remember the rest of the actors who are sad, bad, they never do anything to impress you to make them unforgettable. That's all the time I'm going to spend on this review. Please stay as far away from this pile of garbage, even if you get it for 25 cents, do not buy a piece of rubber at least you will be entertained! br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> > <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> > <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> > <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> I gave this 1 star only for a wrapper .... that's the only thing that's worth love the so-called "movie" -Rick Blalock
