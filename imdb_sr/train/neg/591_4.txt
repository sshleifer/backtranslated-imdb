I was really, really disappointed with this film. it started very well, and built some great atmosphere and uncertainty, but when the "monster" finally came to the fore ... it turned out to be just a psycho with skin problems ... again. Vhoop-de-do. Another movie about drongers ... like we do not have enough. To be fair, "reaper" is really disturbing to watch, and the way it moves and the weird sounds seem to be pretty creepy, but I'm struggling to rent such a movie just to find out The monster is a human being, although it is weird, crazy, weird. When I first saw all the rats, I was hoping for some hybrid hybrid rat monster ... it was so down when Creep was discovered. At the top of this, some things in this movie make no sense. Why does a dick kill a guard? What is the point, except that the big sign of trumpet is held that says "HI I'm PSICHO AND LIVE HERE HERE!"? It's stupid, and it seems just to prevent Franka Potente from getting help. <br /> What hell does he eat down there? I had the impression that it was effectively built, and only the unexpected opening in that tunnel department made it possible to free itself ... so that he chewed the rats all the time, and if so, why are they so fuss about him? Why is it so hard to kill? He's skinny, malnourished and not exactly at the pinnacle of performance ... but it seems to continue to go on despite the injuries that are equivalent to those who kill the non-native characters in the film. DVD comment says I intend to sympathize with Creep, but I consider it disgusting. It's a good enough movie, but it's been wasted so many times that I'm sick.
