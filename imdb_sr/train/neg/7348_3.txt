I was really disappointed with this film. The first movie I watched was Serial Mom and I loved it. Then I saw Pecker and I loved him. Then I looked at Polyester and I really hated him. The only thing I liked in this movie was DIVINE. She had a lot of talent. I was really surprised. As a whole, I would not recommend this movie ...
