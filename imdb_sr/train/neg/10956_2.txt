I bought this movie from Gamestop's discount in the used movie bin, and the cover made me laugh uncontrollably so I bought it for 99 cents. The film itself is retarded and uses a dozen different monkeys throughout the film that hardly look like it. Not to mention that they are using a duplicate who is just a short guy in a costume who desperately tries to present himself as a monkey. The director most likely committed murder-suicide with chimpanzees after the film debuted in a preview for another Varner Bros. movie. and ended up thanks to the money studio. It also does not help if he was not even embarrassed for the horrible job he was doing, he was not even known for making a movie about food. Why is this movie ever filmed?
