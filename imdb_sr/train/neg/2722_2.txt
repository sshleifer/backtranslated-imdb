For great thinkers among us, "Intruder" is a disturbingly unrelated movie from France that gives the so-called "art films" a bad name. The story is something about the bitter old fox, Michel Subor, who goes to Tahiti for heart transplantation, but in addition, I have no idea who any of the people in the film or why they are doing what they were doing. Without any coherent story that can boast, the film loses us early, although I'm completely ready to admit that someone might be there and who would really get a deep message from this movie. This messy, dumb drama lasts for two hours and five minutes - although I seriously doubt that anyone else with any kind of life will continue to hang around the final credits.
