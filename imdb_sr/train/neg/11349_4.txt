Actually, this is a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first 3D animated film. I bought it on DVD 3 years ago. Did Bug's life do that? I think that it was in Disneyvillard on that tree, so I say before they go and use the logo. Also, Shrek 3d was a simulator for Universal Studios. They still need to consider it a movie because it appears in the "theater" and you can buy it for a DVD. The film was cute, at least there were small leaflets. I like IK. I agree with the animators, they have made the job of making a movie out of something that is just an adventure. I recommend it to families and children.
