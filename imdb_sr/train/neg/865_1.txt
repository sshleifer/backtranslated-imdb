I had an accident to pass through 102 minutes of what is, in my opinion, this shockingly bad movie. It fails at almost all levels; acting is terrible, acting - ham at best, and the soil lacks any depth, leaving me feeling very indifferent in terms of the outcome of any tricky story. Plan B has no charm. this genre has the ability to transmit, and I found myself physically red at various points where the script makes its regular wrongly evaluated meanders anywhere in the comedy region. Bona fide saccharin coated with a bunch of film.
