Team Tim Burton remake of the original "Planet of the Apes" from 1968 (and starring Charleton Heston) is far, far from the quality and complexity of the original. Certainly special effects have been improved since 1968, but writing is not. The characters were boring and the dialogue was terrible. I sat across the whole movie with my friend (who, luckily, rented him), and fully understood why, before Christmas, all the toys of the "Planet of the Apes" in Target were in the container. My advice to Tim Burton: do not put this in your summary. My advice to everyone else: see the original 1968 movie "Planet of the Apes".
