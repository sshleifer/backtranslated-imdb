Brothers twins separated by birth (due to their parents' death) reunite twenty-five years later to revenge their parents and take back their tunnel of one million dollars. Double Impact lasts for more than two hours and basically does not add a real approach to the complicity of the Corsican and Jean-Claude Van Damme brothers while being adequate as an evil twin brother is just as embarrassing as a good twin brother. Also, the action sequence of this time is not so exciting and Jean-Claude rely more on shooting than on his martial arts. Also, auxiliary cast is futile and in two hours the film is simply boring. <br /> * 4 (bad)
