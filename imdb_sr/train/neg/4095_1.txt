Today, Bea Arthur died so I cruised around the IMDb website and somehow I ended up on a show called "Gloria". "All In The Families" was a great performance for the first four or five years and I bet I watched each episode more than once. However, I swear I did not know that there was a show called "Gloria". Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe that means I had a life as a young adult, not watching TV. On the other hand, it is pathetic that the "Everything in the Family" Franchise has so much worsened that it started for which I have never heard - and the one that the previous reviewers rated very badly. I rated Emission 1 for two reasons - the system did not allow me to register without a vote, and writers and television executives should be condemned for launching a show that did not have any work in broadcasts and disdainful memory of one of the biggest performances in history of television. Shalom, Rare
