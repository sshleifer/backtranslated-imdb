As a great fan of Marlene Dietrich, I had to (finally) look at this very, very boring picture. It's the first color film of Miss Dietrich, and the most beautiful blonde in the world is a redhead! Bad start. The story is a huge boredom that involves a subject that bites me stiffness: religious guilt. It's enough to say, perhaps, that of all Dietrich's films (and most of all I've seen, including "Pittsburgh"), this is the only one in which even its performance is hardly worth watching. Color photography is ok (this is a very early edition of Technicolor), but for no purpose. Funny throw: C. Aubrei Smith, Basil Rathbone (to be sure enough?). The only thing that is at all interesting is the unusual caricature of John Carradine's performances as "The Sand Diviner", which predicts everything that will happen. The supposed "happy ending" is one of the most depressing ever. Another example of the highly inflated reputation of David O. Selznicka (did he ever make a really good movie? - other than that?) And, for the last discomfort, the soundtrack of the MGM DVD is a mess, with sound levels seemingly random. Highli unrecommended.
