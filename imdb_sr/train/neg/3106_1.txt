Whenever I compose a list of the absolutely worst films I've ever seen, this film is always on it. He has no redeeming quality. It was necessary for the act of will to go through the whole thing, and I would have spilled my blood before I had to go through it again. What's wrong with this? Let me tell you the story of my journey to see him in the theater. I went to midnight show, on Saturday night. The only one in the theater was me, and a bunch of loud, noisy, rather disobedient teenagers, who were sitting somewhere behind me. They obviously had fun on Saturday night, and they came to this "comedy" for laughter. Before the film began, during the review, they laughed and joked and made loud comments with great old times. It was a border constraint; that they continued unquestioned enthusiasm in the film itself, maybe I said something, but I felt tolerant and compassionate towards their lively party, so I released it. And they calmed down when the film started. Why do I tell you all this? Because you can judge this alleged "comedy" by the effect he had not only on me, but on this grueling crowd. During the entire film, no person in the theater laughed. Not once. Not me, no noisy kids. Absolute silence, except for the soundtrack. And when the film was finished and the lights came on, we all, all of us, slowly left the theater in silence. It could be a funeral. It was the effect that this "comedy" produced. No laughter, not enjoyment, but absolute depression. It was depressed, depressing the film, not the smallest. Preachi, self-indulgent, depressing, but not funny. I consider that Mel Brooks "Blazing Saddles" on a short list for Funniest Movie Ever. It still seemed absolutely to me that the same gentleman could be responsible for the most likely most unusual movie ever. In short: if you feel too happy, give this movie a whirlwind; Otherwise, do not say I did not warn you.
