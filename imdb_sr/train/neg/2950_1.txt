I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision at TNT. Even he could not make this movie pleasant. The only reason that I watched him to the end was putting up video production, and I wanted to make sure that my students never did anything wrong ... but I needed all the intestinal courage to sit through it. It's like watching your grandmother flirting with a 15-year-old boy ... painfully painful. If you take a real movie, dip it in a color thinner, and then watch it, it would be more fun. Seriously. If you see this movie in the S-Mart bin, get away from it as if it were an overhead.
