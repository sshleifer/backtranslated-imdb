DOC SAVAGE: BONUS MAN (1 outta 5 stars) Brutal, horrible movie ... based on a series of magazines / soft cover Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... about a super-heroic adventurous hero of the thirties and his five assistants, all experts in an area that allows them to fight against evil. It was pretty hockey series ... but it's fun to read when I was a teenager. I knew that they made a movie version of the 70s, in which Ron (Tarzan) Eli plays ... but I never had a chance to see her. She never played in the movies where I lived and has never been featured on TV. Now that I finally saw the movie, I can understand why. The action and characters are never treated seriously ... it's all kind of language in the face and camp ... the kind of old Batman TV series ... just without the help of being funny ... or having any kind of visual imagery of theirs. Corny dialogue, cheese special effects, stupid stereotypes, mild action scenes and bad, bad acting. In fact, I find it fascinating in my troubles ... what could they have thought? It was said that Arnold Schwarzenegger would act in a modern remake ... but I do not think it would prove to be much better.
