I do not watch a lot of TVs and I came across this show. Reality show? I hope this is not real. If I were a man and that I had such dirt and that I was married to someone so stinky, it would be the basis for a divorce. I think she sets a bad example of how a person should treat the person she loves. This is one thing that is not right with our present world, so many people in bad relationships, selfish and do not know what it means to really love the other. It's self-sacrifice, not something that should be on the merit. It does not give a good feeling, to see what should be in private counseling. If his personality in the show is real, then he deserves someone much better who will show the true true love and care for him and appreciate him for what he is. Is this a reality or is it reimbursed for reviews? I really would like to know. Sincerely, GB
