Where to start? How to best describe how this film is horrible? Start with the humor at the campsite. It's not so funny. Add a bunch of acting actors - Meat Loaf is terrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. The harm of the poor Art Carnei, who needed to know better than this film. And there is a plot. A traveler whose life goal is to show the Alice Cooper show, is getting to know a girl whose life goal is to be a cheerleader for Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want ... And then, when the movie needs to end, they can not come to a more convincing last scene than - well, I will not destroy it for you if you really want to see a movie . There are certain actors that let you know that it will be a "B" movie or maybe worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and he has a prominent role. It's a sure sign that the movie will not be very good. If nothing else, the film lives up to low expectations - even overcomes them as poorer than the poor. Let's just say this. This is a movie that compares all the bad films. And none of them is worse than Roadie.
