With the fun, I noticed PD PD Detroit was eventually credited for their participation. The police chief has even one voice line that plays himself (and the boy, can you say he can not act). The reason for the fun is that the police in this film shoot first and ask questions later. Not that kind of PR, I think the police would want. In addition, this is your standard movie of policemen and robbers dressed for the 1970s with racial angle. Alec Rocco has an ungrateful role as a policeman who can not progress and is burdened with a mentally ill woman. He compensates for it by socializing in a local public house. Harry Rhodes is his passionate partner who has groove wardrobe and likes to run for the suspect while wearing a robe. The film moves until the last shooting, which absolutely does not make sense (why people who are just blamed for robbery take over the entire police?). Not only do we see a shootout, but four bad guys, we see four. Then, there is also a screw that should leave a speculation about what really happened, but it just left me thinking how stupid it is. Seeing that the director of Arthur Marks was also behind the marriage "Foster Foster" and "Bucktovn", I should not have wondered.
