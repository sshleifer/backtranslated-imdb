slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three enthusiastic words that describe the book's book. This is certainly the case when the film should never be made at the expense of the book. The best part of the movie was a landscape, great. The worst thing was that the actors slowly moved in combination with endless important points of view. Editing is abrupt and unclear. However, despite this, the actors worked very hard at least trying to be a little convinced with the horrible scenario. It was astounding that in Peru there was barely a peruvian person wandering around the set-even in scenes that portrayed Peru in the 17th century. If you have any sense in history, try to avoid this movie.
