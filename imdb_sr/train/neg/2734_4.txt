But, let's face it ... there are several nostalgic sighs from me. The emission is so consistently large that it is allowed to have a few shots. I got a new season, and only through them, as if I had 2 days of life. I like the idea of ​​wrapping it up, but it was much more than the end of the episodes of the season that would explain the following: Dr.Cok should not be bald for a few more episodes, The only explanation that I can imagine that they have changed the episode rotation or that they had to start recording again. In any case, the show is brilliant ... bring the 7th season.
