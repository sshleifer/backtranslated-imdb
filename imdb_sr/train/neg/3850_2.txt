I saw this film at SKSSV with the present director. A few people came out, and the audience barely managed to get even a friendly applause in the end. Of the 60 or 70 films I've seen on this festival, Frohnland is among the worst. For 106 minutes, it's at least 95 minutes too long. You can see how the main character failed and pulled out communication attempts, in the extended real time. The same grimaces, hands above the mouth, kinetic and wildly repetitive words and syllables over and over again and again - WE GIVE A POINT. One location actually compares this work with Early May Lee. What kind of drugs should you do to give this statement? Since Frovnland is a song by Captain Beefhearta, you may need to be able to enjoy the Trout Mask Replica at a powerful rotation to appreciate this movie. Unbelievably, this was won by the jury at the festival. You can bet that he did not win an audience prize.
