The comedy of Oscar Wilde's manuscript, perhaps the most dramatic drama ever written, was almost destroyed in the hands of second-class actors. Sanders is, as you would expect, casually, indelently brilliant in Lord Darlington's role, but the rest of the actors make the whole procedure a waste of time. Jean Crain tries to emphasize the stage in alternative sentences, and other members of the actors seem to believe that this is a melodrama rather than a comedy; Moreover, the whole production has books that reduce it to a tragedy - undoubtedly Hais's office insisted. It seems that Preminger's direction is mainly to make sure he has a lot of servants, and even music seems banal. Stay in the visually perfect quiet fairs directed by Lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with Helen Hunt as Mrs. Erlinne; or try to read a performance for word satisfaction. But skip this version.
