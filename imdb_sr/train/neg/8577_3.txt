I knew that my resume would get you. How is this movie like Pet Rock and Disco?! Well, unless you've survived the seventies or eighties, you probably do not understand why someone would want a new cocaine or Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I still do not understand it completely). These are just a couple of things that made sense at the time, but really confuse the younger generation. The same can be said for Kai Kisera and his band. At that time (mostly in the 1940s), they were very popular and had enough influence that the studio acted with Boris Carlof, Bel Lugos and Peter Llor in this film. Still, if you did not live at that time (it was a lot before my time), you wonder why everyone likes this kind of "fun". After all, Kiser and his band members are incredibly disgusting and their humor is very, very wide (ie Ungrateful and messy). Frankly, I could not stand their fools, nor did I appreciate that the movie had too many music numbers. Because of these factors, great support was given to the back seat and the fans of these actors are likely to be disappointed. aunt live. Once there, the bridge is washed and strange events begin. In the end, it culminates in some attempts by Salli's life and a sort of session. Everything is laughing - and it's not a horror movie despite the actors. All in all, it's transient entertainment at best. As a supporter of Lugosi and Karloff, I certainly felt cheated watching Kisera and his heads.
