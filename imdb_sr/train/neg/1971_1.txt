This film is deeply disappointing. Not only does Venders display only a very limited Blues music spectrum, but also his subjective and personal interest in the parts of the music that he brings to the film so that watching and listening makes him totally annoying. The only highlight of the film is the interview of a Swedish couple who has made friends with J.B. Lenoir also showed his private video footage, as well as stories. Venders's introduction of the film theme begins very interesting - alluding to world culture (or, in fact, American culture) traveling to the universe, but his limited viewing on the subject as well as the funny or extremely fascinating reproduction of the 30s story makes this film like Easy sleep aid. Iavn. I expected more from him.
