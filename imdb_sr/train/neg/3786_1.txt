This is not a real overview because I did not see much of the movie. I stopped watching him. The movie is very violent, with nasty drug dealers and street bugs, but that's not why I stopped watching. Here's the problem: I was watching just enough to get to know some of the characters, all of which were not interesting. Everyone was a boring, disgusting psychopath, without any attractive personality, which gave me nothing to look forward to. I did not even care what would they do next or what could happen to them. If there was even one person of interest, and I do not mean a good or a good person, I mean an interesting person, I could stay with her. Look at the "State of Grace" to see what I mean. In this film, the character of Gario Oldman is a complete madman, but he is very * interesting. Al Pacino may have done a good job in Scarface, but his character simply did not hire me.
