The original "les visiteurs" was original, hilarious, interesting, balanced and almost perfect. LV2 must be the candidate for "The worst first continuation of a really good movie". In LV2 everyone shouts, when the gag does not work first, it repeats itself 5 more times with some vague hope that it will eventually become fun. LV2 is a terrible parody of LV1, except of course the parody should be inventive. If you liked LV1 you just can not see this movie, just look again at LV1 !!
