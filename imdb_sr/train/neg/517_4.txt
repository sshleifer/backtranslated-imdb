"The return of Chandu" stands out, if it can be said, for throwing White Lugosi as a hero, not a villain. Why she even gets a girlfriend. The story as such includes the Black Magic Kills Kills trying to capture the last Egyptian princess Nadja (sweet Maria Albu) and use it as a victim as a means of reviving their ancient leader who simply looks like Nadja. Lugosi as Chandu, who has magical powers, is trying to convict the villains. Director Rai Tailor does everything in his power with limited resources and extensive footage. The fans of King Kong (1933) will recognize the huge door that served to keep Kong away in several scenes. The acting is mostly horrible. The actor playing the high priest (I believe Lucien Privalu), for example, uses that active trainer inspired by the excuse that was so common in early speakers. The less talked about others, the better. The mystery is why Lugoshi accepted parts in independent hits at this stage of his career, because at that time he was still a bankable star in the Universe. Perhaps because in this case he had to play the hero and bring the girl who knows. As his career began a spiral downhill in the late 30s, this kind of ticket would become the norm for Lugosi, and not an exception. <br /> <br />
