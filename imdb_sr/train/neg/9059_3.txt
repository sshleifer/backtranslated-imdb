I'm just going to be vague about my potential corrupt comments. In this film there are enough canned elements that are essentially pre-spoiled. This film extracts several ideas from the Southern Classics to kill the bird crook. I guess maybe TKOM got its ideas from a source ... in any case, after you look at this, you'll say, "Oh, yes, it's ripoff." I think the really fun thing about this McMovies is when you once identify the element of the plot, it's to understand whether it will stick to the original, or try to turn it around. There are not many plants in this.
