I saw this film trouble in the dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (when the tickets were really sold for $ 1). This is the only film I've ever left (with my friend, while the idiotism is the sketch "Laser Bra 2000" on the screen). Apparently, the reaction of my and my friend to the movie was common. It's not that I have found a film offensive (either as an 18-year-old, or even now), but that it's stupid and cleverly stupid and apparently immortal, without even the unwanted humor that makes Ed Vood's film visible. This is the real reason why NBC refused to broadcast it, not the failure to grasp the "vision" of Mr. Mike (unless, of course, his vision was to drive the film's supporters into bankruptcy). I remained surprised to this day that this film did not seem to have made a published list of "10 worst movies of all time". It certainly does mine. You are warned.
