In one word: tediously. I was advised to read some of the articles about the philosophical meanings of this film afterwards, but after spending an uninterrupted 115 minutes of film and being slowly broken under his filling symbolism and heavy avalanche, it seemed better to just put my reactions to the film. After all, who's going to watch a film with a curriculum in hand? And this film was sad. The main actor Claude Laidu, from the opening of the film to the end, carries the same tired and boring mask of agony that practically can not be distinguished from the eternal, gloomy voice of the film. Recording one over the other could be better than subjecting the audience to both, because they basically say the same thing: The Ambricourt priest is a poor human being. The story of a persecuted cleric who is trying to help a rich family that is struggling does nothing to make her characters distracted or compassionate, such as a family of bunch of unpleasant freaks, and the priest himself encounters a harmful pest. . The last 30 minutes suggest an exciting message of the mercy and suffering of a man who is equal to the suffering of others, but because of all the terrible major plans of the suffering of Laid and the unclear subtext in Robert Bresson's scenario, all I felt was, finally, it's over, a little ice cream. Interesting to fans of Bresson fanatics Paul Schrader, just to see how many elements of character and setting Schrader carry in their scripts and movies, especially "Takidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
