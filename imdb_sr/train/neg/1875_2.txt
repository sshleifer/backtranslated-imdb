First, I really loved Henry Fool, which puts me in a very small swimming pool watching movies. Parker Posei is one of the best actresses on the screen today. But this film was full of tragedies. Watching Hartley and actors in the add-on movie - so full of pride and senseless analogies with Star Wars - there was a stomach turning. This was a hyper on the production part (HDNET) realized at the maximum. The real example of the emperor and his new clothes. Mostly I feel that Hal has always ruined HENRI FOOL. I think I will never again be able to see him in his pure, innocent light. You remember Hal, you can FOOL some people for some time ... etc. today, if everything he did was throw out meaningless trash. Unfortunately, this is a pure example of the lesson learned in the ADAPTATION movie. The story must be exciting and active, or its hopes of the cash register are really darkened. It does not matter the decent story. For the actors, it was like trying to act in a crazy shirt. The result, I believe Hartley, is untidy. With a drum, he guides walking throughout the dialogue. There was an Apple Soundtrack loop that I recognized she smiled at me. When I saw a trailer, I thought, oh, just trying to catch the new audience. But it's really this ridiculous ride. I'd love to spoil this movie for you, but it's done. He's ruined. FOOL franchise is dead. Henry Fool lived.
