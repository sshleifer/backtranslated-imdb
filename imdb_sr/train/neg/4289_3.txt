Education of a small tree is simply not as good as it could have been. Education of a small tree is about things like a circle of life and how to look at a star to help you. What happened to the three R? Reading 'Rhythm' and 'Rhythmics'? When the idiot returns the teacher to the place of boarding, he begins to cry and talk to the sky. Oh my God. Of course, the lady was a little rough, but then came the character of James Cromwell and led him away, leaving the audience to think that Little Tree was absolutely right. He needs to learn to adapt to the new discipline. It was time! Conversation with the star will not change anything! Small Wood needs to learn that his fans are not always right.
