I, like many people, watched this movie in the theater when it first came out in '97. This was at best a sub-film, and it was definitely not a "masterpiece" that all these "Titanic" fans like to correct. First, DiCaprio is a horrible actor no matter how you look at him. People like him for his looks. His acting "skill" consists essentially of saying many cheesy lines and trying to behave sexy. Secondly, the film itself had a rather boring and simple action: the girl fell in love with the guy, the boat was on the sink, many nasty love scenes after that. Anyone who has an IC greater than 50 will realize that it is not in any way ingenious. Neither is the original. Plus, the director felt the need to pull him back in 3 hours. I could have squeezed it into a block of 1 hour without losing any plot. In conclusion, "Titanic" is the most precious film ever. Why so much attention and money left me outside of me.
