I really wanted to like this movie, but the story is ridiculous. I do not want to spoil this movie, do not worry right from the start, you know something bad will happen - but here's an example of how this movie is messy. Covboi and "Tvig" ride along the ridge. Cowboy has mustache with lunch. Covboi and "Tvig" enter the race and run halfway downhill. The cowboy is cleanly shaved through the rest of the film. Somewhere between the fight with the gun and driving down the mountain the cowboy had time to shave, in the dark, on the back of the horse. To be honest, acting four main character is solid. .
