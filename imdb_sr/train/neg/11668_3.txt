It has beautiful scenes of landscape. Writers who put their mouths in the mouths of actors. With smaller players this show would be stupid. "Art must be raised by mankind or BS." Not because the art of all mentioned is also the promotion of humanity and the expression of the dark side. The main figure even says that those who do not drink hide the side of the shadow. Incorrectly, he lived in the darkness and pushed his dark side drinking and was one-dimensional without extending his horizons to anything other than the landscape. In his work there was no organism for breathing or expressing his pain. Everything the artist did was limit himself to a dozen landscapes. Conversations between characters were in elementary school, banal things that gave one character a superior advantage to the writer. I tried to love him after I read all the first comments on this. I had to dig deep to see those with whom I agreed. I thought that there were great comments from those related to the film. I just moved to the end once. The kid was too passive. The landscape was beautiful, and the music was funny. Just my opinion, or do not show anything to me.
