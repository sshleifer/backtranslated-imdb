I think everyone was pretty disappointed with this film. First, he was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a remake of what should be a classic. I was bored, rude and ridiculous. If you saw him, you know what I mean. Almost everyone in Imdb says it's bullshit and a boy, are they right? If not, avoid it. It's a snorer. 1 of 10
