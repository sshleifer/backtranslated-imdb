I am delighted with positive reviews for this completely non-inspiring movie. Often with foreign movies I skip reviews that appeal to slow tempo and seemingly "lack of action" because many of the best international movies do not Enjoy the Western Hollywood model of cinematic narration. I enjoy the common skill and lack of clich√©s in the foreign film arena. I enjoy the fact that many foreign films do not bind things in a neat tasty little onion. Still, this film did not offer a redeemable value during the time I spent watching it. There is no meaningful character development, no engagement of a story, no way to engage emotionally with any character on the screen. Brief content: A bunch of emotionally immature prejudiced colonies harassed their slaves, and a little girl was injured by her only friend when the "home boy" finally succumbed to withdrawal of abuse. While the upper paragraph is sharp and dramatic, this movie will bother you while you play the script. I was so uneasy that it took three sessions to finish it, and I would not have done that if there were no positive ratings. Unless you have an academic interest in this period, I strongly suggest that this is clearly removed.
