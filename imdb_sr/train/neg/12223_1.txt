I remember when this piece of garbage came out, all the newspapers were scared about how Barbra Streisand should have made a film for years. Well, it could not have lasted so many years; the show was opened only in 1975, eight years ago. She made Broadvaia the great actress Tovah Feldshuh, who probably should have been in the movie, but NOOOOO ... The Great Star of BARBRA had to do it. I MUSIC NO LESS! This film is a complete catastrophe from the beginning to the end. First, Barbra was forty years old when she did it and looked at her every moment. There was no way anyone could swallow a young girl who wanted to study Torah. And then, when dressed as a boy, he becomes camping. It seems that Streisand could not bear to be unattractive and played with makeup; she is more beautiful than a boy than she is like a girl. And as if this is not bad enough, she also interacts with her colleague Avigdor (Mandi Patinkin, whose best moment is the recording of his naked hawk) and his fianc√© (Ami Irving, who works on his usual routine of the moonlight, a little schtick poor woman always resorting to when the director ignores and she does not know what she is doing, Ientl even goes so far as to marry a girl: I will not even think about the scene of the "wedding night." Then there is music: Nine completely forgotten songs, All were sung by Streisand over his voice (probably as a look inside her mind) and each of them is intrusive and irritating like nails on the board. I'm not saying Streisand here shows no sign of promise as a director; some of the pictures are beautiful (especially Patinkin's buttocks), and has good eye for balance The problem with this movie is that it will not get out in my own way I did not believe her a second in the title role NEVER need to add songs, and above all, the whole mess continues for two hours and fifteen minutes . I've been struggling with all the mess after forty-five minutes. Terrible, terrible, terrible.
