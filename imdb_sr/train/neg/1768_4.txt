This is another of those films that could have been great. The basic premise is good - immortal people of cats who kill to live, etc. - the type of variation on the vampire concept. What makes everything seem to fall apart is the total recklessness of the main characters. Even sociopaths know that you need to stick to a low profile if you want to survive - see how much you were supposed to catch Unibomber, which was because the family member understood it. On the contrary, the kid (and to a lesser extent, mom) behaves as if they were untouchable. The kid kills without the thought of leaving no evidence or trace or a living witness. How these people managed to stay alive and undetected for a month, it's amazing, let alone decades or centuries. It really is a pity - it could have been much more that it was written probably, i.e. giving the main characters the level of common sense they would need to pass so long. Besides, it's not a bad indicator. I loved this piece in the end where every cat in the city is approaching home - every time I put food on the porch and see how our cats suddenly enter wherever they are, I mean that scene.
