We had a free weekend STARZ and I turned on the station to see what was happening. It was the movie Hovling II: The act was terrible, but the candy was great. Sibil Danning and Marsha Brovn as mentioned above sweets. I was laughing a lot of several scenes that I saw. My friends are wondering why I never want to go to horror movies, If they saw this movie, they would know why. I'd be thrown out to laugh so much. Just a few things: Reb Brovn, who played Ben Whitney, played the captain of the American in the film Marsha Brovn, the inspiration for the song Mick Jaggers. "Brown Sugar" Mick certainly has a great taste for women.
