This film was not nearly as hard as I expected. There are a few seconds of brightness in this somewhat idiotic hardcore UFO paranoid-fest. Most actors are central, but quite typical of 1970s style stuffed with pregnant pauses. The photographer and model testify to some strange events in the forest and soon become victims of these same events. Flying saucers are spotted, more people are missing - but are they aliens or an ultra-secret group of people hidden? Soon, the reporter and "UFOlog" (obviously modeled as a writer-director) are drawn into this failed fiasco and become the target of ultra-secret agents that are as dangerous as they are incredible and foolish. Then the party starts. Film, predictably, makes sense as well as the average theory of the UFO plot, but it should be commended for being so seriously understood. Working with cameras is fine for a low-budget movie, pacing is pretty good, the script is silly and absurd, and there are continuing problems that are fun to watch. What are the few glitches I've mentioned? Frankly, I can not tell you so much without writing a spoiler. Just say that the end of the movie is, at least, worth the fast forwarding if you can not take the middle.
