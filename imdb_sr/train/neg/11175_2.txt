Unless someone enlightens me, I really have no idea what this is about. It looks like a picture with a message, but it's far from it. This film speaks a senseless story about a journalist agent in New York and his problems. And that's basically everything. When this agent plays Pacino, it must be thought that this is something important. But it is not necessary to think hard about how much this film is meaningless and boring. For one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second film of the year (the second is "Simone"), which deserves the title "The Most Dangerous and Worst Movie Year". Well, what's going on, Al?
