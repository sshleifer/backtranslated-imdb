I've seen bad movies in my time, but this really takes a biscuit! Why is this film made? There's nothing here. Please, believe me, move the switch and destroy the copy of this movie. There is a plot ... which could take about 5 minutes to show up on the camera. This is a key issue, the story is 'based on a true story' (mmm ... anyway) just can not be pushed out for 80 minutes in any way. So we have to go through an hour looking at people walking around. That's it! During the first half an hour absolutely nothing happens except to see someone walk to the store ... and then 3 boys who walk through the woods. Perhaps this time was spent on character development ... but not. So there's absolutely nothing to do with people on the screen, so when they start firing, we can no longer worry! In fact, I finally confirmed that the film will end! Above all, working with cameras is really terrible! This director / editor / writer / producer, Tiesto is a trash. I hate to hit a guy, but really, his work is pants! These boring large frames are constantly, and then long, taken by people who follow as they walk - I'm sure he thinks he's smart, but the results are so boring that I just wanted to stop the film and cut the wrists! As this man is led to direct the next movie about the cabin, it's beyond me! To finish, the acting is also sad, ... which is true for the film as a whole. Beware of common sense, stick to the bundles of total ejection!
