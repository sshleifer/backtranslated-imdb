Paul Verhoeven finally bombed this. He became a joke on himself. Once again we have a film that includes sex and violence, immorality, leering on women and a lot of conversations between characters and puppets. It's all for nothing. Because there's no action in this movie. He fudges all his pieces. All actors give a kind of performance from the Verhoeven film. In other words, unrestrained activity at almost every level. Starship Troopers got out of it because it was such a cat world that inhabited the characters. In this case, scientists behave the same way. I'm sorry, Paul, but soldiers and scientists are not actually made of the same way of thinking. One major flaw in complication was that after escaping because of one night to do evil things, Kevin Bacons is back to science. in a lab where we have spent enough time watching these animated manners (except Elizabeth Shue) walk and talk. Why not show how much a character could work in the outside world. How could they be tracked if it could be anywhere at all? Think about all the different things that could have been done with this concept, both in terms of both character and character. Then look at what this film is doing and how much you actually did and realized that the whole project was really. More offensive is Doco on DVD where everyone claims that Verhoeven is some sort of Genius. Well, one of the two is not so bad. This film has nothing special in it. Just like the title says. Hollowed !!!
