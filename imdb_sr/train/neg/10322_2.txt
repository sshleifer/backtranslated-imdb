If you want to be offended or having fun or both, you will probably have to look somewhere else. LMOTP really did not even think that triggering what happened after re-inserting the usual stupid clich√©s. At the end of the second episode, I felt a little embarrassed that I actually sat in the fake mess. Behind the thinly curved premiere that has drawn all the initial attention to it, in the first place it is just another chrome, harmless and anti-septic attempt to comment and entertain CBC typically highlights in production. And once "ZOMG MUSLIMANI IN THE RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO !!" Hype highlights his welcome, the show will probably follow the ether of cancellation because it is so shallow when judged merely by his merits. Unless you obsess with Muslim culture in the west and / or easily entertain them the most detailed idiosyncrasion on the subject. I really do not see how LMOTP is more comfortable than satisfying the curiosity that came out of the hypo. Other shows were better addressed by the issue of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in Western multiethnic societies. LMOTP will never rank among them in entertainment or insight.
