Hilarious, laugh at loud moments ... and yet not comedy. I especially liked the planted gaga ambulance that drinks "dirty ass" then shouts behind them in anger "you dirty bumps", I mean, someone's online degree of literature is worth it! The worst scenario imaginable, with the introduction of the act at the moment, ridiculous movement in the story, the ZERO character development (even between characters who meet ... it's like they all knew and believed each other for years) dodgi voice over vith added echo effects, and land holes .. oh god are there land holes !! To be honest, I write this, even if I have not looked at the whole thing, but I certainly expect the last 30 minutes or so that I do not improve the already pathetic attempt in the cinema ... thank God for having a good look that leads to something we forget that the film is a load. .. so ... use the imagination to conclude this particular sentence!
