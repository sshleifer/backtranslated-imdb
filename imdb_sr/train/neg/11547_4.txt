what is it sh * t? Pover Rangers vs Freddi? He was visible and good as the first movie in the beginning, but in the part where the protagonists gain super power in their dreams, he began to become childish. This sh * t should have been rated PG or PG-13 instead of R. I expected to see some very mature things, but that's only 1/3 of the movie. The rest is for young children. Plus, too much is focusing on Christianity. I know Freddie is a demon, but there are many religions that have different ways to fight the demon. Why Must It Always Be Christian? This is total Orientalism and filled with white people / Western superiority. Do not look at this, show it to the little children who love the powers.
