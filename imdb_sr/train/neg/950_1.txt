I caught this movie on AZN on the cable. It sounded like a good movie, the Japanese "green card". I can not say that I have ever loved an Asian film, on the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I am a HUGE admirer of John Woo's films in Hong Kong. I did not oppose the films of bright hearts, such as Tampopo or Chung King Ekpress (two of my favorites), so I thought I would like this. Well, I'd rather cut my wrists and drink my blood than watch this nasty, bad acting movie ever again. this film had a personality. And when any of the characters tried to act, unlike the mocking line or two, their performance was forced and incredibly fake. Frankly, I did not think anyone ever worked ... THE ONLY person who sounded authentic is Brenda Aoki. I think it's incredible that this is promoted as a comedy, because I did not laugh once. It's even more surprising that CBS's morning news called it "a refreshing breath of comedy." There was neither a refreshing nor a breath of comedy. And the end was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things. BEAUTIFUL this film unless you want to see the boring predictable plot line and the wooden cast. In fact, I think that "Spike of Bensonhurst" better played a movie than this ... and I came out halfway through that movie!
