I agree, I am not a connoisseur of my partner, but a very complex, smart movie is worth the time. My objections, briefly: - Dialogue is often weak and sometimes incredible from a given character. - Irresistible action. The writers dug out elective pieces from half a dozen mainstream films, inserted into a teapot, jammed not close enough and tried to feed us with the poor exhaustion of the resulting mess, al'dente. /> Long and short, although not absolutely terrible, it was definitely not worth the absorption of one of my NetFlik rentals.
