Since the arrival of the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, there has been much talk about reviving the film industry in Hong Kong. Do not believe it. People who are now making films in HK give a new meaning to the word crass. Running Out of Time 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is the name of the drawing, here, but he spends most of the film just rubbing idiotically and turning the coin. He turns the coin over and over again and again and again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a policeman who is fighting for a nice boy. But once again: who knows why? She has a female actress who runs some kind of company and she has to pay a ransom or something, but she seems to prefer to be in a spa or shopping mall rather than in front of the camera. Nothing makes any sense. No action. No sex. No comedy. It's all that name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? Who cares?
