This was one of the weakest films we've been watching over the past few months with a predictable line and a pretty bad acting (mostly from assisting characters). Interview with Hugh Laurie on DVD was actually better than the movie itself ... Hugh Laurie has obviously invested a lot of effort into learning how to dance Samba, but only the extent of his character was needed to is immersed in the children's poolside. The film is based on the look of a wonderful girl and great music, but that's not enough for a good party. If you've never seen Rio, or the interior of a British bank, this movie is for you. 2 of 10
