Persecution. Of course, remake. The original was a creepy psychological thriller and one that improved over time. Compared to the remake of 1999, it's a classic. There is no character development here, only caricatures (slut, authoritative brain, "I'll get us out of here", a guy, a sensitive book moth). But, seeing that bankers for special effects were "stars", I assume that the characters with which you can sympathize with secondary care. Unfortunately, the effects are ridiculous. Meving herubs, stretchi doors, irritating dead children who can not speak openly ... and the idiotic sacred region that makes it easy for you to give a new era to the butterfly and liver. I'll take my Skittles orally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I like The Covbois. Stop it.
