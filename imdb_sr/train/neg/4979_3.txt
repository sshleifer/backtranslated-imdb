Why oh, why can not anyone make a decent movie from a legendary story? This is the second adaptation "Beovulf" with which I was disappointed in a year. But I must say that the previous version (Beovulf & Grendel, starring Gerald Butler) was far superior to this one. That was just a bit disappointing. This is mess! What made me most tortured? Was it a useless element of complications that they added for no special reason (Human Victims? A meaningless interest in love?), Or a bad CGI, or inconsistency of characters or uninspired acting? Even worse is the way the marvelous Marina Sirtis has done so terrible !!! And do we allow not to talk about this ridiculous crossbow? And why they remind us that Beovulf had the strength of 30 men, and yet never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the film. He turned both monsters he fought, relying on his aides to save bacon. Even when he hit an arrogant prince, he did not knock him down. Too much to rely on weapons. Beo-vimp is more similar. This certainly was not Beovulf's powerful epic song! I'd like to finish this on a positive note, but I can not even think of one effort. All I can say is, if you've ever read Beowulf, you will be endlessly disappointed with this sad, inaccurate pretext for the adaptation!
