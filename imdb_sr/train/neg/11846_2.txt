After I looked at this movie, I complained to the local cinema about the sound quality of the soundtrack or whether the sound system in the cinema may be wrong. At least in the first half of the film it's extremely difficult to understand what someone is saying about background music and sound scratching. I was ready to blame the cinematographic equipment, but not so - it was the director. I was told that the subject matter of my appeal is an essential part of making a movie. Music and sound should be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film. These days, directors will do their best to make their film unique. Unfortunately, no matter where and how you watch the movie, the sound will be the same. So, in addition to the historical inaccuracies of this movie (which you can find elsewhere), the distortion sound is in itself a good reason to show this film a defect. You will only hear a distorted scratch of the soundband and certainly not a cat's mice.
