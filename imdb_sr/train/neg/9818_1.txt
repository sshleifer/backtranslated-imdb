This film launches a series of urgent questions in my head. First, how did Jennifer Tilly manage to maintain a film career all these years based on this ridiculous screaming voice and the very limited scope of the expression she used? Second ... what, for God's sake, are people responsible for the fact that this offensive and deeply rejected film meant? And third ... given that there have been people who have so much made up their mind to decide to make such a move, should not there be anyone in the system - in the studio, distributors, or somewhere - healthy enough to prevent it from being completed and release. . You really should search a very, very long way to open another movie as it's very nasty ... and it's not even charged as a horror movie - which, to the extent that it can be considered as belonging to any legitimate film film genre, it's certainly. The film starts from the beginning to the end in the worst of madness, violence and abuse, and there is no substantial opportunity to repurchase it. I do not really advocate censorship (which I do not believe in) ... but I really do not see how anyone could imagine anything positive from watching such a movie.
