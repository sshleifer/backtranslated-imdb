Get your breweries and enjoy this flicked action. Speakman's significant artificial expertise (nice turn, decent with sticks - poor couch!) Is the only redeeming quality of the movie that only cries bad acting. The plot is not half bad; just executed pretty badly. But if you're watching this movie for anything other than martial arts, miss the boat completely. And for a film that should be held in Koreatan, too few Korean actors (even statists).
