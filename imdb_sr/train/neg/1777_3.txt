If you are a fan of movies that enjoys original content and intelligent uncertainty ... then look elsewhere, kids, because Sleepwalkers really shit. I'm usually more eloquent than that, but ... this was bad. I especially love when Charles offers Tanya a ride home, she refuses it, and then they see him at home. Where's his car? In any case, you just do not see, folks. I really want to be more accurate, but my words are running away. Cats jump on people. The type of corn sting. Cheesei agrees with the proverbial "vazoo". You just can not see it. Wait, I take it back! Look at him as writer Stephen King as a guy who owns a cemetery. It's actually pretty good. Even with the visits of Mark Hamilton and Ron Perlman, King gives the best performance of the film. But, besides ... vow ... BAD.
