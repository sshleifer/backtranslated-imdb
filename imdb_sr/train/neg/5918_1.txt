Carl Panzram lived an incredible life and wrote his memoirs on pieces of paper for the only possible person who ever did something selfless for him. The book "Panzram: The Journal of Murder" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, which had left most of the century after Panzram's death, gives the historical context to the account of the first generation of Americans to escape from home to go west and be a cowboy, be caught, thrown into a boy's house, escape successively and thrown into prison again and again time of torture and sodomization. As Panzram became enormous and strong, he sought to vindicate the injustice done to him while he traveled to South America, Europe and Africa, and it did not matter what people raped, looted or killed because we are equally worthless. This film casts skinny James Woods as a rough door, the son of Karl Panzram's son of a bitch, who is "drunk" in a film, too dramatic and emotional, and who never mentions the joy of sodomizing men and boys. The film does not explicitly explain anything about the notes about this world traveler and career prisoner (such as the looting of former President Taft or release from prison in Oregon as long as he gave his word to return). In short, I do not think Carl would be happy.
