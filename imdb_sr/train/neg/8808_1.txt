"ASTONISHING" Screams LA Times on the front of the DVD box. They must have thought about the fact that such a sad shit was ever released. The film revolves around a crowd of girls who have a disease that forces them to become cannibals, and kill innocent people just to stay alive. Their skin is peeled throughout the film, we also see broken legs, heads, etc. Which are convincing as a set of Fuzzy Felt. There are many stories about b / l ** ks, a little human kitchens and some strange zombie hunter who closes the sick of that skin disease in a wardrobe tied to the chair before they pinch them in the head, cutting them into bits ... <br /> Get the picture. Given that there is no acting talent at all, and above is ridiculously unrealistic, what is the purpose of the whole Farrah? Again watching the video box, the guy responsible for this is an "underground cult director." Would it be like those strange religious cults in which you brainwash yourself in thinking in one way when it is clearly the opposite? Because that's the only possible reason I can imagine someone can enjoy watching this tax deduction. Then, on the same paragraph, he compared himself with Mike Leigh, Ken Loach, and George Romer. HAHAHAHAHA oh stop it. Now you're just stupid. Do you enjoy this movie? Are you offended by the above-mentioned opinion? If so, you must be a member of the aforementioned cult. Do they give you pockets? Do they allow you to see other family members? Do they make you watch Andrew Parkinson's films until you think he's the best director of A.Hitchcock? Say ... this sounds like a special Panorama. And say goodbye to LA's critics when you return to your colony, will you? 0/10
