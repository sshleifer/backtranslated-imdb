I was hoping this film would be a little fun, as would other types of his genre. However, it was miserable and I did not find myself laughing a lot. Look at HBO, maybe, or if you have a free rental for waste and you need a movie that will pass you. But I do not recommend that you see it. The action is simple and clear, and it may have been funny if the scenario is better. Jason Li can be funny, and he laughs here and there, but the film falls. Just do not see this. The direction is unclear, but for what it is, direction is not so important. I suppose his main disadvantage is that it's not so funny. See something else, do not waste time here.
