Having heard such a praise for this performance, I decided to watch it when I stumbled across it. I do not see how this "encourages" women and their "struggles" by focusing on the subject. I suppose that if you are interested in stories about female private parts and how it affects their lives, then this is for you. Otherwise, it's pretty boring and boring. If nothing else, I think it's a little humiliating. I was wondering with a friend who also watched this and she thought she was terrible too. So, not just the guy does not get.
