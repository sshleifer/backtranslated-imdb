Obviously, the Tortured Man is talking about a guy who is wandering around the earth and carries out hours of self-sacrifice as a way to cope with his violent childhood. I use the word 'obviously' because without listening to the comments of director Andyi Copp (which I did not have at my disposal) or reading the movie before watching, the viewers will have no idea what it is about. Gorehounders and extreme movie lovers may be lured to watch The Mutilation Man with the promise of some sharp spray scenarios and disturbing real-life footage, but unless they are prone to pretentious, challenging headaches, experimental art-house cinemas, find will this real little thing go through. 82 minutes of ugly pictures accompanied by dishonorable sound, horrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this mind-numbing terrible madness is the perfect way to test a common sense: if you still have all your marbles, you will exclude this garbage and watch something decent instead (I looked at the whole thing, but I know I'm totally bark!).
