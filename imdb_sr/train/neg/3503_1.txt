And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love a strange, dishonorable humor. But this woman is so damn B-O-R-I-N-G, boring, and reckless-worthy. She also lacks everything that is humor. The unsuccessful way in which he is trying to deliver his lines is dead only on arrival, because he is not very funny. I watched two segments of her program and was ready for a new one. I thought it was a compliment. The one she says "Look at my show or I'll kill a dog" is really convincing. I know she wants to be a comedian. She just came across as a distorted case. I just do not want to see her near my dog.
