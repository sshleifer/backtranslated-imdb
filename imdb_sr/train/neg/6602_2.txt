For my life, I can not figure out why someone would make such a movie. The action is tired, the act is tense, the language is a consistent violation, and sometimes the excessive use of the word "F" seemed to be like the lack of dialogue prevailing, so let's throw a couple of "F" for good measure, that's what the American public wants he hears. Gossett was particularly nasty and seemed to enjoy his role. Forget this c__p, rent "Shrek" and smile.
