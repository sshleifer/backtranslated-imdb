I recently watched this movie on DVD and I have to say that I was not impressed. I know that taboo is a whirlwind of independent films, but this has been devoid of fun. The premise was interesting, but the execution was short. I found myself thinking "okay, they just go into it, the story will come soon." Before I knew it, the film was over and the story never picked up. I can not say that the acting was so impressive. It was pretty bad. Not Star Vars threw the trilogy bad, but still bad. I'm not sure how much time to run, I presume two hours (because it's a reliable estimate). In any case, when the film was over, I felt like I deserve some kind of recognition for the willpower I had in not stopping the movie and going halfway. and in the end I'm bored. I'm not one of those guys who demand quick action and explosions in the movie, so do not start from me because that's the reason I do not like it.
