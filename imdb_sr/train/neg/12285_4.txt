The story is absurd and lame, and sucking is a play and dialogue, it's hard to keep your eyes open. I advise you to have a friend who has a caffeine drive and to wake you up in time for a couple of effects. Why bring Alcatraz? In this case, it becomes increasingly difficult to swallow. All the time, I wondered who this film was intended for? A chunk that is full of solder subgroups (such as a captain of the American army of cannibalism) This is a low degree in every aspect.
