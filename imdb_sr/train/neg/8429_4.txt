This film does not offer anything new in a genre that traditionally portrayed a cultural love story supported by politics in the mid 20th century / before the Second World War in India, where the British and their modern ways are bad and primitive, but honest and genuine Indians are Good. Surely, such clich√©s of the British are now quite transient. In addition to the drama that launches the second part of the film, narration is predictable, the acting is walking and two-dimensional, and the direction is obvious. The story really should have been elaborated and surely would have benefited from another half an hour of screen to give deeper depths to characters and narration and give the viewer something to feel some investment in. All in all, pretty unassuming. Oh, and Linus Roache just can not do a tragedy.
