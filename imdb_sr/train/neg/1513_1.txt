Flock is not a movie. It's a movie called "Vannabe", with actors who want to stay. Not including Richard Gere, he gave a great performance, but when only one of the actors truly goes to his character, and the rest of the actors are just acting ... the result is pathetic, just like this movie. You see, the idea of ​​acting is to hide the fact that you are behaving. What the hell is Claire Dains doing in this? She is the most suitable actress for this character. In 99.9% of films she looked amazing, out of everything !! The only thing she was doing was asking stupid questions like "You really think so?", And making stupid faces. I was embarrassed for her acting, seriously, and I loved to love her ... She is a romantic movie, I do not know who picked it up among all the actresses there ... LOL, and saw Avril Lavigne ?! This really made me laugh .. In any case .. If you want to get a feeling of vomiting, this movie will do the job for you !!! I wish I could vote ...
