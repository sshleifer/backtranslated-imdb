I was interested in this topic, and only Drew Barrimore dance lovers at David Letterman's desk will find something interesting in him. OK, she shows some breasts (or maybe a double body). The plot is chopped into pieces and the acting is terrible. There is no material for work, too, because the direction of the film does not lead anywhere. Do not waste your time. Look at Donnie Darck instead of if you want the dreaded movie Drew Barrymore, and if you want to see another one, skip this and look at Darka again. See Charles Villiams's novel "Descent Into Hell" for something that should be considered. This is just an excuse to create a B movie to go directly to videos and suck some life from people in the Blockbuster. Give me a break.
