not in a fun way. It's just bad. It's shocking that people here posted positive things. the story is shit, the acting is bad, it's not terrible, special effects are not special - oh no! The board has hands that come out of it! oh gee - the mirror has turned into water! hair, clothes and make-up in the scenes from the 1950s are not accurate, and they got a middle-aged man with a drawn hair to play the high school version of themselves. This is like a late nightmare to things in the street of a bush. I enjoy sitting on a movie with horrible horror as much as anyone else, but there are better ones who can choose.
