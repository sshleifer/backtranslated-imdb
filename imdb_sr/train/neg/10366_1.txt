That was more than 80 minutes of half an unexpected boredom. First, I wondered how it was possible to produce something like that. Then, reaching the 70th minute, I convinced myself that it was only a few minutes, and lasted until the very end I am proud of, because I think this film is an excellent test for human patience and tolerance. Was it worth watching at all? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test, try and if you are strong enough, it may even last until the end ... The film lacks coherence and characters do not have common sense all. All the happenings in the movie, you can be sure that you have seen it before, and it seems that they are set in this movie just to fill the movie roller.
