I probably do not give this film a fair shake, because I could not watch it all. Perhaps I saw him in the theater, in his original presentation, maybe I appreciated him, but for me it's too slow. I read the book some 25 years ago and the plot details faded from memory. This did not help the movie, because it is somewhat less vivid and clear in the presentation of the event. These are really four related films, or a four-part movie, and it was, I believe, intended to be seen over four nights in the theater presentation. I found Deo And to be fun enough, but that's all I could do to sit through Part II, which is endlessly pulling. Reading Tolstoy's philosophy is one thing. If you get a good translation or you can read it in the original, its brilliant writing far outweighs any problems that you might have with the tempo of the story. On the film, however, it is difficult to reproduce without being difficult. I have other problems with the parts of the movie that I have seen. It's very flat, with a lot of work on the camera that attracts attention to itself, instead of serving to improve the story. It's clear that I'm missing something, but I just could not invite enthusiasm to build parts III and IV.
