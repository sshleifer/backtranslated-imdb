It's not a bad start for the program - but what a slap in real law enforcement. The worst part of the series is that it is trying to charge itself as the real price - and that's all. Men and women who dedicate their lives to the implementation of the law deserve better than that. What's next, medical school for a minute? Charo runs lipo? Charles Grodin helps to replace the hip? Come on ... show some respect. Even the Muncie people planned the program. Police Academy = High School? Bad editing (how many times can I use the Taco Bell car in the background?), The siren siren effects (the same loop added an ad nauseum to each 'call', whether it's a code or not), and the last , but not less important - more questions about the security of the officer than you might upset the stick. If I want to see a produced police job and wise fake police officers, I would look at the RENO 911.
