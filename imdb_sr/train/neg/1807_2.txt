I admit, since I became an adult in the hippie-dippy age, I am a fool for such films. I can enjoy in a frog a hippie genre far more than most "normal" people. However, this film is simply terrible in every possible way. Every thorough perception of the hippie stupidity is portrayed as a gospel, cops kill young long hair when the plane landed steadily. This film is so scary that it's not even ridiculous to watch as stupid on the excess of the hippie drone. It's like a left-wing version of Dragnet, except for professional actors. The only reason I gave him two stars is that there are some uncertainties in the soundtrack, and I could not find a selection for the negative stars. Without actors, almost without complications, sheezes, barely even a script ... you got it, an "art" movie ... All this is done on a slow rooting of the root canal, pulling out every nonsense scene only to fill the time. In a bizarre reversal of life imitating art, the star's "nectar" movie joined the municipality in real life and robbed a bank in Boston, one of his snipers was killed and sent to a prison where he was killed in a suspicious weight lifting "accident" ... and just think, it has to leave this behind itself as a legacy ... Oi vei.
