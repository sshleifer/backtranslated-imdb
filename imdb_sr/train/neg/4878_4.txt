If you want to make this kind of film, the threat is real. Do not surround your duck with Bonza. There is no credibility here. The plot is boring and incredible. The act is even worse. I thought I was watching Arthur Lake (Dagvood), one of the worst actors in history when I saw the main character. Oh well, at some point it has to face music and fight with madness. I do not care. Is not it? There are all those long scenes set up in this strict office (furniture made of cardboard or masonite). People talk and smoke and do nothing. Most actions take place in a five-minute series. After that, it's over. Do not bother.
