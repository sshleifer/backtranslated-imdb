This film may be the cheapest, most integral and poorest continuation ever made. Still, it's the funniest and most interesting Disney movie, which will guarantee laughing skate stories and crazy plots from the beginning to the It's a group of short stories that look like bad fanfictions. SPOLER ALERT * The first is all about the Beasts and the Belle are tiny through a pathetic argument. Then, three new faces of the losers decide to patch things by making a letter of gratitude to be given by Belle. In a way, through this little episode, Belle has the wall eyes, which my brothers and sisters laughed so hard. Then she and the Beast fight over the letter ... and later find out the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they??? Certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. Next, the next thing is that Lumiere is the biggest drug in the world when it comes to romance. This comes from a man who can please women. And make FiFi a psychotic criminal who tries to kill Belle, and ends up in the end. What message to send children! Next, the next one is all about Mrs. Potts who is angry. And the next after that, everything is about the Beast, which becomes excessively obsessive for the bird, to the point where it just seems foolish. The animation is so ugly that it kills. There are at least 100 mistakes you can clearly see ... and coloring is terrible. Belle is a lovely juice that rob whenever something goes wrong. Plus, it's tiny and very different from the usual Belle. Strange characters are boring ... (I mean, Cogsvorth and Lumiere fight for almost all the time. I know they did it in the movie, but that was too great.) But the worst character is Madame Potts. It's destroyed in this. I can not describe that. Just buy it and see for yourself. I give her 1/10 for juice, but I give it 10/10 for comedy.
