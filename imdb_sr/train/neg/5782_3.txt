A lesbian movie about vampires on holidays that reside on what they think is an empty castle, but is really used as a couple of lesbian vampires. While the vampires bring an occasional victim, the couple goes to work until the two groups collapse together. Make sure you recommend this cult film. Yes, it's a sexy story about a vampire. No, it's not far more interesting than women. To be honest, there is a reason to see the photos of this film in horror books and magazines that look great, but in addition ... For those who want to see only sexy vampires.
