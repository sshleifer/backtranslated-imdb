I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne Bronte's novel when I read it some time ago and I usually enjoy BBC dramas. But, I am very disappointed, I never thought it would be so bad: the entire series smiled more amorously than the novel started me. First of all, music (and songs) seems completely unmistakeable in the period of the drama (it sounds like it was written for a modern horror movie) and as the second commentator, I was particularly angry about the way the cameras turned and turned around the actors. I've seen some scenes taken in this way in the "North and South" and everything seemed to be fine, but in the Booker, it's definitely exaggerated and simply boring. Moving the camera can not make a wooden game alive. Most of the other roles were difficult to distinguish at the beginning and the script had no clarity. No image has been correctly displayed. The little boy gave a very good performance, he is very cute and the best feature of the film. SPOILER Characterization Helen Graham Tara Fitzgerald made her look cold and rude, not allowing emotions to pass. He does not seem to be able to cry in a realistic way at all. I just could not believe Markham could fall for her, and I did not mention the terrible hairstyle she got. I could not refrain from her husband! Fans married for such a virgin ... Besides, he was the only major actor who sounded to me right. Toby Stephens I found just OK, Brother Helen Graham is not very good. Perhaps it is difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such gloomy topics as alcoholism and cruelty. In addition, what the book simply hints at and leaves it to the imaginary reader in the book, focuses on television adaptation: making some scenes both rude and comical (as when Huntingdon's eye begins to bleed), and others too much for sex Period Drama! I mean, are not we getting enough beds in modern drama?
