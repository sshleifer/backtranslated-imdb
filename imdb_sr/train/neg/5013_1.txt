I will not argue with anyone who declares this film scarce, as well as the January Jones performance, but please check, if not already, in the AMC TV series 'Mad Men', starting this month. I will, I suppose, assume that it has taken the role of "taboo" strictly for money, and realizing that it will be a nasty mess, has turned into a minimal acting thing to avoid hunger. I know if this is the case, but I know (now) that it can work. First, watching "Taboo," I was convinced that her delivery in flats was a tricky choice that would later trigger something great discovery about her character or complication, it's not that lucky, it's hard to believe her director he did not say that he can not change the expression for 17 consecutive scenes. , her winning performance in "Mad Men" comes as a character who, at least in her early performances, is very suppressed, reserved, unsure in herself, and rather colorless, not unlike her "taboo" role. But as the TV series progressed, it began to blossom into someone who called into question its traditional role in the early 60's. I can not wait to see where her character will be in the second season. In short, avoid "taboo" like wrinkles, but be sure to check "crazy".
