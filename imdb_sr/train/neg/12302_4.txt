Italian / American co-production with Lynn Blair and David 'The Hoff' Hasselhoff: How could one of the trashy horror fans resist such a treat? Well, based on insignificant, extremely boring, and completely meaningless first forty minutes, I would say 'very easy'; Fortunately, things get more and more fun with the introduction of several inventive scenes of death, and for those who are lucky enough to find an uncut copy, also a little nudity (unfortunately, my copy is optically arranged to remove such offensive material Hoff plays Garia, a photographer who traces his pretty girl Leslie (Leslie Cumming) to a failed hotel on a seemingly abandoned island to photograph her final project, a witty book, while frustrated Geri also hopes to try to cure a bad blue ball game who will rid Leslie of her innocence.His plans for the nookie, however, are outraged by the unexpected arrival of investors Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), son of Tommy (Michael Manchester), rather nymph architect Linda Saliven (Catherine Hickland), and real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsvorth), who came to inspect the Island Hotel. After explaining their unexpected presence on the island, Gary and Leslie were greeted by the new owners of the property, and when they are the violent storm is suddenly lifted, which is disastrous to return to the land, everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building. Unfortunately, not knowing about new hotel guests, this place is also home to the spirit of the evil witch (Hildegard Knef), which requires human sacrifices to get back to life. One by one, the victims get into the whirlpool of the red vortex (which guarantees unintentional laughing) before they encounter a terrible fate. None of this has much meaning, and the acting is terrible (Manchester) as Tommy is particularly bad, while Hasselhoff proved to be one of the best performers, which speaks of others), but those viewers who passed through the gloomy first half were rewarded with quite decent moments up: Rose had her lips sewn together before they were baked in the fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burnt alive; Linda was tortured by herds and stuffed on swords (!!); Freddi's veins pulsate and erupt in blood geysers; and Garry was stabbed in the back. Oh, and Leslie raped a guy without lips and Blair was obsessed (again).
