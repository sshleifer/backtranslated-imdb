I refused to watch this when I was originally broadcasting it, remembering the late series with the sixties with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I can never resist the challenge. I should have known. Not quite remake, and more parody than hommage, this show did not quite know how to play, and plumped with infantile comedy and cartoons and characters. The three main characters were just caricatures of the actors, and only Emilia Fox could act (Bob Mortimer was ill in a straight role). Supporting actors were only comedians-acquaintances of Vic and Bob who wanted to be part of the joke, and were too aware of the situation to be convincing. And the CGI, although the effects could not help improve compared to those available 30 years ago, only blinded the viewer with the lights and camera performance, and did not do much to mask the poor quality of the scripts and dialogues. All style and without content. (And while the 1960s show was ridiculed for having been a long time, this upgrade is now also very outdated, with the Matrix style of fashion, the compulsory 'girls' scenes, and less than the subtle tension between the two living waters .)
