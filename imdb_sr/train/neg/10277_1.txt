I feel totally torn off. Somebody has to return the $ 4.95 I spent in Blockbuster to rent this home mess. This is not a musical, it's a total waste of time and my evening. What I do not understand is why this was allocated to the first place ... ... somebody had to do some heavy drugs the night they agreed. I saw films from film schools better and I was in a film school to say that as a fact. The quality of this work is also very bad to watch ... recorded on DV ??? Nuff said. Songs are not poems, but only a joke that sounds the same in each section. You want to see a good musical? Then do not rent this movie.
