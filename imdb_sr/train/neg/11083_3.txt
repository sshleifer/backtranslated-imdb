This movie was late at night when I saw it. It was interesting at the beginning, but it did not convince me in general. I'm not the fan of Tyson. In fact, I do not like boxing at all. It is a barbaric, obscene and double face (by society) that some get money for beating. Still, I felt that the beginning of the film was fine. Actors are fine, especially George C. Scott (as Cus D'Amato). I do not know how reliable it is. I did not read books and books about Boxing or Tison. I do not know anything about this man, but it was pretty fun. As the film continued, I felt that it had lost some of its charm and I also lost interest. I managed to stay awake, but the last hour was not good enough.
