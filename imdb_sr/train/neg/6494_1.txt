I like Anthony Hopkins as an actor, so I was very interested to see how he would work as a writer / director. I could not be disappointed with this move. The film was so unconnected and the cinema was so ending to the extent that I wanted to pull the plug from the wall. The actors were very good, but it was such a loss of talent. Not all actors are cut out to be writers or directors and clearly Mr. Hopkins is in this category. Of all the movies I've ever seen in these 50 years, this is absolutely the worst movie ever. Please do us all the service to Mr. Hopkins and stick to the acting, in which you are excellent, and leave the writing and directing to those who are talented in those areas. If I could give this film a rating smaller than one, I would certainly.
