During the sleepless nights, I went over the channels and found this shame of the film. What did they think? If this is a life after "remote control" for Kara (Vuhrer) Salin, no wonder she did not go anywhere. role? Pathetic! In any case, I turned the movie close to the end, so I did not get much complication. But this is certainly the best part. This kid who brings this domicile girl to school ... this scene is straight from comics - or inexpensive porn movies. She calls her mother an anal retarder and loves her father "Oh, I did not expect a tongue!" Excellent lines! After this, I had to see how this would end. up. And that ... they surround her! AND YES YES! The kid breaks her brain !!!! AHAHHAHAHAHA !! This is a TV that must be seen. <br /> <br />
