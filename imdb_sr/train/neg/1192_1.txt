I totally agree with jam 4 this was one of the most horrible films I've ever seen .. the holy shit was terrible .. I was warned not to see him .. and I dumbly watched him anyway .. about 10 minutes into a painful experience I completely quit watching horror .. but sat down to the end .. just to see if I can .. I did well and now I want that I was not ... it was disgusting .. nothing happened and the end was all preachi .. a movie that badly has the right to survive .. I beg you all to spare the terror of the fatty discs on the bus ... just that I listened the same way maturing .. save yourself from this movie. I have the feeling that those who highly rated him were involved in making the movie .. and everything should be deleted from the face of the planet ..
