Frankly, before I watched this movie, I heard that many people say this film is a shame. I did not believe that Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacei took over the role in this film, and they watched it by themselves. Apparently they were right. I was really disappointed and wondered all the time during the movie - why I was watching this movie, damn it. the business. But Morgan and Kevin? I could not stop wondering why they had agreed to take part in Edison. To be honest, their roles are pretty stupid. Well, you might think that if the players are down, then I should pay more attention to that story. That's really the story is the core of the film, but the guys ... believe me ... this is not the movie you want to deserve for his story. Imagine this, a smart journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learned how to become a "true" journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). All this was supported by an agent who still has a heart for justice (LL Cool J) and a brilliant researcher (Kevin Spacei). In the end, they won the system with a happy ending story. My God, I could not even continue with this. I only remember the film, I'm already sick. My guys, do not look at this! Save money and time for another movie.
