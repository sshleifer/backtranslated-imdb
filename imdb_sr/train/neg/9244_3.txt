He can deal with historical inaccuracies, but this film was too much. Practically, nothing was near the truth, and even for eru, it was considered stupid. In the forda defense, it was revealed to the old talk shov that he worked on the story as the real Viatt Earp, who was obviously old, senile, told the scene in his own way. Earp told the director about the carriage and how it is planned to happen during the arrival of the carriage, so that despite what other historians claim, Viat himself claims that it was premised. man and his brothers. History does not say exactly that they were or not. Most people like to get a little scam and lawlessness into their characters, but it's nothing new. The truth is probably closer to those who are in accordance with the law, and that's the PUNA IN THE CORAL. People who saw this as a career, and believe me, in the old West, you did not have time to think too much about it. Characters that do not exist, the characters shown die on Corral that really is not, it all makes a weaker film. It is further weakened by the mature, who really did not convince the doctor. He may be the worst choice ever for Doc, but at the same time we must remember that the older films were closer to the era and closer to the feeling of the truth. After all, ford got the first-hand information from Viatt Earp. It is also undermined by all so predictable events involving a Mexican girlfriend. Hollywood was very pro-Nazi at that time and was ready to kill brunettes in a very predictable way to show his patronage to Hitler's idealism. It happens in most films until the 1980s. This is not an excuse, but it diminishes art. Actors who play Earps do well, and Brennan is always excitement. In fact, a mature person may be the only negative side of this film. Still, it's the weakest of the old OK Corral movies.
