There seems to be an amazingly high number of reviews of 8-10 stars from people who have never written an IMDb review before or after. Considering the very low average rating given to other people by the film, I think you can make your own conclusions. This is a very bad movie. I admit, I thought that the concept was sweet, and I was glad to see the actresses played by Eve and Harmoni on Angel and got the job, but it did not take long to make the horror of this film to myself. Actors: Guides were competent enough, but everyone else? Terrible. Chart: Fully filled holes for truck driving. Direction: Does not exist. Humor: Do they really think that people will laugh? Oh boi. Eie Candi: OK. in this film were some really nice women. Not just three main female characters, but also across the street. It was as if the producers were hoping that the scenery would keep male viewers so distracted that they would not notice how much everything else was terrible. If so, they have failed. In the right hands this could have been a sweet, but darkly ridiculous camping classic. It's not even close.
