Dear God, what a movie! Let's first talk about "special effects". Do not misunderstand me, I'm not one of those fanatics with effects, but I really thought that superimposition was a practice long ago, mostly in the sixties. So for some time I thought that they may have made this film a long time ago, and it should have been for them to cut it forever and free. But as far as I know, they did not have mobile phones of the 60s ... What I'm looking for in movies is usually a good story with a really good message. Behavior is secondary, the effects are secondary, I do not even think of a few inconsistencies. However, in films such as this bad acting, incredibility, etc. They seem to be even worse movies - that's what happened to me with the Celestine prophecy. Well, even though I'm not in all these spiritual things, I can somehow see that it can be transmitted in a convincing way - the film did not do it. this one. If you really love mermaid movies this will be the right thing for you. If the IMDb stars were for cheesiness, not quality, I MUST evaluate this film as a ten star. (see comments on this - funny). Celestial Prophecy is at least somewhat fun.
