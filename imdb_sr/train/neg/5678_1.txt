It should be one of the worst, if not the worst movie I've ever seen. (I could not watch it all). It's pure and simple, it's a waste of violence just because of it, and the funny story only contributes to the dark and incompetent recording. Sick. And it's only suitable for those who like manic messing. After killing several hundred men, women and children, Seed was finally caught after he effortlessly killed several more policemen who finally got advice on where he was. He is sentenced to death by an electric chair and he miraculously survives! Mercury buried, he dug his way out and planned a revenge against those who took him and switched the switch. Needless to say, there are more terrible murders ...
