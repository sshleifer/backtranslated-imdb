As a big fan of horror films, especially J-Horror and up, I thought Nekeddo Buraddo sounded pretty good. I surveyed the store, read reviews, and even looked at some photos to make sure it was a good and horrible watching movie before I downloaded it. So excited that he finished and was ready to be afraid and bounced in horror in a miraculous mount I was expecting to be terribly disappointed. The action was funny and did not make sense and left it too inexplicable, the blood was funny than scary, and what about the sound effects of the cartoon? The act was probably the only thing that was a bit scary. I did not understand the idea of ​​the cactus and the way in which the husband's husband disappeared in the middle of the sea, after a flash of light followed, they were quite unexplained, or I missed him because my mind could not understand what I actually see. I appreciate the way it should be; shocking and a few scenes (strange cannibalism and kissing mother?) are certainly, I just think they went a bit far and even in a horrifying way, they made it inconclusive, making it more convincing that comedy is horrible in my opinion. However, it's a very fun movie and I'm amazed by many friends and friends, but unfortunately, we expected horror and comedy, so it's worth watching a fun value, but do not expect the dark, deeply terrifying and terrifying film; you will only be disappointed. If it was a horror comedy / podvala, I would probably have rated it for nine, and the peak was a strange scene when my husband climbed into the stomach of his wife and closed her wounds, but unfortunately, I gave her one horror.
