I have 2 words for you. Sean Bean. He is the only worthwhile presence in this film. But still, you do not see this movie. Although he is good as a major bad guy, you do not want to waste time. I did not care about the characters (except for the little boy) and actually, I did not care if the lovers who crossed the stars ended up together or died. The film did not make me carefree or I BELIEVE that these people were worried about each other. I read many "classic" novels after I saw movies and this film did not even want to read me. The story works so boring. But I can go forward and read it in order to try to buy the story in my head. Distant from Lorne Doone. The actress who acted with Lorna was also in Sensibility and Sensibility and was much better at it. Watch Sharpe, Horatio Hornblover, A & E has great movies about novels such as pride and prejudice. Or miniseries like Forsite Saga. Check them out, do not bother with Lorne Doone.
