I missed the beginning, but I saw most of it. A friend bought it on a DVD in a cheap room in FIE. The skates are very short, yet most of them are still too long. Most of them seem to have forgotten to have something funny! A lot of racist / sexist / "homophobic" humor in it, sketches based on stereotypes, or sketches using racist expressions for humans. , and I have problems .... The Tunnel Vision logo is a mouth with a lipstick in the mouth with an ocular apple. The mouth opens and closes around the eye like eyelids. Very creepy. What a disappointment. Most actors went for better things and fortune that this bomb did not keep them.
