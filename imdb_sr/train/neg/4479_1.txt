I'll be honest, this is one of the worst movies ever. If not, then VERY is close. Have you ever seen a bad soap opera. Well this is like one of them. Except worse. For example: (MOBILE SPOILER) girl: I want to go somewhere else. Boy: All we need is here. Guy: I'll take you somewhere else. <br /> <br /> ... By continuing this line they have sex. Music is a bad and bad punk rock. If you've ever read a book, avoid this film as a plague. They completely change the personality of characters and events. Besides, they are just solving things. Also, the movie ends before the book is over. It's an AVFUL movie. So if you have not read the book, do not look at it. If you read the book, burn it (film). If you like stupid teen soaps that are of poorer quality than your average low-quality teapot soap, start off. Then again, should we expect something different from MTV?
