102 Dalmatians (2000, Dir. Kevin Lima) It is believed to have been cured, Cruella de Vil (Close) has been released from jail and is moving into a new beginning of life. Things are happening well for Cruell, who is busy helping homeless people on the street. When a clock strikes Big Ben, things get bad. The hypnotic medication is inverted and Cruella is back, and this time she is determined to make that coat that she has always wanted. Movie. Every scene with her in it is worth watching in this boring sequel, which is felt more like a repetition of the previous film than a new story. Changed. ?? Ken Sheperd (Ioan Gruffudd)
