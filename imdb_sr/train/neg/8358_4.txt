This is not one of the best Arbuckle or Keaton movies, that's for sure. A fat woman is tired of being drunk, so she is taken to a sanatorium where the psychiatrist (Keaton) claims to have a guaranteed medication! Well, once in there, Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and takes the surgery. Then she escapes and fishes where she meets a sweet girl who also wants to escape. Finally, despite the fact that they are being hijacked, they are running away at that moment and it becomes obvious that the girl is crazy and Arbuckle is soon caught again. However, he wakes up and everything that was after the operation was a dream - there was no sexy crazy girl, and Dr. Keaton is not as incapable as he seemed in a dream. The lack of humor is the biggest problem with the movie. Of course, the ridicule of mentally ill people is quite low, but in our time was guaranteed laughing. And I would laugh if it would be funny to answer! A lot of energy and that's all. FII - during one of the hunting sequences, Fatti is asked in a race for men over 200 pounds (wow, what are the chances of that?). And, soon after, he returns to the post where number 5 is just painted. As a result, five are now on the back of the Fatti shirt and look like a regular participant. However, the number should appear back on a fat shirt, but it went forward - a mistake, because they should have understood that the mirror image would be back 5.
