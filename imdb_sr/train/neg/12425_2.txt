I do not know what you're breathtaking, but please, stop. This film was a complete garbage. Macaulai Culkin as Kevin McCallister was cute, sweet, cute, full of love and extremely fun to watch. He had this innocence, but at the same time he was strong. This new kid, Alec? Boring like hell! Only the obvious effort to try to match Culkin's charm and grace, is unsuccessful. Zlikovci, total bullshit. Harry and Marv, they were so fun on the screen. They were comical, they were humorous, and they just made you really want to get even more for Culkin, a good criminal. These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, absolutely PERFECT for these roles. On the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots who are just arguing and trying again to capitalize on the charisma and the duo of the charm of the first villains. I'm not saying they're terrible, but they were not unforgettable or even really fun. More on the stagnant side. Then we got real movies. The first and second part, the classics. Memorable. Perfect for watching around Christmas and brings a wonderful Christmas feeling and brings so much emotion. It makes you fall in love with the story and worry about the characters. Simple, unforgettable and close to the masterpiece. Part 3? Masterpiece of crap. Enough is enough. Everything and everything, I do not know why people like this. I think people no longer know what a good movie is. His shorthand continuation with unrealistic traps and a stupid new main character that I would like to rob at least overwhelm shit. Run, run away from this garbage. And let's not start with Part 4!
