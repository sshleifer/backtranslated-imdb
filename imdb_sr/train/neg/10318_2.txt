Who likes horrible "comedies" such as the Small Mosque in Prairie? The only two types of people I can recall are: One, the Muslims and the self-proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so enthusiastic about the idea of ​​Muslims that it does not matter at all whether the performance is good or funny (which is not). Second, old people and people whose idea of ​​comedy is incredibly predictable, poorly written, staggering jokes. The CBC should really look at what they are doing and who their audience is. If they only write a comedy for really old people then guess what will happen, their audience will soon die and will not have more audience. I wonder who's writing about this show? Do you think they are actually Muslims, or funny young people? No, I bet the old white guys are writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC emissions since the sixties. When you watch CBC comedy, Air Farce was the only one who finally took off the air (thank God!), but we still have poor ducks like this clock has 22 minutes and Rick Mercer for which we pay , not to mention this bad excuse for the "comedy" of the Small Mosque in Praia. Should it be funny and fun? Only the CBC would have thought that this lameness was subtle or funny at all. It's a shame for cross-border cooperation to disperse our tax dollars on shows that only a few people would be upsetting.
