This film took me away. The title may have been the biggest idea I've heard. I thought it was an independent film about the outbreak of zombies and their quest for the takeover of the US and a group of survivors, to unite and plan to carry out zombies. DEAD VRONG! It's a psycho-policeman with a weakness in murdering a woman's arrest and getting what comes to him when the zombie stars rise from their graves to get the right revenge. As you can see, nothing applies to the nation or to the county. Where to begin with the seriousness of this film disaster that caused our nation. First, zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with a dark eye pencil and pale face. What are zombies, but foolish, discreet, intelligent, cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive, basic needs? These zombie women walk like street walkers and runway models, talk like they're in a bad movie noir movie and do not act like real zombies. It is safe to eat and kill here, but where is the foolishness and terrible punishment? Although this is a very interesting concept and maybe a great satire on a zombie genre, it draws the genre and asks: "Why can not zombies be a nice machine for killing foxes?" I would say that this film would be considered a really bad indie film produced by garage drug addicts. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who loves zombie too much, it's an insult and it's not scary.
