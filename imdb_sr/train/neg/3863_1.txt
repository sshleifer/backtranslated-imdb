Vov. That's roughly how much I can say now. Who writes these things? Who produces this stuff? Which self-respecting actor would agree to "starve" in these things? Oh my God! I do not know how I managed to get through this film, but I suppose that the fact that I had 8 cups of coffee on that day was a key element in keeping the wake. Dear God! It was one of the most sought-after and foreseeable parts of the cinema I've ever seen ... and for the record, I never planned to testify again. First time I saw when I bought a DVD (error # 1). I mean ... I thought, hey! Julia Stiles. I like it. She's cool. I'll watch it as soon as I get home (error # 2). I tried to watch him without sighing every five minutes, wondering when this bunch of shit would end, I really am. But I was not successful. That was one of the worst things I've ever seen. I mean ... what about the thing in which he imagines what would happen, and then he returned to real life? That was bad enough when my father did it in 'Parenthood' like ten years ago. "Jokes" - and I BELIEVE me, I need a lot of them to call them - they are stupid, the characters are jerky and forgetful, the story is completely predictable ... all this makes a movie that should be RECORDED HISTORY RECORDS! I should have realized that something was wrong when I realized that I had never heard of this film. Most likely it was right on DVD. Anyone who thinks about watching this, I have one hint. DON'T! FOR GOD PEOPLE ... NO! I'm ashamed of what I have in my DVD collection, and I can not get rid of it ... Nobody, and I think NITKO does not want to buy it from me! I'm talking from the other hand and third-hand shops that would buy mud from your shoes and screw it in the window. It should tell you how much CRAP is.
