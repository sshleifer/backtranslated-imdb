AntiTrust could have been a great vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director cut out her best scenes. In the scenes in which she is, she is just a zombie. She is involved in a sub-action that is simulated on a plot in the "Get Carter" movie, but she better manages the underground plot in "Get Carter". (Guilty director). (This is a scene in which Ryan Philip's character realizes that he may not be able to trust the character of Tim Robbins, at least I think it's a loyalty to Hitchcock. The DVD shows scenes that are cut out and do not listen to the test audience.
