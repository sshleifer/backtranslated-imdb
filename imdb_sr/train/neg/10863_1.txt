LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is a really disappointing movie. I saw the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good, but this really makes me feel disappointed ... ............ This movie really wastes time and money . I went with my friend to this movie on the first day of his release and went to the cinema hall .......................... ...... ...................... The role of CIRCUIT was very small and useless in this film. I think SANJAI-DUTT has reduced the role of ARSHA WARS ........................ The character of the film is also not well defined as previous. This film shows the result of OVER-CONFIDENCE ......... The ideas of MAHATMA are also not defined and confusing ..... ........... .. REAL LARGE EXPOSURE
