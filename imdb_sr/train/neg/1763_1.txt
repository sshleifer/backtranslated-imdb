This is one of the worst movies ever recorded. Trite. Predictable. Apartment. The only thing that rated one spot was a few nice scenes that emphasized Barcelona. I suppose you would use such films in Guantanamo or some other CIA / NSA secret prison to torture the suspects. If I were in it or that I was working on it, I would change my name. Really shit. It's hard to write more than that, but I think world viewers of the movies need a head on this. On the other hand, it will be a great gift for people you can not stand. You can send them to politicians you dislike, laws, ex-wives, teachers you hated, former employees, Diku Chenei, V., and many others.
