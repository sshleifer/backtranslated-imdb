I have seen many horror shows over the years, such as Nightstalker, who dealt with the Vendigo legend, so I rejoiced with the angry spirit that caused the crime to add to the taste of the Halloween season. I made a mistake. The whole movie creates that sense of events that will happen, which will be terrifying and creepy, but then brings a very simplified story of revenge and murder due to the loss of some property. Terrible - no! This film has a lot to do with Cold Creek Manor, another total loser. . What idiots are paying for such a fake movie? Go back to the drawing guys and do something useful with those millions of money you have to throw away.
