It does not even deserve a review, other than warning to potential viewers. It's a somewhat generic story about the actress who plays in the studio during the drama of the Second World War. There is no fear, no uncertainty, no surprises. One shocking moment that seems a little stupid to be shocking. Visual style is very flat and boring, although there are plenty of nice changes. The story never comes together, and movies are actually only a complete failure. 4/10.
