I bought a DVD version of this film at the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw on television. But the version on the DVD was a disaster. The lighting was poor to nonexistent and the entire scene was simply cut out. In one case, Adele is asleep, and we immediately turn to another scene - which comes in the middle of the sentence - where the next night is. Characters like Grace Poole and Mason have never been featured, leaving one to wonder if they were in the movie for a few minutes. at $ 6.32 was a swipe. Be careful of which version of this movie you are buying! We're sending this back.
