Why did the stories of Mary and Rode have to be so fierce? Divorced women with indifferent daughters. And why is there a little mention of the original performance and characters? The face of the daughter was stupid and uninteresting. Why can never be the daughters who love their mother on TV? It makes sense for Mari to leave Minneapolis, and Rhoda would return to New York, but why Phillis or Sue Ann Nivens could not be guests? It looks like a sad way to remember such wonderful characters. It was good to see, of course, Mari and Rhoda, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there was Marie Tyler Moore Shov Reunion, Dick Van Dike Shov Reunion.
