The characteristic of the early 21st century cinema allows various evil creatures and bad guys to strike each other. We did not see such things from Godzilla in King Kong and the like. It always sounds great on paper when you are in the mix of good things that you have an inspired idea and you see the whole game in front of you like Beethoven's symphony. Then you get to the writing. Great ideas like all the vampires are women. Ergo is hot, seductively deadly, but in a way I want to disappear. And all zombies are people. So this is what men like a woman immediately after being rejected or deceived? So everything looks good to creation. Then the rot begins to go. Mosters fight. Nothing's happening. Another fight. Philosophical noodles and cod. We found Eureka how to win. Again a great fight and the end. Sounds great, is not it? If an indie company was made, it would be great. But this is Hollywood with eye to money: glow, not what fans want. All this could have been well drained.
