I give five out of ten. All five brands are for Hendrik who delivers a very decent set of materials from their second day. Unfortunately, the quality of work and editing of the camera is on the verge of horror! We have countless Hendrik's full-face shots where he could almost do anything, maybe to pee? We do not see his hand on the guitar. We also got a lot of Hendrix footage from the back? There appear to be three cameras on Hendrik, but all of them are crazy amateurs. A man in front of Hendrik seems to have rocked his lens with his focus on the stage as if Hendrik's guitar was a mere distraction. While the guy behind him is sharper to zero on several chickens in the stands, he actually documents the incredible work of the guitar that bleeds from the amplifier (sound recording is good thanks to Valli Heider). Vietnam, etc. On tapes such as Machine Gun, the complete loss of the movie! If Hendricks has lived for another two years, Berkeley is one of those things that would never see the light of day as far as the full official edition is concerned. One gem that contains is incredible Johnny B Good, but everything in a pretty bad visual document of a great man and inferior and Voodstock and the Isle of Vight.
