This is the most important movie I've ever seen. "Rekuiem for a Dream" looks like a Disney movie. Although it is technically rational, acting, cinema, music, direction, etc. They're good. However, the final scene of the gang rape is the most horrifying and hurting thing I've ever seen and I really want to see it. I'm afraid he'll persecute me for the rest of his life. Although I think anyone would think that the film was extremely disturbing, my wife and some of her friends were victims in a very similar way and I really did not need an explicit reminder of the horrors they experienced. I saw a movie at the SKSSV film festival in Austin, TKS and none of the actors or crew was present. I wish they had the opportunity to defend the violence in the film, which I thought was excessive, free and unnecessary. The earlier scene successfully transmitted the mood for which they obviously fought, but without rubbing faces in extreme and explicit sexual violence. This film should have a large WARNING tag. For these reasons, I would not recommend anyone to see him. You are warned.
