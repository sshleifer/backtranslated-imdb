There is a lot of obvious connection with this movie. We face, however, the main reasons why anyone would watch it for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. I'm not saying that they are not good actors, I say they were shot in this movie. Special effects were decent (and I will say that the filmmakers have done a good job making the boat attractive), but IT even has several major defects. For example, before the ship falls, you can see an unfinished blue screen image behind your main characters. find this film an insult to this story. The editing was horrible - there is no reason for any film to be longer than 2 1/2 hours (except for the MAIBE biographical film), and the writing and script were terribly stubborn. that music may be better than I could have predicted (and not just the song "My Heart Will Go"). There is one scene that stands out when the boat sinks and bass music is heard. It could be the peak of the film. As for the mood, it was extremely boring. I was much easier than sad when Jack died, which I know can not be what the director imagined. hip-chick flick.
