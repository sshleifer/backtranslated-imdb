this movie is not good. The former was almost sucked, but he had an unrealistic ending to be worth watching. This is nothing that has no fear, zero tension or suspense.this is not really a horror movie. do not show anything. There is nothing worse about talking about it. This could be almost a TV, except a little nudity and a little violence. acting is not very good. dialogue.as for the end of the surprise, surprise, there is no one. And I suppose it could have been worse, although I do not see how it is. but again, it's less than 80 minutes, so I guess it's good though it felt much longer. Obviously this is a cropped version of the movie. I found it for a very cheap price, but it's still not worth it. If you want an uncut graphic version, check the Anchor Bai release, however, this version of Sleepavai Camp II: Unhappi Campers gets a massive 1/10 of me. if you're watching this movie, you'll probably be a boring and unhappy camper. If you are a true fan, you may want to pick up Anchor Bai's Sleepavai Camp (with a survival kit) three disc collections that contain the first three films of uncut special features
