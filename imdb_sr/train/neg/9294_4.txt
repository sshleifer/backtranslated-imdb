As someone who was stunned by the incredible visual representations of "Hero", I was impatient to see this film that was written as if it were on the same line, but better. She was also an actress I love: Ziii Zhang. Well, I was disappointed at both points. I bought the DVD of this film invisible, and that was a mistake. It was not better. I realized that these films about martial arts were pure fantasy, but this story has been extended so far from everything that seems to be convincing, it only shook my head in a disappointing disbelief. A blind woman wins hundreds of opponents? Sorry, that's a bit far away. Also, the main male character "Jin" (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so boring with his dialogue, stupid expression of his face and stupid laughter, that he even ruined the film. In spite of beautiful colors and incredible action scenes, this story - to me - did not have the appeal to be a film worthy of possession.
