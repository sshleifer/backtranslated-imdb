Cave people were by far the greatest burden of shit I've ever lost watching. This show based on Geico commercials is less fun than the current 30-second ad for Geico. The makeup was at least half-exhausted, it's hard to imagine a caveman with prefect white teeth even after going to the dentist. This show could have the potential for a funny series if they could get a cast from advertising, which makes it a bad idea in itself. Maybe if the writers were the same from Geic's ads, this might have had a chance, instead of giving the pilot a good story. I give this show 1 out of 10, I would like to put a zero of 10, but it was not an option. I pray for the quick death of this show, I would give her less than 5 episodes before the death of death.
