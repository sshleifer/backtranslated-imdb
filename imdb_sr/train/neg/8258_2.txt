I was lucky to read the book before I saw the movie. It was an epic adolescent dream, a dream of missing flights, a great potential indie movie or a big budget drama. Somehow it came into the hands of hack, who obviously kept notes watching Boogie Nights and Rushmore without learning anything at all. The script loses meat from the book for the benefit of forced emotional notes and dull eyebrows. I'm sorry for the actors, because the characters in the book were rich and textured, but they reduced to the disadvantageous features in the film. Mason Gamble is great when he gets a chance, as well as Dylan Baker, but the skeleton that the rest of the story plays as bad after school. Poor people = GOOD, Rich people = BAD. Although it's almost worth a look at the South California beach, where Gary Sinise parks his trailer that should go to the Gulf of Delaware. It's a good book, but an unfortunate twist for the first time director Mills Goodloe. K. K.
