Firstly, I must admit that both films I saw from this director saw without title and so maybe missed points. My Czech is not bad, but after I spent two of his films, I would have liked that I did not even try to learn. The Samothari is too cool. Too cool. It's about ten different stories that weaving and exiting together. It is not so deeply unusual in the Prague-size city (tiny, really.) The main characters are between 20 and 30. They have a job and only one study. The best character is a young Balkan girl. Her feelings echoed the immigrants here every bloody day. That's it. The only big character. Everybody else does their own lives. How can I sympathize with such obvious incompetence? There may be interesting parts with Japanese tourists, but do I need another stereotype in the movie? If you love good music, check out this movie. If you want to laugh at the nonsense of others, take a look at this movie. If you like irony and dry humor, look at the original Jarmusch is not an imitation. And under any circumstances, look at Ondricek's movie, Septe (Shapat). This is unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes.
