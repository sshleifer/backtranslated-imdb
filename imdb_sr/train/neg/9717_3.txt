Pretty obvious thriller in numbers, in which it turns out that the only possible craft is hiding for nothing. I was looking primarily for an English language performance, Isabelle Huppert. It was not great, but then it was a strange role. I would not be surprised if it turned out that half of her contribution was left on the floor of the separa with a few last-minute corrections. . Steve Gutenburg seems to be trying to fulfill his role with the charm everyone has told him to have. There is a sensational stupid sequence suggesting that his sexual power will be able to help in the treatment of PTSD. It's an insatiable performance. Elizabeth McGovern is more attracted to true charm and character, but she is a little consoled. 3/10
