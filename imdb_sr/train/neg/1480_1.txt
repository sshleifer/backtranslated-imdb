He pulled the guys out of his ass! Is that a real gift ?! Nobody really writes that it just happens as improvisations have become terribly wrong. I mean in any way. This film must be fake, because someone would say that they wrote this scenario otherwise. Can anyone imagine that the whole actor sits around while the director and writers cross over the screen of the script. The director says: "Our next inbreed criminal uses his 24-inch mache to dig up our reindeer. He will remove the hose from his bunghole" Brilliant! "whole head proclaims. No way to make this happen, nobody writes so stupid! I have to be fake. I like the part where a skinny introspective girl strikes an inbreed freak to death with a fade of iron located on the floor of the cave. I was not sure that the types of inbreed cannibalis tried to cook a lot. Perhaps this explains why the pan was lying on the floor in the dark at the right time to kill a defective hull. It seems ironic that after a strange guy defeated pornography experts and a couple of door types, he so easily descends on a slimy, thin, helpless girlfriend from the neighborhood. What is Richard Greco doing in this? Did he fire his agent or something? Can anybody explain me the ending, because I did not get it? I can not figure out why a nice girl wanted to kill a funny lady who made her tea. It does not matter, I do not want to know.
