We should not be confused with the above-average supernatural thriller "Sentinel". Sentinel was a great boring movie for me, not delivering a consistent action, promised a few critics on the back. It seemed to me like everyone was attacking him, and only there to earn quick cash, as it seemed to be made for a TV movie. Sentinel is a rehash of some of the better movies, such as "In The Line Of Fire", it has no originality in it, and watching Michael Douglas running around, felt somehow stupid in my opinion. The main problem, in addition to being non-original, had to be a bad rhythm. I was often distracted while trying to watch this movie, while I watched how much time to do was left over, more than once. Not just miskaing with Eva Longoria, who could not believe she was worth licking. Performances. Michael Douglas is usually a reliable actor, obviously going through movements here. He does not assure himself as a man on the run, nor as a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger was also turned off. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here's just OK, nothing more than that. He tries to find himself as rude, but he has managed to be bland than anything else, and to be honest, he did not seem so interested. Eva Longoria Parker is pretty central. She does not believe in her role, and she was pure sweets. Kim Basinger is pretty scary as the first lady. Tears look bored, and her role is rejection, more than anything else. Martin Donovan plays a big part in the end, but it's not enough for me. Lower line. Sentinel is another political thriller that bored my tears. It's too old, too tired, and most importantly, lack of effort is sucked. Not recommended. 4/10
