Really bad. Why someone thinks this is a good movie, let alone ridiculous, is a mystery. I like comedy as the next man and I love the "Christmas story". The fact that he has the same director and is based on the memoirs of the same writer, completely confuses me why this film is completely unsuccessful at every level. Charles Grodin began to hide like a father initially. For the other it seems that there is no same pacing - it simply does not run well. Everything seems tired and forcing. The joy of life that permeated the first movie is completely absent - you just want the film to end. I would not even recommend this movie for the seekers of curiosity who enjoyed the "Christmas Story". It's so bad. 1/10.
