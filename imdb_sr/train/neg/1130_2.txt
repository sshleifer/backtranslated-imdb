There is a certain eccentricity between the characters and in dialogue and situations, but the kind that is bad for the film, causing it often seems absurd. as a semi-retarded person, so there is no choice but to watch a movie as a retarded girl doing it in the theater world - which was obviously not the intention. Early we were told (in this story about Barry Lindon) that she learned to hide her emotions, which certainly explains her autistic stone face, but the film suffers from it. She's essentially walking like a zombie, and her success as actresses is not quite credible due to lack of emotion. Occasionally, the film had that boring, sleepy feeling of Dogma 95. Is that one? I would not be surprised at all. Summer Phoenik is the sister of Joakuima Phoenik and the late Phoenik River. Nepotism rarely works.
