You're not sure if I mean those who called it a video or a director ... "Devil Hunter" is certainly a bizarre "horror" movie. The plot is a loose goose combination of top-quality movies such as "Cannibal Feroc" and "Cut and Run". Chick was abducted in the 'jungle' of the 'tribe' of the savage. The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies who walk on the costume of the edition of tribal clothing. And savages move from white to Asian to black to Hispanic. I suppose Franco just caught everyone who looked even a little ethnically for this mess. To make things worse, this film has an ultra-minimal up, there are no real fears and much unnecessary penis. It's not fun. I can find something I love in any weak Italian or Euro-trash movie; this one just fell short. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10, kids.
