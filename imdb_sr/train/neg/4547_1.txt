The film was TERRIBLE !!! The easiest movie I've seen in the past few years. One of those films that I will be able to tell people for the next three years is that it's the worst movie I can think of. Thank you for giving me the answer to this burning question: "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" Answer: Celestine Prophets. Believe me ... I read the book, enjoyed the message, and I was excited to watch the movie, but then, they treated the audience like ourselves. There is no story, and the story here is muted with too much magic and coincidence. It is a shame that they have to bring up nine prophecies and can not simply translate them into a funny story. They did not spend time developing characters and it was easy to not worry if a character died. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who kept up the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is too boring, but I enjoyed parallels that can be seen in everyday life while reading a book. The film does not offer the same opportunity, and I suggest you do not watch it if you want to continue to keep the words of the book close to the heart. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. Trust me.
