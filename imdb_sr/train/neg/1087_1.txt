This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. While showing good actors, the film does not meet expectations. The most dramatic thing in this movie is music, which largely sums up the film: it compensates for the bad and confusing story by having well-known actors, loud and dramatic music. It does not change the fact that this is a very boring movie for watching. I earned a score of 1.
