First Pover (1990) was a horrible movie that came out in the late 80s / early 90s of cheap horror films. I thought this film was very boring, but in some parts extremely hilarious. This film does not have so much sense and credibility that it is not even funny. The fast-track justice system in this film makes Texas weak in comparison. Lou Diamond Phillips is on his way over the head with this role (he's playing a stubborn cop), and Tracei Griffith (Melanie's more attractive sister) plays psychically. Do not waste time with this because it's bad. What minute, I take it back. This movie is a big part movie. Check out the nun, who has the most beautiful legs I've ever seen on the Nun, which was not in the classic movie Jesus Franco. Ieov! This marked the end of the era for L.D.P. His star was darkened and could not draw flybins. It was D.T.V. for him until his "resuscitation" a few years later. It is not recommended unless you are desperate.
