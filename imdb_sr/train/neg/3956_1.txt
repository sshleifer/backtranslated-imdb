in essence, it's basically the same movie. And they could not get the exact time line of the event. But that was intentional because of laziness or negligence, whatever it was, this thing is a real voofer.it does not even deserve it. to be called a movie.

You should come with a warning label such as: Warning - it can cause your icon to give up several points if you are near it. For me, there is no doubt that this thing is 0/10
