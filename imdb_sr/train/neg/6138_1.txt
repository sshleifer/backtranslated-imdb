This film was horrible, from conception to execution. The United States must establish the Star Vars site in this remote country? That's their premise? The way to get access, the US concludes, is to win a course like a race on the ski track, where the winner can ask for anything from the leader. And who better to win in this race known as the "Game" than the gym? Of course! A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission. And do not forget his father was an operative. Fortunately for our hero, there is also gymnastic equipment in happy places, like a horse's stone in the middle of the square (no reason) in the middle of a crazy city. Perfect. But above and beyond the horrible, HORIBLE premise, is the unpleasant shifting of romantic scenes, apparently very depressing ninjas whose only job seems to be holding the flag to point to a race, and the worst climax ever. After winning the race, our hero highlights the wishes of the US government. And, look, all the efforts have paid off, because the US gets the site "Star Wars"! Huzzah! THIS IS YOUR TRIUMPHANT ENDING?! Wow. But still, if you are such a bad movie, it can be fun to watch. Only the cover, which shows the ninja with the machine guns, was enough to make me rent this movie. But if I ever met Kurt Thomas (gymnasts) in real life, I would probably hit him in the face after a double overturn with 2 1/2 rings in schedule.
