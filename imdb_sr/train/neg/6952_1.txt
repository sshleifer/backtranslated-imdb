The most terrible story about a big series. It should not be called Battlestar Galactica, because it's just a name. Too many changes to just change. You have characters turned from male to female, black to Asian to Cylon, all in a way to "attract a female audience," when there were already strong female characters who could only be stronger. Egyptian sentiments disappeared. They went searching for the land. The disadvantage of the cylinders for the withdrawal from the terminator is rejected by the film, especially when the fembot is made. That the original show had a lot of cheese for her, but she had a great escort. They tried to hold on to this next, but they give the fans nothing they are facing and who basically spit on their face as they do it "with their story." Changes are good when they make something better, not just to make them.
