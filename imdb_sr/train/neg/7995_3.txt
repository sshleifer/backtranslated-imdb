I remember watching this movie when I was young, but I could not remember the title that he wrote then, and then I went through horror films that I found and thought "that's the title?" This film is a kind of combined film about a catastrophic film / an insect attack with less significant stars in it. It's also a bit boring, because it has that television vibration in which you can watch a movie that fades for commercials and the like. This plot is attacked by ants. I think they were a little upset about the construction or something that was going on nearby, but do not quote me. The most striking ants attack for me in the whole movie was the first one involving a kid who fell into the pool after being overwhelmed and, of course, Samers' attack scene. What is still peculiar in this case is a very stupid ending in which survivors use tubes from cardboard to breath. In the end, however, like most of the television films, this film is very loud and is not scary, unless the ants obey.
