I'm really shy - I rarely watch the movie and in the end I'm disappointed. I've seen a lot of adaptations of Ira Levin - 'Rosemari's Babi' and 'Stepford Vives' - and they both liked it, but I did not like it. When I read the plot, the award-winning drama writer (Michael Caine) decided to kill one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) and make his own scenario for his success - I was excited. I love the thrillers, Michael Caine is a good actor, Sidney Lumet is a good director and the work of Ira Levin is generally good. I will not spoil it for anyone who has not seen it yet, but all I would say is that there is a turning load. It's so difficult for them to explain a detailed movie action without giving it. I enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes before the contours started and reversed, and then my interest and enjoyment began to be lost. Although I have to give Lume a merit for a very fun ending that made me laugh out loud. The main actors - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dian Cannon and Irene Vorth - were great in their roles. Although Vorthov's apparent false Russian accent slowly began to annoy me (nothing personal to Irene, I think that every acting accent would irritate me). I'm not sure whether Cannon's character should have been troublingly funny, but Dian managed to upset and entertain - at the same time. Anyone who has read this - I do not want you to be ready to watch this because of my views - give him a chance, you might like, maybe not. Everything is in the mind.
