It is obvious that all good reviews have been published for this film so far from insiders who were either involved in a movie or who know someone who knows someone and thus see multiple cuts. Well, I do not know anyone who is involved, and I've seen the final cut, and that's clean garbage. The only thing for her is the ambition and the multiple traps of the horror legend (none on the screen for a terrible long time). It's as if the filmmakers made this weekend movie during a horror concert and listed actors such as Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berriman to record scenes during a coffee break. This is ultra-cheap, shot on a video with Ks files with a horrific acting actor non-actor with more shoes than is acceptable in the 21st century. There is little or no action; it's all overly explaining a dialogue that attempts to explain a meaninglessly complex plot. Computer FKS is a joke, but there is not enough, nor is it enough to make this film pleasant in MST3K mode. After about eight real scenes, except for a story, you will find yourself coming to a quick button ... and you do not play. Absolutely worthless.
