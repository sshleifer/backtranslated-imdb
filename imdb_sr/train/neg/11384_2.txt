From the time that Europe began to fight World War II, by the end of the war, Hollywood (with significant incitement to the government) made many films designed to try to instruct young men to join the army, making life a soldier looks "cool" . This is by far the bravest, implicating that the life of soldiers is devoid of work, to get the best food, and you can lie around all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio. I am too young to have participated in World War II, but I think it was more than that. There is a Brac's feline plot, and a bunch of musical numbers that show some of the leading action of the day. I think that until 1943, even the most naive of the civilians knew that there were many more overseas than the whimsical hijinks shown in this film. Although I am sure that this should have been viewed as an escapist party, I can not help but wonder if the family and loved men of men fighting in the war entertained or refused this triviality of sacrifice of their loved ones.
