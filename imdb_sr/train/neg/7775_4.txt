I'm not familiar with the trilogy, but last night I came to this film on Shovtime. The film looked very good with scenography and cinema, but the script was stiff and woody. The act was pretty bad - they thought that the two women's tracks were helpful. You never really believed what the auxiliary actors said. There were stereotypes - a biblical Reverend without a hint of nuances, an authoritative captain, a hot soldier, etc. I'm sorry I have to say that on the basis of these shortcomings I immediately entered the Canadian, not knowing that this is so. Telefilm Canada has granted loans. I know I'm a terrible person. Perhaps I missed something in the beginning, but hostility towards girls is never explained. Here they are surrounded by a stronghold of the invertebrate, and men lose time and energy by brutalizing two young women for no reason. FOCUS people. There is something more than a difficult situation outside of your walls, but whether or not these lesbian girls - it's just my conclusion about hostility directed towards them. If they can target and shoot from a gun, you may well agree with them. The question of their "immortal soul" can be solved later. Also, I suppose this applies to the rest of the trilogy, and girls should be the protagonists? One of them killed the Indians in the end who saved their life. I suppose she is just one of the victims of her condition that can not necessarily be blamed for her actions, but the other is only a killer who does not deserve her happy ending.
