What can I say? I'm a secret fan of action movies and horror films. Especially when it comes to a lot of humor and allusion, but I'm not a fan of Snake on a plane. There are three potential attractiveness of this movie: ?? Comedy of the situation; ?? Horor; i ?? A novelty of hundreds of snakes on the plane. First, this film is not written as horror in speech or comedy, and in the movie it has only 1 or 2 points in which you will smile. If you want to feel a movie, the trailer really is a movie, horror. Second, if you expect a movie full of action and shock, you will not be disappointed. It does not stand out from other movies, but always keeps your attention. Third, although the novelty Snakes of a Plane does not worsen, but you will leave the cinematographic thinking. what was all this noise. "I know this film has a high score, but it does not add up. A) Many reviews that were written before the film was published, and B) The classification of user ratings is much less variation than normal 77% of people who rate the movie 10/10, and only 7% of people give 9 10 - Why such a big gap?
