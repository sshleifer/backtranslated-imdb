The scenario is so ridiculous ... which in turn makes the acting lines sound cruel and unreal, and not be believed. There is a repeating of the phrase - "my sweet divine daughter" and fewer variations of that line that comes to mind ... and it's just a gruesome soap operand. Even worse, the music is so bad. ! Plus, the main blues "theme" is terribly weird and totally wrong for this. And it feels overwhelming mainly because the instrumentation, texture and layout of this subject never changes, even when the emotional context of the scene does. After that, whenever it appears, it rises as a sick thumb, moving from one scene to another. The music is running out, and as if the writer wrote the soap or sitcom music - a low-budget Canadian sitcom of the 80's - and it makes me feel like we're always on the verge of throwing on the commercial. This is so wrong thinking, there are many exaggerations and it's really stretching so that many of these characters use only one type of New York accent - a thick Bronx accent. I do not know whether this is a limited capacity for actors only in the knowledge of one * NI accent - or it is about the director's ability to notice such an obvious anomaly. End, it's an amateur script with its lead lines, which makes this whole "movie" ... blow. When any medium is trembling and unstable, it is impossible to build on it without its defects being revealed in exponentially more detrimental and unpleasant ways.
