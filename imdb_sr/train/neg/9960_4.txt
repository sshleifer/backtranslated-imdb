MY BROTHER TOM Image Ratio: 1.85: 1 Sound Format: Dolby Digital After the episode of sexual abuse in the hands of a trusted neighbor, a young Jessica (Jenna Harrison) forms a relationship with a strange boy (Ben Vhishav) who encounters a forest. Unfortunately, the Vhishav has its secrets, nothing less disturbing and far more dangerous ... Stubborn drama, inspired by the courageous performances of Harrison and Vhishava, in which two related spirit enters the mutual love of nature after being traumatized by their experiences in the 'real world'. Unfortunately, their friendship is flaring as a crude reality that begins to impose itself, leading to an inevitable tragedy. He directed Dom Rotheroe and photographed in a digital video format, and the film looked torn in places (too much unpleasant close-ups and rugged movements in his hand) and it takes some time to find his legs, but the dramatic payback quietly rewards.
