Is this movie stupid? Yup. Is this film depth? Nope. Personality development? Nope. Plot tvists? Nope. This was just a film about the very fiction Springer. This shows how many people will go to get their cups on TV. Molly Hagan did a great job with the mother Jaime Pressley. Jaime is .... well ... GORGEOUS! This movie is not so much made to be a "breakthrough" movie, it was intended for life in a park trailer (I live in a park trailer and it's nothing like the one in this movie) where everyone is sleeping with everyone. Otherwise, all the girls get pregnant from different guys, and All the guys drive captured '66 Ford's peaks (exaggeration, of course, but that's the picture everyone sees when you mention a "trailer"). Some people over-analyze films (Case-to-Point: Star Trek). I'm watching movies exclusively for fun; not to emphasize that the girl wears a different shirt in a different scene (read "Goofs" a bit about Connie's shirt.) Could it have been better? Of course. But it was funny as in hell.
