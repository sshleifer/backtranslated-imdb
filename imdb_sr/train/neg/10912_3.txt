I really did not like this movie. It was not so funny and in some cases it was just stupid. Rob Schneider was definitely one of the incredibly talented individuals and while his acting was good in it, it seemed like a real waste for him to act. I mean, there were some parts that were fine and a little funny in the sweet way, but that's about it. The only thing that caught my attention throughout this temptation of jokes was that there were some very handsome females, and I can not watch the movie solely because of it, but in this case it was the only corner. where even the smallest case of redemption could be found. All in all, it was a few inches below the average film! The Final Query: Theaters: I'm so glad I did not spend too much money on this. > Buy DVD: Ummm, let me think .... no! Renting: If you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not.
