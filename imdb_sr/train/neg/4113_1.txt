I have to finish watching the movie when I start, no matter how bad it is. This film was tortured. The "sparkling" bullets, the reporter with "ninjas" such as moves, the way that bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and seem to have hit innocent passers-by, a predictable outcome and all bad acting was terrible. Like a girl who finds a reporter in her friend's apartment and goes from "what the hell are you doing here (holding a bat)" to "hey, you're cute, will you @ # $%!!" in just 1.2 seconds .... Only bad .... Save yourself for an hour and forty minutes and go play with your children (or dog)!
