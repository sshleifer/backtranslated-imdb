OK, how this is for the original - this evil, the rich old girl leaves her property to her adult children, all those ungrateful losers, and two angry servant, provided they spend a week in his old house. What happened that night will surprise only those who have not seen a movie or a TV show before. After a series of killings in which victims look like a bleeding restaurant ketchup, we have a painfully obvious bandage. The acting role of the water was once prominent actors who desperately sought their salaries. There are also several second-rate actors who were raising at that time, but now they forgot. As a result, the film generates all the drama and mystery of the "Matlock" episode. I will credit where it is because - the final scene is smart and fun, if you are still awake.
