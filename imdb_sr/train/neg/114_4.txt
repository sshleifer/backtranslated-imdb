It's not an actor. Finn group of actors, you can not find. It's not an item. The director is in love with New York City, and to the end of the film, so are we all! Woody Alen could not improve what Bogdonovich did here. If you fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the right place. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is not one. Actors fall in love at first glance, words are unnecessary. According to Hollywood's own experience, this is what happens when they go to work. It's a reality for him and his peers, but it's a fantasy for most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the film is hollow, shallow and messy.
