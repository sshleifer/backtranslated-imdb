This film was serious. The act was the worst! It was worse than a student film. Super cheese, and I think the worst actor was an old lady. First I thought, it's an old movie. Then I remembered that this was no excuse! I've seen older movies that play better and more. The music was terrible. It was really excited. The editing was bad (most of the dialogs were not synced.) All in all, this movie does not deserve either 1. I watched it just because it was boring and the movie is barely entertaining me. It was just funny. My dead grandmother's left sleeve could make a better movie than this.
