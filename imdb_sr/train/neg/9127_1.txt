Okay, here's the basic plot. It was in 1933, Peter Sellers was Dr. Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese who lived for quite a long time. The film begins with its birthday celebration by drinking a special elixir that (even the film never mentions) extends his life. Well, on this occasion, the elixir is clumsily knocked down by an assistant (Kato, if you remember Pink Panther movies) and he orders his servants to find six rare items to make an elixir. This creates a global hunt for men in which his adversaries end up looting the diamond museum and entering London to meet with Dr. Fuis by a reckless, retired detective, Scotland Iard, Nailando Smith, played by vendors who try to stop him from being a witty comedy adventure. It was obvious that the Seller was the last feature film that he made before his death. The terrible tragedy is that he was in it. Sellers who are so gifted comedians who had unforgettable "funny" roles in Panther's films, especially in the movie "The Party", are still in the film. This film was an absolute torture to pass and I could not even finish it. He died completely and I stayed as I watched the Seller's performance. After the great work 'Being There' arrived a year earlier, how, how can this and how this thing was made? As one person mentioned the first 10-15 minutes are ok, but then it's ALL DOVNHILL ... Avoid As Plague. Rating 1 out of 10.
