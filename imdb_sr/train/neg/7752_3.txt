The film speaks of the loss of fun in an amusement park in which teens deal with garbage. Since there are no rules, they break into the building and start killing themselves. Deaths are stupid and stupid. But at least he had better effects than sabretooth. I gave her three because Stacy was in it and I liked the Sabretooth movie. I thought it was okay, but some deaths were out of the screen. There was a stupid scene in which two teenagers kissed, and the head of the saber came out, and the boy leaves his girlfriend behind him, leaving her completely fake to look red. Then the sabotage rises into the ventilation holes and bites the children. The ultimate death with the owner was completely fake graphics. Even that death was stupid because his teeth sculpted through his mouth and hung there as if they would support it, and there is a scene when a goth girl loses contact and does not find them, and she does not seem to need it. The film is idiotic and waste of time.
