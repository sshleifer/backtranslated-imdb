Massage feeding is just one of the recent central zombie movies that are after your hard-earned dollars. Suggestion? Keep your hard-earned dollars and let's just say that the good old TheaterKs took one for the team on this one. Guess what it's all about? Zombies download. This time, however, for the sake of originality (?) This film takes place on Rhode Island, and to be honest, I'm not sure I've ever seen a zombie movie on Rhode Island. The TV station, controlled by the government, allegedly maintains "normal" broadcasts, so that all remaining citizens will not think there is any problem in the world, that is, those who never look or go out anyway. I will say, however, that several commercials broadcasting this station are probably the most fun part of this movie. There is actually a story for this, but I do not bother with it, because after a while you will either not care or you have fallen asleep. In any case, this has a lot of terrible acting to make up for all the things that are "seen before" that appear in front of the camera. Believe me, you can find many other things that can be done with your time than watching this. 3 of 10
