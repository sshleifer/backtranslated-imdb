I decided to watch this series after I saw endless commercials for him on the BBC in the weeks before the start. I watched him despite the fact that I do not like the pretentious thing Alan Hollinghurst writes (sorry for his fans, but I think we have a case of new imperial clothes with the work of this author). I admit that the performance is excellent, that it was beautifully recorded and that it was reasonably entertaining - however, I discovered that the story is extremely thin and that after watching the three episodes they look very unhappy with this rather empty production. The "explicit" gay sex that the media he was talking about has already worked on TV on several occasions - so I'm afraid there was nothing shocking. Full estimates for production values, but low for story / content.
