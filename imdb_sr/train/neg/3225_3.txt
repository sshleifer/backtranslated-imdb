Children love dinosaurs. That's a bit of their culture. But they have the Earth ahead of time. Original. At least that movie had a heart. This. This film is simply pathetic. Just because kids love dinosaurs does not mean you can just slap any old story and show them to the kids. This film has no complication, the whole premise is stupid, and it's more in numbers. Not like sucking the soul like Theodore Riv, but it's far from being a land before time.
