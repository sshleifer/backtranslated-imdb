Class is a comedy that shows a bunch of 27-year-old former classmates. I like the idea of ​​the show. So I'm sorry the Class is not funny, although it has obvious potential. It's not funny enough, just stupid. (Haha.) It's because of the slow pace and lack of really hilarious lines. Also, some actors have difficulties with timing. Most of the inventive characters are the twins Kat and Lina Varbler (Lizzi Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh), but even they look just a little exaggerated for the good of the show. On the other hand, the characters I find unattractive are the main hero of Ethan and the old Duncan and Nicole. What troubles me with the series is that the only Latin figure of Aaron was chosen for his accent (though not-reputable, but anyway).
