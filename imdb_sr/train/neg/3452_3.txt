I decided to watch a movie at a recent film festival in Dubai because it was chosen for prestigious competition in Cannes. I was surprised that Cannes could have been so impressive in evaluating quality. Film, some critics, noticed that there are not too many shootings - but the inherent violence is disgusting. Imagine killing your enemy / contestant in front of your son .. or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. There are some indications of contrasting Corleone's sons in Copolla's "Kum" that appear to appear here in this Chinese / Hong Kong film, but the quality of the two of them is so different from chalk and cheese. The movie is only recommended for addicts about violence. There is no great cinema here. At best, it can be considered to be better than the usual Run Run Shav production for production values.
