This film has several key shortcomings. The first and most important of them is a clear lack of good plots! This unfortunately makes the movie not only difficult to watch, it also sends the observer some feelings of hopelessness, as if spending the precious time of his short life. This means that the movie can not capture its audience, but encourages the audience to ignore the movie and everything related to it! In short, it is very very very very very bad! Do yourself a favor and cook a big rubber shoe, you will find it more interesting and pleasant than watching a Terminator woman.
