This is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I am a lover of horror films and I'll rent any horror movie if it's not made for the so-called. When I look in the box says it's rated R for the up and a tongue ... Where was the blood? Was there a good scene of death in which you actually saw the blood? I could have overlooked that there was some short nudity or some good dialogue. There was not even a witty or fun line in this movie. Sometimes horror films are great because they are so stupid, but this was just sad.
