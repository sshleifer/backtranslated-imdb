Wider Eplbi is the easiest little embodiment of evil that turned a good girl who hits Buffy, Elle. But I am in front of you, you see that Lilith was the first woman God made as a companion to Adam. But she got all the striking evil feminists and God drove them from Eden. The secret order known as The Fath is catching, but it does not kill, so now with amnesia (which is not really well explained), Lilith (now Elle) is free to become the Buffy clone that has to fight with crazy insanity. a scientist who received Lilith's blood injection. If the previous paragraph sounds terribly intricate, that's because it is. The film is also boring, generic, and for a film with complication in theology it seems that it does not know licking about it. This movie about the cheap basement was a failed pilot series. All I can say is that he did not pick up the echo of Amen. My Rating: D- DVDs: Comment by writer / director Bila Platt and co-writer Chris Regina; and the Stills Gallery; video effects: before and after (also has a "available" selection that would THINK lead to some trailers, but not on DVD covers for other movies, which is a stupid idea) DVD-ROM Accessories: Final script and transcript of deleted scenes in PDF format
