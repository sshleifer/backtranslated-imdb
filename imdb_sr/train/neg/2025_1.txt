My wife and I are having fun before Hovie Mandel's shoe. And I love Shatner - even when he's stupid ... But this is absolutely the worst broadcast on television. Please cancel this show. It's bullshit **. The only positive thing that I can say is that the girls are warmer on this show and seem to wear less clothing than Deal or No Deal ... Questions are a mix of ways that are too light and incredibly vague. And watch Shatner or competitors say "Show me money" makes me want to vomit .. This will not last.
