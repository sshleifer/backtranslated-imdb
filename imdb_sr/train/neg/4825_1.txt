Judging by the hyper, and other reviews on this site, I was ready for a terrible horror film that focused on drug addicts. What I got was a complete shit focusing on drug addicts. I wonder if there is another movie called "Cookies" that these people reviewed? There are only 3 main characters, and none of them hit me as well-written or well-played. Mostly the whole movie I spent shaking my head and I admire the stupidity of these addicts. Do yourself a favor. Do not rent this movie. Rent "Cabin Fever" or another decent horror movie. Hell, rent "Mari Poppins"! Animated penguins are more terrifying and more convincing than anything you'll find in the "Cookers".
