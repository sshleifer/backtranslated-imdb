I was so disgusted with this film, I felt obliged to warn others. This film does not have a story, a plot or a hint of purpose. The film begins after the standard introduction of the film "Let It Be Scary", which until now every observer of the film has become accustomed to. So we can completely ignore the beginning. We will soon be introduced to the main actress and from this moment it becomes clear to everyone that you just lost your hard-earned and you'd better be watching the statics. (Unless you see the white noise - EEK) The act is DISGRACE and everyone should return to the traveling pantomime from where they came from. By saying this, even the best actors in the world would fight to watch this movie remotely. Their bad performances only contribute to disaster. The meaningless violence and what I can only suppose is a written word of another junked "eccentric" writer, who is probably thought to be an artist, resulting in a film that will test your patience. Only when my colleague turned to me and said: "We watched this for 45 minutes." I realized that this film is slim and uncomfortable like a cup of tea without a tea bag. It is clear that something is missing and unfortunately it was not an audience. Instead of proposing what the movie lacks, let me tell you what it has: Stupid blonde (surprise surprise), Victims, a thing with a bad monster, about 2 minutes of a story that extends over hours, days, weeks, months ... and loans. Want a silver coating? Well, the blonde is a little stupid watching some of the scenes, but I expect she wants her face to be broken for the rest of the movie!
