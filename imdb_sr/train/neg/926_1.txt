This film is about Tiran, a gladiator who was returned from the dead to invite Tiranus, a gladiator who must return from the dead. Tirannus, we learn after about an hour, is also called Demonicus. This adds the much needed depth to the scenario and challenges our assumptions about identity, psychology, and ourselves. The spirit of Tirannus accomplishes his small list of tasks (killing some people and pronouncing recurring phrases in Latin) by owning a body from a college student. He uses a magic helmet to control his mind to do it, which the college boy readily put on his head, and then in several places in the movie, flew and put it back. the Sean Villiana Scott poor, and Tirannus wears the Rollerball glove. Tirannus has his green backlight for no apparent reason, and apparently he was sitting next to the CG fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries. Great misfortune. This film is empty and will hurt you. Look at him.
