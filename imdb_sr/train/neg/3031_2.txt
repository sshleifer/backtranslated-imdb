Tony Scott is destroying everything that could be interesting in Richard Kellie's cliche, scenic, overwhelmed scenario. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightlei) was a model that gave up and became a bounty hunter. This is her story ... "in a way". The problem with this garbage is that there are not many stories at all, and Scott's extreme graphic stylization of every shut acts as a distancing mechanism. This makes us indifferent to everything Harvey is in chaotic life. Only you do not care about Harveia. Knightley is acting like a disgusting, cynical bartender who has done nothing to justify our respect. She hits people who do not like and throws her clothes and inhibitions when the situation requires it, but she is not realistic at all and Knightley is not even more convincing. The film is boring. And it's loud and chained to one of the most unpleasant musical sources I have heard for a long time. The last twenty minutes are the poor repeat of Scott's "True Romance" climax with Domino's band who will meet two sets of hostile bad guys who are - a surprise! surprise! - destined to record it at the top of the casino in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, this potentially exciting fire is completely unsuccessful by Scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious, senseless exercise in celluloid masturbation. This is not an artist's brave or experimental piece; it is a failure at every level because it does not give us an entry point in the lives and dilemmas of its characters. Mickey Roarke looks good as a spill head hunter, but he disappears in the background as "narration" is progressing. Chris Valken turns into another shameful cafe, and Dabnei Coleman, always solid, is underutilized. Do not be fooled by the multi-layered surface of this film. It's still shit, no matter how hard it is to polish.
