Maybe I'm not a critic, but here's what I think about this movie. I just watched a movie about cinema and, above all, I must say how much I hate the story, I mean, what the snowman is afraid of, besides small children, the other is pretty bloody, but I bet because the movie is so small they probably used a ketch so MY CRITICAL VOICE OF BOMB !! ! a nice try and continue to suck twice.
