I understand that the figure of Diehl is only the microcosm of America - to see Arab terrorists beneath each rock, only to finally discover that his own acts have led him to this state of siege all the time, and indeed if that good practice for all people will be all long and lollipops. I'm sorry that you made incredible movies in the past that remained neutral in politics and for good reason, the controversy is your weak point and weakening this well-made, incredibly recorded movie with absurd characters, dialogue and complication. Better luck on your next move. Another thing that pulled my lunch was the hardest point of homelessness in LA because of starvation, these people do not get enough to eat. Indeed, these people do not eat strictly, but the true hunger of this person is spiritual hunger, emotional hunger, mental hunger. They need self-esteem, self-esteem, dignity that you can not give to a man. Yes, these people are hungry and if they need it, it's available. A lesser hunger center in America, I would say it is more a center for alcoholism, drug abuse, mental suffering and economic devastation. Solving the problem of hunger, although a noble endeavor helps in a deeper systematic social and old human homelessness problem. Bill Diehl was good even though Michelle Villiams was sweet as a young but (clich√©) old soul.
