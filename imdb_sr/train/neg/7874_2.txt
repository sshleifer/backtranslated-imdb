In a way, Time Corridors are a success story because the film reaches its goal: to see it thousands. But it fails to make them laugh ... Les Visiteurs had their success, because the theme was the original way of thinking about traveling through time: forget about Zemeckis's Return to the Future, here's the old France, a medieval knight and his almost a barbaric way of life. Full of pride, funny thanks to the ancient words it uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting, but retains its honor. Then follows the continuation. No one foresaw the enormous success of Les Visiteurs, the first one. And it does not make sense to be a film expert to realize that time corridors are created for money. The general story begins after the completion of Les Visiteurs and immediately tries to justify the continuation of the time paradox that would be needed for another thought. Explanation: there is no point in trying to get back the jewelry Jackuouille stole; Do not you remember this beautiful red glossy and expensive car that he bought at the end of the first episode? Where do you think he found money? Selling jewelry ... And that's just one of many holes that Poire tries to avoid ... and fails. Let's look at the characters: Montmirail does not change, he's just a little more boring. As far as Frenegonde is concerned ... it's another story: Valerie Lemercier has decided not to compromise in this sequel to avoid being stuck in the bourgeois role. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so miserable that I almost felt the pain for her. And Poire does not realize that humor is not enough to make a good comedy. Forget about time travel, digital effects, concentrate on the story and you will see that there is enough space on the postage stamp to write it 10 times. The main interest of this film are the landscapes. Film for young people, say up to 13 years.
