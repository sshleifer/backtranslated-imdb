I actually saw China O'Brien II before I saw the original Chinese O'Brien. And I must say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: Worse = funnier! And funny = better. If you're a bad fan of a movie like me, this is great stuff. However, if you are looking for any meaningful action, acting ability or the skill of creating a movie, it is best to avoid it. The best part is how they recorded all the battle sequences in stuttering fast forward. Hilariousli bad. You see him for a laugh, you see him as meaningless fun, but whatever you do, watch him for free on TV.
