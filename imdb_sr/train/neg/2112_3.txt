White Lugosi plays a doctor who will do everything to make his wife young and beautiful. To that end, he binds the bride during the wedding to look like they are dead so that they can steal their bodies. I'm not quite sure what to do with the bodies. I do not remember that it has ever been fully explained. All I know is to pull something out of them and inject it into my wife. (I suppose it's spinal fluid. Spinal fluid was a bastard of crazy scientists for the forties.) The rest you can quite guess. There is a couple (well, really more than a couple, but I'll just write about the two problems I have with this movie.) One way in which White is used. Of course, he does a decent job in his own excessive behavior (BTV, the rest of the actors are simply horrifying). But to hide in the back of dead cars or to get into the bedroom of a female reporter to do nothing, he is just stupid. Also, why he beat him and / or he killed all the supporters he had? Would he make him look evil? Well, someone who takes a comic brides does not have to be made n that it looks more evil. Another problem I have is the idea of ​​drug bridging. Why brides? Would not there be any women under 20 years old? Seeing how White goes through these giractions to bring her victims, I recalled the idiotic Fisherman, I still know what you did last summer. In any case, there seems to be an easier way to achieve your goal of applying a seemingly impossible plan that depends on many things about circumstances beyond your control. (CTV, the alternate title for this film is the Case of Missing Brides. I suppose this partly explains the need for 'brides'.)
