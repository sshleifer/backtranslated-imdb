For a movie with so many promises, it was disappointing, thinly plotted and the acting moving from terrible and incredible. The final scene would have pulled my heart out, if the whole movie was not so painful. I was stiff! From the first scene - someone wondered if the nurse was trying to reach her twin for help, or she was simply scared to death that would be better for the audience and saved us from the two-hour worst acting. I've seen it so far. It was a horror in the true sense of the word.
