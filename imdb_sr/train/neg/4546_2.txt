I just watched this movie and did not read the book. The good thing about the movie is that in some places you think at times about the spiritual subject, evolution, synchrony and your role in the world. and there is very little relationship between the viewer and the characters. It is clear that the book loses much in this movie version. Events that were supposed to show the synchronism that is happening are almost unrecognizable. There is a lot of reasoning for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence, and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a bigger purpose. Enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create a better feeling than they should. Do you remember enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in Mali Buda)? Well, that's nothing like that. Most scenes are badly performed. There are many scenes that really do not develop a story and do not help creating an atmosphere. Save it. It seems that the first two got more scenes than their characters should try to save the movie, and because they are paid more, but it does not work. Most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all. Jurgen works well in his own scenes and sells like an evil guy (as always), but his script does not help him all. The scene in which John tries to persuade John (Matthev Settle) to join him is only a bad scenario. Execution of the scene when he died in an explosion is absurdly badly executed. Flashback during the movie can not be commented on. All in all, this movie is a great waistline, read the book! I have not read it, but it is probably a billion times better than that, it must be. So bad is that I had to write my first comment in IMDb.
