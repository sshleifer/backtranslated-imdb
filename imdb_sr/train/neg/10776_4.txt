When my wife and I decided to watch this movie, we thought it could not collapse. I love Billy Cristal, my wife loves Julia Roberts and all of us with whom we talked said they liked it. We were in mischief, dots. The crystal of the character was extremely one-dimensional and very little done for the film. Of course, he attacked a couple of good jokes, but as a character he did nothing but take up space. And the poor Julia Roberts. In past performances she plays well as a beloved, self-appointed lady. In this film, it looks completely suppressed and has very little fire. This is not Julia Roberts my wife likes to watch. Okay, if I find one good thing, it should be Christopher Valken. It's a party. But, just like Billy Cristal, hardly anything is shown by his character. But if you are looking for a smart, romantic comedy, this is not your movie. It's none of the above.
