While Leon is sweet at the SNL, he's only for a minute. Like most SNL movies, this can not be completed for 90 minutes. There are some sweet moments (the ones you saw in the trailer), but the actors have fallen to a great extent. Team Meadows does everything in his power, but the action does not have much high points. Vill Farrell has little to do. Farrell is perhaps the funniest man alive ... but not in this movie. What a shame.
