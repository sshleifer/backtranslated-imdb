Firstly, anyone who thinks this continuation of "French ties" by Villy Friedkin, superior is definitely completely crazy or moronic or both. The problem with reviewing this film is that, a.) It's a sequel to a brilliant movie, which is always looking objectively difficult, and b.) Directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors ever, so I wanted to like it. Villiam Friendkin was the perfect person to shoot a movie about drug trafficking in the breakdown of New York, due to its documentary approach to action and story, Frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most picturesque directors ever, Candidate "and" Seconds ", and with his" French Connection 2 "feels like someone is trying to be persistent and that he does not have a real understanding to do it. The fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to direct the continuation of Gene Hackman really speaks a lot about Hackman It's known that Hakman hated Friedkin on the set and promised that he would never work with him again, it is also known that he imagined that the character is more dimensional, losing weight and trying to play it as a real character. shows that Hackman, despite being an excellent actor, did not he had a clue about who to make the film and the story great. It is interesting that Doyle becomes an addict, but does not guarantee the rest of the film. The disadvantageous lowest point in Frankenhimer's film.
