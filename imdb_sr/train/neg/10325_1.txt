This series is getting worse and worse. Badly written and just not funny! The premise is excellent, but the inexperience of the writer passes. Trying so hard it does not offend anyone, in the end insulting everything. Now, in the second season, the desperate actors stopped waving their hands, and resorted to such a patronizing, self-confident, "Oh, silly" style of the acting that comes with no laughter. They turned their eyes and shook their heads together as if they were saying, did not they? Is not that funny? Well, no, it's not really. Gum disease is less painful. No wonder, with the exception of Corner Gas, Canadians generally avoid Canadian television. Come to CBC so you should be our leading station showing the best of Canadian talents. Pull the plug on this amateur mess.
