As it seems to be a general commentary on these comments, the film has some stunning animation (I looked at the blu-ray), but it really lacks any real depth. First, the characters are beautiful. dull. I got a hint of some kind of Laputin situation between Agit, Toole and Shunacka's main antagonist. However, my mind may have wandered and it was eager to think (Laputa is my favorite anime, original Engilsh dub). The characters are not very kind and as mentioned in the second post they fall in love very fast, leaving the poor old Mink jealous and rejected (she loves Agita, who does not seem to know this). However, it seems that immediately in the end I forgave Tooli, without explanation for the change of heart, except that it makes the end more "happy". There is a serious lack of explanation. Like who are the druids? Are they people? and who are strange women / girls who seem to hang out with them and run through the forest? Nothing explains why they are there and how can they give real human superpowers. The plants that come from the Moon still do not fill the gaps around this. It's almost like a strange version of Dana Triffid. And who is calling Toolu? Why bother with it if it is not explained? I really wanted to like this movie, but I found a plot that was not as deep as a movie like Ghost in Shell or any real figure like those of Miiazaki. I do not mind watching, but I do not like to buy it. My advice? Leave it if you have a few hours available, but borrow it or buy it inexpensively! You may also like your new animated movies and you do not have much to go. It is certainly visually pleasing.
