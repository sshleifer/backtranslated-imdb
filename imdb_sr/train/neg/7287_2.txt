In his youth, the old man wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbade it. Many decades later, the old man raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allowed his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, her sister is bored with her brother # 1, and jumps into Brother's bed nr. But no - they are Europeans of higher class going to college and employed in the social world. We never see any flickering moment between any unmanaged male and one sister. All the cocktail moments are shared only by brothers and sisters. The weakest part of the GLADIATOR was the incest. The young Emperor Commodus would have hundreds of girls slaves and a city full of girls after marriage, but no - he just wanted his sister? If the film incest is your glass, then SUNSHINE (slowly) will delight you to the end.
