This film did not have something that I could not put my finger at first sight: charisma by the leading actress. This inevitably led to the lack of chemistry when it shared the screen with its leading man. Even romantic scenes appeared as actors. It could have been a director who misjudged what he needed from the actors. I just do not know. But was it a script? Just who is the head of the kitchen in love with? He seemed more in love with his culinary skills and restaurant, and in the end for himself and his youthful ventures, than for anyone or anything else. He never convinced me he was in love with the princess. I was disappointed in this film. But do not forget that she is nominated for an Oscar, so she suits her.
