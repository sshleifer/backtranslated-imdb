Do not listen to the wrong title "The Wounded Woman". Europeans are known for emphasizing sex and nudity of real fears in their horror films, but this is just a bit too much. It seems that the "Wolverine Woman" has a humorous sex scene with a headline that crazy and brutally kills her partner. Have fun for the first few times, but a hundred minutes quickly becomes very monotonous. She was not even a jeweler, but a chick chick was hanged, whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film can not even decide on its tone, with the first ten minutes (flashback) a legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I got a garbage class after that) to a pretty bad investigation of the character of a woman who was mistreated and tortured on several occasions. thriller revenge. Finally, the director insists that this is based on a true story. Yes OK. To be honest, there are several fun aspects of production. The headwaters of the werewolf looked and there are some nice effects of up and bare scenes. However, they quickly become quite monotonous. Also, the dialogue is quite hilarious in the camp, especially doctors who swing the world most (drinking at work). Unfortunately, the film becomes quite irritating. There is no real complication or anything else. It's a pity, because I read the description that I felt the film had some real potential. "The Werewolf Wife" is far too long, slowly moving, and a bit too absurd, even according to the standards of the exploitative genre. (4/10)
