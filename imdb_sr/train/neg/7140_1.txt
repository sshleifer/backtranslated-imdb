You already know how painful it is to watch this movie. But I wonder why one of the worst films should ever include one of the most beautiful cars. Why cars must be not only a victim of violations, but also the only real actors and performers in it. So how could you, Porsche, Lamborghini or anything else allow these people to get in touch with your cars and ruin your reputation for giving millions? It's painful for those who love cars. It's painful for those who love movies. I want my money back !!!
