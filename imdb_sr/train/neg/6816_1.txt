I have to say that there is nothing wrong with low-budget films, so that was not my problem. My problem is that I felt like watching a neighbor's home movie. IMO all about it just seemed like the guy wrote a short story, grabbed the camera and started firing. I understand how difficult it is to work effectively, but when you pay to rent the movie, expect to feel like watching some kind of professionally made film. <Br /> <br /> John Schneider has a great resume is a great actor, and he was good in this movie. Other people in it were not. I understand that it must be fun and cheaper to use friends and relatives as actors, but it does not seem convincing acting. It seemed to be the way it is taken, attempting to many scenes provide interesting look, but when writing, plot and acting there to start, this type of style is not necessary, and it's harassment. Also at the technical level, he had digital artefacts everywhere. At the first stage all these fine cars, when they were slow scan, it seemed that they move it back and forth. The problem is not in my equipment for viewing, (Benk PE-8700 84 "diagonal) somewhere in the production. I have never seen such an artifact in a professionally produced film before. Did not do any voice, which may be wrong, unless sounded like The track in this movie sounded like a built-in microphone on the camera.
