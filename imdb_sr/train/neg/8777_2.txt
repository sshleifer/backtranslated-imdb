Ok, I was struggling to leave aside the fact that in the sale of EVP the real movie was basically lying from the beginning. I was thinking about hell, I do not believe in vampires, but I still loved Dracula so I could live with this. However, even with this, the movie is not very good. He was competently created and acted, but he does not capture you at all. There are a few moments of "jumps," and I just looked at them and thought "yes, I did not expect it," and I did not actually jump at all. And the resolution does not make sense. If the force behind it is capable of doing what it looks like, why then, hell, should it use proki? Plus, the title was absurd. Apparently, they put it here as part of "give credibility to the film by claiming it's all real," but to do it really should be at the beginning. But they can not put it that way, because then they take away the plot ... and they are stabbed in the end, just because they forced her to fall like a sick thumb.
