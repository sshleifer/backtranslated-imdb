Do not misunderstand me, the film is wonderful, the recordings are stunning, and the material is dramatic. However, that was a great disappointment and in fact I was very angry at what Disney did. It was subtle. He had a general sense of balance and showed a full circle of life and death. It was a tragedy and triumph, loss and gain. It was balanced. Disney's Earth change is none of this. They tried to make a film about which the Americans would talk. They made DRAMATIC. They place the highest music party there to scare us. They did evil to predators. They made VALRUSES evil. Each meeting proved to be negative. He tried to be tense and successful, but at the expense of the balance of the lesson. The film was an hour and a half negative, and only about 10 minutes positive. I am for the prevention of global alerts, but this was above political and environmental waste. It's one more thing, I went to see it on the big screen, but I was disappointed with the picture quality. It looked better on my TV at home. If you want to see something like this and get the whole picture, go out and buy, rent or borrow the BBC's Planet Earth series. Better lessons, better sound and (if you have Blu-Ray) better picture quality.
