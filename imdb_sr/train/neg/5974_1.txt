To start by telling me that it does not seem or does not seem like a movie. It seems to be just another TV show about popular girls and boys who do not have the right movie language at the top. Connect with it. This film leads us to a place where no film I have seen has done earlier: in an area where the film theater becomes a warm tool that gives the public an element of interpretation. Too obvious. A large movie screen is used only as an enlarged TV, from where we can see every attribute of these women in a way that is greater than life. Sale. This is very scary. Industry spoils art in movies. We must educate ourselves and our children about what is actually about cinema and its language. Not only sales and entertainment, but also a way of communicating feelings, passions and even culture. Not as a platform for launching young giants and athletes.
