When I saw it at the store, I thought it looked really good and original. Like the Wolf Creek, he encounters a Texas Motorcycle Massacre, and I think it costs only three pounds (about $ 6). To be honest, I do not think it was worth it. It seemed that directors - the "brass brothers" can not decide whether they want to do some sort of horror or bloody slave horror. He finished with a Satisfactory Satist satistic clock and fifteen minutes with all the characters that are one-dimensional and you did not care what happened to them, but you try to get the audience to pay attention to the characters added by the useless monologue at the end and the beginning of the film that was completely honest it was not needed. The only good part was actually the middle / end - I will not destroy it. But that was the only "good" part. All in all, it's pointless to watch. He felt like a two-hour film, but it was actually only 75 minutes. If you want an artistic film - do not bother. If you want a slasher movie - do not bother - the movie moves so slowly that nothing happens.
