Check out the website of the movie, more time is invested in making it than writing scenarios for this movie. It can no longer be that it boasts. The original story? Original? They must have found a script hidden between the old covenant, or faced with legal repercussions for that part of the trumpet. High-end Special Effects? Come on, I'd better be with the Atari 7600 and kneeling my ear. Modern cinema? Oh, yes, the funniest look of the American home video is still a classic. I'm sure they had little money for this title, so, of course, SF is not so good or somewhat bad now and then, or simply strange, but it's a story that makes this movie a waste of time and money. Four stories went into one and all were foolish parts seen-before and already-already.
