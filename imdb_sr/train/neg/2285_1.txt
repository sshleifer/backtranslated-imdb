Well, that's 90 minutes of my life, I'm not coming back. This film makes the young TV show "California Dreams" look like "Almost Familiar". The acting was terrible and the story was unrealistic. I do not even start with the real band at the head of this story, lame songs, looks, and so on. You had to believe that they were one of the hottest bands in the country, and there is not enough irony in the world to accept it. Guitarists are believed to be a heroin user, not to blame him, that I was in such an angry band with staggered songs and wooden acting, I would inject a horse. If you take the music remotely seriously, avoid it at all costs.
