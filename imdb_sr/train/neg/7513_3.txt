What can I say? I think I have to write "Spoiler alert" and then "discover" they used the F-word LOT in this movie - like in every two sentences. This movie I did not like at all - too much hint of sexual perversion, forcing and cheating. And that swearing was completely out of the window. I gave this film "3", and two of these points are for the sexy moves of Mire Sorvino on the dance floor.
