The film has been re-recorded over the years, and the army has established electronic equipment for surveillance in the desert where attacks in the first movie took place. The crew was killed shortly before a group of soldiers appeared in the exercise to find nobody near. You can fill up the rest. This is a canvas that is around everywhere. There seems to be no passion in anyone's performances, nor in anybody behind the camera. This is a movie made for money and nothing else. At some level this should have worked, it could have been a terrible southern comfort (where national guards face some people in swamps), but instead it is nothing more than anything. For the most part, you can blame the script, which was incredibly partially written by Ves Craven, who again strikes the same old goals again. Add to the mess the fact that the direction is boring and that the sequencing adjustment is so abandoned to remove any inherent tension in any scene. Not bad as such, but poorly made and boring. . Allow me to put my feelings in context: The reason I saw this movie was because the local multiplex screwed up and started this movie instead of turning the children around "Last Mimzy" and I wanted to see what caused the crying (I think they films so much in common - says sarcastically). I am convinced that this film will only scare away those who like the last Mimzy.
