First of all, I am sorry that I even added a rating to this film (nothing less than this available). The film fails in every department, whether it's a script, direction, characterization or acting. 1) To begin with, the name of the movie is really a C class (although the movie itself matches with the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan tries to adapt to the character, but the poor script in combination with the pathetic direction leads to a humorous character. 3) In Sholai Gabbar Singh has a prize of 50,000 for him (which was convincing). Here in Aag this figure was 100 crores for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan, but the poor man was beaten by our so-called hero and had only a few bicycle men to travel (with all automatic rifles). 4) Regarding Nish Kothari, someone should tell her she does not know the acting. Why is Ram Gopal Verma again and again? 5) Mohanlal was good, but he hardly had anything to do. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav who are great actors are lost in the film. 7) The legendary role played by Lila Misra (Mausi of Basanti) in Sholai was replaced inexpensively in this film by some Gang Mummy. Ram, please, grow up and realize that there should be some intellect in the film. Pretty stupid characters in the movie such as Shiva and Aag. 8) I should not say anything about modern Jai and Veer ... as much as possible. To sum up, I was shocked when I saw this movie because it looks like a cheap and comical translation of the original classic. Please do not spend money and time on this movie. I think watching Aap Ka Surror (which I thought was the worst possible movie) was a better idea than seeing this horrible package of stupid characters, bad songs and mischievous direction. Thanks, Saurabh
