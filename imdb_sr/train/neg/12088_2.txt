I read reviews of this movie, and they were generally pretty good, so I thought I should see it. I am a great fan of francophone and artistic films, but I believe this is another case in which critics make something "arti" or "intellectual" in something that is not. I will be open: it contains scenes of sexual perversity that I never, never wanted to see. Apparently, the piano teacher has some major psychological problems, but I really did not want to see them graphically. The film is basically disgusting. I mean, when I saw the dream of a dream, I was rejected by the last type of scene with Jennifer Connelli, but it was not even near the disgust and repulsion I felt during this film.
