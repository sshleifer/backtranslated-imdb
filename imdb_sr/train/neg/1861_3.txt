You know what type of film you are entering when the main character of the serial killer is transferred to an electric chair (what looks like a bakery truck), just to get a prison vehicle (and I'm not saying) this truck for genetic engineering. Goo, who throws him out, melts him, and connects his DNA with the snow, creating our protagonist, the killer of a snowman. My favorite part of the film, however, was a shot across the shoulder of a snowman waving some poor dumbbells, in which his hands looked suspiciously like a few white gloves with an oven. Mmmmm, schlock ...
