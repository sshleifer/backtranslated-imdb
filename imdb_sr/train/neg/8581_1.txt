This apology for the movie is absolutely nothing! Rachel Griffiths certainly needed the money. The film must have been made at a very low budget because there was no lighting. I would swear if I ever saw Pete Postlesumthingor or someone else commit suicide. I would love to know if there is 1) plot or 2) scenario. My biggest regret is that I was wasting my time watching this trash.
