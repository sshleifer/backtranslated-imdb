(SPOILERS IN THIS) Rosenstraße is a film about heroic women in German Nazi times. But it's too long, it's not moving and sometimes bored! There are too many cliches and insufficiently good acting. The story (story) is bad. As with James Cameron in Titanic, an old woman remembers the events of her life. Okay, now we have a point of view. Then another woman who works the same was introduced. It's puzzling that both are reminiscent of the events of other people's lives! Come on! This is a lack of knowledge about telling stories ... How can Riemann know about the fate of a girl's mother and her examination for example? Scenes are displayed in the wrong order rarely know when this happened. For example, when Riemann proposed Fabian. When did it happen? The scene looks like it was set in the age of 20 ... Riemann's character is, of course, a talented pianist, well, she's even a baroness! Vov. Her brother is returning from the Eastern Front, received a "Ritterkreuz" which shows in some scenes. So, he is a war hero and still a good man who saved his conscience. And he learned about the massacres committed by the Germans. He even made some photos! And so it goes, the cliché after the cliché is piled up and the film does not work. Basically, Fon Trot made a chick from something that could have been a decent movie. And in the end everything is very simple. Riemann finds a way for Goebbels to go to bed and - yes! - Everyone is free. What is not a historical fact, but pure imagination despite the claim of "true stories" at the beginning. Like "Sass" is unclearly based on a true event. It's sad but true, this is a typical German movie these days. That's bad! Macaulai J. Connor <br />
