So "Tanya" ... Yes. This Steven Bachman (read Steven King) about a man who gets his real desserts from Gigant Elder whom he just killed, the story itself is there, there is no doubt about it, but I do not know why I did not enjoy more than I could. I guess the actors really hurt me. I mean, who's in charge? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And do you shout loudly, can anyone stop hiring Josep Mantegno for every Italian role of a mobster ever? And while we're on it, does every mobster have to eat the Italian mother's paste? The only good thing that's done here is under 10 kilograms of makeup, Michael Constantine as a Gypsy. It's pretty good. But the rest, I'm doing all of you, "better actors ..."
