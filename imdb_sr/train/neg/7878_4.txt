I am a great fan of the original book and this adaptation is simply bad. First of all, it was difficult to decide whether it was a children's toon or an adult, which caused a strange blend of adult stories and some pretty violent scenes with a stupid little duck that constantly gives "funny" moments in the beginning. Br /> But it does not matter, the film is simply boring, immovable, and is not true to the original story. He simply fails to transfer to the picture everything that Orwell tried to do in his book. {SPOILER} Second Revolution? !! Did not they learn something? Who is next Napoleon? Benjamin? !!
