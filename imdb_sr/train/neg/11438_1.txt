If there ever was a worse comedy than the Gray Issues, I do not know that. The funny premise of the New York comedy in New York is that siblings Sam and Graya are wrong for a couple and so decide to arrange Sam with a girl just to find that Grai is equally attracted to their target - Charlie. The revelation that Gray is secretly gay seems to be just a surprise for her. There is a deeply offensive wedding sequence, a deeply embarrassing "drunkenness" by Moinhane and Graham, and a show that will embarrass the forests all over the woodlands of Tom Cavanagh. Sissi Spacek demonstrates her complete inability to deal with comedy and wants to exclude her from her biography. Molly Shannon plays a friend with lumpen insouciance. Only Alan Cumming appeared with any kind of merit, but he was seriously under-employed and did not give anything he could do. The entire disaster is reinforced by Graham's bizarre performance of the eye, which culminates in the last scene in which she wears a hat for comedy and dressing, despite the fact that the scene is set in a lesbian bar. It's astonishing that this movie has ever been published and has no feature and should be avoided at all costs.
