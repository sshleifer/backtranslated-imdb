The story of the Kid (Prince) numbers, the singer, is on the way to becoming a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Apolonia Kotero). But he must deal with his father (Clarence Villiams III!) And his self-destructive behavior. I saw it in the 1984 theater. I enjoyed the three great songs of this film - "Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazi" and "Vhen Doves Cri". The concerts in this film are great - full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately, this is a VERY small part of the movie. The story is blatantly obvious and made many times before - and much better. Subplots are poorly processed to fit nicely. The love triangle between Kid, Appolonia and Morris Dai was so predictable and tired that I actually became offended. His wife is being beaten by a father for a story, but the scenes are so poorly processed (in acting and direction) that I could not believe it. The scenario is terrible - bad dialogue and some really sick "comedic" routines. And there's a ton of misogyny - Kid's mother got a beating; Kid hits Appolonia and (for no reason) Appolonia and goes toples to swim in a dirty river. Also, the characters of Villiams and Princess constantly treat women in a terrible way. Acting is where this movie really does not work. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful - but no actor. And Prince is the (lightest) strongest actor I've ever seen. His empty face and the wooden dialogue are so bad that I could not believe it. This film comes to life only during concerts, but there are not many of them. "Dramatic" scenes have behaved so badly and worked to make this movie a tricky job. They should have done this in a concert movie. I'm giving this 2 - just for music.
