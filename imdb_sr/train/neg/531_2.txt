With a list like this one, I expected much better. Venessa Redgrave spent most of her film in bed. The best actors in the world can not do anything very interesting when their acting is limited to laying and sleeping throughout the film. The summary of the summary says that the daughters discover the secret until their mother approaches death. The thing is, he never tells his daughters anything but secretive advice to be happy. All relationships in the film are underdeveloped. I also felt that progress between the past and the present was unnecessary. It looked like the idea was stolen or from Da Vinci's code where the device was used to increase uncertainty, or from the Notebook in which they used the device to create an endless romance of the main characters of the story. Either way, it was a cheap device in this movie because it failed to do anything. It was a way to try uncertainty in a movie that does not exist. I went away wondering why good movies can not be written for women. That was really a disappointment.
