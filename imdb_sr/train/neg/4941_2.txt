In fact, I did not mind Geico advertising the first 50 times so I saw them and even found them to be slightly distorted and fun, but seriously! This is the BEST thing that these people can think of?!? This show is bullshit! It's a little fun and I feel like watching an episode of "Office" with characters dressed in cave people (I know that many of you hate me because I said it, but "Office" does not just work for me). Ok, I understand: we have a poor lunatic who is trying to keep his nose clean, and he has a shy boss who hates him; a pseudo-intellectual who really has a barely functional intellect; and the dumb thing that only wants to be accepted, but SO WHAT! I worked with these people and found them just as boring in real life as on TV ... why would I want to spend 1/336 weeks looking at more of such nominees?!? Please call your parents and ask them if they threw you on the head, if after thinking about it, you are still fooling yourself into believing it's fun.
