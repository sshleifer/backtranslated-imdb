- I was planning to write something explaining what I do not like in this movie, but this will be harder than I thought. Frankly, I do not remember much. I watched it just three days ago and that almost did not leave me impressed. This is usually a sign of a real stink. The only thing I remember was the incredibly boring majority of it. The novelty is that Humphrei Bogart looked like a detective who quickly disappeared. It would be different that he could play, but he is an entertainer for one note. The killing scenes were amateurly processed and there was no uncertainty about them. If you can not spot the killer five minutes in the movie, you must see more Euro horor. Casting is a dead gift to the killer's identity.
