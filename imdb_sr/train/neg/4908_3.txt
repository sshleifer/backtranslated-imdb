This film should take place in and around Seattle. Why is the Porteau Cove P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L Park shown? Provincial parks are in Canada, not in the United States. The inspector uses the Palm Pilot along with a stylus to "read" that someone was hacking a computer on a computer. I did not know that this was possible with the help of a database storage device. A woman appears in a movie without a prelude and is never introduced. Half the time we learn a movie that this woman works in the district prosecutor's office. Then, at the correction center, the guard was in fact PRECEDES Jenks walked through the door and held back to the assailant !! This NEVER will happen in a correct corrective environment. The director really screwed this up - it does not happen in real life. The operation is adequate. The plot is good. Cinema is good. However, many continuity errors lead to 3 out of 10 votes.
