Despite the great acting, this is an incredible movie, especially from the perspective of aviation. It may be slightly better than von Richthofen and Brovn, but not much. "Blue Mak" remains best of the small market in the past 35 years, while "Darling Lilli" is fun if it is not taken seriously. It is interesting to speculate what ILM could do with Zeppelins and Gothas in a new, high-quality World War II film.
