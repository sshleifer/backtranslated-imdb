6/10 A play, not great or good acting. 4/10 Director, makes some nonsense for this movie. 2/10 Writer, story does not make sense 4/10 Total score for this movie. Do not waste time with this movie, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and maybe it's too much. The characters are so exaggerated that they can ever be in real life, and some rather inexplicable things happen "story", not in a good way. Due to the style of this movie, you get bored after 30 minutes (too special effects: slow motion and cherry on the camera and fast forward). It's always good that the movie uses music to keep the story smooth, but there are too many tracks in this. In the first hour there are almost 50/50 dialogues and music
