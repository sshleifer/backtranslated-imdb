The only possible way to enjoy this movie is to punch your head against the wall, allow internal brain bleeding, let your brain cells die and when you are officially mentally retarded, maybe then * enjoy this movie The only rewarding benefit was the story between Ray and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of taxi drivers, as did the British. Perhaps they made the whole movie on their escapades in India and, in order to fall in love with them, they would make it a much more pleasant film. The only reason I gave him a grade of 3 is what Govinda and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy. Juhi Chavla and Anil Kapoor are unnecessarily lost. In addition, the scene at Heathrow's reunion was too much to be cautioned. As an international traveler in the nineteenth century, Anil Kapoor would be shot long before he even reached the bridge to confess his true love :) But the film's sense was again to resist logic, gravity, physics and throw the egg on the face * GENERAL * audiences. Beware of your own danger. At least I know that I'm damaged by life :(
