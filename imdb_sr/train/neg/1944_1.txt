I grew up with Scooby doo all my life, My dad grew up with Scooby doo. We just watched the first episode of a travesty that calls itself Shaggi and Scooby gets a clue. Which planet is Varner Bros. about allowing this to break. The younger sister could better draw the characters. The story may have been better written by my three-year-old cousin twins (who are also Scooby Doo fans). Scooby and Shaggi are simply not !!!!! if anyone, except Casey Kasem, Shaggi's voice does not only work people !!!! trust me. This program was embarrassing. The new Scooby Doo is much better. Why change the winning format. Bin this piece of garbage and get back to the real Scooby
