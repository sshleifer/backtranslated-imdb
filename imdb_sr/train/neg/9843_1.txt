Only Robert De Niro's film that I really hate. It's a dumb movie with a terrible acting (of course, De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma has to do his mafia movies as always as Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also loved De Palma's Mission: Impossible (1996). De Niro worked with Palm twice, Greetings and The Vedding Parti. I thought that the wedding was fine (I did not look at the Greetings). The scenario is really bad and inconvenient. There are no scenes in which I can laugh even once. The film has lost the chance of being a somewhat funny style on the "Be Black Babies" scene, and I also do not like the scene in which the sex organs of a guy appeared. So, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! just the worst. I hate that.
