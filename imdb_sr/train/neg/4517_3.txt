There is a lot to be appreciated here: spectacular locations and flying sequences; periodic costumes, requisites and sets; and competent writing and acting. However, in order to enjoy drama, we need at least one director who shows some qualities that we can love or admire. In this group of sweet snobs, we found only one character that is lovely at all? an unhappy soldier in a short-term peripheral role as their helpless victim. From the screenshot here it is clear that we are completely out of step, but we did not find their behavior in a malicious school fun or fun. Even a dog is disgusting. We wiped the towel after two out of six episodes, so you should discard these observations accordingly, but what I found written about this mini series did not give us reason to expect character transformation or redemption.
