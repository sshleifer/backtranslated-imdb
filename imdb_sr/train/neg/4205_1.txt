ALARMIST is so endlessly scripted that you were thinking why there is an actor on the ground as David Arquette agreed to be in it. It must be one of the weakest plots I've ever seen and without any humor, borders on the edge of a boring one. She stumbles over a terrible conclusion that only seems to happen because the director got bored and just wanted to end up quickly to come home for dinner. Stay away!.
