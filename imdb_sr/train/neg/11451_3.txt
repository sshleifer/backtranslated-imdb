All right, friends, from a serious movie lover, are expected to watch all kinds of films, bad and good, and this film has put me to the test. I will not cut down the words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The acting was bad. Always wonderful Sissi Spacek did nothing to make this film better. In fact, I wondered why I tried to see this broken movie? Why did I spend my time and money on something I suspected would be bad? The answer, of course, is that I am a film lover and therefore I can not avoid what should otherwise be avoided. I will not waste my time explaining what is right with this amateur film, apart from saying that the quality of acting was, to say, decent, subpaar. A serious film lover may want to take responsibility for watching this movie. Otherwise. stay home, do not waste time, read a book, take home jobs or have a good sandwich.
