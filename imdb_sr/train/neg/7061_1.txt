I'm still trying to figure out if it makes sense in this movie. For content that should be so "rebellious" and "controversial" things Maddok distributes to students are terribly lame. It seems that students can easily be subjected to vague anti-authoritarian feelings and clips of words that are incomprehensibly written on leaflets. Rebels, everyone. I guess it would be too much to look for a movie about a teenage rebellion when a school fire alarm does not start. Obviously "The Great Fight on Football Fields" is a fight that consists of two people. Personality personality looks to be wildly different at random. The football jersey that Maddok fought (which later got his head on the face) is the next day's smile and apology. The fact that it does not come to the right conclusion complication seems to me that the whole thing could be built in half an hour after school. They shaken most of the tried pseudo-glitch soundtracks.
