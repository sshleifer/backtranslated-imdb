We saw this on the shelf in a local video store, we saw "Coppola" in the credits and got excited. It was the only and only time when this film aroused interest. I could never understand whether it was an attempt at a humorous movie that failed or an attempt to make a serious movie that failed. Generally speaking, the whole production seemed incredible. The sound was absolutely horrible, especially in the scenes shot in a small bar; The dialogue was so banal in parts that it was incredible. Frustrating.
