I really love slasher movies, but this one is really terrible. The acting is lame, the scenario is bad, and the atmosphere does not exist. The action is as follows: deformed gardener Charlie Puckett kills people in a small US city. That's right - this is a complication. Very genuine, eh! "Night brings Charlie" is not even cruel enough - if the film is not intimidating, at least it should make it bloody. Avoid this cheap piece of garbage If you want to see some good jokes, see "Madman", "Burning", "The Provler", "Just Before Dawn" or "Humongous" - does not waste valuable time with this worthless piece of garbage.
