Vampires Vs. Zombies were not the original title. It was actually ... Nasty lesbian semi-vampire and two zombies hit cars: special guest appearances of Bob and their dog Random Voman with special authority and Catholic school Girl Short Skirt Zombie Choir. Also on the box: Warning: No plots - the only writer and director will understand the end, or anything else in this movie. Seriously, I love bad movies. I love the Vampire. I love zombies. Damn, I even enjoy lesbians. This film combines all three with an unclear and confusing (or nonexistent) plot, a horrible (I mean REALLY bad) dialogue, and a random STUFF and PEOPLE that have nothing to do with anything (or not ... you know what's happening in the world). Oh, and I can not forget the green oat flakes in latex gloves (yes, the filmmakers were so cheap they could not cover their hands Zombies in oatmeal and color). Either way, the result was this incredibly bad movie, if you could even call it that. Did the end make sense? The vampire was really a nurse, and the other girl was really a mental patient? Where are vampires vs. Zombies? Damn, where are Vampires ... you can not really call any vampire. Whatever. Never rent or buy this movie. If you're really curious ... OK, I'll understand. Seriously, even lovers of bad films will not be able to withstand this. It should be number 1 at the bottom of 100.
