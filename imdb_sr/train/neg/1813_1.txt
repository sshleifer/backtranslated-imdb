If one wants to make a really, really bad movie, the "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" really sets a benchmark for measuring the depth of the bad one. The main character ... Some poor guy in a baggy white "furry" costume that looks like he was sewn together with discarded carpets. Work your way slowly, painfully, through a number of non-special effects that fundamentally deprive the viewer of the suspense of unbelief. Add garden gnome (for him only). Otherwise, skip this movie completely and find something else for an hour and a half.
