I was so eager to see this one of my favorite TV shows. I saw that the Universal Trademark came with a new famous title and song that still impresses me. a spaceship approaching the amusement park and more has made this version great and fantastic. Not long afterwards ... I could not believe my eyes !!! How lucky I was that I could forget everything I saw. the songs of Titania and its theme song in the new arrangement were in my head. In any case, I want to see this space family (also Flintstones and Iogi Bear) in all graphic computer designs like Toi Story or Bug's Life. In my opinion, Hanna-Barbera.
