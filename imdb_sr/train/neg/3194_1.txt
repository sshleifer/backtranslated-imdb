I can not believe that this film was created in 1984. It has something funny, not to mention one of the dumbest stories ever. Who would ever ask thick Texas Sheriff Joe Don Baker to rinse the Italians whom he illegally arrested in Mexico back to Italy? Not to mention that the title of the movie tells you almost nothing about it - in fact, it's a generic title for a movie that needs to be an action / cop, as I can remember. I am glad to see this only on MST3K with Mike and bots as a shield. They noticed the similarity of the female lead from Elaine from Seinfeld ("None of them are sponsors") and riff non-stop on Baker's weight. This film is probably not worse than Mitchell, but Baker's reputation definitely precedes him: when his title appears at the beginning of the film, Tom says: "I wish I was illiterate so I would not have to read it."
