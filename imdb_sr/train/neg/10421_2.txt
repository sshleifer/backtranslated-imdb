I saw this film as a very young girl (now I am 27 years old) and this has scared me for years. I had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way music was drawn to (obviously) violence. My parents still argue about who let me watch it and both of them say they would never let me watch such a movie. I think they just say that knowing that I have such strong feelings about it: 0) I'm currently reading a book (from morbid curiosity and the fact that it's a classic) and that's a really great story. However, I do not think it should have been done in a cartoon. Ever. Well, perhaps today the children would find it strange, but it brought me nightmares to me for weeks and weeks, and it's still hard for me to see rabbits drawn in a similar way. It gives me a little heartbeat every time. I am vuss, but I strongly suggest that any parent wants to show this film to their children, read their book instead or first watch to make sure they approve the content. Not everyone thought it was disturbing as I did, but we're out there;
