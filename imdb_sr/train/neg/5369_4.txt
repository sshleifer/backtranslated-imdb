It seems that the brilliant team of Shonda Rhimes sent the writing of this letter somewhere on the coast, perhaps to Mediocrit? "PP" reminds me of one of the many boring, promising at first, but predictable within a season, David Kelli flicks (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal, and now Boston Legal). The crazy things they get are so strange that they hardly cause compassion or sorrow. And this is what actually makes a good medical drama - dramatic situations that you are afraid of, "This could be me" sentiment. They're not funny either. The actors are pretty good, but the lines of the plot are dead and I can not go back to life. I am a therapist, and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays an incredibly incompetent, unethical, untrained therapist. Whoever writes his things has ruined the ethics and transfer / counter-transfer courses in Stanford. Someone needs to give them a code of ethics to read (an episode with a woman that bleeds the nose and the therapist's interference in it). There are no therapists who are so bad. Women who crave for men who went on - it was done to death, we all graduated from "Sex and the City". Addison in his youthful aggression towards the guy he loves - very inappropriate by age, looks so unnatural in a woman over 40 years old, and this otherwise talented actress does not believe in herself and does not deliver it well. The only successes / delicious events are Addison who struggles with his decision to move to LA, and "Voodoo Dr" and his confrontation with widows.
