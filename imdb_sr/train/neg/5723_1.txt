Anyone who says it's better than the Hostel says it's completely shit, believe me, I'm not a hostel fan, but this is just funny. This is just another video on your camcorder, straight to DVD, low ideas for wasting time, I can not believe how many of these movies are and still will not look decent. In the 80's video nasties, horror and horror films were made without budget, but a great story and a lot of new ideas and most importantly the heart and soul of the director who had something to say. Now they appear to be fired in an attempt to deceive people searching in the Blockbuster to rent a copy, until people stop doing this, so I guess these films will continue to appear. This film is so low on the idea that it's amazing how it's ever made, the acting is terrible, the location is totally inconvenient and the soundtrack is so boring that the beggar believes. This time loss does absolutely nothing for him, unless you are looking to make a list of the worst movies of all time. My best / worst part of a movie is when a feminine character picks a gun at someone and threatens to shoot them if they do not retreat, you can see that it does not even cover the trigger while her finger holds the handle. Absolute joke.
