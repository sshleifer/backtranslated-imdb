Lorenzo Lamas starring Jack `Solider` Kelli, a former veteran from Vietnam and a rebel police officer who goes on a quest and destroys a mission to save his sister from the buttocks. The horror movie is so cheap and so bad that Ron Palillo is third, and yet it has 3 minutes of screen, and even they are not good. All in all, an awful film, but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hanging from the tree in bags and crowds are worth a few (unintentional) laughs. This is followed by an improved extension.
