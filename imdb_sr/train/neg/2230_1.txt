If you want to see a retarded expert on homosexual karate, to throw a pile of trying Mexican gangsters to try to repeat in an hour, then this is the movie for you. if not, then select another DVD from the 20c bin which is the only place that this movie belongs to. The acting was so terrible that I had to compel her to look her up to the end. The cover makes it look so cool, but it's just another inexpensive gangster movie b category, modeled on 2 g, key, bloody streetz and danger. I would not buy or rent this movie, unless you plan to be stoned and complicated, editing and acting really does not matter to you. It's really the worst movie in the history of mankind !!!
