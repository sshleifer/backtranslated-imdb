Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. This is the first, most important and most disturbing thing in this attempt to re-imagine Scooby-Doo and the company. Shaggi's voice is creaking and does not sound anything like what it sounds like. the previous Incarnation of Scooby. They also changed clothes and the classic way of walking from the original. I'm not sure what's still about the criminal angle, but it certainly does not follow the formula used in any of the previous Scooby shows. The style of animation is very bizarre and distorted. I like it, but it's not a real Scooby-Doo animation. But the strange animation used for other World Bank shows grew on me; That could, too. Worth to look - once - if you can withstand the lack of proper Shaggi voice. This right has enough to have a good time. Besides, I'm trying not to be inflexible, admirer. Develop or die, as the saying goes. We'll see what he looks like after two more episodes - until then I will form a much more solid opinion.
