If you look at this movie, you will be reluctant to film, director, producer, actor and person who told you to see it! I'm ashamed of you, Sarah Michelle Geller, that you put your name and face into this bad pronunciation of the film. Perhaps it was more scary that Japanese actors were just speaking in Japanese, instead of trying to "act" in English. I wanted to be when the film ended ... a genuine disappointment after everything that happened on TV and film advertisements that promote this lame money. Sarah Michelle did not have to act at all to film this movie ... she just practiced her frowned skills. Do not waste time and money on this movie.
