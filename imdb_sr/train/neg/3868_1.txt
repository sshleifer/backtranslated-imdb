If you study Velles and want to see how far he has fallen after Citizen Kane, this film will prove it. The cheap excuse that the protagonist turns into a self-proclaimed dumb fool to explain how he could enter such a half-schemed scheme fails to explain the absurd theatricality in the courtroom and the funny complicated complications that will arise. Do not be overwhelmed by the high rating of this movie in db as I was; All I can imagine is that there are many hard old Velles and Haivorth fans.
