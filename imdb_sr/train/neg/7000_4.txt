Hollywood, home of a hypo, glamor and search for profit, barely dominate spiritual values, and therefore it is not surprising that his attempts at exploring spiritual life are slim and often stupid (better to go on) for Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman films, for the study of spirituality). "Strange Cargo" is no exception. This unusual hybrid of adventure film, love stories, and religious parables trivializes exactly what it is trying to communicate. That the figure of transparency and salvation will correspond to Vern (Clark Gable in his craving and self-confidence) and Julie (Joan Cravford, cutting and spitting every other word in an attempt to be the Queen of Hard Ladies) seems at best funny. Is this the patron saint of the star system at work, the corresponding war ego before sending them to further sentences on M-G-M? BUT. . There are good accompanying performances, and visually appealing moments: a shadow prison barracks; going out of the moon by the moon, or against the painter's cloud; Julie walks along the shore while the wind strikes; Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre) negotiate for Vern's freedom as the storm builds up; an unusually refined gay imprisonment romance between two convicts. . Above all, Paul Lukas is a dignified and distinguished performance like Hessler, a killer who can appreciate Cambreau's virtues, but turns his back on. In the most momentous moment of the film, Hessler, leaving Cambreau, stands in front of the cabin. We hear the wind through the jungle, we see the shadows on his face, which transmit the moment of fear and doubt into themselves. Then he goes out in the night. At this point, Hesler achieves ambiguity, depth, and existential strength that none of the other characters can accomplish. is the secret of the film that his deepest sympathies are related to Hesler?
