Rumors are true: girls prefer COIOTE UGLI than boys. And the reasons are obvious as soon as it complicates. A Jersey girl goes to New York to become a songwriter. And after the initial frustration that she is not lucky, she sees some girls who are having fun about $ 300 that they made last night. She received an audition at the bar where she worked and a surprise! The city is full of "two-year-olds" who shoot when they see dancing babies. and the bouncer, but to face it, the drama was terrible and completely funny from the beginning. Violet and her father looked too funny as they dealt through the film. And check if Violet has distracted too much on the keyboard with the dancer! For the first time I remembered how the production was so terrible? For a brief moment with this film, Hollywood could stand on his two feet and show a new low without much public protest without saying, "You were warned!" Instead, it seems that COIOTE COLORS have a purposeful intention to try to kiss every major part of the world. Advertising the baby in the bar, but showing thin paperwork "following your dream" disappointed every male teenager you targeted! And finally, music. There was absolutely no interruption to the music I found in this movie, especially when it was needed (hospital scene). Each scene felt like a short music video that you want to stop until it's opened at all. But the highlight was the ultimate laugh: the 80s as a song you would expect Cindy Lauper to jump on the stage and jam with Violet. Heck, I personally thought Bon Jovi would pop out with long hair and jam! Apart from some really smart cameras working with coyote girls when they dance (especially a wet scene), and a couple of cute clich√©s, COIOTE UGLI is something for which it should be totally unpleasant. Regardless of whether you watched or worked, it seemed like it was just killing time. Or losing depending on how you look at it.
