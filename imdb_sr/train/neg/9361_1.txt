When I saw on TV, I thought, "Ok will be a good inferry movie," but it's not. It was not terrible at all! The acting was good, the plot was horrible, the military offer was simply stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel could be better than this shit. The film sounded as if Arron would turn into a wolf, instead he toppled his psyche and bit the doctor. If you've read some of my other reviews about other movies, it's all positive, but this is not easy because the story was terrible. One of 10 mak. I'm sure that you all expected a movie, but I bet you did not expect it. Behind Loch Ness was better than this movie, any movie on the sci-fi channel is better than this movie.
