this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not kidding. the next time it arrives, I'll just keep running my head to the wall. it would be more pleasant for me to sit in an emergency service trying to explain to the doctor why my brain is swollen rather than trying to get through this movie again. Hope that black and calm will never work together on the project is again bad. both are good comedians, so I was shocked that it was so inconvenient. If they had to do everything again, I'm pretty sure they will decide not to do it. People who have fought money have surely lost their tone. not really - because the special effects (all two) were terrible.
