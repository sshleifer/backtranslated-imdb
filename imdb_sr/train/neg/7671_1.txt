The film starts with some moving text that lasts almost five minutes. It provides a basic overview of what's happening. This could easily be done with acting, but instead you get the effect of moving the text. Shortly after being bombarded with characters you learn about, keep in mind that this will teach you all. The action starts to crash from the ground and then crash through the entire film. Not only does the shop change, but you can even ask yourself if you're watching the same movie. I've never played a video game, but I know people who have it. From my understanding whether you played the game or not, this movie does not get better. Save your money if you do not want to sleep in theaters.
