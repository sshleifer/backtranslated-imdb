Home Alone 3 is the first in the movie Home Alone, which does not show Culkin in the lead and the same villains. However, the plot is very similar to the original movie "Home Alone". Instead of two comic villains, we got three or four. This movie includes some pitfalls, but it also has a long scene with a car for remote control. And the humor with the slapstick is consistent, but the young man and the villains really do not manage to influence this film. This film does not offer anything new or different from the previous films, and there really are no warm, holiday sensations or sub-clusters that other two films have. It's more pure comedy, but she failed to smile because the characters did not really do it for me. I would not recommend this movie; It's pretty boring. If you are looking for a good family vacation comedy comedy, then look at the original 'Home Alone' movie.
