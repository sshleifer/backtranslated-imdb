The story has been seen before, but it does not matter if you can think of making a real recordboard. It is clear that the director did not do his work on the screen of the script. In addition, the cameraman spent too much time at an angle that did not match the movie's message. The funniest, however, if you look at the movie's website, you can read that the director decided to make a movie with poor camera angles. Because it reminds us of hunting. But I've never heard of hunting with the bad corners of the camera ;-) It will have 1 star because the story is fine. It's a shame that Ti West did not spend more time reviewing your story. It's like film is more important than planning. Because you have a camera does not mean you need to make a movie right away ... come here. Everyone can make a movie, but not everyone will be equally good. So, the advice for the West is: stopping and marking what you want. Take the time to start planning, and not shoot until everything goes down on the screen. You must have the ability and the desire - so do not abuse your talent.
