No one is a fan of Geroge Macdonald Fraser's Flashman than me. I was surprised when I just saw Richard Lester heading Roial Flash, because I also saw he made three / four muskets. with Fraser, which I did well out of. Not So Roial Flash. I was 12 years old when the movie was released and could not be thrilled I read all of Flashman's works published until then, and was drunk with Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowell (still alone, but he's never really got a chance after that). What a disappointment (I saw it once more when I was 20 years old on television and it looked even worse). None of the sharp dialogue in the books was shifted to the screen. The flashman's comedy looked like it was wrongly guided in the same way that a group of high school students could try to get it parodied. Dueling and fencing were terrible and dishonest. Looking back with mature eyes, the film failed to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of prisoners from Zende. If you read the book and did not see a movie, I can only say that the movie ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg becoming quick friends and playing the game that Rudi had just invented: the Russian roulette. <br /> <br> Pathetic edition of everything about books. My comments would be more direct if I had seen the movie recently, but I'm glad I did not. If by chance Fraser reads this, I can only say that he is a genius - maybe the greatest writer of his generation, but, based on my assessment of this corpus of work, it is hard to believe that he has written a script of this film, as that he did all those horrible films by Roger Moore James Bond.
