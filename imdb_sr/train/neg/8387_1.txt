This was the worst movie I've ever seen in cinemas. It was just a compilation of recycled material. People who hit their heads are not funny. People who are shot are not funny. After a third time, the guy was shot in the eggs, even the youngest member of the audience no longer laughed. I was just getting tired soon. I went with my younger sister. It actually laughs loudly on King of the Hill, but this film masterpiece has bored her. I'm not surprised. The story is pretty poor. The thief of the ball steals a big diamond in what is definitely the easiest looting in Hollywood history. Then she's hiding with a family that pretends to be a baby. I know it sounds exciting, but that's the whole story. Say these two lines over and over again in 1.5 hours and you will get the picture There was a predictable joke. I really felt torn after I saw it. I did not expect much and I was still disappointed. I wish Keenan would only hire some decent writers to write jokes and / or his next script. This was worse than Wit Chicks if it's possible. I've seen high schools that are better and cheaper. There was nothing positive about this film. I do not like to have fun.
