I saw this movie in TCM. Several problems with the film were obvious from what I saw. First, adults did not grow old when children worked for 10 years. Several parts of the film had problems with continuity and for some reason the actor who played the youngest son seemed to be the oldest when it was 10 years ago. The copy I saw was missing about 20 minutes, or at least, at least a big black screen appeared. Too bad, because although the script left something to be desired, Bergman and Russell had a good time in the film in their roles. It's a shame that a big piece is missing, but what is here is visible. I would just like it to be all intact. The scenario makes little sense in the fact that Bergman's figure was fired when the children were small, and then returned to take care of them when they grew up? Some of the weather lines make no sense. There was a fall in the stock market that looked like 1929, but children grew up to fight in the First World War. I wonder what was in the movie I did not see, because it was not.
