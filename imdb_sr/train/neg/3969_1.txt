I write this because I somehow felt it led me to believe that Dark Remains is a good movie. Although it's not the worst I've ever seen, it's certainly not good. Bad script, weak actors and poor directors. Even if they can not afford a big name, would it be too much to look for a more attractive actress? It was painful to watch an ordinary actress through a movie with her boring performance. The story was a clich√© and badly written. Special effects were minimal. "Uncertain" tricks that are repeated here were hard to swallow. To be honest, Dark Remnants are not worse than some of the Masters of Horrors episodes. But it's still not quite in the ranking with quality movies. Dark Remains is recommended only for hardcore horror fans who do not want to miss any movie in the genre, even if it's bad. As for anyone else, time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy.
