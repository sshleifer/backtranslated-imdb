The movie is bad. There is no other way to say that. The story is poor and obsolete, especially for this country. I think most people do not know what a "walker" is or will care. I felt like watching a movie from the '70s. The theme was incredible for 2007, even when it was placed in DC. I think that's true for all the others who watched it, because the applause was low and fast in the end. Most did not stay for K & A. I do not think Schrader really thought about film in advance. It seems that many scenes were shortened as if they were never finished or simply did not know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to another and you had to try to figure out or guess what's happening. I really did not get Carter's private life or boyfriend. What were the "artistic" male tortoises and images of torture (from Iraqi prisons)? What did he think? I think it was his very bad attempt to try to create this dark private life of a subculture for the Voodi character (Car). Failed. It did not even seem to make sense. The only good thing in this movie was Voody Harrelson. He played his character (car) impeccably. You really understood what a "walker" was (for example, twenty years ago). He was great and probably will never be recognized. As for Lauren, Lily and Kristin ... Boring. Do not see! It's painful! Unless you're a true fan of Harrelson.
