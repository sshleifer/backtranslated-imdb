I'm still shaking the idea of ​​EVER re-seeing this movie. I saw action movies, I even liked several of them, but this goes over the top. Not only does it have the worst male actor ever (Sli Stallone) who plays the lead role, but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning (why not plunder money while the plane on earth is much easier) that a person with IK less than its number to believe it. Moreover, the plot has no real plants, a three year old kid can guess what follows. It's a set of clichés (action genre), with Sli's worse than other films (it was even better in Rambo III if you're watching this movie as a comedy rather than a movie). Now there is an actor who can not act A) surprised B) Sadly C) anything other than his basic face. I would still like to point out that this film has two factors that could make some people like it. EXPLOSIONS are extraordinary, but then ... you can see better on the 4th of July. THE PEOPLE are magnificent, but then ... there are documentaries about the Alps and the Himalayas, so you can see better aspects in this way, instead of wasting time on this movie. Go to watch another movie, there are hundreds, even thousands of better action movies.
