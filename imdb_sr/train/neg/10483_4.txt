I saw this movie on a US airline plane. It was so bad that the flight took longer. The plot had the potential (who would not love a film about a woman who accidentally kills every Elvis imitator she meets?), But she's screwed up a million different times from really bad writing. In the end, there is a shamefully bad scene in which the group of Elvis's imitators on the casino's roofs sending the sky thinking that they will return, and then a group of stars move together to form the constellation of "Elvis", which immediately shoots lightning on the imitators, sending them to fall through the roof. Bad ... really bad. What is the theme of the whole movie. I would avoid this at any cost.
