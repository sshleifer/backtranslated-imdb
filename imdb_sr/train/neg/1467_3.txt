It's no wonder that historian Ian Kershaw, the author of the revolutionary Hitler biography, who was initially a scientific consultant for this TV film, separated him from it. The film is historically too inaccurate. The mistakes begin immediately when Hitler's father Alois dies at home, while he actually dies in a tavern. In the film, Hitler moved from Vienna to Munich in 1914, while in reality he actually moved to Munich in 1913. Hitler's childhood and youth are shown too briefly, making historically uninformed people hard to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man. Significant persons of the early party, such as Hitler's father's friend Dietrich Eckart or the party "philosopher" Alfred Rosenberg, have disappeared altogether. The characterization of Ernst Hanfsteng is very problematic. In the film he is portrayed as a noble character who almost despises Hitler. The script obviously follows Hanfengeng's own glow for looking at himself in his biography after the war. In fact, Hanfstaengl was anti-Semitic and was crazy about his "FÃ¼hrer". But the biggest problem of the film is the display of Hitler himself. He is characterized as someone who is constantly hostile, has no charisma or charm and constantly orders everyone around. After watching the movie, it is said that such a disgusting person has ever succeeded in getting any followers. Since we all know what the evil criminal Hitler was, it is natural that every writer is tempted to show Hitler as totally disgusting and insufficiently. But the facts are that in the privacy could be quite charming and fun. His comrades did not follow him because he kept shouting at them, but because this stranger liked them. In addition to all these historical mistakes, the film is well-made, actors are first-class, location snapshots and production design give a convincing impression of era.
