I just finished watching this movie and found it was not funny at all. I am RPG Gamer (type of computer, none of DnD table stuff), but I did not find any jokes Some of these scenes seemed to be much pulling (tilt and zoom can be reduced to 5 seconds, not a minute) and the director seems to be Just trying to fill the time. I think I laughed a total of 2-3 times in the whole movie. The very act was not so bad, the standard that should have a movie from class B. I suggest you do not bother with this movie, unless you are a great fan of DnD, and even then it would be best to avoid it.
