(Possible spoiler or two) "Soul Survivors" is probably the worst theater movie. Nothing makes any sense, there is a plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead. The whole movie is just a bunch of random pictures of things that do not actually connect, to the end of the movie. The act does not exist, the camera's operation is truncated and the script is so confusing, it just makes the movie even more difficult to watch. I constantly waited for something to connect the film, but nothing came. Definitely the worst movie of the year. - **** 1/2 star.
