THE PROBLEM OF CHILD is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the last decade! This is a bad movie about a wild boy who was adopted by two parents, but he later gets into trouble. Yes Junior can drive his grandfather's car. He can scare people with a bear. Can fire the room! It's a bad movie as much as BATTLEFIELD EARTH. The continuation is worse than fate. Instead, rent chicks. 1/2 of ****.
