All right, I rented this movie because of the director ... he made some interesting breakthroughs in the past (if you have not seen the Vack, you miss a party). In any case, I doubt this film from the beginning, but I decided to suck it and look at it. That's bad. Very bad. If you have not seen a movie and do not think the spoilers have read in advance. Firstly, the old saying 'You can not judge a book by its title page' is used here. It seems that the box for this film indicates that Jill is a stone fox with long hair with accentuated details. On the back of the box there is a cool red leather Jill and some other footage. The description makes you want to rent a movie because it sounds good. You begin to watch it and you suddenly find out that the film is unfolding (inexplicably) in 1977. The film is not as predictable as you would think ... and that's not a good thing. The characters do so stupid things without any motivation ... it's uncomfortable to watch. 10 minutes before the end of Dolph and another lady have sex for no reason. Also, what the point was was that Dolph coldly killed that other lady who helped him. Anthony Hickok director was supposed to see the stinker when he read the script. If it was placed in the underground of the new millennium and that the characters were half-way intelligent, it might have been decent. Setting it in the 70's does not make sense and has no effect on the story. Avoid this!
