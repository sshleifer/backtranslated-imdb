Is this movie a joke? Is it a comedy? Surely this is not a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is some deliberate humor, but in a lot of cases, bad acting, bad directing and horrible scripts were laughing at the cinema. The action is acceptable - a young promising artist has just reached his peak murdered by a killer who accidentally falls. The killer sees a working portfolio of young artists wearing and deciding to attend exhibitions of his work. At the exhibition, the killer meets a sister of dead artists and they fall in love. It's all very predictable and the end will not have anyone to hit because it's so badly scripted. The film takes place mainly in Vienna, Austria and shows how it is a beautiful city. Do not waste time on this movie, unless you learn how to not act, direct or script a movie!
