I rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting, but for my Horror this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen! I read the comment Gumbi-8 and he must be part of the acting team or team. Unless Gumbi-8 is not a four-year-old child or some demented member of the cult, no one in common sense would have thought that this movie has any potential at all. Citing: "From the" Dune "inspired animation opening to the fast pace ... this movie keeps an eye on the go and works so well that repetition of watching is not unexpected." Animation is the only aspect of a movie that was interesting and the fact that the film keeps an eye on the move, that's because you are constantly looking for any type of uncertainty. I mean, give me a break. Halloween was shot with a budget of $ 100,000.00 and a colored mask, and by the way he became a cult classic. As far as "re-viewing is not unexpected" I think he made a mistake. Another quote from Buttons-8 is the only fan: "The acting is also a strong aspect of the movie." With due respect for the actors, their performance is nothing more than the appropriate talent of Robert Napton. It's because there is no twilight or darkness in this movie. MPAA rating "Rated R for some violence / worse" The only worse you see is a red color on a sheet above a dead body that you never see. As far as I know, it could be a bunch of grass. Finally, I saw horror films from the 50s, 60s, and 70s. I saw what I thought was absolutely the worst and some very good. The director of this film did not even try, he slept, or took the acid. In any case, I think that actors deserve applause to try to save a very bad job. I would give this film a score of .5 for the movie 'B'.
