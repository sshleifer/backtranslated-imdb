The good thing about it is at least fresh: There are almost no films about dance music and club scene (if it's even made) in cinemas. It radiates a lot of energy, from music to portrait of Ibiza. But the main problem is that it can not decide what it wants to be. Although definitely likes to be mockumentaries in the line This is Spinal Tap, the creators also realized that they do not want to play copycat. However, this does not succeed in a large extent on jokes because it is not well written and most characters are underdeveloped. And there is no arc in his script and direction to be up to 90 minutes, so why not edit it to 75? The production department and the cinema are still trying to save the day (eg Pavlov dom).

Conclusion: it's messy, somewhat entertaining at the basic level, but better spend the night in your favorite club.
