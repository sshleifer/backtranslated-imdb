SciFi has had very bad luck in producing quality movies lately (such as Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel should be based on the great epic Beovulf, however, he deviates so much (and offers so little in comparison) that advertisements on television could be called "some shy movie Christopher Lambert." I did not expect it to be as precise as Hollywood production, but I nevertheless expected that 'artistic integrity' would not interfere with the actual story (even if it changed slightly to make two hours of converting nicely). the director and the producers had some idea of ​​what they were doing (did this research come in?) Obviously not, as can be said from the massive horned helmets that Beovulf and his team (except for the gang) carry. One major problem which I had with the appearance of Grendel, if Beovulf should have opposed him, for should not be 16 meters tall and weighs 2 tons? Grendel's death segment is also missing in every way? In my opinion, the one in the epic is actually better than the fictitious garbage on the script, for example: Grendel should get Beovulf to take his hand out of the socket "Do not cut off on the forearm after being burned with an explosive shot from a crossbow that looks like it's 300 pounds!" And Grendel's mother ... was she simply combined with a dragon at the end of the epa where he finally died when he succumbed to his wounds? And honestly, what's the hell with that scarf? If you want to see this film because of its connection to the epic, do not, because it really does not have it (except for the character's name). The only way to recommend this movie is if you liked the Druids film (directed by Jackues Dorfmann) ?? although I do not recommend even watching.
