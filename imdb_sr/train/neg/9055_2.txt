As a fan of Billy Bob Thornton and the diversity of his skills, I noticed that this film is on the list, and I was surprised that I had not heard of him. I traveled more than usual during both at the time it was shot in 2000, and when it hit the theater for more than 2-1 / 2 years later (that time was the first track it was not all right with production). Now Patrick Svaize can not function for sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough abilities to make up the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is someone who would be pleased to see him, even if he showed that he was looking at the color on a dry one. Being curious, I checked the production information of this site. He made an incredible $ 600 per screen for his home weekend, and just over $ 400 for each, after a theater program was launched in 2002. location. The story is fairly benign, and even the use of the usually interesting site of Renoa is as boring as the rest of the event. It is something like several SNL bits that are all assembled, none individually too large, and the overall presentation is even worse. Anyway, the costs for this production had to be significant - even if they all worked less than the usual tax - so the only thing that made it hardly feasible was the quality of the recording and the presence of Billy Bob (though understandably somewhat laconic here, compared to his usual work. Think of the three top, completely different characters that he showed in "Sling Blade", "Bandits" and "Bad Santa", and you know that he understands this job under the standard, long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm it One star for him, even here, and one because the production was better than, say, the typical "life" speed.
