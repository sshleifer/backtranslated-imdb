This is one of those films that obviously tried to get into the madness of the martial arts waves. Somehow like Billy Jack. However, while Billy Jack had a remarkable martial arts scene, there is no one in this unless you think of some gentleman's grappling and roughhousing as such. We met a star described as having learned a judo in marinas. I was in the marines and while they were pretty well established in the box, I really do not remember any emphasis on judo. As a result, the antagonist, James Macarthur, mentions Judo when he offers an excuse for why he, the state champion wrestler, was so easily defeated. Lame.
