Yes that is correct. I spent the first hour patiently waiting for the film to land. It was terribly boring and consisted mostly of people who drove randomly along the hills without visible direction. Then the hero comes to the picture. Born as an Asiatic, but when he grew up, he became a white man. Obviously white. He was not even near the passage for Asians. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was extremely confusing, and the story did nothing to help the cause. Endless combat sequences and lame dialogue. It's an hour and forty-five minutes, and I tried to eat my face to the end. I watched this because people in the video where I work always ask me if this movie is good. Now I have an answer. It does something like this: hm. "No, good God! No, it's terrible! Do not do it to yourself! I would recommend another movie, maybe one that's fun."
