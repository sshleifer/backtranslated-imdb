Has HeidiJean really seen this movie? Big Christmas movie? Not even close. Tupa, mild and completely lacking imagination and heart. I continued to watch this film wondering who, to hell, thought Carli Pope could play the main role in this movie! The woman has no recognizable personality and gives a completely ineffective effect. Baranas was as great as usual, and he offered only a few interesting things. Probably her engagement was the only reason this project was green lighted up. Perhaps I expect too much for a Lifetime movie that has been playing for 15 days since Christmas, but I've been going through this thing thinking that with a different director and processing JJ with an actress who could at least cause compassion, this could be a pretty cute little movie.
