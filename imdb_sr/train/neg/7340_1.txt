Impressed! This is the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood movies I've ever seen! I did not like the Roman, but this movie has worsened! Very bad music, worse actors (besides SRK, of course, even if it does not manage to save the movie), it does not make much sense. The director makes everything look very confusing, God knows why ... Maybe because he's trying to make everything look very surreal, yet credible. Well, he does not work. Even if you have a few hours to lose, do not watch this movie, please! (Say it for your own good!) Continue to seek, you will find something else to watch!
