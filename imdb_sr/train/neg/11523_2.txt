"Igor and the Lunatics" is a totally incompetent and amateur attempt in the film of horror in the madness-hippie cult of killing. Apparently even nearly twenty years later, Charles Manson continued to inspire excessively enthusiastic, but incompetent filmmakers. This is a typical Troma production, which means in other words, there are many boring and completely irrelevant shots to fill up meaningless complications. On the screen is a little random up and free nudity? what is not bad ?? but everything is so meaningless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to watch. "Igor and the crazy people" are so desperate that even twice they use a lot of footage, as the circle saw killing. An incomprehensible shop attempts to tell the story of a hippie cult led by drug addicts and Charlie Manson vannabe Paul. One of Paul's lower-ranked students, named Igor, becomes somewhat obsessed with Bible stories and orgy for drugs and gradually leads to the entire cult that goes down into criminal madness. Just to illustrate through a small example exactly how Igor is crazy: he heart heart straight from the chest really sexy black hiker girls! There is disturbing synthetic music and some really confusing pseudo-artistic camera tricks, such as slow recordings and unusual dreamers of dreams. There may be a sequence that more or less qualifies as valuable for the fanatics garbage, that is when the poor girl is halved by a machete. For no particular reason, the camera holds a blade shot in the bloody belly for fifteen full seconds.
