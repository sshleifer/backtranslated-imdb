I found this film pretty strange. From the very beginnings it was extremely difficult for me to like this film, and now, after a bit of reflection on it, I can pretty much determine the reason. Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him to pieces (I think Zentrop is one of the best films ever made) here is quite wrong, and although I can not imagine life that would be better, I'm sure someone could easily take his place and make this movie. Everything else is fine, except for the sting on a bad comedy (A Meet The Parents Joke is not really needed, filmmakers!) And I really like Richard E. Grant as a British major. Just suffering from one thing ... Jean-Marc.
