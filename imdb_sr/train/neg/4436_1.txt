I gave this film a score of 1 (Terrible). The only reason he should get 1 instead of the big one is - Ben Kingsley, who does not always shine, does not matter what a terrible material is being thrown into his path. here the viewer simply can not overcome the fact that he is even in such a piece. Stupid, stupid story and terrible production. DO NOT spend your video rental $.
