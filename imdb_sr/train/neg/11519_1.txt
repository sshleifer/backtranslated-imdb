This is the absolutely dumbest movie I've ever seen. What a loss of a wonderful actor. It's James Cromwell as an ignorant playmate. I could go on and on, but obviously I would spend more time on this review than anyone who ever worked on the script. The only thing this film is about is that we are against them and how to enjoy a profane splash above the tolerance of every reasonable human being. This is one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen - and I love James Garner.
