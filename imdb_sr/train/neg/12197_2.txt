The war of the beast is a play that is exaggeratedly exhausted and overstated. Let's get to know the characters of this disgusting performance whose creators need to be acid to try to make this shov. Cheetor- Seriously, they must have censorship on this type. How did he not let the viewers have the same voice as baby Taz? (at least Razzoff from Raiman 3: Hoodlum Havoc released Slip & Slide) Action Blast - If you want shov's shoving shit, take the G4 Tranceformers Cibertron-A shov that should enter VC. Good creators (Sarkazam) Show self-retarded and boring (at least Super Mario games are better) This show had many followers who said they were coming back, but I believe it was canceled for their own good.
