This film is a loose collection of incomprehensible analogies and bad ideas for devices. Film history: The director of this film was a pervert who drove across town shooting random women. When his wife discovered film drums, she was forced to quickly invent the story. He claimed to be filming a movie titled "A Brain That Would Not Die". In the end, his wife asked her to show her "so-called movie". That night he quickly recorded some extra scenes with a friend and was born "A Brain That Would Not Die". Hate this movie! Synopsis: The main character's verdict was killed in a terrible traffic accident (caused by ignoring clearly defined road signs). He grabs his head from the wreck and revives her. After reviving his head, he went and picked up a bunch of whores. This is mostly what happens to the rest of the film. In the end he fights and kills him by the monster living in the closet. The monster appears with little or no explanation. However, the monster saves the whore and I presume that they live happily for the rest of their lives. Side Notes: The End-of-End Screen claims that the movie is called "A Head That Would not Die". /> I hate this movie!
