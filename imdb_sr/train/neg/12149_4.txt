Set in Providence, Rhode Island, Feeding the Masses is trying to be a satirical view of the role of the media in power. At best, this can be applied to the way the United States is trying to control the media during the war in Iraq, but this ends with a sense of emptiness. There is never any tension in the story, and acting has never been good. Worst of all, the direction of the movie is terrible, more focused on the strange corners of the camera that fail to convey nothing but "Is it a strange way to hold the camera." Special effects are pretty bad ... at one point the video of the explosion is green over the city, and this is at best funny. The film has a few bright spots ... namely advertisements for post-zombie services (including complaint service and party bus). But that's too little for a movie to be worth the effort. For a better zombie movie, try to hide and crawl. It has the same poor production value, but behind it is much more fun, humor and talent.
