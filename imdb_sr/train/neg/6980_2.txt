Historically accurate? Hmm ... Maybe ... if you blink, and the light falls on the subject just like that. But the accuracy of the core is not a compensation for a gloomy, unequal and inconsistent plot, a bunch of cardboard dialogue and an unsatisfactory conclusion. The main characters are just characterization; unpleasant stereotypes ranging from the 'mysterious and noble' American Indians to the 'miserable but sadistic' British officers. Poor and worthless performance of the fascinating period in American history. I want my money back.
