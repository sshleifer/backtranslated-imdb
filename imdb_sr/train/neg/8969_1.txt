The plot does not offer any new excitement, it even starts the same as the cube I. This time there are no other improvements for the machine of the cube, except that it has an extra output, which is not kept, very genius. The characters are also not as well elaborated as in the first episode, they simply became "flat" as in the soap opera. If someone comes to a normal exit, a person will be asked some questions, such as "Do you believe in God?" and this is not really creative or original, and especially in my opinion do not fit in the mystery of the cube with these traps. There really is nothing else about it.
