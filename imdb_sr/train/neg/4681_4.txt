We laughed at our heads. This script is so incredible that either you burn CNN or you go to bed. My dad was a marine captain for 30 years, he could not believe his eyes when the video was a movie. During his experience as an officer, once claimed the command over the ship, the captain drank 3 bottles of whiskey / daily and (sorry) on his desk. Of course, this was not a nuclear mission. For example, a fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important thing on any ship, nuclear or not. The drill at that time was just a Hollywood scenario. When the captain is arrested, he is arrested, you take all his keys and open the safe where the weapon is held. This is kept within a few minutes in a well-guarded room. He can not escape, it's like in jail. It's strange that my dad had a dog on board, however, we see how Hackman allowed him to pee in the control room. This is never done. My dad cleared all the mess the dog made wherever he was. Hackman and Washington make three stars for which this movie is credited, everything else is bulls ** t. When we know that 23 people lived in Koerca, this film gets an additional dimension. If you want to see the real thriller about the underwater rent: Thas Boat. <br /> <br />
