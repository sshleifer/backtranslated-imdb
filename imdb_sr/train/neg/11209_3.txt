This rude mini-operetta with the Eddi-McDonald prototype in the Valentino scenario is so bad that it becomes a stretching exercise after five minutes. It's stupid from the very beginning, because this briefness opens up two soldiers who discuss the lack of masculinity in the son of one of the officers. In less than a minute, he is packed in Morrocco, where he lives a double life like the Red Shadow; the leader of the Arab tribe who would rather sang than he fought. Alecander Grai and Bernice Clare have a fine light opera voice (with low acting skills) and there's a decent bass, but the acting is so random scenes so poorly prepared you get the feeling that they do things as they go on. These two reels were part of a larger theater production that lists six writers. With more space for harassment and harassment, the show may have had some value for entertainment, but it's an accelerated hit just over insulting for an audience waiting for the show.
