It's quite simple. Friends are a comedy of very basic humor for teenagers and young people, with incredible sense of humor. It is also painfully obvious that in the end they desperately tried to pass the 10 seasons, most likely to be able to say that they won the Seinfeld season's race. The problem is that Seinfeld had 9 wonderful seasons with great writing. Friends had (and I am very generous here) a maximum of 5 or 6 seasons OK, and then 4 brazen season. Recycled humor soap and characteristic recycled characters that were not so good to start, then deteriorated for the 100th time you saw them. It's very hard for me to understand why people so highly esteem this. It's really terrible.
