First seen 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): Campi vampire Stephen King movie has so many strange and ridiculous elements to start laughing over extreme wonder about 3/4 times in the film and wondering whether this film maybe he has a cult for King's fans. This is a story about a mother and son who are sleepwalking (cat, meat, changing the shape of meat, a vital necessity, nearly extinct species of humanoids) who move from town to town looking for virgins to feed in order to maintain life. They came across as quite normal people of higher classes, except that they are secret lovers, and cats are roaming around the house, day and night. Cats are deadly for them, so they set traps in their backyard to try to reduce the population. We see them break their necks pair when attacking (which is also the first film in my experience) - I hope that none of the rights of the cat was not hurt in the making of the film. The boy asks a cute girl to fall in love until she turns into a "moonlight" and then just wants her body. The film has so many unique uniqueness that might have been better if it was totally satirical comedy about life in the suburbs, but the director instead trying to scare you every few minutes until you want to run over and speak up. In the end, this happens and the film turns to the typical Stephen King. The film is interesting because the King's humor comes more than usual, but his strangeness is very present and what you have is a film that his fans will probably love you and you should have in your collection, or as a worthwhile movie experience is not cut.
