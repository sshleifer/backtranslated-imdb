Seeing the hot Eliza Dushka in a pretty good Vrong Turn, I decided to pick up this, instead of Return of the Living Dead, of all the movies. I have not seen it yet, but, given that it is one of the most appreciated horrors, I'm sure I made the wrong choice. There is simply nothing to recommend this movie, and I'm talking about an allegedly superior killer. He did not even have a youthful sexual attraction of central to bad films as I knew what you did last summer or Valentine or an urban legend. It just did not make sense, there was no excitement, he had very little interesting acting or impressive writing. The publication date seems to have been postponed many times in about a year, and the reason is obvious. A whole movie appears as a bunch of meaningless scenes that are collected by chance, to a meaningless effect. Instead, you get a wrong turn, if you want to see Dushka. I would like to see a movie with her and great hot Elisabeth Harnois - but I do not think it would make this film visible. Casey Affleck, so promising in Good Vill Hunting, is terrible here - he seems to lack intelligence and courage. It's enough of this.
