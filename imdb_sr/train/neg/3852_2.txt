Was this one of the most lonely films I've ever seen? I do not know why? It's just a story about a guy who's about to get married and start to love someone else. The story is told thousands of times. Nothing new or innovative about it. I do not know what was in this movie. Most of the time when such actors / actors gather to make a movie that has already been made a million times before, it's really fun. There are usually a few smart things in them that are not really anything else. For some reason, this just does not keep your attention. In it you can choose some funny things, or smart ideas, but for some reason they just are not ridiculous or smart in any way? I'd like to explain something new, right? Just do not waste time on this?
