** Can contain spoilers ** The man in the dash Kong's suit (the same one used in KING KONG GODZILLA in 1962) gives many lafs in this ridiculous monster movie. Kong has risen to the island of Mondo and helps this hero and other good guys this time. The vampire villain is called Dr. Vho ?? - Funny, it does not look like Peter Cushing! Kong finally refutes him with pride and joy, a huge robot monkey that looks like a bad metal sculpture by Magilla Gorilla. Like many Honda shifts, this may have had some merit before the American audience did it and added new recordings. Rankin / Bass animation had a hand in this mess. They should have top-quality children's programs such as The Little Drummer.
