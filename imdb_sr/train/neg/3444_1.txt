This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. From the plot, although shootings, "special effects," acting, and did I mention the plot? Every thing in it is exhausted! This is a good example of what "overweight" means and I will try to explain: I understand what the creator of this film was trying to; This should have been one of those films you can not say. You sit hypnotized, not knowing who is dead and who is alive, and who killed someone and why, and only when you think you're right on time, you find out that you are wrong and the film ends - leaving those open mouths for the next 5 minutes! Something like "Unbreakable" or "The Job" if you know what I mean. But Olga Levens, the writer of this garbage, yes, Olga ?? Writer, director, producer, script writer, Caster, production designer, art director, costume designer and also double for one of the characters are some scenes ... this is basically a woman film and when it comes to Olga Levens from "Levens Productions" you can not go wrong :-) Well, this could be shocking, but "this time" Olga has done this great time, jumping from scene to scene, from dream to reality ... but wait! it was still a dream ... or was it ??? The picture was pale and I realized that none of this happened, the girl was alone on the boat ... there was actually no ship ... no waiting! It's a boat again, and guys! You live in! Thank God! No, it's called to join a cruise ... but then the ship disappears and maybe still dead? or maybe they were never alive to start with? If you understand what I just said, you may like this movie - it's a boring job and the only reason I remembered this whole shit is to find out how the hell can end this film ... Do not watch this if you appreciate the time, 90 minutes is a waste in this case ...
