This was simply terrible. I read this book for school, I made it on all tests, and I see it this way! My teacher forced me and another 20 people to watch her, and that was worse than Leonard 6, Plan 9 from Outer Space and Hudson Havk together. What made this movie so horrible was enough reason to want to kill. First, it was created at Hallmark. Secondly, the acting was terrible. Thirdly, it was completely different from the book. Literally, it was so bad that I asked to apologize. Basically, I'd rather watch Basic Instinct 2 than watch this. Take my advice, do not watch this movie. Nobody would like to see this. It was scary. HORRIBLE!
