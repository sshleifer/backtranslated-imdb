Villiam Hurt, diving scientist ??? US agents are investigating abroad? A sickly contaminated man kicking his ass after falling 20 feet on the back and running? The sniper disappeared and he did not kill Hurt (only wounded him), but the other "killed" the shot dead? Waste of time. To compare this with a fall, as did other reviewers, it's ridiculous. By the end of the film, they decide to wear gloves on their hands, except for the "evil" agent, and Hurt decides to kill him by giving him "viral handling". What? BTV ... when IMDb demanded 10 rows of text? I'm just messing around here. Does not this only dilute the content of the review if you are asked to have a number of lines?
