I had to stop watching this film (a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious filmmakers) twenty minutes into it because it was central and boring enough to inspire yawning, not to mention that I was soon close to tears because of the $ 3.99 I was spent on the Blockbuster. The actress Joanne Pacula and her terribly derived Slavic accent are scary enough to get stuck on their teeth. I knew two hours would be too much. Both Breuer and Nietzsche play the undeniable actors of a stunning little talent. While we are on the subject of talent, Breuer's supreme assistant seems to have been pulled out of the local acting troupe. She obviously did not learn her craft. In fact, it's really terrible. All public scenes looked gradually, with accessories that mechanically walked in Sunday's best release. Turning this movie off was much more pleasing than inclusion. Do not rent this horrible movie. You'll be sorry that you spent your money.
