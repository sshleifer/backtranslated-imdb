All I can say is that I am glad to have socks while I was watching a movie, or I would be very angry that I spent 2 hours of my life. The acting was terrible, the plot was even worse. There were some scenes that were supposed to be serious that my husband and I laughed out loud. I recommend this film to people who like to work their own version of MST3K.
