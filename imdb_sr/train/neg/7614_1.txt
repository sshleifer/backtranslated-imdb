This may be one of the worst films ever made for production. 1. The most exciting part is the beginning, where the man walks ... and walks ... and the walk (spoiler). There is only 15 minutes walk. How? 2. Not to mention that there are many problems with lighting, and almost as if they even recorded night scenes during the day. 3. The acting was TERRIBLE. They seem to have found a community theater (in Mexico) ... and then took people who were rejected. If you know someone who owns, apologize to them. The director should be punished through the war crimes tribunal for having done it to the public.
