I remember seeing this movie another 86 'when the first time came out and what a horrible movie. The acting was terrible, the plot was so weak that it should or should have gone into the air. I think it was sleeping on more than one occasion and I was not tired of remembering. Please avoid at any cost even better for all your teeth to be removed without anesthetics because it would be more fun. It's just a pity that I could not give him a zero or a negative rating. I wish I did not spend my money getting this from the video shop all I can say is that the tape on which she was still new is practically barely surprising because the film was so bad. If I remember well, I sat and watched him with the girl I really wanted to come with and the fact that she was sitting next to me was still not enough to keep me awake, how bad this film was.
