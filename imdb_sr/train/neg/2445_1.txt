Hello, can anyone hear me? I do not know why you came to this site, but if you are a colleague watching this movie: join the fan club! This film was so incredibly bad that I could not stop laughing when I saw it. I think it's safe to see it, it's bad in a nice way. Any clich√© ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here. I'm afraid it's hard to get a copy of this movie, but it should be in the top 10 worst movies ever recorded.
