I'm beginning to write this review during a break while I watch a movie. This is the first time I try to do this, but I have a problem to go through this without intermittent interruptions. This is not because it is intense, but because it's bad. Almost painfully boring and unbelievable, especially when supernatural robust dying brother Rian (Colm Feore) on the screen is tragic and vicious, self-indulgent and self-pitiing. This would be a much better movie to leave that character out of the story. It adds nothing but cat, maudlin, very irritating melodrama. Maybe somebody decided that if they fail to convince Ryan to make it offensive. The problem is: Who cares if a spoiled, cowardly, sullen dick dies? Not me. The only thing this character has for him is the fact that he is dying, and I'm sorry, but that's just not enough. Dying does not make anyone special. We all die, sooner or later. He does not give anyone the right to expect sympathy while acting like a jerk. The other two characters, and the actors who act (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah), are very large. more interesting, and their story, without Ryan's self-causing interruptions, would make a much better movie. But it's not over yet, and it's time to press PLAI again. Perhaps something great happens before the end .... No. Sorry. This rented turkey is back tonight!
