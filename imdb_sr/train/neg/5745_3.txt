The film was the winner of the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1990. Over the past few weeks, I've seen dozens of nominees and recipients of this award from the past 30 years and I really think that this movie could be just the worst of all - but it was not just a candidate, but it won! I guess 1989 was a terrible year for this genre. The film shows a group of characters that look a bit like a super-skinny Uncle Festers. They seem to be simple articulated figures that move through stop motion animation. They are all identical - with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their back. They all stand on a large platform suspended, like magic, in the universe. Each of them has a pillar and their box on the platform. The platform begins to lean forward and people move in an attempt to balance the platform. This takes longer and longer. The only relief from this boredom is when one of them seems quite nasty in the end, but it just is not enough to watch this fun at least. Apart from transient stop motion animation, this short movie does not offer anything interesting to me .... NOW. By the way, the big short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why he was not among the nominees. It was VERY short and was much better than any nominated one year or a year earlier. Perhaps the success of Picard in previous years has resulted in prejudice against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so ridiculous that it seems almost ignored by the crime. Can Picard not enter? This seems unlikely.
