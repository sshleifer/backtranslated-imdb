This is a film of tired, even strange, childish clich√©s. Is there a Nazi master who performs SF-related experiments in the basement? Please, please! For the purpose of a perplexing sense of horror and fear, the overall impression of the film is a very immature concept of fear. Without previous expectations, I remain: the old Xander from Buffy and the heroine with a monkey face that does not seem to know how to behave. He told Adrienne Barbeau that I had only met before in the much more enjoyable "Cannibal Women in the Avocadian Jungle of Death".
