Ah, the infamous "Guinea Pig" series ... I must sincerely say that I'm completely disappointed with this whole series ("He Never Dies", "Siren in the Shaft", and "Flower of Meat and Blood" are exceptions ... a even they are not in any way big ... ", but" The devil experiment "is just ordinary punches. There is nothing realistic here, except for the climatic (or perhaps anti-climatic, depending on how you watch it) the scene of the eyeball It seems that the victim does not care what is happening and barely squeals or sneaks while she has been subjected to "terrible" (often "hateful") torture "The flower of meat and blood" is a more violent and bloody depiction of the false snuff material, but this film also falls to the level of realism. I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they have indeed gone a long way in the past two decades to carry the crown in the "extreme" movie, but "The Devil's Experiment" simply does not support it. It's worth a look if you're stubborn, if not for other reasons, but to see what that noise is, but I can give this movie an extremely generous 3/10 and it's just for the needle through the eyes of the scene ...
