You ever sit through the movie and after everything is over, it's like one big "vtf!?". Welcome to Decoi. Another flick for food for video action you can immediately forget that you watched or not even better watched. Peter Veller and Robert Patrick are stars and are quickly decaying in this quick action, where the story is pretty bad, and the action is bullshit and what is the purpose of watching the action as the action takes place? Robert Patrick is particularly hitting a new string in an action series that shoots him from a machine gun while standing on the hood of a mobile school bus. Co-stars are the ambience of Charlotte Levis and Canadian Scott Hilands (TV Night Heat glory).
