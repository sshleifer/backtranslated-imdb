I just had evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A crowd of children, aged 14 to 22, was put on the DVD "Titanica" on a fantastic top mega screen. Only two of them have seen it before. But everybody saw so many moments of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion that most of them felt they saw the whole movie. Shortly after the epic began, they began to be disturbed, some of them left and asked others - "call us when the iceberg appears." Over an hour and a half in the movie, only two girls who watched the movie before were are still there. They started shouting: the iceberg, the iceberg. A stampede followed, they all returned to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat open their mouths, emitting Ohs and going out a long way. So, just like I thought when the movie first came into the scene. What is this? Waiting for an hour and a half waiting for the damn thing to sink, but what about the rest. For example, Doctor Zhivago had a similar time, but think how much that movie is going on in the same time period. In the "Titanic," Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands, supposedly, cream de la creme in the first-class dining room of the ship. See historical details if you can find them. The story is so thin that it has to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that should sink. Real sinking here are film standards. All efforts are focused on special effects and the final opening week. The film has become the most successful film of all time so, what do I know?
