What a horrible movie. A spoiled tomato also had a good rating. do not be fooled by positive comments; It was not terrible. It was not funny. It was not smart. He will not even keep your attention. I just spent 2 hours of my life watching this shit-fest. Computer-generated monster was interesting to see the first couple of times. After 15 minutes she did not have any more fun. the dialogue was terrible, it must be translated. Another negative that has stood out is the idiotic Americans. They were introduced and all were without character, intelligence and judgment. Now I will write several lines to add this because we need to have 10. The employees in the video were supposed to scoff at me for putting this title on the counter.
