This movie makes "American Pie" a sophisticated movie! No additional comments are required. Humor is cheap, dialogues are stupid and actors are unpleasant. Each clich√© is used several times without any original plant. And what's worse, the film turns out to be more Catholic than the pope. It's so sad.
