In his own way, Mister Foe (originally, and more appropriately, called Hallam Foe? I do not see the addressing of his title character as "mister", is a tribute to good acting.) And Jamie Bell, like Hallam, physically attractive voieur / creep, and Sophia Miles , as well as Kate, his partner in sexual and fantasy romance, are convincing.The problem arises when you try to link their roles with everything that happens in real life. A young man spying on the intimate details of people's lives in the way that Hallam works, deserves be beaten to pulp. And a woman in Ke The situation would have been rejected and scared - it would probably call the police. These things, however, are not what is happening in the film. Poor Hallam's mother died, and the father married the woman with whom he had Halam, of course, hates his stepmother and let him know he has sex with him Kate is a person who hires Hallam in a dishwasher and plays sex games He looks like his mother It ends up happily when Hallam solves "their" problems ". Forty years ago, a piece and a brilliant acting "Who is afraid of Virginia Voolf" had a similar optimistic ending, while the characters became wiser and better after separation. The trouble is that it does not always work, especially when no one really cares. In Virginia Wulf, the end is acceptable because of the intensity of emotional discovery. In Mister Foeu, emotional discovery never happens.
