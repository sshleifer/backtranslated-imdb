If you have not seen a gong shov TV series, then this movie will not appeal to you, not knowing that the series makes this movie great. I give her 5 out of 10 because some things make it fun that helps make up for her obvious problems. 1) It's a funny shooting time in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 2) You've got a lot of funny comedy people you've seen on the show. 3) It is interesting to see Chaka (host) when he does not work on television. 4) You see many bizarre people doing all kinds of freaks as you see in a TV show. I will not list all the bad things because there are many, but here are some of the most prominent. 1) Movie Gong Shov has many real videos that are tired of the movie. 2) The story line of the film outside the segments of the cut is very weak and essentially consists of only one point of plotting. 3) Chuck is actually half-decent as an actor, but most other actors do a typical way through the 1970's artillery. It's a good movie to watch when you do not have an hour and you want to watch it all at once. Watch 20 minutes by the time and it's not that bad. But it's not that good then. ;)
