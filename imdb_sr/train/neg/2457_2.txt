Some people do not like animation. Personally I think the animation was pretty noticeable when this film was finished. There are many older cartoons I love. My problems with this movie are not animation, but basically the way it's designed. The characters are all just ... well, stupid. And for this film they should not be. It is obvious that everyone in LOTR has a problem with limping (for starters). My two sisters and I laughed through most of this movie. I think that if many people see this before they see new ones, they would not leave. I'm glad to have rented this and I did not buy it. There are several movies that give me a headache. This was one of them. However, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, although it's there. Or down there, depending on your view.
