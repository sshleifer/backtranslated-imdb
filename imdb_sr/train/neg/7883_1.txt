A cover story and a very hidden imprint The Power of Prayer has prompted me to rent this film. It started very well and pulled me in. Between 1/3 and 3/4, the film began to throw things that were not set up and make no sense. My first thought was: "This was not written by someone who knows how to tell the story." I finished watching the parts of the film again, thinking that I missed something. When I arrived to the last 1/5 film, it was a DIRECT DIALOG that did not make sense, did not say anything, and it was unpleasant to listen; I turned off the sound and accelerated to the end. Do not waste time with this movement. . And I'm Catholic.
