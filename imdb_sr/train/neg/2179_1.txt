I just wanted to watch it and have fun with the total badness of the movie. I saw this movie through the useful sarcasm of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have a DVD. If you move to the other side of the DVD, they show the real movie, so I gave it a chance. Seriously, people this is a grill cheese. Acting, special effects and complications are generally very Syrian and unrealistic. "Do not they need lungs," Crow said, noting that the head still could speak while there was no body, and Tom Servo simply observed "No, she has neck juice!" The ending is just classic and nobody can touch it with K-Porn! I loved the "cat fight" between two strippers. This "Mijau" after the fight or the scene, whatever, was classical. So, in a way this was a fun movie. I think you'll probably enjoy it for horror fans. For a good time, watch MSTK3 version, you will get a great laugh. MST3K version: 10/10 Brain to die: 1/10
