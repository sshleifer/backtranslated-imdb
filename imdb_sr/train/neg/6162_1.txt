"Smokey and the Bandit" is not exactly Shakespeare, but then no one wanted to be. It was a slackstick, but he had a brain. He had a very smart script with characters that can be defined and fun final work. People came out of the theater smiling. "Hooper" does not give any of this. There is no reason to smile. If it should be a tribute to the Hollywood stuntman, it seems to look terribly lazy by not providing anything but a poorly choreographed battle scene and one of the most amazing jumps I've ever seen. Everything looks fake, poorly shot almost intentional. Poor Salli Field (as a hand-hugging girl) gets the weakest role, with no ridiculous or smart line ("If you make that jump, I will not be here when you come back"). Burt Reinolds is constantly looking at the camera and hinting, but a joke is for every audience that goes through the "Hooper". * from the ****
