That there were no bad dialogues and scenarios. I mean, the line was really in touch with his topic. The actors worked well to bring their characters to life. But in the end, the thing that really lacked was a solid script that held all the pieces together. I suggest you do not watch this. Unless you are an Al Pacino enthusiast like me and I'll watch everything he's playing. This, after S1m0ne, is another very bad movie for this actor who once knew how to choose the roles.
