Slaughter High is essentially your symbolic filmmaker. The joke comes out of his hand leaving a strange man awfully burned. A few years later the geeky guy is back and starts killing people who have hurt him. Now the story could sound intriguing and very fun, but what makes this horrible movie so different from the rest of the 80's millers is that it has some humorless flaws and bugs below. however, it is not really as bad as it would have been assumed. Although this does not help every character in the movie is so embarrassing and unpleasant. Leadership, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is easily the greatest torturer of all of them and she is the one we supposedly need to share compassion and root. Not to mention, the geeky guy is almost too geeky and I think even stereotyped geeks themselves will be roughly maddened and only utterly antagonized as geeki his, so when he gets mauled, does anyone really care? There are many unintended potential for laughter. Munro's lack of acting talent is quite obvious, which puts him at the same level as the rest of the horrible actor. However, the funniest is when the film is badly trying to present Munroa, who was 30 years old at the time, as a teenager among teenage actors. And then, when it comes to later life and Munro is playing around his real years, other actors do not pass as adults. All this goes well with a thematic song that hilariously poses a heavi metal thrash accompanied by a maniacal laugh and a voice screaming "I'll catch you." With these words, Slaughter High is really not a good move, but it has a bad party. Perhaps important for hardcore slasher fans, but do not expect a dilemma, uncertainty or any credibility. Horrible !!!
