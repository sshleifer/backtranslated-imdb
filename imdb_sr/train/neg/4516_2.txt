I bought this DVD set, a scene unseen and I wish I did not. Scenarios had to be seriously rewritten because it seemed completely devoid of any sense and pale in relation to the book. Lighting is terrible, very uncomfortable, but if it was just that, I could have overlooked it. The script does not focus enough on characters ... there is hardly an introduction to different characters, which makes it difficult to distinguish who (especially in airplanes - has no idea who will die when). I have long felt that the key to a good film is that the public takes care of the characters; if you do not, you have nothing. They did not focus on characters at all - you never knew them - who they were, what they liked ... what made them do what they were doing. The series is 5 hours long and divided into 6 parts ... I bet you wonder what they did all this time if they did not describe the character in detail - put a lot of stuff in it. I'll say at least one hour spent watching watching them dig and take off in their planes LOL (I think it's really necessary to constantly see it again). I would give this much higher rating that they just improved our knowledge of the characters.
