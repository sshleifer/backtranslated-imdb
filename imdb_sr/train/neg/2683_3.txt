Have you ever wondered what would happen if several characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai prison? If so, this is your movie. This is Midnight Express for the MTV audience. That would be fine, but the story was badly done. Strong coils, bad dialogue and unresolved problems abound. This lightweight movie did not deserve the right to be so mysterious as it ended. Potential spoiler and incredibly absurd line - the tension filled at the moment when the hotel employees find out that the girls do not have that room and throw them out. (This moment is inadequately played with the same gravity and gravity as the moment they were arrested on a target). Later the same employee of the hotel was somehow found - and Bangkok is a big city, I think I was there - and testifies against the girls, as if a couple of free Mai Tais guarantees 40 years in prison. Come on. Instead, rent another day in paradise.
