SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: Gettavai is mainly an action movie. And what is the action !! Shootouts, chases, dumpsters and more. These are Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as Mc Coi's. chemistry. But the film did not do it for me. Gettavai became very strenuous. The plot overshadowed a fight / chasing after another and how violence continues to accumulate, Bassenger and Baldwin retain their great looks regardless of the dangers they may be in. the start. I do not think Bassinger's eye makeup moves once throughout the picture. This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, especially not, but it's not very good and if it's not a Puffy Action Movie I do not see the real enjoyment in this movie because there's not much to do with it. Getaway is not terribly genuine, and he goes from unnecessarily brutal to rather boring. I think it's really better. Bassenger and Baldwin give good performances, but they do not have much to do but to chase them and run for their lives. Sometimes it is less, after the same thing is seen over and over again, it becomes stagnant. I did not enjoy this much.
