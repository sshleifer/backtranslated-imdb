About twenty minutes in this movie, I was already bored. Simply, these characters were pretty boring. Occasionally something would happen, but then things would slow down again. Luckily, my patience was eventually rewarded, and the ending of the film was not at all bad. However, this was by no means good enough to justify sitting in the first ninety minutes. So, I would say that the film was the central overall, and given all the talents in the actors, I would call it a disappointment.
