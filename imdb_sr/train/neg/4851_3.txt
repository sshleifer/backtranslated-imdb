watch a team of Iraqi bomb disposal experts counting their time before they leave home. That sounds boring in itself. Every time that small inscription appeared that told us how long they had gone, it only caused this film to be complicated and withdrawn. Hurry and finish your time there so that we can all go home. Must be missing something. I'm a big fan of war films if they're done well. This had a "jarhead" syndrome. A film that was sometimes beautifully filmed, but cinema does not prevent it from being completely boring and meaningless. they could save money and only get footage from any other movie with a gun in it. I had no empathy for the main guy in him, I was always hoping his negligence would cause him to die. In fact, the movie would do much better if he had it. I read some reviews and it seemed that I had the feeling that those who were in the armed forces do not like it, and everyone else likes it. I've never been to these forces, and I'm with them. Pretentious. 3 stars are for cinema.
