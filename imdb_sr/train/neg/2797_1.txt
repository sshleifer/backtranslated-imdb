I'm the main fan of the horror genre! I love horor / slasher / gore flicks of all kinds. Some of my favorites are really "good" bad horor flicks. But this film has nothing to justify watching! I will not spend much time talking about anything that is wrong. The script is terrible. The acting is terrible. FKS is not worth discussing. "Set" is absolute JOKE !! The sad thing is that I think it could be some real potential in several actors, but this vehicle left NIS to work with. and I feel I'm being robbed !! The time you've wasted watching this would be better spent on flotating your cat.
