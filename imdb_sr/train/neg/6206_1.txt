Thomas Clai mixed with the wrong types. This is the problem of young people these days, they have no respect. Seriously, this film should be avoided at all costs. The action in the main body of the film is slow and quite dull and raised to a drug that ends up as if, as its director, where it is better to go. We met with the main title character who is a little outsider, we see him at school and does not fit at home, he feels awkward in himself, as many adolescents do. Robert enters the bad guys and starts to miss school and takes drugs, and before he realizes it, he is a psychopath. The film is in fact Clai's complete failure in understanding the links between images of violence and violent actions. . Clay seems to think that the generation of crazy young people has been made a wreck by the scenes of war on our televisions. yet he recorded the most troublesome piece of SIMULATED violence. Is this guy real? If Clai did not see the video, maybe he was naive and not aware that he would be done with a brutal scene from his movie? All that anyone wants to see is the most horrible scene from the end of the film, and I'm sure it will be what people keep. The rest of the film is pointless in the conduct of such a violent film in the film Glina, not only for young people who are actively involved in the prevention of war, but also curses himself as a perpetrator of extreme, insulting violence without better reasons than his personal status of personality. Shame for everyone involved.
