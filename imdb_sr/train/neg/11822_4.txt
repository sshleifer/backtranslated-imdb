I thought Harvey Keitel, the young, fresh from the Sean Pistols John Lydon, then as a bonus, the music of Ennio Morricone. I was expecting an old school, a sharp Italian policeman who was filmed in America. Istead, I got a story about the disturbance that never made sense and the movie that left me saying: VTF !!! Too many questions without response, and insufficient action. The result: a potential cult classic was washed in the toilet. Keitel and Lidon work well together, so maybe Kuentin Tarantino can reconnect those guys with a better script. Oh, and Morricone's result: OK, but not unforgettable. All in all, there is no waste of time, but not "must see" unless you are a hardcore Keitel fan.
