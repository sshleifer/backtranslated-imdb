So, this guy named George sitting alone at his birthday party when two women appeared. George's wife is in the hospital and worries about their son, and when a woman leaves, George enters the bathroom and leads love with both of them. It's not a great scene because it really does not show anything. After that, the boy wakes up the next morning and the girls are still in his house. He gives him a good breakfast, but George is not hungry. George is not very happy and tries to throw them away, but when he gets home, the girls are still in his house. The girls had enough with old George and they do not want to cook for them anymore. They both appear to be great psychopaths and use George in their crazy game. I liked the fact that the girls just did what they wanted and messed up George's house. George was not so good for his two guests. When George said that he was a married man, it does not seem to matter. George looked like Tom Tucker at the Familia Gui. I was two girls all the time.
