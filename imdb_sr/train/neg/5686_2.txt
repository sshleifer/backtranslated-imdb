Hello. This is my first review for any movie I've seen. I went through trouble by doing this to tell everyone that this is literally the most distasteful film I've ever seen. I feel like the film is made of pores, which I will give a little understanding because of the budget constraints I make. I felt like I was watching a very bad remake of the movie saw. As far as I agree, I saw that it was very graphic, but, as the film saw. the most exciting scene I've seen. The scene lasted for almost forever, but in fact, it probably was about 5 minutes, but still. I want to mention that I love some horror films and I give credit if they are good. this director is hurt, and his group of people who used this movie should consider before making another similar to this. final final note haha ​​!! FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO ENJOY A BEATIN BEAUTY TO DEATH, RETURNING ROTS, WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN, AND THAN 5 MINUTES OF SOME SPEAKS, THROUGHOUT THE HEAD OF MOMENT, then you will enjoy this film, if not, and you will love horror. , go with a higher budget movie, as you have seen for example. I can not believe people make such films. Anyway, I'm sorry anyone who loves hurt and got it in the heart, this is just my opinion about the movie.
