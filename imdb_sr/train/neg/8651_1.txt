For the first 15 minutes, I looked at thinking that this was a real documentary (with an irritably overly dramatic producer "on the camera"). When I realized that all this was set up, I thought, "why would I want to spend my time watching this garbage?" That's why I turned it off and I came to warn other people. Characters do not act in a convincing way. too immature emotions. To travel some half of the world in a war-torn country, he acted as a child. and I do not believe it was because "his character was so upset about the bombing at the shopping center". Very loose and stupid. Have you seen the "city of lost children"? A French film about a dark fantasy about a kid who kidnaps children and steals their dreams ... I liked it!
