This film is a perfect illustration of how to not record a sci fi movie. The worst tendency in a science fiction fantasy is to make your theme a terrible, a sophomore, pseudo-orwellian / hackloves / vitriolic "vision" of the "human future". Film creators of science fiction (and authors), like geeks, are taken very seriously in view of the high ratio of their genre. I think that other genres with the high CTGSR (yes, I just invented, I abandon), as a horror or action or even a romantic comedy, seem to have a better understanding of the fact that they do not change the world with some deep "messages." /> Sci fi can certainly be successful at a serious level, as many large filmmakers have proved. However, there is a huge lack of the entire concept, which represents "Robot Jok", with its low rent of the "future" (a unique good design element: bizarre, smooth advertising at all places encouraging women to have more babies) and his painfully heavy "Ilijade" parallel (he's called ACHILLES for BOG'S SACKE! I actually did not pick up this until I saw the movie for the tenth time, but I went public, of course, so filmmakers are not released.) Of course, if you're a crazy movie freak like me, this defect has a big front . I absolutely love such films, because bad films are often more entertaining, and sometimes more interesting than good ones. That's the kind of Lester Bangs approach to watching movies, I suppose. Note: The leadership in this movie (Garry Graham? Is that his name? I declare that I'm going to check.) It's really not that bad. He does it. It's kind of cool, especially when it's drunk / overturned.
