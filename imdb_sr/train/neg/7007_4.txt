This is a pretty bad movie. The action is sentimental porridge. I guess the production values ​​are fine, decent photography, unobtrusive direction and all that. Mark Hamill was terrible. I never care for him, and this film confirms this perception. No wonder he never had any career other than Star Wars movies. I'll only say "Buh-bie, Mark" as he sinks into a deserved ambiguity. On the other hand, very young Annie Potts stole the shov. She showed charm, beauty and acting heads all in one performance. I remember seeing her in "Tekasville" recently and that I noticed her beauty. It's interesting to see it ten years ago. In any case, unless Miss Potts is interested in you, escape from this film screaming for the hills.
