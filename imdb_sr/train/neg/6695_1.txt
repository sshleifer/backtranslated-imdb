I had something for this Kari fish for some time, and how much she looked in this movie, there is no objection. But after I caught him in HIGH DEFINITION last night, I'm sure: it's the only thing in a movie that's not below the standard. The scenario is terrible, the acting is terrible, the direction is terrible. I saw another comment that someone comments on how sexy scenes were ... what? Not at all. When the film is so bad, you can turn it into softcore pornography, but instead I see some white whites that block me to see Vuhler's body and scenes that offer me nothing but flutter. They only needed to go to the cinema to make the movie a complete waste of time, but not. With a script that was terrible, it was supposed to capitalize on Vuhrer's appearance, as it is a lonely film professional. 2/10, just because it looked so hot.
