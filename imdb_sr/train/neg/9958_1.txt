If you completely like an extremely easy, regressive, self-indulgent, anti-establishment, anti-civilization juvenile, then this is an ideal movie. Very poorly written, with often silent dialogue and endlessly tedious hand-held camera as a whole, this is a film that represents the world with attractive, simplified, maniac expressions: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) are insensitive and fearless at best and the worst predatory monsters. The only escape from the horror of civilization in general is the abundance of primary screaming and infantile regression (literally) in the primitive cave space in the forest, with a utopia that takes the form of rave parties - again, into the forest (natural ...). It shows all the weaknesses of the first movie and more.
