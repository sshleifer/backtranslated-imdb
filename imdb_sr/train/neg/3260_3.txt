Doc Savage: A Bronze Man is a horrible movie. Badly written, overplayed, and simply stupid. That's what's been said ... it's actually a fun movie at some level. This film asks to be seen in a group of abundant supplies of cheap beer. It's one of those movies like "Santa Claus wins the Martians" or "Ior, a hunter from the future" ... so bad it's almost good. If you have the right group of people, this movie is an explosion for watching. It's camping. That's fun. He has a theme for Sousa. If you are looking for a good movie, look for it somewhere else. 3/10. BTW, I heard rumors that some studio explores the possibility of remake ...
