Ascension is actually a step forward in terms of what the original film was in the story and in special effects. Jason Scott Lee is as good as a vampire hunter who seeks the Count himself (if you recall him, he was from Dragon, a story about Bruce Lee.) A far-off Dracula's body from the plate. Diane Neal is good as a woman who steals Dracula's body to find a cure for her dying boy, and Stephen Billington is as good as Dracula. Giving better performance than Gerard Butler, he counted in the original film. Roi Scheider completes the rest of the actors in this film, and he does a decent job as mentor Jason Scott Lee. This is the second continuation in the trilogy and they started well. In the air is whether the last film will close the series on a good note.
