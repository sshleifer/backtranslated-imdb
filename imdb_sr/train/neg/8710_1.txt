I did not see the first two - just the one in England called Primal Species. I do not think I will try to look at them. This is a horrible movie. Terrible acting, bad dialogue, cheap rubber monsters. Everything about that is so bad. Most cute figures die very quickly and leave you with boring people, especially those called Polcak, who is an incredible jerk. No one would survive 5 minutes in the army. It lasted for years, but I was glad when it finally got its head bruised - I had nightmares to survive. The Colonel was also a garbage - all the strange duds and unscrupulous shouts. And the doctor looked and acted as if she was out of pornography. I waited for her to remove her glasses, shake her hair and become a vampire, but she did not. It's a shame that the film would come to life without end. Was not Roger Corman ever making half decent movies?
