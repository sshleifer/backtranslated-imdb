Just PPV this. I do not want to spend too much time on this, because most posters are better than I ever could, but I want to say a few things. I did not know he was more funny: Redgrave chasing little butterflies and stumbling about his sister; A close disdain is that her "precious" boy (whom she and gentleman decided to be a drunken loser) turned into murder; that ton-deaf Ann buried with Peggy Lee; or the terrible CGI guard crypts Annie looking at her younger ones! I never bought Dance as a young Redgrave. I did not even buy Richardson and Collette as sisters. If daughter Meril Streep wants to be an actress, she will give her a few lessons better! I had a zero idea why any girl (or Buddi) would make fools of themselves beyond the senseless people in Harris! Anne's daughters are equally sordid and unreasonable like her, Luc is a retarded lazyman on the crevice, and I did not give a damn about them! Evening gives Chick Flicks a bad name!
