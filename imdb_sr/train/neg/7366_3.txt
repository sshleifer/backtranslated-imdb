What is this F * @ # what I just watched? Steven STOP !! Please! This film is relentlessly bad and stupid. In a bizarre departure from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal is now struggling (apparently) for being "vampire" like "with super-human power. OK? Oh, and their eyes blinking sideways in an inhuman way? Wow! Even in this film, however, to silence the Seagals, the HE is somehow stronger than they are. However, all average people are broken all around him. Come on, I can understand a big street bully or dealer, but these are super-human people. Oh, and understand this, Seagal is going through a brief identity problem, because obviously he and his colleagues in the film think he's Volverine! Oh my GO ... And the worst of all! Yeah, it's worse than that. There is a voice that changes in voice in the middle sentence as we look at his face. They obviously do not sound anything like him and I believe that this may be one of the other actors in the film. It was pure madness. Although I wanted to exclude him, I always watch the movie to the end. This is the lowest time even for direct video movies Steven. Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! Two inches down! Quality of survival? So I guess I'll be honest in that respect. At least some of the special effects were fine, and I like the choice of dresses for actors and actresses. All women were quite attractive IMOs. Still, I also said STILL, it does not compensate for the attacking Ks-Men, Undervorld, (insert your favorite zombie, the vampire movie here) to tear off! The director, writer, producer, SVI should be banned and escaped from the film business. I think I feel the way most people think about Blood Raine (and almost all other Uwe Boll images) about this movie. That's my whole $ 1.00 in this movie. Look if you dare.
