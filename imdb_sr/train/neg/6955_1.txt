I do not see the appeal of this series (which should be sci-fi). It's actually just "to see what the soap operatively happens this week" and oh, Cilonci are involved through flashback. T & A is added to the show. Every time it appears, I'm confused because VTF should be happening. And do not even try to hear me about "storytelling". It is a soapbox with some CGI inserted. This is not science fiction except the original premise. This series is not everything that is made. If you like the trendy, nervous, rude, nervous, unclear work of the editor on the crack, this show could be for you. As it seems that the nerds are bragging about this performance, it is a clear indication that the opinions of the loud nonsense have changed from Picard's LPG.
