I thought it was the right thing to go through this movie. The audio recording was not the best, and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said. There was little movement to move, and often the action simply stopped and there was an extended period of conversations that seemed strange to the movie. These conversations were shifted between family groups and the observer was left to try to put together a common thread that linked them. It's rare that I evaluate the film so low and I do it in this case, because the entire viewing experience left me thinking "so what" and "why I lost my time watching this."
