Earlier today, I embarked on a debate about why so many people complain about modern films in which I encountered an unusual statement: "the development of a character in recent films is simply not nearly as good or interesting as it used to be." Depending on the film (s) in question, this can be attributed to numerous things, sometimes generic special effects and dance Hollywood garbage such as Var Of The Vorlds, but in the case of over-the-top, uninhabitable attempts at social commentary and desperate struggle to "art" return to the cinema, these are films like Dog Dais who are guilty. Usually I have very high tolerance for movies, no matter how boring or senseless to find them (ranging from good, long like Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to those I thought it was painful to sit through la Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West). I turned off this movie for 45 minutes, which is 30 minutes more than I needed. I was not interested in any of the characters and I did not find anything important behind the thin vele unfocused pessimism. In an attempt to say something about the decay of society, this film is very easy to turn into self-indulgence, banality and exploitation in a very sincere sense. However, I have seen many disturbing movies on the same topic, but there are so many better films about depressed, pathetic people (happiness, stupidity, children, fat, narration, irreversible) that actually contain features of great emotional depth and personality. Dog Dais had nothing more than rejection of the eighth grade to society, deciding to ignore every genuine intelligence about the way people actually are, and instead choose to be a boring, horrible and hopeless attempt at "art." This is not the characterization of unknown or smart observation in the waves of society, it's just boring and nothing worth worrying about.
