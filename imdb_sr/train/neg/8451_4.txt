I have to admit that the first half of Sleeper I liked. It looked good, the performance was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. Superior Hollywood movie. But ... No one has mentioned so far (at least in the last 20 comments), when a scene in the courtroom came up, and Brother Pita's figure followed his plan to rescue his two friends, who were rightly accused of murder, felt that He's cheated. This film offended my intelligence. Warning spoilers !! Why did someone accept their false alibi, what does the priest testify about? If these two guys were with him, why not say that during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were a judge or jury member, would you believe? Is it wise to give the motive for the killer? I'm sorry, but in the end, the story is very weak, and it makes me angry. This film had great potential. 4/10
