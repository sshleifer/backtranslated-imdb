This Nashi trip in 1974 was directed by Leon Klimovski, and a flying look at the photos and packaging of the public could lead you to believe that this medieval riot lies somewhere between "the Inquisition" and "Sadomania". Unfortunately no. This is a strict PG affair with pitiful tortures, no nudity and little borders. Naschi (whom I am an admirer) underlines his things as Gilles de Lancre, "Antiguo Mariscal de la Nacion". Unfortunately, he is more a Pantomime criminal than anything else. This film gives us the feeling that we have seen it (and this) all the time before. So strictly for Naschi only.
