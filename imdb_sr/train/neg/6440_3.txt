This was one of the worst Vrestlemania I saw. It simply did not stand out at all. I thought it would be pretty good, but every game seemed to be short. Chris Benoit vs. MVP One of the better games. Benoit wore it. I just did not think the MVP was so great, but Benoit saved this match. Kane vs. Khali Vov, these two guys do not mix. Or maybe Khali and any other living person do not interfere. I'm awfully agreeable. Melina vs. Ashley I am not a fan of women's wrestling. ECV Originals vs. . Really, really disappointing. Edge vs. CM Punk vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardi vs. Matt Hardi vs. Just a big drop, for many people in the ring at the same time. She just did not live. Bobbi Lashley vs. Umaga O.K. not very impressive, but not the worst in the night. Batista vs. Funeral This may have been the best night game. Very, very, very nice to see something good for change. John Price vs. Shavn Michaels I really think this match deserved to be the last. People make the case for Batista against Undertaker, but this match was just as good. I'm starting to get sick of the fact that Price wins on every match. It's getting a little old. Now, I must say, I feel that this match is best for the night, but I'm a big fan of Shavn Michaels, so I'm a bit biased. Batista vs. Tucker may have been better, but I'm biased, so ... I'm sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best night games and most of it remained short.
