I've seen many good Korean films, including trillers and movies with darker tones, but this is bullshit. The director seems to be sadistic, who accidentally persuaded someone to produce some rubbish. The film has no fun value and is not even a thriller. I can not believe that someone really made such a movie. Although the acting is fine, the story and the feeling that it leaves is terrible. I'm sure I will not see the films of this director. It does not make sense to film movies and utter disappointment in thriller moments. All this has a show of scenes with psychopaths who spend drums with badly recorded scenes and show more blood and violence, which makes it exciting. Very disappointing movie and I recommend skipping all the films of this type.
