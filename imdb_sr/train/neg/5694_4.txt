I'll be honest - the reason I rented this movie was because I'm a big fan of Kyle Chandler (especially from the Early Edition). Since a good guy usually plays, I wanted to see him as a different role (out of curiosity). And the intrigue itself attracted me; He wants to be a killer (Toni Greco-a.k., Mr Chandler) must randomly kill a person before confronting his life or, before, the death of a witness who will testify against someone in the "family". The films were nothing like I expected. It was sick, I hated the end (if you saw it, you would know why), and there were so many unnecessary parts. Basically, it was dirty and it made little sense. Yes, it was a mafia movie, and the guns go BOOM. But there's more to the film. This movie acted as if there was no time for details - just to deal with and understand. The acting really made up - James Belushi was pretty fun as "The Rose". Sheril Lee made Angela as convincing as she could. I was most surprised. And Kile Chandler was equally convincing as an awe-inspiring newcomer in the "family". If only the script would justify the actors.
