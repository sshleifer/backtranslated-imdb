It has a great name, but it's and you will not get more than that for your money, in fact the first 30-40 minutes of the movie may seem to you somehow funny, but after that, the story goes from one side to the other without any special reason and you just do not you can understand what is happening until the action is gone. Still, the producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) call him an actor, but I do not think that the way he can be called is anything but overweight !! .... period of time. A little kid playing as his son has no sense in acting, and I believe that it was just a service he did or something because he had no idea what he was doing. For some reason while Radio Casting thought they could do it, but they did not! and sometimes rude cheap humor is so bad that I do not buy it. But, I hope it's as bad as it gets. In order for people to accept these DVDs for a good audience, they will have to offer some food with it, which could succeed. Maca
