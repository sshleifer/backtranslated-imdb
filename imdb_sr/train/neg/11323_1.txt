This film will promote the improvement of the mind. Read a book! It's unbelievable that anyone would think this film deserves time and investment. I saw "B" movies, but the movie "C" was just invented. I did not think that I would ever enjoy the Power Rangers since my kids stopped watching, but I found a video I saw fifteen minutes in "Knights". Productions in secondary schools are better than that, and involved actors should delete this from their resume. Confusion is one of many descriptive descriptions. My roommate, who loves such films, even turned it off. That really needs to tell you something. If you watch this movie, and I like it, I will pray for you.
