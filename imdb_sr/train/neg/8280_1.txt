Looking at this, I've mostly noticed ad placements. DHL, Akuavhite Strips, Rockstar and more. This is one placement of products after another. It is quite obvious how this film got financing. "Actress" Jessica Simpson is funny. Any Dick should not get a job because he plays the same chrome. "Story" is just a background for this very long advertising. I can not believe this movie was even considered for theatrical release. The longer you watch this movie, the more you are embarrassed for everyone involved. The only minor savings are Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, who almost do not get anything on the screen as Jessica's cousin. I'm embarrassed to see the whole thing. I would recommend that this be avoided.
