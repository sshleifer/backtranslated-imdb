This film sounds a bit like: a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend, but with songs and (pretty pitiful) sex scenes! The film is not sure what it wants to be and mostly ends the mess. It's more expensive than most of the films of director Al Adamson, but it's not at the same level as the budgets the spectators expect from sci-fi movies. Actors are pretty bad and unlike most of Adamson's films, there are no former big names or B actors. Some music is fine, but it's easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years.
