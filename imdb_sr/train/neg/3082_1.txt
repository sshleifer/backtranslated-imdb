Lord, what are they THOUGHT? This is your spoiler warning, although I do not think it matters. You will not see this piece of garbage anyway. The group of hand-made dolls is moving in search of a group of really stupid people who go on a really stupid quest to try to kill them, the dolls complicate things by allowing them to live their really stupid fantasies. In other words, the whole thing is really stupid. You know that it must be bad when neither Mike nor Bots can save anything !! And they are not! I know, some of their lines were ridiculous, such as adding the "HIT" and hand comments, but, God, this was pretty sad. SEE THIS PISTON ON THE CRUDE. It IS NOT VALUE YOUR EYES.
