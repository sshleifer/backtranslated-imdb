Anyone who has studied any physics or cognitive science will retreat disgustingly after 40 minutes, as our wife and I did. Uneducated masses can enjoy arguments that give up their hands and absurd "conclusions" (even without a logical reason) from the real science. I am offended by such nonsense presented under the guise of "science". I can only conclude that the writers picked up a book of quantum physics, did not understand a single word, then they looked at the Matrix about a thousand times, and continued to write this film. For example, the crime experiment in Washington was carried out by the Transcendental Meditation Program. A brief search will reveal the science of their methods.
