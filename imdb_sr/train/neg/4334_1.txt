This film had the potential and I was willing to try, but there are so many weather problems that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow is treated like such an idiot. late sixties. Carlit's road was set in the middle of the late seventies. In order for this film to be realistic, it should have been set in the fifties, if not in the late forties. There was no sign of Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), there was no sign of Kleinfeld, there was no sign from Roland that Carlito had allegedly been running in his "heyday". None of the primary characters in the original movie were in this movie. We should believe that Carlito met all these people over a period of several years. Getting to power ends with Carlita walking around the beach talking about retirement in paradise, and that's what he wanted to do. in the original movie. Also, pre-kuel creates Rocco and Earl characters - what should happen to them because they are obviously not in Carlit's Way? It is also difficult to understand how Carlito could have a relationship with the Italians in the original movie, watching Rise to Pover events. Where are Taglialucci in this movie? There are seven years between these two films, and five are spent in prison. It's like trying to put a square plug in a round hole. It is obvious that nobody was interested in telling a good story and being more interested in making some money by making an average gangster movie. and throwing a character named Carlito Brigante in the story. The film had some good moments, but I think it would be better for them to leave this movie to stand alone, instead of trying to bury it on Carlith's way. If you feel that you are determined to see this movie, the only advice I can give is that I do not think about the movie as a linear pre-kuel. Think of it as a spaghetti of westerns with Man Clint Eastwood without a name, in other words two films that have the same character, but they are not necessarily connected to each other.
