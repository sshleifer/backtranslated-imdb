How does a big German TV station broadcast such a mess? It's amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent - Even well-known Gottfried John behaved very badly - especially on the scene of a double murder - how amateur .......! The screen layout is very, very lengthy - maybe it will fill two parts of the movie. Be careful not to fall asleep while watching! The set is obviously often a blue screen, for example, scene on a ship with unreal sea in the background ...! In the German version sound and synchronization are very bad - probably the reason: different languages ​​of the actors - but: other international productions deal with this much more professional. Tip: DO NOT watch - it's a devil's waste of time!
