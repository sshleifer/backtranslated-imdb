I remember this film, exhibitions in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, in a week. Although this may seem incredible, and I can not offer any explanation for this, this film was an exhibition in the theater dedicated to ... the films of art and of great quality (that is, Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Bunuel, and ... Projection of Man ). Few people saw it (happily, no doubt) and no reference to this very boring SF film can be found in the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Peter Nicolas, or the author of the original novel. Very Indicative. I remember that, after all these years, non-stories, many special effects that make funny effects in fact, and nothing more. It seems that in some countries 90 mm is working time. in 77 minutes. Well, that means just a little more pain.
