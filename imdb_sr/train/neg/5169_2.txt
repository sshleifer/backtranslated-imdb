WARNING: I advise anyone who has not yet seen a movie to read this comment. Although I did not see them all, the Hamiltons certainly delivered a little fun, which did not entertain me at all !!!! I thought he was in common with a half-bad acting, a stupid scheme of plot, and a tweet at the end of the movie, which was very retarded, this film was sucked !!! are people who eat other people. Yes ... I noticed that people are not people, not because they are not people, or I do not think they are, OH DO NOT WAIT, YOU ARE NOT YOURS !!! So, okay, did these people kneel, or are they imbreds, or what they are !!!! I mean, maybe they are just "THINGS" who came here to see how people like or have been cannibals that have been eating people for a long time, or maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE !! WHAT WAS IT !!! So if you think Hamilton is good, I ask, why, why, WHY, WHY, why it was so terrible, because To me it was simply terrible !!! One big BOOOOOOO for The Hamiltons !!! Go see Gravedancers, Tooth & Nail, or Borderland for a party of fun !!!!!
