Classical bad people like "The Creeping Terror", "The Mighti Gorga" and "Manos" are equally bad from start to finish. "Hobgoblins", on the other hand, starts badly and gradually becomes worse. When I first looked at the notorious battle scene, I thought this was a really bad movie. I was blissfully unaware that I had just seen the best that this film had. The film draws its most massive nose into celluloid hell during a painfully incompetible "Club Scum" sequence that is an uninterrupted series of one optional joke after another. It is with this film, director Rick Sloan proves that he deserves to be mentioned along with Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors of all time. How bad can a bad movie be? Watch "Hobboblins" and do not ask yourself anymore.
