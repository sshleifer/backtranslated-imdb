While most of the film is very amateurish, the slaughter of basket of slaughter is played, but not untrue. The Kosher law says that the animal must be aware when the blade touches the skin. Kosher's slaughter scene is as well as everyone knows who has seen one, or has seen the Fifth Movie showing cat slaughter, in which the animal's throat is cut, and the esophagus is cut out while still alive, aware and obviously suffering. We must remember that the history was written by the winners. Is it even allowed to even READ that the Nazis were right? Do not they say nothing that the Nazis forbade this corrupt religious massacre, and the Jews are still practicing it today?
