I saw this movie when I was a kid. It's by far one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. Now, normally, I love strange movies, but this was a bit too much. There are not many complications for the film. If nothing else, it starts like Toi Story, where the toys are reviving, and Raggedi Ann and Andy move into the adventure to save their new friend, Babette. From there comes insanity. There's Greedy, the Looneis, a sea monster called Gazooks, and a bunch of pirates singing performances, all of which just became strange. Also, I can not help but feel that Babette is annoying and a bit tearing. She definitely did not help the movie. Now, although this movie did not like me, there were a few sweet pieces. I liked the song of the camel. Although it was a song about loneliness, she had a friendly feeling. Then it was Sir Leonard. While most of Looneis was just crazy, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the most entertaining. King Koo Koo was just a little dirty that caused Dr. Evil as a serious villain. Also, there was the song Raggedi Andi, No Girl's Toi. It was definitely a good song for boys who wanted to behave hard. But, frankly, even these things did not make the film even better. (But remember, this is just my perspective.) Although I personally would not recommend this movie, I must even admit it has its charming moments. You see if you're interested, but only if you're in favor of something "really" unusual.
