What a shitty movie! The worst of the worst! This movie is fun as a dead shot. Non-talented-what-ever-actors, stupid complication. Who wrote this script?! Has there ever been a script for this stupid movie or the director accidentally pressed the recording button on his camera and then decided to make a movie while they were together? Does that mean it's a movie for children or a comedy or what? My friends are younger brothers in the 6th grade, and he and his students did just an amateur movie for their school project that surpassed this film. Simply no excuse for this movie!
