For a killer movie, this is surprisingly boring. Nothing happens, and even when things happen, they do not create any real excitement or interest. The acting is good of the two leading, especially Cassetti delivers excellent performance combining the safety and stupidity of Succo, but the rest of the actors do what they need. The problem is that there is bad writing and the direction and the fact that as a true story is not interesting, Succo is not a unique character, it is not interesting or exciting. Movies of this kind usually try to cause tension or empathy or anger and it does not create anything but a feeling of regret that you lost time watching it.
