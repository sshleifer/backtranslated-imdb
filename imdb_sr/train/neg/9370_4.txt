Although this is not a "great movie", it has something interesting and unforgettable in it. As the second commentary on the film, I saw it in my childhood. It's been thirty-three years since 1952, but I've never forgotten the story or its funny headline title. Look if you have a chance. You will feel like a voyeur of a small city life as it develops through decades. More than any other film, this brings the human face into a historical drama of "progress" in the early twentieth century. He is appealing enough for a young spectator and enough to remember for the elderly. In addition, it is easy to love characters and watch their passage through time.
