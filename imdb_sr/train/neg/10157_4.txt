Slashers ..... so if you love horror, you should certainly see it, otherwise they do not bother. It is absolutely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget, for example it looks like the entire movie was filmed. somewhere in the warehouse, and on several occasions you will see the shadow of the mum bum and the camera, the shadow, believe me, you will not have to look for them. several people decided to go to a show where they must spend one night in a great labyrinth because the three killers are at large and whoever lives in the end becomes rich. Now there is something about this movie that keeps you watching and rarely do you consider it to be a cheap budget horror these days. especially for $ 12,000,000. so in any case, I would recommend that you watch it and make your mind.
