It's not obvious from watching this movie (I therefore recommend that viewers investigate people who show their case in it), but this presentation of the reality of Islam, and its encouragement of violence and intolerance towards all non-Muslims, lacks objectivity, and also completely fails to influence human condition. It is one thing to document that the Qur'an is saying a lot about how a pious Muslim is asked to interact with non-Muslims, but every realist is able to understand that any man who feels like a follower of Islam will disagree and obey all principles and faith and system. There is a reason to call into question many exhibitors, so that viewers must see a presentation with sound skepticism; Do not swallow everything, hook, line and sink, without thinking about your own. One specific, for example, explores the person Valid Shoebat; who claims to be a former Muslim who committed a terrorist act in Bethlehem. There are many wise people in the world who do not believe in any of these claims. I have never even been a Muslim. I never read the Qur'an. I am not a Christian, nor a member of the Faith of Faith. But I'm an intelligent and discerning man. While the film is quite disturbing, in its presentation that some Muslims see their obligation to Islam; I remind you that Islam is more than a fundamentalist view. Just as they are fundamentalists and evangelical Christians, there are also variations in the intensity of beliefs and obligations between Jews and Muslims. When watching this movie, you need to have a shaker for salt. hand. One grain will not be enough, you will need more. Please use your mind and think for yourself, explore what is presented and assess the state of the world and how Islam fits into it based on more than what was said in 98 minutes of video. There is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together, indicating a certain bias. Be your brain.
