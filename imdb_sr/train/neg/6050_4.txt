I just can not believe how many people compare it to the first movie. He moved me to leave this comment! This is only an obvious attempt to cash in on the success of the first film. The dialogue is terrible and nothing like authentic or striking as the original movie. How many bosses do you think go to the dock to see the shipment? The ease in which Doile finds her type is just pathetic. It's as if all the French police just drank coffee until Doile came from America and did some REAL police work. What a joke. Try to go to a foreign city and dig up the biggest crowds at the place with a travel map and some tourist pamphlets. Pathetic. A really terrible sequel, everyone who thinks differently is crazy.
