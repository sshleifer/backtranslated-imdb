This film is one of the worst in the year. The main heroes do not have chemistry and the acting is terrible. Paul Rudd is the only one who has any talent, and the only one who is not boring. I've never watched Desparte Housevives, so I do not know how Eva Longoria was on that show, but she was terrible in this movie. Like he does not know anything about the actor. Everything her character does is a whim during the whole movie, and she can not be b **** and still fun. And the other girl, Lake Bell, shows little emotion and looks like you're looking at the reading cards while reading them. It goes from points A to B with little surprise. So much more could be used with Kate as a ghost. The action should revolve around her and the things she does as a ghost.
