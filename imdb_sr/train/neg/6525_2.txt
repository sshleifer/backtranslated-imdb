I gave this film 2, and although I consider myself a fan of science fiction, this film was very difficult to grasp seriously. It was one late evening at AMC, and I'm glad to see it for free. This film is probably good for a few laughs, but not much more. Special effects are average for a period of time - not terrible, but not great. Of course, now we know more about Mars than we did then, but we can not keep this against this movie. The main reason I did not like this movie is a story. There were several parts of this film that I would like to explore in a little more detail - astronaut injury / condition, City on Mars, a creature in the lake, etc. All in all, the film is similar to the long episode of The Outer Limits of the 60's - along with the raw ending.
