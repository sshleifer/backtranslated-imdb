Eric Rohmer's "The Ladi and the Duke" is based on magazines of the English aristocrat who survived the French Revolution. But it is a stiff affair, with its strange, painted backgrounds and bold conversation tones. In particular, this portrait of the age of terror is almost completely removed from the actual action; in the film, very few ordinary people are seen, and a little chaos, poverty and terror that took place from the salon of the persecuted but spoiled, aristocratic classes. The result is often dull, and ultimately the illumination of the forces that sometimes lead society on the brink of destruction; it's the disappointing film of a famous director.
