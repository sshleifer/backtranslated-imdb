What's there in the sky? Is that an airplane? Is that Superman? Errr, no ?? It's TURTLE!?! You see, that's what's coming from the Cold War! Nothing but bad news and other issues! The Americans smashed a Russian fighter plane somewhere above the Arctic territory, and a subsequent explosion unfolds and literally arouses a giant prehistoric turtle creature named Gammer. He / she is not very friendly, because he immediately tries to destroy everything and everything on his way. Governments that claim they have finally decided to kill an ugly bastard with a brand new and super-sophisticated ice bomb, but Gammer has yet another surprise? Damn turtle can fly! For the first time, this is happening in a terribly grotesque and harsh sequence! Gammer is lying on his back and looks defective when suddenly a fire explodes from his armpits and he rises in the air. How can you not love that? Then, there's also a terrible subgroup of a boring kid who is able to telepathically communicate with the monster, but it just is not interesting enough. Flying turtle, people !! There is not much to be written about this Japanese (and American re-edited) science-fiction effort, except that it is obviously and completely shamelessly seizing such classics as the original Godzilla and The Beast of 20,000 Fatomas. The effects and designers of the monsters are extremely hockey and, unlike the above mentioned films, never succeeds in creating an apocalyptic ambience. The respectable actors such as Brian Donley ("Kuatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") do not know where the film is set, and even the original Japanese scene can not be convincing. Gammer's very own and personalized themed song is pretty cool, so he gets one more point for it.
