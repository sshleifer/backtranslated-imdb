Definitely, definitely the worst movie I've ever seen, no questions! Contradictors of this opinion can claim that this title should not be rated according to the same criteria as others, because it is an independent, low-budget film, but now? Amateurism and scanty innovation is horrifying. Arranging everything that has been said about this film, for example to the mind of a poor acting (when this is bad to take another one to film the scene, damnation), the thing that bothered me most was the complete absence of common sense in the scenario, assuming that such a thing exists during production. There was an obvious absence of dialogue with respect to viewers; the girls changed their personalities several times and seemed to show absolutely no singing about any kind of rationality or even the brain - five relatively appropriate girls against a little female psychopath? just agree with her, why not? The only thing that can be considered as conquest for this title is that the camera does not leave the van at any time, so that the viewer sees everything from inside - which, like the rest of the film, is a good idea performed exponentially terrible. Oh, and by the way, this movie is NICE like Blair Vitch Project or Cloverfield or any other title captured with a handheld camera? This is an effect, not a trait! Used smartly can be astounding, but in this case it is an excuse for inadequate cinema.
