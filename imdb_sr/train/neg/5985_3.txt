This film is just children against the evil genre. Thunderbirds is just a hook for people to see it, but they're almost random in use. The fact that the action takes place on the island of Traci is just a public maneuver. It was interesting to note what the film will look like about the future of London and how the world will fit together. The best part of this movie are some of the lines that Ladies Penelope delivered that are very comical. This provided some relief for those who were expecting a TV series reprise. Saying that 90 minutes have passed in 'fun' and that it might just be worth watching.
