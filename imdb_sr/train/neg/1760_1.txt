This film makes several mistakes. several American actors in Spain and Spanish actors who speak English. English "Spaniards" are fine, but the way the acting is performed seems to be quite disturbing. the dialogue through the entire script is very weak; maybe it was a Spanish script, but inaccurately translated, who knows and who cares. I can only assume that these famous Spanish actors are forced into English, they can be good, but not on this flop. you'll see the movie in the first 5 minutes, it's so pathetic. then it's just bad. a lot of waste of time, lots of necessary UN plots. Oh, did I mention one of Baldwin's in this.
