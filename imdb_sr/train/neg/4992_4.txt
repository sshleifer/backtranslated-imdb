This film is just another average action movie, but it could have been much better. When the pistols came out, they really needed help for choreography. Someone like Andy McNabb - who made that great action sequence in Heat as he moves through the street robbery - would make boring actions into something special. Because the rest of the movie was fine - predictable but viewed - better than you would expect from this kind of movie. Then came the final scene, shov-dovn, the one we were waiting for, but it was like looking at something from the A-Team of the 80's. They shoot wildly, do not hit anything, and run around the house trying to kill each other - the same old, same old man.
