The action sounded as if it were promising. To be honest, I did not watch the whole movie. After about an hour in the film, I had to make a decision. Is this movie worth watching until it's over? The answer was clear NO! It is not a fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from another species without being discarded. Nor the premise that they were persecuted by secret government transplant organs / wolves. It was because the movie was poorly written, the acting had no emotions, and I did not understand a few dream sequences with wolves and bison. When he ran into a zoo with a dog bowl and left them in front of the entrance to the zoo, he said: "If you can not run with big dogs, you do not leave the porch," she ran through my boring mind. Save time and skip this movie. I can guarantee you if you dare to watch it, you will sit there in a tight position, as I have asked myself why someone is spending money, time, energy and effort to make this offensive rage to an American film.
