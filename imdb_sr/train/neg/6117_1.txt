I can not say that this is the worst movie ever made, but I personally think that this is because when it was originally published in cinemas, (1) the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted that we go to see her, and we actually STONE IN LINE to get tickets, and (2) it's still the only "serious" movie I remember where the audience started laughing at a certain moment and actually laughed the movie through the rest of the way. When we reached the infamous (and infinite) scene of the battle with snakes, I think they all gave up. The only positive that I can admit is the noisy location recording. Oh, and there are Bo's breasts, although her acting is so woody that the nudity is illogical and is not worth much more than Plaiboi. The "dramatic tension" in this film is between Bo's terrible acting and the awful direction of her husband. The snake fight must be one of the most incisive "action" sequences ever recorded. However, this is one of those films that are bad enough, it may be worth looking at the level of unintentional humor. Definitely the worst movie I've ever paid to see.
