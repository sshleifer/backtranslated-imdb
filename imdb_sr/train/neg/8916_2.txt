I rented this DVD since I saw it while I was looking for something else. When I saw the title on the jacket, I could not believe my eyes. I read Yalom's book a year ago and loved him, I'm really admiring Yalom's work at all. (I'm a clinical psychologist.) I watched perhaps 30 minutes of this film and I had to turn it off. I'm not sure I can take much more. At the superficial level, missed accents, as others commented, are simply at best hampered and irritated and, in the worst-case scenario, at best. The acting is boring when it needs to be passionate and comical when it needs to be serious. Portrait of Lou Salome is simply frivolous, and brilliant Freud appears only as a schoolboy. I see very little of the spirit of the book that has been transmitted so far. I was hoping to be able to recommend this film to my students. Instead, I'll put them in a book. Imagine.
