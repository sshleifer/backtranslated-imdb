This is a very strange movie ... I'm not sure what it's all about, some N-London ni≈°ani find a quiet little kid in the woods who all believe that some kind of prophecy and somehow makes them all their way, change something in their lives that they usually end up with a catastrophe. The film ended after about 90 minutes, leaving me quite unhappy, almost upset with the senselessness of everything. I do not care about any of the characters - none of them have the chance to adore the viewer. What was the message? Am I mutant? It was too weird. What's up with Runner? Why does Emilio shoot a child? ... it did not make sense, meaningless. Can someone help me understand this mess of the movie?
