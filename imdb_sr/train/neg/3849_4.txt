Debbie Reinolds pops, tangos, and, yes, tapes their way through this ordinary thriller with a distinctly fabricated atmosphere of the 30s. Two ladies, assembled when the sons commit murder, try to survive by running a dance school in Hollivood. The problem is that one of them suffers from neurosis. Can you imagine this thing 10 years earlier with Robert Aldrich, directed by Bette Davis and Joan Cravford ...? Nahh, Bette would never allow Joan so much time to show on her stuff, and I can not imagine Bette Davis in the second role, and dance her heart. This is a purely fake piece of macabre, written by Henri Farrell from the straw (whose idea of ​​a good "shock" is to carry out the mass murder of a group of rabbits!). Not a bit of fun in the whole lukewarm package. * 1/2 of ****
