I have to say one of the worst films I have ever seen. To keep up the storyline they were pretty good, but they were so badly confused. Before throwing, the cast is totally wrong, where did van peeble (crap actor) and puff daddy come out? It seems that Carlito was hanging on the hood and hanging with his real idiots. This film does not do justice to "Carlitos Way". I was so happy that the success of "Carlito's Way" was first released, if I first saw the litter, I would never have given a chance to its version. And, nevertheless, Pacino has supposedly read this story, that it has been a ruthless act. Carlito Way: Power to the top - 10 to 10. Carlito Way - 10 to 10.
