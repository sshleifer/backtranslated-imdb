Råzone is a horrible movie! It's so easy. It seems they wanted to make a movie to show the life of the bobbin. Like Zappa has done just like many years ago. Unfortunately, Denmark has no good young actors. Leon is still a krummernesen native girl, and Laura is just as important as her. Sometimes he puts the soul away from the movie and is destroying the movie! <br /> <br /> Although you should watch a movie. I do not agree that the young man has such behaviors, but I think he can show how he finished, if you leave your son. It is also important to support new companies like Danish films and "Film folket"! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think people should see Råzone. It's not a big movie, but it's a movie that connects with important issues. I think it's important to stress that even if the scenes are violent, the scenes are the best. - Like the end of the gun!
