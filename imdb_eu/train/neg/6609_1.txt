I can not say that Aag is the worst movie ever in Bollywood, I have not seen on all Bollywood movies, but my imagination is good for me. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be an art artistic attempt. In the name of the director, and I think he has been successful in his role. A single A-list actor outside the movie will risk sharing the same billing in the case of all insults that must be filmed. <br /> <br /> But let's not guess the director here, there is no Cinematographer, the first year of the year as it seems to be an amateur film essay. It's a dramatic score to take the next scene. Lighting, which had to hang a cigar with a hand and a bulb on the other side of the bulb, and add cigar to light the burning fire in every scene. And, of course, the actors! Some of them have never come up with new ones, otherwise they would be forgiven here. Aageko actors set together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the reconstruction of the most beloved movie of all time in India. Do not forget that these actors were not forced into this film, A-list and a willing participant, we expect that the public would surely have a great and eager expectation? So Amitabh asks (aside) that other actors really believed that their performances tried to improve the original one? Would Amitabh Bachchan read the script and dirty abomination of a movie that people would remember in their conversation? Do not be stupid, of course, he did not, that's how much money the public can speak about was a demonstration that the actor could walk on. <br /> <br /> I really hope everyone who is in the party is really happy to renew a classic movie really, just to reflect on what everyone who views originals.
