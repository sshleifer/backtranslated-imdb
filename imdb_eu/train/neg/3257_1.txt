After watching the movie, I made the first question in my mind: is it irony or not? After reading some comments about Doc Savage and the comic series, I knew that this film was not ironic. So, the story tells us about the Super Doc in the United States of America, to rescue a South American republic. It looks like a typical story. But this is so realistic that it makes it ridiculous. The final compulsory fight shows the worst martial arts presentation I've ever seen. The movie may be an interesting example for low budget designers.
