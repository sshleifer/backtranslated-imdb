I do not have to waste so much time, because for me, initially, there is no beginning of a movie, the mish-mash mordacle of a borrowing and the footage created exclusively for emotion. He intends to collect the whole mess and call a "Boogeyman" sequel. Literally, 80% of this movie is robbed by the previous "Boogeyman", who apparently did not see the writers of these rubbish because they did not see the actress Suzanna Love get the name of the original character (Lacy). to the right. And to damage the injury, the killer is invisible in the original footage and is visible in the new footage. It seems that the viewers are very stupid. From 0 to 10 and the rating system for the IMDb could have been very low, despite the fact that I have tried and tried to rip money from people I've seen, FEEL HERE!
