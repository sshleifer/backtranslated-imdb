Bad cinema I'm very surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes are associated with something like that. If you're showing a baseball movie and baseball scenes, it's at least a realistic one. Why was people always playing a specific role in games? *** SPOILER POSSIBLE *** And the last scene in the movie ... what's that? In some way, we say that DeNiro has found that some pitch was uniform, and the game is even more underwater underwater ... one of the worst scenes ever ever in sports games. 3 stars 10
