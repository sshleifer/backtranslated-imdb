A soldier is on the side of the road, ensuring that 1 is completing the speed limit (which does his job); Then a woman catches a mother (there is a child in the back seat); Then he says what's wrong and BAM ... they die. Well, that is, I personally thought it would be a good movie. When I was watching this movie in theater, I was with some friends. This was our first night after summer, and we wanted to see a beautiful movie. We all decided to see a suspense / thriller that looked at everyone in a group ... it was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. I was wasting $ 7.3 on a movie card, but I had to sit down with the brain torture. This film started mysteriously and suspensively and I thought "this could be bad" ... I was so wrong. The whole problem of this movie does not make sense; If you miss the story, you're overwhelmed with a "not-so-terrible" story, and you're surprised by the overwhelming mix of this movie. It's not enough to understand it because it is not intelligence, since a man with no brain can understand what this stupid movie is. Right now, I might think "Oh man! I need to see this movie just to see if this person is saying it". PLEASE KNOW YOUR CAPITAL! I'm trying to keep watch over this movie, thinking I'm telling you so badly. Please, people do not make the same mistake, thinking about the potential of this movie ... no. I'm going to give 10 to 10 of this movie (I'd like to give it a zero), and I do not recommend this movie ever, recommended by anyone, I will help you save a lot more sleep. This is a horrible movie.
