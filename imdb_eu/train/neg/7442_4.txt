I'm sorry I was not afraid of this movie. It was so frustrating that I had seen the potential, and all of it fell on the path. Kids! Father! Premonition! So much potential and ziltch! zero, nothing! I've heard everything before. Scary No! I only have to repel myself, when I'm sitting here, than what I can not get in the movie. Is there a man who is writing the image that women are so annoying? Eh? This movie was quite atmospheric. Or, at least, if the director / writer had trouble working. We also had good music added to the tension, if someone tried it. I want to know why they get the money? Give me and save all this difficulty. Left ... We do not betray him
