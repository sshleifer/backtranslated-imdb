I saw this movie with my 17th year. daughter We emphasized the matinee, because I'm not close, but I felt it. NASCAR is a spirit-dreaming sponsor. It is more serious advertising, it will almost become an information merchandise, if it were not so-called. Traditionally, the story of the franchise Herbie continues with a cheesy line, the car is just a car (for no movie without punishment) for a movie star. Earlier Herbie's (even cheesy ones) were serious, to dig a little bit more. Mrs. Lohan, the main Queen of Disney's drama, has little acting. I was surprised that Keaton and Mr. Dillon would join this project. The only snack bar, ripoff was bigger!
