Most of the plot details in this movie are not illogical and seem to be. The authentic, dead and dull human story does not look like it. It's a Hollywood parody, a parody of the Denzel Washington movie, slim and focusing cameras, racist stereotypes, famous personages that are totally unnecessary and comic bookmarks and gestures. The significance of living in the name of the names consists in responding to the meaning of the population. The only good thing about the movie is the funky song and the funky song. I feel like an idiot for watching this, save yourself.
