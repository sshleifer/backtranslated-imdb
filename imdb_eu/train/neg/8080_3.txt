I was looking forward to this movie because it is Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But those expectations fell on the ground in the first 20 minutes. Palance was ridiculous. Neither Heston's performance nor the beauty of Annabel Schofield (or even naked scenes) can save this movie. Some of the space effects were pretty good, but others were cheesy. The land was playful. Science fiction fans should also skip this. F level
