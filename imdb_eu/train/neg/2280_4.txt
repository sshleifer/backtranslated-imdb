It is trying to capitalize on the nature of the business for the success of others. Here we took a film from the previous 'Dracula' (1931) and 'Frankenstein' (1931) - a German town, the heads of the town think that vampires (bats) have been the last deaths. Bloodless victims Although filmed in Universal (and Bronson Caves)! It's a row of poverty; It is not correct to compare them with previous films, with higher cost and high-quality films. <br /> <br /> He was the most famous and exciting talk by the main titles (ie, Mischa Bakalienikoff). But the well-made initial sequence, Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, will give you a good 30-year mystery. Unfortunately, it does not happen. That is disappointing. <br /> <br /> We get a little bit more than the element formula of these films, but with a slow step, with a small budget, not enough Dwight Frye, the forgotten presence of Maude Eburne (aunt Gussie) and the human blood of Lionel Atwillek (von Niemann) Or the Emil server (Robert Frazier) has never been able to control himself. <br /> <br /> Do not see the doctor "Tikaren". X '(1932) - Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray also have their father and daughter, as I saw before; He is the reverse Oscar winner. Check this out first. Actually, 'The Vampire Bat' is still not good. He has a lot of talk or comic relief, without vampiric villainy paying close attention. <br /> <br /> Additionally, 'Dr. X 'and' Mystery of the Wax Museum '(both in 1932 and Fay Wray), Lionel Atwill's most famous appearances are' Frankenstein Son '(1939),' Gendarmen Armed 'and' Sherlock Holmes and Secret 'Moriarity. Arma '(1943). Dwight Fry stole all the scenes from her maniac film Dracula (1931). "As a young lover," Melvin Douglas and Fay Wray have a nice kiss scene, but that's why. "The Old Dark House" (1932) and Joel McCrea drag Fay on "The Most Dangerous Game" (1930). Then, the classic of the 1933s 'screams'. There was no bad time, no money and no rewriting, to show better talents and chemistry of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye. Unfortunately, then, this incredibly disappointing movie is just 4.
