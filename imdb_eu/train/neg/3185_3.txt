This movie was made by MST3K and heckled and it was a good reason. First of all, it's a "cop" movie, all of Joe Don Baker, all we know about is a good-looking actress, as Michael Jackson is a western singer. <br /> <br /> Police plot on the plot of everything with their own devices ugly, bar fights, children shooting hostages outs, acting bad, lame police chief, bad game, revenge / justice, endless goons, and, of course, acting bad . Do not see this without MST3K filter people.
