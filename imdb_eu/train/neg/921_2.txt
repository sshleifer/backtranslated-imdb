I rented it again to see Vanesa Talor. He will be able to play, but he has not got an opportunity in this clunker. The opening sequence is a crane-drawn cave lined by mountains. It must come from stocks archive because it is filmed directly. The production values ​​are professional _Blair Witch_ appearance. There's really cheesy animated statue, but other effects are not worth it. This movie is bad, but it's not so fun. The players would do well not to mention in their curriculum.
