Salvation is the worst horror movie I have ever seen. There's nothing remotely about that. It has not been so good to be in the genre. First of all, I do not know how many people can think of such a movie. If I wrote something boring and absolutely ridiculous, I would laugh and be ashamed to make the stupidity of others. The second: the play is awful and the green actress is wonderful. The third one: the story is sucked, cheap and inexpensive film used before it. Read in the back of the cover, it shows the whole story. I do not recommend that you watch this movie for 80 minutes if you do not need to worry about damaging something that you will notice. I really feel bad to the Croats and the irony of their name. All bird Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
