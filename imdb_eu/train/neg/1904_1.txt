=== Small spoilers === <br /> <br /> Like many others, Jerry Bruckheimer is a great fan. So, when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging on the front and the trailer for the MI: 2 hopes rose. Production by Jerry Bruckheimer. Big cars Nic Cage and fresh Oscar-Angelina Jolie. What can be wrong? Many <br /> <br /> The script is not very fun (it's really hard) and it's not exciting. He and a joke about Wooh-ha make you a black man who is doing racism! Did you get comedy? I do not think so. The excitement is totally out of reach. First and foremost (and surely this is often said) there are no sympathetic people, so do those who die? If Psychopus fails to lose 50 of his brother's brother Nic, if he does not steal 4-day cars, the next thing is that Kip (brother) walks again in Nic Street. Is it excited? Do not think about it Then the best bit comes from the love between Nic and Angelina. It seems to be really boring to say these stupid lines with Nic. "Is there a girlfriend?" - Do you see anyone? - What was wrong? etc. <br /> <br /> Then there is only one glittering hope: the car is running. At least they say, because the trailer was full of looks and unique. Very long, trapped by the camera's irritating movement. I have really had trouble for this action. <br /> <br /> So is the action movie? a thriller a romantic comedy? - There is no decision, just to avoid the horrible evil. I have given 10 stars of 10, and I'm generous.
