Ah, sex and gore movie. It is bad that they do not do it already (unless they live in Japan). But if all this had happened, this is not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The movie basically has two beautiful vampires on the country road that joins John to take him to his castle. having a crazy sex with them, and then eating (except those with the first victims, who do not have special causes). Things are complicated by the mysterious women who continue to see her husband's camp with a woman. Here it becomes totally ugly. In the end, the two vampires are bloody, they eat to watch everything and they escape the captive victim. There is so much for this secret existence. <br /> <br /> Both vampires do not care about removing clothes and deceiving them, this is the only thing that is in this movie. Otherwise, the mess is bloody and confusing (why is it that their tomb is far from the castle?), There is only a few minutes of the vampire playing. The only thing I got out of this movie was two valuable tips: shooting lesbians will not die; It only turns vampires and does not catch them on dirt roads; They are probably vampires. In addition, it really is not worth my time.
