A PRAYER STARTS <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movie ever made: it's easy. There's no free quality about this movie. The first 10 minutes make it quite difficult; You really think that this film will be amazing and on the edge of your seat. Instead, you'll spend 83 minutes stolen and see the wrong scene, without any organization. The lake was ridiculous, it looked like an aquarium, and the same plant was on the bed of different beds. The characters show the powers of advanced teleportation, such as falling into the lake of Alex Thomas (drink), and then it is impossible in his aboard. Angie Harmon has given a terrific performance as Kat, a recent fifth student who has written the interruption of the interruption of the interruption of the conversation that appears. An example of this would be "lantern!" In this stupid way, the amount of the human body can reduce the threshold. In the end, editing this movie is the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Like the cameraman, scientists were throwing up camera butterflies. An example of this will suddenly be the front of Alex's car. I bet that there was little time to edit this movie. The end was completely pathetic. The writers, of course, tried to create a mysterious line on the plot, "oh yeah!" Instead, we have seen some silent spider paintings that will be included in the story line. Unfortunately, there are no millions of pre-millions of people that can save this movie. <br /> <br /> I give 10 to 10 .5 This film was recorded on the film instead of a photo book.
