True disappointment for show by Ridley Scott. G.I. Jane tells the story of a first female helm outfit about the SEAL Navy. The training is difficult and hard for the instructor to play the role played by O'Neil Demi Moore. There are no specific posts or points in this movie, or I can not get it right. It can be a kind of expression of women's rights and abilities, but the fierce struggles between the tired scenes and the end of all the movies are blown up. <br /> <br /> I can not really understand why Ridley uses it. A lot of bugs mentioned in the final rifle in the desert ?! Sooooo seems stupid and irritating and almost amateurish, so I really would like the director to see what technique. Watching the latest film from Black Hawk Dawn, there is nothing wrong with battlefields (there are many) and they are directed very strongly and skillfully. Complete end of G.I. Jane looks ugly and does not do without stupidity and dying. <br /> <br /> This is my worst film by Ridley Scott, and there is no significant touch on this brilliant director. I'm still happy to see this in wide-screen format, as Scott's great-looking scene and excellent samples, but very few in this movie. <br /> <br /> A displacement and nothing compared to classics. With this talented director (Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise, Alien, etc.). So, G.I. Jane 4/10.
