Hello, what does anyone hear? I do not know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow audience of this movie: join the fanclub! This movie was very bad, I could not laugh when I saw it. I think it is essential, bad in a pleasant way. Any keypad that has been invented for making a horror movie can be seen here. I'm afraid it's hard to get a copy of this movie, but it should be the worst movie ever made.
