The summary is quite summarized. This is just as good as the original. Stallone and James Cameron's script (while Aliens wrote). Most of the actions were written by Cameron and Stallon wrote political parties. <br /> <br /> Sly was in a good state of physical condition, while she was doing it, and Rocky 4 was very look or look. for steroid eyes, depending on your vision or opinion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Finally, he agrees and Charles Napier begins a briefing campaign that governs a suit in Washington, trying to try to overcome former antiquated Rambo forces. <br /> <br /> Knowing that there is a mission is that POWs are still missing in Vietnamese camps. Rambo was chosen at the place where he was in prison. It is said that there is only one rescue mission and playback photos. <br /> <br /> After a bad attempt at parachute parachute from an airplane, he lost his biggest kite. She is a pretty woman and runs the river off the pirate. <br /> <br /> He is still in prison and saves him. 3 Half of Vietnam's Voters fled under their abyss and pirates betrayed them, but they all die Rambo, and they need to take them on board to Rambo's when they are walking. aboard <br /> <br /> Rambo betrays again and abandons Napier when he called for the rescue helicopter. It is clear that the return to the base of the Trautman is expected to be rescued, but it was expected that there was no survival. Vietnam troops and Spetznatz. He is dying to a great extent, eventually Rambo has stolen a helicopter and has saved most of the prisoners from returning to his base. <br /> <br /> She suffers Napier's killing but destroys the Ops Center. <br /> <br /> It's a shame and a very weak Rambo as a freelance man at dusk.
