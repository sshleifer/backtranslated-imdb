When I saw Calvin Kline-esque ads I was skeptical, but I thought I'd give it a chance. So I've seen, and I can say that's not all that. The movie was so bad. It's strange I hate a movie. When they saw this movie, the fun episodes of "The Player" in Altman reminded me that the writers were putting extravagant ideas to the producers. However, I would like to know which MTV producer was agreed to by Bront (but this time with Heathcliff Heath and a rock star, and Hindley called the medium-length music video Hendrix), it would be a good idea. /> <br /> However, it might not have been so bad, if all the aspects of the film had not been so bad. He should be the director of "being lonely, give me." I laughed at every "serious" scene and I was bored with the rest. The camera's work was sharp and repeatedly reminded me that I was watching the movie as bad. My theory is that the guy was bored, and some beer came down to the beach with his boom - all that I heard from the middle scene waved. And in other scenes, it's what you want to hear. Speaking of the sound, what he did about Mercy of Mercy's "More" song was totally impossible, and it's impossible again about what Brontos did. <br /> <br /> There was a fun scene next to the side. - exactly, the moment when Johnny Whitworth darkened the face of Katherine Heigl - and, in other words, what this scene has to do with all the rest of the story has to do with more power.
