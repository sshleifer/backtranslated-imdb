The beginning of this movie is very good with a terrific sound and humor, but when the movie becomes animated, it loses its appeal. <br /> <br /> That's why at least it was for me. The colors of a large part of the animation are very silent, with little contrast. It does not look good, at least in VHS. Sometimes it breaks down and looks good, but often, the characters will go quickly and quickly. For example, I'd like to hear about "Moby Dick". When the movies begin to drag, it selects again with the dragon's entry, and then the movie ends up firmly. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not enough to be memorable or compete with the great animated feature films of the last twelve years.
