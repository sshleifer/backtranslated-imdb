This movie was the longest movie and probably had 30 feature-length feature films by JAANI DUSHMAN (2002). I have never had anyone daring to do something like that <br /> <br /> The film suggests that the title is based on the Killer Wars, but the problem is that there are too many characters and romantic sub-sites and the songs of many characters get bored. <br /> < > There are also plenty of witches to kill with knifes, wonder what the soldier does? <br /> <br /> JP Dutta's management is in front of BORDER. Music is OK <br /> <br /> In the midst of the cast, Ajay Devgan is high, Saif is very good at his side, and his first movie, Abhishe is pleasing to Manoj Bajpai, his moment is Sanju, Suneil well Akshaye Khanna in his part is well pleasing to rest Rani is good, Esha is well resting.
