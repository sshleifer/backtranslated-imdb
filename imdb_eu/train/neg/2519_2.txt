I really paid to watch the movie in the theater. <br /> <br /> It would get a score of 1, but the scenes between robots are fine, and there is a surprise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I know that some films have bigger budgets than others. I have no problem with that. Unfortunately, science fiction films are most likely to suffer most in a small budget due to clear reasons. But, in any case, this film fails, each piece of each set looks tender and cheap. I mean, can not "give" a look? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < , but I was expecting a good movie at that time and I had no idea what it would be. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it was a great experience for 85 years.
