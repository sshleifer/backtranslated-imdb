An interesting movie about a Vermont Civil War event. My attention has remained to the finish line and I will not regret seeing it. I have never read about this accidental incident, so it seemed curious that the rebels were removed. I enjoy historical films of that time. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is with confederated uniforms. They look good !!! For a few days the theater was hard. The old man likes to eat potato mashed because he likes tooth. He knew he was playing a wounded wounded dog. In general, it was a subsequent movie.
