OK now, let's see. What was fun in the first movie? I know, people with funny accents, people falling into the water, collapsing stupid boats and fun comments between the two groups. In this movie, the accents are affected by the maximum, not so well. Many people fall into the water for unknown reasons, not quite well. Boatcrash, check. They tried fun comments between both groups, but failed. Also, there are too many personalities that follow in this film. This movie is about what's happening in the water, not on the floor. I'm sorry to say that it's far away from the fun parts and they're making the most of the film's sponsors. Not good In the end, I give it four decades because it has some fun parts.
