This is a bad B movie that goes through as a fake movie. The film's documentary film has almost any screen time and dialog boxes. They wanted to create it completely destroyed "feel the documentary". <br /> <br /> The movie is not really mockumentary, it's the least problem. The movie is not fun. The movie is not sexy The movie does not make sense about porn business. It is not particularly salable. Even though the sex is simulated, nudity is not smooth for the film of the R film. <br /> <br /> Someday someone will make a mistake about the pornographic documentary. This is not.
