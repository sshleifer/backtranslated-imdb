After reading the previous comments, I am pleased that I am the only person who has been confused, especially in the last 20 minutes. John Carradine is shown twice as he goes down the grave and closes the cover. I was waiting for a short explanation about this strange behavior ... I thought there was something wrong with nature at home, but after the death of the first glorified body (called # Zombie). 1), these scenes did not make any sense. Please, Carradine knows why Carradine is still a bit further away, it has left us all the rest !! <br /> <br /> All the activities are left in the last 20 minutes, so I will summarize. John Carradine goes to the cemetery to investigate and heats the Zombie # 1. So far, so good. However, when John Ireland and Jerry Strickler are shooting a small cemetery on the lunar moon, they know Carradine's body. Strickler tries repeatedly to open the tomb that fell in Ireland # 1, but Ireland opens the open grave and PRESTO! Strickler appeared in Zombie # 2! Yes, can I think that Strickler was dead (a witch?), But why he did not change the appearance of the corrupt version of the corrupt version of Zombie # 1, he never explained. (Considering that some of these zombies are terribly slow, I would have thought that he would rather stay in his "normal" until the business was over). This scene also takes into account the question: who is it that it's moving to Zombie # 1 ??? We can only assume that one of the bikes of the original slaughter shows during the initial credits of the film, but who knows what, or why he looks after the film team. <br /> <br /> Anyway, then Ireland sees this transformation and escapes, and we see that Zombie # 2 is moving through tree-lined trees. (This at the moment confuses how really a lot of zombies are). Then, in a 1950s horror movie, he fled Ireland. In a small head of the Faith Domergue's head he fell in comfort (was not it that John Carradine did not know how to carve a tomb of almost a cat?) <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Zombie # 1 destroyed the home of destruction . After three easy-to-read crew members send stairs. Faith Domergue is listening and John Ireland's lover thinks she's back from her nightmare. After seeing only Zombie # 1, he screamed and entered the room that recovers the Irish revolver. Carole Wells starlet shakes at this point and does not listen to screaming, Charles Macauley (who dims her bedroom in a mirror that sank in her bedroom). Taking a good season (and just a few templates from hip-mat), he decides to finally investigate. (In the last quarter of this film, the star is a thing that touches the audience with SLAKERRAK stars that belong to screams and clues). He goes into the Domergue corridor and is ready, but Macauley made a mistake on Zombie # 1 and shot it six times! The rail rails a nice image of acrobatics, then protects an immense Domergue, inserted into the arms of Direct Zone 1. shooter and Domergue's cries; He does not even exhaust himself in any urgent investigation. In that period, # 1 Zombie has a time to enter Domergue's neck chain. Wells sees the corpse of Domergue and is dead. The next time we see the house is in the outer stream (???) - but more about it. In the meantime, Ireland has regained the senses, and entered the home of the Zombie # 1 bloody slaughterhouse. Even though three people in Ireland have dropped their killers, he is worried that he is exposed to his film and is damaged. For zombie (and viewers), Zombie # 1 throws some of the equipment on the 2nd floor of the head. Zombie # 1 is the last. At that moment, viewers are launching an assembly of all deaths, showing that the elders "make mirrors". How deep it was <br /> <br /> Numerical numbers 2 have arrived near the house (remember that these zombies move as slow as molasses in January), where it was transmitted to Carole Wells and saw fish. away How did it arrive? Does Zombie 1 lead you to throw, and then zoom back at the top of the moment to step on John Ireland? Apparently, one of the original victims was dropped in a tube, so Wells must also be drowned (but why it is not explained in the current situation). The number 2 of Zombie has never gone into the house (now everyone is dead, but thanks to Zombie # 1), but Carol Wells takes it to this cemetery. When the final credits are on the screen, we will see Zombie # 2, still dead in love, open to the grave. <br /> <br /> He asks the spectator: Yes, but that was not Zombie. # 1 tomb? Why is Zombie # 2 taking over? And what if the # 1 zone comes in and wants to go back - will Zombie # 2 give permission or a zombie fight? Are the tombs and the dead, Carole Wells? And John Carradine was dead now: where will he stay? After all, it is clear from the previous scenes that the house is in the grave ... If you have confused the summary of the final composition, do not worry, that you are not alone.
