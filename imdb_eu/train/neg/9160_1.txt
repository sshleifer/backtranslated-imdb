This movie was laughably bad. A friend rented and watched me on Netflix. There are so many Gaffes and Goofs, and it is impossible to get acquainted with characters and plots. For example, in what ways ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Vermont airport" surrounded by palm trees <br /> <br /> Ben's apparently marvelous shirt in the telephone conversation <br /> <br /> The priest's palace office ... with a bent table table. <br /> <br /> The decent story is hidden behind a bad movie. However, if you overcome technical defects, you will find theater and interrogation. I was mistaken for the casting of a stunning gay actress playing the right-brother brother-in-law of the religious manuscript. His first scene, sitting in a clean apartment, was the most horny carpeting his kitty cat. <br /> <br /> I praise the writer, director, producer / editor / star / hospitality / cast / dentist / composer. this movement was made), a movie like that was actually distributed. If you do not have anything better, it might be a fun movie group or a drinking game, but do not rent it for a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriage.
