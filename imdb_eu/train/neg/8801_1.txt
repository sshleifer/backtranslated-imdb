Body parts of the dead (deleted scenes) from together (edited) corpses (Anchorman), Frankenstein Monster (Wake Up, Ron Burgundy) are constantly watching bad eyes (twice what you want to see ...) for that matter. <br /> <br /> The relative relativity of the WURB scenes are mostly relevant to third-party narrators. It's more frightening to say that WURB's characters are incompatible with the versions that we had at the end of Anchorman (they say that the WURB is a descendant of the opening story). From the start of the movie and a hybrid embrace. In this movie, Veronica's phone calls back to his theater playwrights (clearly, they are the same as the original Anchorman scenes, spliced ​​to WURB) <br /> <br /> The part that goes on The movie, which is constantly evolving A story involves a bank robbery without the cause of the alarm clock. These scenes are almost painful. This piece disappeared from the original script of Anchorman. <br /> <br /> Most of our other Channel 4 newsgroups are clearly alternative / deleted in Anchorman's scenes. They go to the party like the original, "the same group as a team" with the original "tie-up team" and the objections against Veronica's chronicle, like the cat show. <br /> <br /> Burgundy is back in San Diego and its favorite dinner, Tinos, his first date. There is no mention of any characters that came to the unit, and when Borgoña joined Tinos with Veronica, she has never appeared as a presenter. Oh, and they wear the same clothes on the original date. <br /> <br /> I still have to give credit to some of the filmmakers - even if it's a quick way to present WURB deleted scenes. related to narration. Ron Burgundy has two stories, which is the weakest. Looking back, the success of Anchorman's ash from WURB is quite a success. You are class, IMDb. Thank you that it has stopped.
