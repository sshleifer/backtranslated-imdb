When I first watched this movie at the theater when I was 10 years old. Although at that time "humor" was an immense humiliation of my teenage minds. <br /> <br /> Previously, Ed Begley Jr. I would have a serious jeff Goldblum and I started feeling very uncomfortable and even a bit dull. Until today I remembered this movie, I did not know why I felt it. Apparently, I blocked the memory of that movie and still my two negative feelings continued. Apparently I saw the movie I forgot, but unconsciously robbed my soul parts, because they were not the creators of this work. <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not boldly see. as an adult I think that as part of the healing process I would face the fear of childhood to really * stop behind. Regression therapy and / or hypnosis might not be a bad idea.
