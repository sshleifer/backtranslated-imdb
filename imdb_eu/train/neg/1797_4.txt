This movie has a very strong premise, as well as the gender standards. It's been asked to request a record that can recapture the record backwards, but the record also contains hidden messages, that it is SPECIFICALLY addressed to a child, when the singer has nothing to do with the boy, when he was alive, and of course, whose right record was no end. However, the movie is a bit fun, but in the end, dizziness and nonsense prevail. Even though Freddy was trying to create a new horror icon, they were far from here: here the criminals have no personality, they have no motivation and no variety. (* 1/2)
