Tree of Palme's teaser tries to go through allegories of a fairy tale with real meaning, and then they begin immediately on animation. I should know what it means. <br /> <br /> Palme's main character is a good example of the whole movie. For a moment, Palme is a humble hero who seeks herself, and next, a violent psyche, which once looked after a healthy fixation for a girl. <br /> <br /> Like all the characters in the movie, Palme is poorly defined. You have no connection with the characters, even if you bought a couple of fans of Shatta fan. It seems to be the writer that this drama and all the complexity was more interesting than studying the motivations and personality of his characters. <br /> <br /> The new story lines of the last fifty days were introduced. minutes of the movie The writer needed his story rationally. Perhaps he wanted to be epic, but it was too much information for a two-hour movie. However, I can not ask myself, so much so that the dimensions and characters of the plot fit into a TV or graphic novel that could be better suited. <br /> <br /> I was not able to finish the movie for the last five minutes. Do not overlook the quality too much and start laughing at how characters, relationships and plot were invented. I touched my friend and started cracking too much like a young man sitting behind us. We tried to control ourselves, but we could not get the great quality of this movie. <br /> <br /> In bright surroundings, the animation is incredible and the viewers admire the charms of origin and character. designs The animation almost guides you; When you do not look after the characters, it tells you how it feels.
