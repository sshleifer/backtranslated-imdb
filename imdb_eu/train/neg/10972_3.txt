This was not a Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie film. Wannabee was a great one. She wanted to confirm the movie that she wanted to be in a fast, nervous, and stimulating film, but the mere, evil cameras. Imitating something else is easier than the actual characters create a real story. From the beginning, I could not care less about the characters or their participation. He always came, always pissing, or crying over each other. There was only no substance what they did. A dialogue between characters is a hip, revealed, it will be very close, and one scene can be seen one after the other. I know they did not like the movie, so I'd be wrong.
