This movie deserves its original vision. Comes theater, movies and storytelling. Unfortunately, it falls on all levels. The worst of the movies is the desire to commit anything; Campaign, moralist and epic elements without any commitment to any of them. Regarding the story, Chretien de Troyes is rotating in his grave, faced with this extraordinary adaptation that makes Percival a fairytale and unappealable. That is, Francophiles or Arthuriophiles. As I talked about one of those last ones, I found a beautiful story of unwatchable and terribly shabby, disrespect story.
