The film has several characters, following several characters. The language is not like this comedy is very inconsistent and sometimes it looks like an annoying line of stories. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The color may be weak and sounds, but it's true; The Crocodile Hunter series is a better Discovery channel with Steve and Terri Irwin. This movie is more fun and even more fun. I'm sure both of them and the groups made a lot of fun this movie, but the movie does not give much pleasure. For comedy, it's not quite fun, and Steve and Terri Irwin are just good actors, even when they play themselves. Their plays are not good enough to surround the whole film and feel their scene a bit slow, leisure and useless and sometimes annoying. <br /> <br /> The great potential of the movie was Steve Irwin's only character. Strangely enough to see that it was exciting and ridiculous, so when I heard that they were making a 'crocodile hunter', it was my first reaction; get away! However, the film has a very weak story and a harsh story with unrelated and unknown characters. The movie has the value of entertainment. At least, at least once this movie may look like, but I definitely do not recommend this film. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie on time. This movie is still visible once more on TV, in a rainy afternoon. It has good moments, but the storyline completely ruins the movie and its potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
