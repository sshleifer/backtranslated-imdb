This is really a little entertainment. Even worse movies will be worse. <br /> <br /> In Gangster / Drug Scenage, it is difficult to have a convincing line (this movie is not, for example, Sebastians' reason why there's more to be. False Topic.) Then, You should have a relationship setting (this is not a film.) What does he need once more to ask his father to go with his age? an interesting photo to ask about the lack of rebellious behavior and need for high school family children. This movie is not in this direction. Although it would be a potential risk of random reversal. Did not he go down and why he does it again? <br /> <br /> So, here are some interesting questions for the socially critical drama that we present here (but once again, the film is not taking into account the "cool" production techniques and the special effects and not giving it a thought. even when the story is driven from that path and not looking at the way of breathing and evolving the story. <br /> <br /> Wanting to be a drama is not to glorify excessive substance abuse and violence (political days would be political wrong, right?), but On the other hand, a cheap action movie (not so much so much) over the average set, what the actor and Vinnie Jones do to everything that manages to destroy everything that is not renowned for his reputation. <br /> <br /> So, everything ... I just can not recommend it. <br /> 1 Vinnie and the 2nd edition.
