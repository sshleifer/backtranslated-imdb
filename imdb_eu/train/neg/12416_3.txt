Yes, I can forget about AWA about this real show. First, the interviewer Marty O'Neil was very short, "Rock n Roll" had the look of Buck Zumhofe's nose. Then Gene Okerland was said to be "crazy as a fighter" as he was "exhausted" or "he would be well", but he was forced. When he went to the WWF, Ken Resneck said his boyfriend looked like a weekend's soup, "The Georgeous" Jimmy Garvin told me he was a very good interviewer. When he jumped out of the boat, Larry Nelson got so poorly that Phyllis George could have improved! After all, Doug McLeod has been the best adventurer ever to have had all the fight fighters! Then the Minnesota North Stars hockey team was offered more wages. Roger Kent was the one who could forget the words and the worst sentence, as he was a great fighter, "Hes a big-on!" Boost or steal the boldness between "right-handed ladders," or when "oppressed" or "paddriver" is prohibited when "when Nick Bockwinkle's defenseless opponent uses it. For the most green money (WWF), Rod Trongard was predicting the style but it was different. When a fighter attacked the front of his boot in front of another toe, as if in front of a "wolf in front" or a fighter. He has problems with "the bad way is evil." AWA would also say AWA, the worst wrestlers, the toughest, the worst here are AWA! (extra money Verne Gagne!) Did he leave (WWF) Larry (afterwards) Phyllis?!) He took Nelson and talked to one another or completely ignored it. (WWE wisely did not take it!) Greg Gagne also did not play the purest fight. I mean it. Also, when looking for a label, he wants to get that look, so he can move it to the nearest bathroom. Jumpin J im Brunzell was a great dropkick artist, because Greg always wondered why he was. Jerry Blackwell (RIP) was also a superstar wrestler, but he asks why he won Verne against him. (Puhleeeeze!) After Vince McMahon contracted Gagnes's utensils, most of them would fight squash games. I want to make the Gagne family a real fight!
