This is probably not part of the bottom of the Slasher mediocre film, but it's probably a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The holiday premise was interesting but after the first scene, it shows that it is a bad movie. production values ​​and stupid slogans. I mean, at this time, the sub-genre was not an invisible teenager, due to teens, without apparent reason, but this was too much. There are no occurrences of coherence or anything else to add. <br /> <br /> Clichés is boring, it's a little gore and mystery too. <br /> <br /> This is it. The video message entry is quite medium, even if the video tag is nasty. <br /> <br /> I'm really disappointed with this piece of trash.
