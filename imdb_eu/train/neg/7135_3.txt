I'm sorry to say that there is no way, in my opinion, that Enzo can continue with Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The weight of the S7 would be too powerful. S7 has a power ratio of 3.93 kg / hp. Enzo holds 4.61 lbs / hp. The low S7s is also much better. I'm sorry for Ferrari fans, but Saleen just got so much better done. <br /> <br /> As part of this film, it's just that I have to say that it was a substandard pathetic. The story is very weak. Working on this lemon is worse than the soap of the day. <br /> <br /> I can say that it is a jewel in the form of a treatise on negative psychology. This film does not define anything, narcissism and sociopathy, an immortal definition. Only those traces of innocent strokes that cause huge numbers of deaths or deaths are affected by these rich punks. <br /> <br /> I can not give the movie "a star". because the rating was not forced out of the theater. I also think that they do not have a beautiful beauty to have a brunette murderer as a female leader ... even though her song has not been put on the cover of 'Variety'. <br /> <p>> ps: This guy playing Jason is SOOOOOO in James Vanderbeek's skate row.
