It's just one of those horrible films you can find on Lifetime TV, which make sense and empathic behavior of some nasty women. Among other things, together with the different "The Burning Bed", "Suffice" or "Monster", this film takes on a cheeky crime and the viewer is not such a bad person. Tell us! Here are my filmmakers who asked this question: If LeTourneau was a man, and if Vili was a 12-year-old girl, would this person be sympathetic and empathetic? Answer: hell. <br /> <br /> Imagine changing the genres of this movie, and then you'll see why I and others rubbish dumps we're playing here. If genres have changed, they should not try to empathize with punishment. Instead, it is possible to make a portrait of a monster and horrible man who faces a young girl, and the wounded weary wound he had in prison and the victim of Stockholm's syndrome. LeTourneau is the only reason that does not receive the same treatment in these films depending on their gender. <br /> <br /> Let's call the box. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Plain and simple There is nothing, not or not. He is a crime committed in prison, and he deserves our contempt and contempt, but it is definitely not our compassion or empathy.
