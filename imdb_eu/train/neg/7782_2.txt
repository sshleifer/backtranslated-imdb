Monster is a frightening movie about a US factory that is terrifyingly cancerous (another Hollywood), Chimayo contaminates the water of the little city of Colombia, somehow creating a sea-like beast, lamb and a loose woman. James Mitchum, Bill Travis is sent to Chimayora, his evil head, Barnes, can not throw his hands back in the back of his writing to reach the bottom of the story. While in Chimayo Bill, he has to fight all his stories in English with an annoying reporter who goes straight to America. I think there was a market for small news in South America in the Seventies. There is also a radical called SÃ¡nchez, who wants to ruin the factory, and the water that contaminates water for supplying the local population, but why the cold economies must leave Environmental Marxism intangible. . The leader of the Pete factory helps slowly when the monsters say he is a girlfriend on the beach, and said that the daughter of the mayor Juanita sees her and she is among them, then she eats immediately that night. A small side action without proof. My hat for you sir John Carradine casts the monster as a priest to punish sinners sent by God. The contempt that we face in this movie you can see. He also shot himself in the local currency exchange, not seeing its verification. <br /> <br /> They are based on a real story, since they open so much in the initial credits, this movie. It's wonderful on all fronts. The shooting began in 1971 and was suspended eight years later when Kenneth Hartford put him at the foot of Monster, adding his two annoying children to new characters. The sound quality does not exist, and most of the scenes seem like someone has a camera overload in the film. The scene at night is much more boring. The monster is astonishing, because it makes the adhesive ugly, to achieve an anti-lyric finish. James Mitchum, with his brother Chris, proves the need to reduce the nepotism of the actor's industry. Strictly intact Shame John Carradine.
