I love these actors, but they have been wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm just not surprised, what did they think they would agree with that thought? <br /> <br /> Debra Winger has just called her. in one; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were caricature. Some people think it was profound. Well, if you like "Waves Breaking", you probably also like this. I hated both. 3/10
