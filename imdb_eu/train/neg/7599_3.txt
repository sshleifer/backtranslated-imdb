A friend told me about John Fante last year when we talked about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski - a writer with a similar edge and humor, except for a first generation. 'Ask the Dust' was the first Fante book I read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a great part of the writer, who had no idea of ​​writing about himself and the outer world about a horrifying and horrifying young writer, who did not know about the author's real world experiences. In this novel, the protagonist is a virgin, without the idea of ​​winning the woman's passion for writing in the magazine. The story of a curious relationship with Camilla, how to establish her first sexual experience with a "wounded" admirer, and how she does not end up with the story of a love attempt that has failed and is real, without touching Hollywood. ends The adaptation of the film has kept the book a bit, but love enters the white trap of love, which continues through racism, disease and death. The heart of this story is that Bandini is a jerk and Camilla is stupid, and their love has never been and never would be real, both of them want to find each other. This movie dismissed and changed the true meaning of the story. I can not believe that the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and do a bad movie.
