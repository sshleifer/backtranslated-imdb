This movie has a sales function. At one point, when a character attacks an adolescent toy fairy, his brother asks: "Why is your leg there, Chuck?" After almost an hour of bad film, this my drink almost made my nose for me. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances are not bad, but children are tasting it and PJ Soles would be ashamed to do this. The story is weak and nobody thinks what you think (or what makes sense). <br /> <br /> Obviously, there are not many points that create stories. For example, in a scene small children's ghosts must be tough to move a physical object, which is a difficult task to prove so that they can not seem to interact with the physical subject. However, a few minutes later, the horns take on the ground and the toothbrush group plays with it. Apparently, sometimes, things can move and sometimes they can not. Go to the image. <br /> <br /> A lot of blood and trips, however ... some beautiful boobs. But this does not fix the gaps. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie about dancers, rent "Darkness Falls". I think it is very good, although other reviewers do not share my opinion. Sets at least one mood.
