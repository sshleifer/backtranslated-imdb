This movie is very bad. I laughed twice or twice, and sucked the story! Maybe there's a fun joke, it's stupid and boring. In every short movie, I was asleep and when I asked when I finished. <br /> <br /> No one is human, and everyone is stupid and ridiculous. Rob Schneider plays something like an animal that I would like to see. It seemed funny to him, but the bottom line: WE DO NOT HAVE A TASK PRICE FOR YOUR MOVIE DIRECT AND STUPID. <br /> <br /> I asked if it would end up, even though the movie is short. At first we thought it was improving; But it's worse. Stupid, to the finish line. I got out of the theater and I would definitely remember the movie forever. <br /> <br /> Simpsons is a TV writer who writes and produces this movie, but it's similar to Simpsons (that is, the movie pain!)
