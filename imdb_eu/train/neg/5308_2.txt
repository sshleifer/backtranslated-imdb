It will not be prepared for another bad start! This time, Fred Olen Ray is never what makes you unforgettable! As far as the exploration films go, this is not a click! As science fiction, it's very common! Everything we see is a feminine androian woman, dressed in a bikini to destroy the Earth, and that shows everything that goes hand in hand! Give me a break !!! If this type of entertainment is your thing, then why not cleanse the old SI swimsuit maga switch in the attic !? That would be much better if that were not the case, but it would not lift the high factor, but that would never be wonderful. I'd like to mention another movie called THE ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Wynorski, who looks like ALIENATOR's personality. This shows why the best female action action movie 1 to be found is not translated in America. Sorry, yes!
