The first movie begins in a very stupid note: a 10-year-old girl plays on a mobile vehicle and decides to have fun with her hands covering her eyes and then creating a terrible accident. mother dies ... sorry ... I'm sorry, it's not a positive 10 year mute that muted. The rest of the movie is not much better. After the death of the apparent boy on a 10-year-old mother's mother, his father moved his family to Genoa (Italy), where he could teach a local university, but here is the newsletter: he does not speak. Italian word! Then the girl has "eyes" (she has died) and often has night-time fears and always ends her father and ends her rotting. Afterwards, after losing this family constantly, we must then embrace, embrace, then cry and lose and then find (then, of course, more embrace and crying) the point I actually would like to have some natural disaster just to steam steam, ignorant people all of them I'm not mistaken, because they love Indies, but I'm indie (and I'm stupid) about a dumb one, it's just ridiculous and meaningless. It is shameful that this movie is based on these characters that are immersed in these backdrops, because of their interest.
