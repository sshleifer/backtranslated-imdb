This movie is a good warning to anyone who thinks they can write and direct their movie. You can not face it. That way, no one is advised to report them to you in the transformation of large holes in your plot, meaningful conversations, double dialogue, and non-recall, and turns Korean legend into a pretty sweet celluloid turd. <br /> <br /> The movie I liked as a movie filmmaker, I actually did; I like a lot of lucky movies. But when did I ask myself what happened and why, my dear, Why? Over several times, I can not take it anymore. <br /> <br /> Also, I would like someone to explain how the last scene was Mordor.
