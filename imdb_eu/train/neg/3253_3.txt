I saw China O'Brien II before I first saw China in O'Brien. And I must say that the first surprise is really worse. But: worse = more fun! And fun = better. If you're a bad fan of me, it's a great material. However, if you are looking for a significant plot, the ability of the theater or the ability to make movies, it is better to avoid it. The best part is: how they fought the fast sequences as they progress. Bad hilario See to laugh, watch it out of strange entertainment, but whatever you do, watch it on TV.
