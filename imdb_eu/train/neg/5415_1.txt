Dil's film was a memorable script, a great director like Indra Kumar who brought him to celluloid. The film continues with Beta, Ishq, Raja and Masti. All were great. <br /> <br /> But all successful directors give a lot of movies, as well as some hits. Pyare Mohan is one of those films. <br /> <br /> Although the comics are well-known, the audience is not laughing. Compared to the comedy movies that are made today, this is silent. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see and laugh at the movie, do not look at this. Only pathetic comedy will weep. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie must be lost.
