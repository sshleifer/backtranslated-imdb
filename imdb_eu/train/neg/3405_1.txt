I can not believe how this movie is. It's like watching the police academy, if you do not talk with people that are talking about ... and waiting for you, wait, there's a fool who is a fool of robot. I understand the interruption of understanding, but it's stupidity. There is no plot for this movie. It's like seeing a doctor wanting to be a doctor, as if they did not get doctor words, as the main staff of the main medical facilities. They are also dressed in cloth-worn outfit for a space program. In the space the valley girls are watching the movie "b".
