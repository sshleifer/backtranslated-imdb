What we have here is a movie that can ruin your soul with money and revenge ... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, the director of the gangster genre's work, is more than just one of the bunch. <br /> <br /> The use of modern black cinema to reach out to a man who frees himself. By swallowing his pride, he is pleasing to his enemy and lets his money fall on his face. Jason Statham's character is no longer afraid of Ray Liotta, but apparently, Liotta's madman is going to blow him to the bottom. Why? In essence, you can not make a mafia like Liotta character, it seems to have reached the station of his life, revealing a violent indirect behavior throughout the film. Statham's face character. <br /> <br /> I do not know what I'm starting to say before ... I'm not. Do i have it right? Choose your wealth and find happiness and inner peace. Be nice to your enemy and this will be confused in self-destruction. It seems that the main movie is not a bad story, but it's hardly an original one. The problem is that Ritchie simply does not have a cinematographic training. When Guy Ritchie realizes, he thinks the story begins to get bored and he begins to embrace the reddish: Statham stole a car - Why? Marvel shooting some comic animation scenes ... again, why? <br /> <br /> There are several loose threads and unanswered questions at the end of the movie, all of them were able to access it in 2001 and try to calculate or simply accept that there is no response and each viewer will interpret their mode in their own way. Myself He was bored with the rich tone of the movie, but it did not matter to me. Actually, the end could not be reached soon, I do not sit anywhere else in this pretentious psychoactive. <br /> <br /> Losing two hours of my life.
