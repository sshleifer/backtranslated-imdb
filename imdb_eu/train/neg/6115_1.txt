Tarzan's character has undergone so many interesting places and so many misinterpretations as those who expect another version (I mean, like me, that Tarzan's books liked the baby and always wanted it). According to the books, following a little bit a movie version should know how to accumulate the final interpretation. Some reviews on the IMDb hit this point, but I'm here for $ .02 <br /> <br /> I know I only have two depictions of Tarzan's film: Greystoke, Christopher Lambert and Disney's animation. The version, which tries to represent an interesting character of Edgar Rice Burrough (a pair of noble couples in English, who was captured by a tribe of monkeys caught in the aftermath of death and becomes the "lord of the jungle" before returning to England and claiming his other identity before his human more than a superior intelligence, than the usual male murderer of Hollywood, whose famous brand names are famous, know the language, the habit, the strength, the heroism, etc. The only things in common with these two are Tarzan's name and Jane's wife His two wife, Ron Ely's television release is committed: as a Burroughs character, English speaks well and is both expert and gentle in both cultures as JamesBondish, but Lord Greystoke is not there and there is Jane. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is in the third category of Tarzan, and I hope one of these categories is it is overwhelming In this category, character is used as a vehicle for all things, soft porn. Jane, Bo Derek acted legally and abusively in Africa with a brave professor looking for his father, who never finds something that he does not determine. Although his father has been missing for a long time, he finds it unexpectedly. Father Richard Harris is the best here; It looks like stupid movie, so it's essential to remind those of Peter O'Toole's What's New Pussycats. His father publishes it in Tarzan (a ghost or a spirit) says his daughter, however, a monkey or tribute, King Kong). . Shortly afterwards, we hear the bad news of Tarzan's cry. His father dies, and it seems he does not like his generous daughter. And then ... <br /> <br /> Then Tarzan appears, but he does not say anything. In fact, he does not say anything in the whole movie. He and Jane fall in love and do not dress almost anything, since the off-screen poetry of love poetry recites dogs. End That's the plot. <br /> <br /> Well, not exactly; Likewise, Tarzan creates a scene where there is no realism with a boa constrictor - an extraordinary good, the only one ever seen. With the help of a chimpanzee that deals with Jane bite, the wound will shake it by helping to tighten the wound (I do not create any such thing), which is to wear clothes for many excuses. deactivate <br /> <br /> I always want to say something positive to finish the review, but this time it's difficult. Let's see ... well, it's not right to criticize this film for an orangutan, although we all know that Orangutans are not living in Africa; Ultimately, the classic Tarzan films used all Indian elephants, right? Also, you must admit Bo Derek is quite a face and shape. (But, in that case, why did he say hello like an art model? What does it say about a movie being boring to look like a pretty woman? I do not really think it's a positive one, or if it's not that she never showed her crotch.) But now I realize: As I can, I can not finish the positive note. <br /> <br /> See this movie if you are a fan of cinema. I am here.
