Russell Hopton played several films until he died in 1945. He only directed 2 and was the only "Black Gold" (the other from 1936). Frankie Darro sometimes had a remote screen presence, but that was good. Of course, the "quickie" circuit was very popular - he made so many films. He plays the son of an older oil, who thinks he will soon strike petroleum. J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) is trying to denounce that he wants to sell the old man, which will cause oil at any moment. Henry, a geologist, helps dad's "Fishtail's". He also thinks he is going to school "Fishtail". Henryk Cynthia, a pretty teacher, looks at her. She was the last film of Gloria Shea - she began her career at Olive Shea in "American Girl Glorifying" (1929). "Fishtail's" is a murderer and Henry has decided to bring Anderson and his friends to justice. When Henry is kidnapped, Anderson avoids persuading "Fishtail" to sell oil rent. Everything goes well with the oil and goes to the "Fishtail" military school. <br /> <br /> A rainy day is fine.
