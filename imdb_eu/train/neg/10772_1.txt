The worst part of this is that I will never return for 87 minutes. I know that this was a horrible little break, as it was wearing a huge Indian head on the roof. (See if they are out of date in 2008). My 10-year-old boy has embarked on a baseball right now, so we decided to rent a rainy day. He seemed to enjoy some parts, even though there was nothing left I could hear the language. Bad movie, bad Bad News Bears was a huge rebound. Completely shameless and totally predictable. I do not like the planned movie, but this was not entirely.
