I will say "I imagine" in that line, to be honest, I do not now see a film by Hal Hartley. However, I did not hear this, because I saw them as smaller NY filmmakers (when I say lower than Jim Jarmusch), personal budgets on limited budgets. In an ironic way, like Pasolini's Salus, although in a different context, Fay Grim is interested in seeing some of the best features of Hartley, seems to be at least behind a tale, like Hartley *. That could be a good filmmaker, it could be so good ... Or, on the other, it might be someone who was impressed with his own idiosyncrasies and Godard's horror rumors. <br /> <br /> I can not explain the story, maybe or maybe. It's not a problem, but it's not really that happened because Fay Fren, Henry Fool, had not seen the previous movie. Although I think this experience, the final results would not be very different. There is a lot of international espionage, another double plot that has fallen into the fake false characters of the title, which Parker Posey plays in an uncomfortable way (whether it's ok or not, maybe). The CIA operative (Jeff Goldblum, as a strong presence, including mania, with laughter), is not an orgy-loaded image box, and Henry Fool's writer. It is not a script that is completely impenetrable, however, because it only includes excessive spread gaps, because there are some strange mysterious or disturbing conversations. <br /> <br /> Just the direction just suck. Harltey is in love with the Third Man, that is, but imposes a headache style to accomplish all that goes wrong, and the characters need to insert the frame. Unlike Battlefield Earth, a director is so angry that he is trying to choose an unnecessary angles for the title angle for a strange dramatic effect, this time Hartley does not belong to the cluster f ***, especially responsible for that. This, with Godard's title cards along with the jokes that appear here and there, some fun and some totally stupid, and all the montage follow in the segments, and reminds us of some actions that take place a couple of moments. Wood weakens the potential of the script, which is already quite clear. Somehow, it's brilliant to see that all is bad, but a small ladder is seen in a kind of fascination that looks like watching a full-scale story in a small-scale story. <br /> <br /> But be aware: you will probably find a more painful example of this independent American film this year.
