The real ebay movie was very strange and very wrong, I promised it with great hope. I think I've paid around $ 50 for this movie. As a perpetual horror, the American slashers of the 80s are difficult for zombie films, I said it would be wonderful! I can not tell how bad it was. First of all, I thought it would be much worse than it really was. After all that I heard about this film, I was scared to see it. Murder is boring. The play ... forget, there is no play! This story, though it does not matter, is very bad. It seems that the sex scenes have tried to add gems and naked girls, but unfortunately, in this case it does not help the movie. Why? No shades, and this is the worst thing about this bad movie. It's just a bad shooting from the A-B point. It's very funny and fun to watch with your friends and beer, but do not make any effort to get your hands on. There are so many movies in this world, do not waste your time watching Necro files!
