This movie has a good story with cores. The men and women of the Coast Police, especially in the North Pacific Ocean, are heroes and legends. This movie brings out a good story with the end (no one satisfies), a couple of fierce and absurd combat and two supposed "romantic" relationships, like a coin that is dead. Rescue scenes are very good - even if the creation of computers is hokey, and the scenarios are quite unrealistic - but the backstory is lame and disappointing. It's a good costner, especially when you play your hand (see). Ashton Kutcher is flat but not horrible. The main female characters are one-dimensional. The best woman is one of the Coast Police Coast rescue centers and she takes a camera for about two minutes. It could be a great movie - and Costner needed it!
