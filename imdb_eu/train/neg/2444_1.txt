Two houses, a street, a booth, a car, a girl next to it, a boy next to him and a zombie. This list of ingredients will be enough for a horror movie. All you need is blue light, ambient music and ... you need to do it. Not by the Dutch van Rouveroy director! <br /> <br /> Sometimes I like to organize "bad night movies". The concept is very simple: you can get ice cream, get some movie lovers and get into the worst film. The best dirt in the afternoon is this. Laughter certified! <br /> <br /> It's a strange thing, as Van Rouveroy still defends his film as a great achievement. If you want to be a witness, you must follow the DVD commentary. Again: you believe and laugh!
