Mr. Brosnan was entertained as a performer of "The Panama of the Tailor" (that is, I'm classified in all 10/10: casting, theater, script, story, edition, rhythm, music, emotional impact, etc.). I expected it. I was very disappointed. A movie that is not a script, a supporter of being vulgar, is a script that reads, "The costume of Panama" has failed in a rich and enjoyable way. Turn on the screen to write and correct. I sat in the theater waiting for a "good part". he never came. I did not laugh or cry, but a conversation line smiled at me. Is it $ 7? Barely
