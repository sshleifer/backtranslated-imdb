Except for nice cinematography, I hardly know anything about that movie. The only real issue is the problem of the protagonist, whether he should be with his childhood friends or not in the world of misery, or to leave it and take his own life. The "Emotionally Powerful" scenes are not accompanied by this plot and, due to bad performances, they do not create a deliberate atmosphere. The director presents Anthony's dilemma and eventually brings a simple solution. It seems that the characters are not evolving, although it is difficult to talk about any person ... except Sonny. Next to him, the actors do not play much, and when some of them need it, they are pleasing to themselves. I wonder if he spoiled the movie more: the superficial script, that raises all the potential of the plot, or a bad performance that worries about the remaining appeal.
