Doris Day never leaves a bad script. Even when we're testing more days, the day is 100% and it's usually bad. This comedy, perhaps inspired by the real life of New York in 1965 but Claude Magnier's adaptation to the late 1950s, made Doris a little, but his image seems to be a good one, and finally in the second half, he will be comically sedated (this is funny It's because of the spin day). Here are some fun lines, but the stability of the material has been dramatically rendered, of course, rather than embodying the play ... instead of some fun Apple Apple events, we stick to the neighborhoods. Doris's co-stars (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse and Terry-Thomas) do not fit well and will not wear it. However, it is not horrible, it has some great laughs and it's essential for day-to-day entertainment. ** ****
