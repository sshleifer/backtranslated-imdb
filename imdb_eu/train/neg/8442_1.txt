GUERNSEY (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / Netherlands 2005). <br /> <br /> Maria Kraakman, cunning Anna, a woman of thirty, who finds her husband (Fedja van Huet), but does not do it. I did not dare. Unfortunately, it prevents humanity conflicts, parents and sisters, so we do not have the main character with a feature film. We do not know about its origins or motivations. She's just a woman that is involved in a blind, not only in this difficult section of her life. Obviously, it suffers something, but why should we suffer by the audience? <br /> <br /> I saw him almost completely without watching any movie without a sign. 90 minutes were very sad and painful. Normally, I try to avoid losing unwanted film. I'll take the lead and shoot it, but in this case there is a good warning. Where did Nanou Leopold (especially funded funds) come from this turkey? Of course, there was no writing script. A simple filmmaker could only compensate cinematographic ideas or actors. Nobody, no doubt, "I want to do something from a woman's point of view". The result is insulted as a tribute to women's life perspective. <br /> <br /> To make things worse, no movie was found on the entire film. I can not think of a cast, this could be spiced, but Johanna Ter Steege (small) is in the dark, if possible, this is a lack of material. Leopold tries to imagine trying to direct Maria Kraakman: "Maria, look at the horizon, will shoot you for three minutes to express sadly." Insomnia is the perfect healing. Get a copy and watch it late at night, also guaranteed to sleep. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 1/10
