I indicated another review that Sailor Platoon killed people who were never an endless cycle, died, took medication and trash. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the movie because it really was more, but in a way, I can see what it means: this one did not have a real plot - that is, I agree that it is a point. <br /> <br /> The stone is indulgent with its head is the best. He really wanted to show you how to lead not only to war but also how to survive as traumatized. Unfortunately, it seems that this movie is "praised" and the final champagne, which is the best, means that Oscar's "permanent image creation" is my favorite. <br /> <br /> I have trouble with Stone and with other filmmakers to understand that concept: they do not even retrieve the bloody bloody wreck that contains war. The same thing happened at this time with Iraq. If you are out of this point, let me clearly: the second war was a bloody second and how do you think it was destructive if you saw survivors in the life of the soldiers, did you think it was an unjust war? If only the facts do not persuade the war to be unfair, then why it was necessary to convince the representations of the horrors of Vietnam in that case to go to war. <br /> <br /> Personally, I do not accept the Vietnam decision to go to the American war, but I definitely do not subscribe to the theory that "because this war is wrong because people have died and suffered." I do not think that motivations are always wrong, that the war is a terrible thing. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the end or last "twist" was soft. However, Stones is not the first wrong exit. Wall Street was a great movie until it lasted until the last 30 minutes or "bad bad". JFK is probably one of the few films that Stone has successfully completed. <br /> <br /> But it's hardly worried that until it was short he would draw a short film in that regard. And that's why I gave it a brand so low. Almost the story was short and eventually it was boring, if you fell before the manufacure.
