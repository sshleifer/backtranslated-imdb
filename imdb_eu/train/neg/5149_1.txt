This film focuses on women's rape in New York, a cartoonist / comic book writer who decides to escape from the glamorous big city, and move to a dirty, slow-moving town. Many in the 12th and nowhere. Citizens have a mental illness, but nevertheless, the mad man has invited their trailer. It is the ability to make the annoyance dangerous enough to place it in dangerous circumstances. DB Sweeney's performance was at high school. It is one of those beautiful young actresses with a sweet reflection. Sadly, the career was not good and the mother was in the nature directly. As the previous comment says the author was "really real", I agree. Actually, it was not acting. The two main pathetic, weak and healthy individuals are not able to take it. In short, this movie has no taste, rent it to laugh. Real crime A wooden wooden board trailer - enough to commit murder. And finally, it's an artist / writer, so it can not afford a double gauge trailer and something other than the love of the Sun-yellow Chevy Chevette god!
