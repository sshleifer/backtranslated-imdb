I brought TRAN SCAN to the library and brought it home. Traveling to the east and thinking about how we felt it. The movie has been lost for a long time, if I want to buy it, I would call TRAN SCAM when I saw it costing $ 49. <br /> <br /> The DVD lasted 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride. I feel stomach in Canada all the time I feel badly up and down in the curve with the movie at high speeds. <br /> <br /> You probably thought they were shot and they would probably have been doing a better product. If I want to do this project, I would give more footage, signals that would stop knowing where people knew and to sleep in places where they could see the landscape. It should be 60 to 90 minutes for such a movie. Oh yes, he said the case was out of the stereo, the whole movie was a whistle of a car's quickest sound, at least it could put a bit of music. <br /> <br /> If you want a good transverse movie from Canada, see the latest movie by Buster Keaton. The Canadian Film Commission, which is a Buster Keaton, travels to a Buster Keaton railroad with Scotch Keaton and travels to British Columbia.
