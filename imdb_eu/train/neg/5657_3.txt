I'm a great admirer of Lon Chaney, but it's just for me to write on the screen of this movie. The story jumps surprisingly (I learned that the movie is missing a section), and the characters appear and they disappear with irritation. Some subtitles are very explanatory (for example, "why, you're not a child!") - the photo is cut short and slow - "you are a woman!" Yes, we've got it for the first time), but there are some conversations to ask for explanations that never appear. (Listen to Luigi and her girlfriend arguing with his argument!) On earth, incestuous desires (if it does not mean, technically) implies that it was a disturbing observation that was difficult. Regarding the writer's credit, this problem was treated as a problem, and the May-December game is not considered right and inevitable by some of Mary Pickford's films (for example, "Daddy-Long-Legs"). Chaney gives a good performance, as usual, but I think that it has been better directed in the past - some times here, IMHO. I enjoyed the clown sequences, and I was very surprised at stunts. Loretta Young was charming, though she was very young. The film has its own moments, but so far, it's the least favorite Chaney.
