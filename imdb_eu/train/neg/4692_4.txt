When I saw this movie for the first time, TERROR ON A TRAIN was called, and it was the fourth feature film. Glenn Ford has been called by an expert armament to dissolve a bomb hidden in an explosive train. The tension is slow and stable; Black and white cinema lasts for about an hour and a half. These years later on television; tension and drama has lost its greatest influence. This is still a short film in the early 50's. <br /> <br /> Ford is with Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. Victor Maddern is a generation / villain who plays.
