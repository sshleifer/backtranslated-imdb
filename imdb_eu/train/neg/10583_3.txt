I'm sorry to say that, but acting in this movie is horrible. The conversation is considered as reading for the first time. Maybe I got the "dress rehearsals" version wrong. The manager uses excessive motion during special effects, perhaps as an effort to compensate the agents for their bad performance. The story is pretty well written, and the fighting sequences are really better than watching movies on many occasions. The fights seem pretty real. All of this is happening with the two main actors, once again, with a miracle of survival, with weapons of firearms, grenades, mortars and bazooka. The enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots I have ever seen, especially when they run away from the truck at 30 meters and all the bazaars are at least 50 meters wide. These bazazuca need a serious site calibration.
