It's good to see the preview of this stupid movie. The first film is not real, they play everything. They can not sing. They are full of their heads. It's wonderful. Yes, children between 8 and 10 can enjoy it, but they are really stupid. I mean that their manager is a child. Recording label is false. Stupid Do not see it <br /> <br /> In terms of organization and direction, it is not so bad. It's a nice documentary, but it documents a stupid thing. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it you like good music. It's also very crisp. There is not much taste. That's why I mean ... but that's really a junk.
