I just finished seeing the American Pie: Beta House and I have to say, that is, it was such a garbage stack. The first three American Pies were hilarious, they were the last 3 jokes and should not be called American Pie. <br /> <br /> Since being aware of the title of Beta House, it's about brotherhood, freshmen, girls and, in all, the original part of them. Of course, this guy playing with chicks is Stifler, who tries to complete another seemingly impossible task with his friends. It was unrealistic and super fake. It is predictable and the plot is so weak. The two parties of the University struggle to see what everyone is doing (something like that) In short: a horrible play + dull script + the abuse of American Pie franchise = the total loss of time! This movie is unbearable. I give them ten, but most of them even had lots of nudity and beautiful little girls, like 2 fun scenes:
