From the "MITCHELL" star, "Joysticks" and "Angel Revenge" !!! They're lines that I would usually stop by to watch this movie. And the worst thing is that all the mentioned statements are true !!! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker is eating this film for another five minutes. It's like a bad version of "Coogan's Bluff"
