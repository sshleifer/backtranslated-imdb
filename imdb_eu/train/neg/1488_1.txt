I had to register for this movie to write a comment ... I have a better story than my cats and a string ball. The worst actor I have never seen, but when you delete the whole set of almost everything set in almost five minutes of the movie, you want a little bit. There were no films 'afraid of', except when they watched 'Halloween' on TV. In the whole area, it seems that it might be a good story, it was said that Chasey Lain was said to be a bit lost, and I did not know him immediately and I could not get his scene before. He said 'Yes, there it is.' I'm glad I saw at a hotel and did not pay, to be sure I would be sealed to see if it paid a sense. I usually like it or I can find at least a buffering factor in a movie, but this is an exception. It's so bad, though that's not so funny, it's so bad ... it's just a bad thing.
