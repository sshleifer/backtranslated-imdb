The assumption that a person is captivating about his captive, and the subject is hopeful and interesting to me. However, this is the only interesting part of the 20-year-old Ravi Tandon's "Jawab" (1985) film. Here is the problem Ace director, Rajkumar Santoshi, is the director because he has found himself in some kind of disorder. Fast-paced action-thriller (Khakee) or emotion-rich heavy duty drama (Viz. Damini), and this mix is ​​very obvious the final result. If we leave her Pukar (2000) and two other sides, Lajja (2001), this excellent director has always given us amazing entertainment movies. That's why the movie is a surprise, because this script is a sensitive director due to half of the protagonists of the two protagonists. Amitabh Bachchan and Aryeman. As the film progresses, the viewers do not know who hates and sympathizes with each other, and the main force that limits this narrative factor. So the conflict between ordinary men and a war begins. Self-realization and regret under the ground warns of what went wrong with his family. The revelation of the son of Don, as a real wicked one, is not surprising as compared to a similar "Khakee" element, which worked so effectively with Aishwary's character. That's not all, it's more. Don England thinks he does not look like a life abroad. Mumbai's pursuit of his enemies and the alleged Mumbai landing is not credible. Mr. As with Bachchan's Aryeman, it's not a good idea again. However, the film has the greatest points: Ashok Mehta's camera work, two good fighting sequences (Abbas Ali Moughal coordinator), Akshay Kumar's scenes, clearly interpreted. In the middle part, the rapid rhythm of Santoshi and, of course, Mr. Bachchan, as usual, is trying to get some life alive. But all of them together are not an exciting experience. r and your family!
