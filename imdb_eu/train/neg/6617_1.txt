It really shows that this hype is not everything. Abhishek shows his actress as nonsense and his films due to his father and wife. Amitabh is as strong as ever. Ajay Devan is always the same and it is worthless and the new guy is a joke. The female actor is a residue of an actor. Such pathetic films such as directors and such a big industry such as the industry. So, I see the number of Bollywood movies that I see. <br /> <br /> It's been a bit of a time now for RGV movies. Time to get different actors. Is Hirsh someone? Bollywood needs to return to Madhuri and Kajol. All the other main ladies want to be half-naked. Pffffft.
