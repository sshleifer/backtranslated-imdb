This movie was completely pathetic. An exciting script and missing story, I saw three losers on bikini bikes. Sometimes I felt watching Beavis and a Butthead section. I could not sit across the movie. Emran Hashmik disapproves, and Hrshitta Bhatt is not spectacular. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only part worthy of the film is the discovery of Anu Malik and the obsession of Shayaris. He was horny The songs "Sini Ne" and his remix version were very good. Always Emran can have a lipstick locking and lip synchronization. In the end, Emra seems like a good script at Bhatts does not look like this one.
