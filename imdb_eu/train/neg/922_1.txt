When you get exactly what this movie gets you, your skills are like someone you're getting older. After testing one season, it's like someone who punches in the Formula 1 Grand Prix (I can add the Grand Prix of the United States, as everyone can get out of it) and maybe you can win this movie. Now I do not take it in a bad way, I love B-Movies, about half of my collection has been made by B-Movies, but I do not think the letter in the alphabet is enough to describe this movie as bad. > <br /> The first story (for a B-Movie) is not so bad, it's a B-Movie brand, it's not possible to speak on Friday, but it's not potential. But it is actually a play that avoids this film; The second one is nothing to believe, it's like watching QVC, except those that tend to be so heavily QVC's presenters. <br /> <br /> I would like to sum up. I've seen worse films, but I can not.
