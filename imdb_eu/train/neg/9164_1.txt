I must first approach, saying that I am a great romantic. That's why I wanted this movie. So I write my thoughts from the afflictions I feel to save others. The Leap Years tells Li-Ann's patty-filled story that suaves Jeremy down and visits every year. A romantic premise, based on a great story and unlike a movie by Jack Neo. So why is that so bad? First of all, filmmakers believe I was shooting a video clip, replacing the storyteller with cheesy tasks, with planned actions and topical lines. I feel so bad and I've been one of Singapore's first years to watch The Leap Years, but in film, I agree that our performances have been sung by the supposed ideas they deserve. Forever Fever, hoping to see a romantic movie that surpasses the best romantic comedy so far in Singapore, and The Leap Years does not even approach. Some blogs call "Crap Years" hard but true. Do not lose your money or emotions as I have done. The film will love you forever.
