She loved my 7 year old daughter, as Disney's director crassly figured out. That's it with "Air Buddies". It is a rigorously composed baby of a strictly calculated number, a couple that is morally correct, and a humorous enough humor to avoid G's fear. As a parent, or as a 10-year-old, you've seen it before and done it better. Think about "101 Dalmatians Home Alone" and you get a general idea. I think good children's story is a good story. It is as original as recycled paper that "Air Buddies" does not comply with this standard. Not the worst video that your child sees, but there are better megaton.
