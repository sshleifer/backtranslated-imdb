When I saw the commercial, I saw everything. Now, forgive me, but it has not been so long ago, I do not remember how it went. As I said, I saw the movie was not similar to "movie". <br /> <br /> I was bored, I was annoyed and I was extremely disappointed with this film. And if it were not enough, they had to sink into a terrific reggae music. It's not a musical horror for a horror movie, eh mon? If you have never seen a commercial (or a trailer, I suppose), do you think this is a hot thing. To make my money, trade was better.
