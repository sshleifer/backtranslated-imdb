This is undoubtedly one of the best figures of Lucio Fulci. The plot is pretty bad, a millionaire dies, and he tells his daughter to find out who has done it. But I have this the main problem (apart from knowing that they have died within 10 minutes of watching the movie), why should they be asked? Father is getting the most outgoing (that is, his daughter who asked for help), and that's why it's hard to take care of someone to kill. But nobody really looks at Fulci's film to get a good storyline. For this, it would be a screenwriting and an incredible porn movie. Usually, his film tries to try to add too many gore scenes, but it's also missing in this movie. If you are looking for a full movie, look at The Beyond.
