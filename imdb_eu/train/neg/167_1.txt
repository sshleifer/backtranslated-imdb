Anyone who has been a fan of the original series, or even a story-telling story, this series has to be ashamed. Borg has not come until Qa Enterprise brings it to the Gamma sector. Although Klingon has never seen Kirk before it comes to Kirk, it was the first ship to carry the NCC-1701 Enterprise Enterprise ... I need it? Berman and Pillars make mockery of Gene Roddenberry's creation. When they died, they only saw $$$$ and only went their way. It's not surprising that Majel Barrett was in this series of star training sessions. I do not blame him for not having been involved with his illness. Poor cassock He is an excellent actor, even full cast. I like everything, but the story is tragic and all the precedents set by the original series are rejected. Check the ratings. I think more people saw the Deep Space 9 (which was definitively canceled).
