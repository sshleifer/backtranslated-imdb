I'm sitting there, forcing this to end. I think I gave it to 6 VSB I was hanging out. I remember about 4 or 5 years ago when Internet "Worlds of War" caused rumors of Spielberg's film, and I lost the early series of the 90's. According to the website, in the classic book, it was given a budget of several million dollars. It was "a perfect translation". This is a perfect CRAP movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie's video was lined up! It seems that I was watching Full Motion Video on a PC game or Playstation CD-Rom video game in the mid-90s. Unfortunately, color quality was similar. The dramatic "Shattered Break" of the popular Shatners appeared to be apparent in Shakespeare's quality. The performance of different scenes was awful, and the green screens were worse than seen in the ancient scenes of the Dukes of Hazard. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it's slow and terribly drawn. I was about 45 minutes of the video (at the beginning I did not have any promotion) before the first foreigner opened the cylinder. Then the aliens were very harmful CG chips. It's been an hour and I've seen most of the foreign ones I've seen is a rigid whirlwind record (without arms) attached to a mechanical arm. Dramatic scenes have made too many instruments. This last thing, because of a foreign invasion in the early 1900s, no one worries about their lives. The concept is like that. Even though the media is slow, the mouth is spreading and people will know it. Night and night "excitement" was moving. People simply change color purple, blue or green, is NOT NIGHT TIME. Perhaps some illumination and real night-shots would be much more excited. There's not a lot of wandering around in the movie when you watch "heroine" on a gallop or on a stupid road. Make the movie. I know how people move, you do not have to be deep. <br /> <br /> Now, they'll show you an hour and a half in the movie and foreign machines. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers looked better. They also learned about the skeletons of steamed men by encouraging a student at a high school computer application. Animations do not match the landscape. <br /> <br /> If you want to close people and want the "World War", do one of the four things. 1) Check the original 1953, 2) See the 90's series, 3) Wait for Spielbergen to soon publish the translation, OR 4) Read the book of fricks (something that we did in the basic English class). YOU CAN KNOW HIDE Your money is a waste.
