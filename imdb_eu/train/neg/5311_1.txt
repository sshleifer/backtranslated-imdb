It's the worst movie ever you can watch! 2012 Doomsday today removes this rug for me. The backstitch is Frank Zappa's definitive example of the definitive "cheepnis". The space scene seems to have been made in a 1950s power station before the demolition. Music is really awesome. It's wood and ham. The portraiture characters are superficial and convincing. Land can be predicted. It is immediately and clearly evident when copying techniques and ideas from other films. The supposed quality of climbers. <br /> <br /> But you should see it, only to see what you need to be one of the biggest waste of a tiny budget. The most precious example of a stupid movie!
