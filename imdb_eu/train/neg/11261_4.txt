To start, I have to feel completely lost in more than half an hour. Yes, some things happen, but you do not know why or what to do. When you finally get things done, you realize that only opera is twisted, prostitutes adults, mothers dead, illegal children ... the characters are quite poor and the actors (especially young people) do not seem to be much credible. Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but she is an excellent actor, despite the fact that the movie is just a waste. <br /> <br /> The positive thing about "Fr√≠o Sol De Invierno" seems like Pablo Malo is the debutant. good intentions, and shot two scenes of great intensity ... Well maybe next time ... <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
