Do not waste 90 minutes in your time "Fast Food, Fast Women". With three story lines, the story is an episodic script that is annoying, predictable writing, dramatic play, and bad music. I found the main anorexic person to see every time I was on the screen. It needs fast food. <br /> <br /> You spend about 90 minutes in the Indian winery doing something more exciting ... painted like one. You should have more recreation values. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is redeming about this movie is Louise Lasser, but it's far better than this exhausting script. It's the man with the oldest movie. <br /> <br /> AUDIENCE Be careful!
