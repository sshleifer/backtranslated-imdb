I think it's pretty safe to say that it's the worst movie I ever made when I saw the TV trailer in the second, I knew this would be a part of it, and it would be better to avoid it, but I was dragged by some friends when I saw it. I went into the movies with the lowest expectations, but I was hoping he would have a couple of rumors in this movie. The so-called "jokes" in this movie tightens the face; above all, people who come to the face and to the balloon. The baby is a curious look and it acts like a ridiculous gangsta today's garbage comedy. The movie is obvious and the story is impossible to believe, but it is pre-eminent and sad. The characters are very annoying and stereotyped. I do not want to see the movie again, I'd rather take a bullet on foot, than ever again. If I see one, I would like to have a physically frustrated face
