Simply the quality I expected in Morris (Love Brass Eye and Blue Jam). This is not a bad student movie. What worries me, all this Why did BAFTA win? Morris laughs in a lot of his work (Nathan Barley), and yet, with that piece, he gets the backs of a talker and rains! <br /> <br /> I hope I have chosen a topic that I would like (Terrorism Humanity - Lau Lions), that is not to be thought of, giving it an opportunity to warn about it. the phenomenon of the fascinant phenomenon of familiarity and opinion.
