I do not think they made this movie. Utterly useless The first movie was okay. But there was no sequel, no doubt, after a television series following the first film. This movie feels like a soap opera. Writing is so bad, it's very easy. The jokes are not found, the play is flat, shot like soap, it lacks direction. The first movie had a good spine on the spine. All the characters had a small arch. It was very easy then, but I worked in some way and I saw the merit of that movie. But this time, there is no coherence. The characters are stereotyped sad and nothing interesting happens. One thing: Brazilian Brazilian with Axel Daeseleire's son is doing well. This was a great success in this film. I've heard that they have filmed a second TV show that it's a continuation of the 'Team Spirit 2', but please God, do not let a third movie make an extension ...
