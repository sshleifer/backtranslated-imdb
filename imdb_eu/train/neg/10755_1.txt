I can hardly imagine that the artistic traits of this poor performance of Asimov are more than direction. Disappointment of the neglected product, Will Smith and the performance of the biggest holes in comparison. This was not only spectacular and painful. Action was also boring. MTV is a mixture that can be very small, the production values ​​and the bad conversations can be very minor Dark City, to a lesser extent, the same director. This really goes into the top 100 list. It's really awesome.
