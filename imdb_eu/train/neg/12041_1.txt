Well, did they start? That is, in the long run, one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I do not tell the story itself, it's a wonderful classic, but here it feels like a chunk. To start, the performance, except for Eric Bana, is the quality of the telenobia. I've always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here, The Bold and Beautiful actors are ashamed. Camera action is not helpful too. When he thinks how to last, Brooke Forrester returns to the lab! Peter O'Toole has had a very bad plastic surgery, or one needs desperation. In any case, Linda Evans is like Linda Evans! And to finish my comments, Diane Kruger is a pretty girl, but she is not sure of the Trojan Helenik. Peterson preferred to choose the role of Saffron Burrows as Elizabeth Taylor would now be quite confused.
