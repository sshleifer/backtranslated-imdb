I buy at least six movies in the Seagall. Good movies and poor stories, bad camera and personal career, almost lost me. How many films did he remember about how to make a decent movie. Now it's forgotten again. This movie is dark (at any level you name it). There are a lot of people going inside and doing here, without a distinctive goal, as if it were not a military warning. Seagall may have a lot of stability for its scenarios. They used to tell too much darkness and the voice of others was used for most of the time. Unfortunately, only one interesting character escaped from his guard and began to ruin his havoc in all places. Okay, when will we place an armed guard in a private space with an inmate? However, the bad guy was, at least, colorful, and very focused. You really like the king if you like it. It seems bad bad they had the same treatment every time. I'm glad I peeled blood from their bloodless victims. I will return to my summary. Basically a horror movie is dressed as a movie act. Dec 6.2006
