I think Elisabeth Rohm, despite trying hard, is not very good. I think maybe that price could only be achieved for that price. I especially saw Myron Natwicken's work, which I know very well. <br /> <br /> It was the most believable and undoubtedly credible view. When it was not on the screen, the thing was dead. He was shot in Vancouver. He gave me my hair, but make sure that in real life, a man is compassionate and kind. He said he was playing that role. <br /> <br /> I see something in it, but Elisabeth Rohm - never. It was exciting as Law and Order as exciting. Maybe the person is nice, but he's not an actress.
