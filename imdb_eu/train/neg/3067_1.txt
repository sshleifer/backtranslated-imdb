This is just a bad thing. Sometimes remakes, although they divert the original, are good. They can lead to a different perspective, and they achieve a certain interpretation, which is unique and enjoyable. It was as bad and thoughtful as this. That did not have any good. Viggo Mortenson is a brilliant actress, but some of the roles and projects' selections leave it all the way. The original "Vanishing Point" was an exciting and psychological adventure; This is not an adventure and it's not pleasant or entertaining. One of the Hollywood movies that someone supposedly sees as filmmakers is making film-based plots full of movies. In essence, they look like idiot bundles. It's insubstantial to say that someone is a feature film, and even this sloppily attempt to remake a classic worship. The manipulative graphical devices, "make obvious, so do not miss" points, ridiculous conversation, stereotypical characters, amateur directions ... <br /> <br /> This is a bad thing ...
