"Valentine" is a horror movie that can be added to the movie stalk and slash movie (think "Halloween", "Friday 13th", "Scream" and "What to do next summer"). Without a doubt, it's not as good as the ones that I've written about them, but it's better than most of the violations that appeared after the "Friday 13" movie. One of these films was disqualified with the 1981 movie "My Bloody Valentine". "Valentine" is better than that movie, but there's not much to say. Plots: A young nerd boy pressed a couple of his teammates and pranked at the beginning of the movie. After that, the films move a few years later when all of these classmates grow up, and then they are selected individually. The murderer is believed to be a young boy, who is looking for vengeance. But is it? Or somebody else? "Valentine" is an attractive work, including Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw and Katherine Heigl. They can do everything they can with the material, but the script does not do justice. However, there are some scary times. <br /> <br /> ** (4)
