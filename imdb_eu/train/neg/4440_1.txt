I'm clear. I used the IMDb for every year. But, nowadays, I got trouble registering on the site so we can give the best possible evaluation of this film. I have seen hundreds of movies, some evil, some awful. Never, however, I have a similarity and I can see the contrast of disability, ambitions and failure. <br /> <br /> The princess Mira Sorvino is terribly, but it's incredible Phocion, a young boy. Fiona Shaw's character is always entertaining, but the movie's conversation is even worse, even in the French-language theater scene (Marivaux never reached Hollywood, so we should keep it). > <br /> For example, for example, Leontine is a passionate and fascinated philosopher and scientist who is chemically emitted from the beaker, who names the famous names of scientists. And the love between Agis and princess is even more sillier. To this end, couples should receive the 'Clair Danes' award, which, in a fair world, would give a reinterpretation of anachronistic and inspirational non-literate literature of interesting teenage literature from the 1990's (see Miss Danes Les Miserables). <br /> <br /> Apart from terrific plot and conversation, some attempts are made to enter into artificial films. For example, there is a generosity of the audience and moments that are forgotten, sitting in the chairs and seeing the main characters. The director wants to realize that he has adapted a play. I understand But it does not happen in the film any way. At that moment, for a moment watching the crowd sitting on the benches, then disappear, it is horrible and attentive. Zombies are like a kind of non-dreadful crowd, at dusk, they frighten us. When you see the hateful and singing ending the movie, we can think of your zombie crowds and kill them all in 112 minutes. <br /> <br /> McGuire
