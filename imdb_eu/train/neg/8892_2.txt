You must acknowledge that this version disassociates Shakespeare upfront! Nobody was my fault except for the nurse! Julie had good skills as a teenager, but she can not give her deep emotion, and we can never connect to her. The worst thing is when the scene is facing sleep ... God stops crying! I could throw it in his mouth to close it! Anthony Andrews ... yikes! Taking into account other excellent films (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), this is a great surprise. And do not start to Rome ... puhleasssssee! You are still watching to see all the Romeo and Juliet in the history of cinema. Olivia and Leonard are the best versions, Leslie Howard's version and subsequent Leo and Clare version.
