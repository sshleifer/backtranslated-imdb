One of the demands of science fiction, before starting to become a satire, is sensible. I think that an anti-bomb matter would cause more damage. But I will leave physicists who can see the sun crisis. <br /> <br /> The crisis in front of the Earth is due to the fact that the sunglasses are completely out of date. They are approaching the earth, as if it were so timeless, as if the whole Territory were like Death Valley. The answer is that it is an anti-matter bomb that springs from the sun and a spacial material. This will turn off the roots, say the direction of Mercury, if it is not directly aligned with the Earth. <br /> <br /> Who should deliver, but Captain Tim Matheson and his team. So, he can move his head forward, and not the elusive child, Corin Nemec. Caring for personal side effects of family affairs Charlton Heston is the admirer, Matheson's father and grandfather of Nemez. <br /> <br /> There is also something here, Peter Boyle, who is the director of the national corporation. This crisis is trying to control the supply of food that survived in the world. The idea of ​​survival is not included in his thinking. He strives to sabotage the mission of Matheson. <br /> <br /> The 2001 Solar Crisis in 2001 seems to be a bad mix of Space Odyssey and Downstream. Boyle seems like Gene Hackman leads Lex Luthor's Superman. Apparently, it is the only one that indicates that there is a turkey and it is consistent accordingly. real blue and dull. Perhaps except for the desert mouse, Jack Palance finds Nemec and looks after him. <br /> <br /> It is important for the film, directed by Hollywood directed by Allen Smithee Hollywood flop. In the case of more than four stars, the cast is involved and a craft has been thanked for.
