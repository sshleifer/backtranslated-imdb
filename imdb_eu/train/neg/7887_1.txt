... then they will have the right place to send this waste. Sorry, it's not a "mystery" claim, it's a religious mumbo-jumbo. They promised me that I was waiting for the "unimaginable nasty", but the "evil" of this film could not only be five years old with learning disabilities. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that some of the great actors who really managed to get ready to participate in this shame. Sadly, my opinion has always changed, and I will probably avoid everything that is happening in the future. I will also remember the name of a writer and the name of the director, which I would avoid nowadays. <br /> <br /> It is very unhappy that everything is published by religious fanatics here and 10 by 10 films, etc. They say that they will publish their opinions for the first time. This could have deceived the people, as I did, that this film might have been something other than the religion's preaching. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Well, I'll go to the video store to get my money back to get false advertising. I thought it was a bad thing, they could not get 105 minutes earlier, it was a Hollywood horror and supernatural movie.
