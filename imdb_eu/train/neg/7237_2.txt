Life is like a short film. I know it was not a good thing when I realized what I suspected - that David Schwimmer was playing the same type of 'Friends' that he plays. <br /> <br /> Please, yes. The guy can not just play a nerd or never give up any other part. I feel like it's two mixtures. <br /> <br /> And I must say that it is very difficult for Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol to wasted their great talents. Kane !!!
