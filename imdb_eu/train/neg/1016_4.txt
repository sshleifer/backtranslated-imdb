The movie itself is not bad; Many comments point out clear screenwriting errors, but it's a clock. What really drives me, people like Justin Timberlake, is what they get from movies and even what they are like. I must admit that I have never seen the name of the man, but that was when I was annoyed. The voice is empty, his face is rough, and his position is horrible, and he can not coordinate them correctly. I said, I was glad that he was jumping after leaving the disk, I hoped they would only be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. I was very bad. Both these and LL Cool J provide a decent performance, which is why I give you the main reason. <br /> <br /> I see a lot of films coming from small Timberlake cast ... and I can not believe it.
