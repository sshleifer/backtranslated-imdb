I watched the night movie and I was disappointed. The "event of time" many disappeared. At the beginning of the film, Grandpa grew up grandson and grandson in the 9-11s. This film was thought to have taken place in 1994. Also, one of her grandson dressed in an Eagles Donovan McNabb sweater. He still has not yet written. The story line was good, but the timing and the current facts were a long way from the movie. My boyfriend, books and memos of World War II are a passionate reader. I rented this movie because I expected it was good. The performance was so. The dog was pretty. But I was pleased with the way the movie was made, I only paid 4 dollars to rent, before I was 50, I was watching at the theater. I hope someone who reads understands that those who fought against the war did not mean any distress, but events and times would be a little more careful.
