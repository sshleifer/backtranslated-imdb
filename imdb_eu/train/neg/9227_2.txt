CQ was the worst movie I ever saw this year. The movie we are going to watch at the theater is almost something to entertain or say. This film resembles a film called his Intro. Film-making class. Father plays great movies. He made his good sister. But brother Roman? NO! A critique had courage to compare this movie to Godard's Le MÃ©pris (mesprime). Coppola, while Jr. took the same idea, a film about cinema, it seemed to be very hard on European, artistic, and spiritual, when everything is just kitsch. The main actor carries the same expression throughout the film, swore or acts as a horrible movie. Schwartzman is somehow a director. Depardieu is okay It's the only scene with a real movie humor, surprisingly, the B-movie scenes, but what happens in Italian Italian; The assembly of the cars of very different characters, in a very small car, guides random people and drops. The film reminded me that the only thing that was trying to guess it was. Or removal. Or both. He has played a documentary that speaks of the camera and shoots several objects, was labeled at the end as "twisted" or artistic value ... The funniest movie of this film was the same film. and not in that way. It's not surprising that this movie is back after editing a festival or re-editing it or whatever it is, before it's something bad. I can not believe it can be worse than that. If you want to see a good movie parody, watch Austin Powers. Any of them This third film, open to the cinema, is very entertaining and passionate. Lil 'Romy, for cinema, please translate your cousin's music videos. Leave Godfathers to daddy.
