I was not surprised about this movie, especially when I went to the movies with faith in my family, to see a movie in the UK 12A certified. In my opinion, this film was shy with sexual jokes. (I do not have a problem as an adult, but it is not appropriate for children to see it). Sometimes this movie was very raw with some templates, crucifixes and others ... and a great part of the fun movie. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie is Calvin. The 2-inch miniature modes are taken out of prison and stolen a giant diamond, but they must be put on a women's bag. Therefore, he sees that the rest of the film passes through the abandoned child as a child, in order to get that diamond in the women's home. <br /> <br /> So far, I have enjoyed most of my Wayans Brothers production - but this film is definitely a cookie. <br /> <br /> It's a good advice, wait until TV or cable
