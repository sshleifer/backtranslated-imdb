Yes, definitely better than watching the death tunnel. Actually, some death was quite original and it was gore decent. It looks like a bad look like it looks like Hills Eyes. <br /> <br /> BATH: 1.) "Children" (high school or university?) When they discuss the horror movies in the kitchen, Shae says everything. In Scream (1996) almost exact budget. Girls among the big girls and so on. The same thing happened. 3.) What happened in October, what happened to the movie with Samhain? You ask me pretty much in vain. When I see the horror movies of the '80s, I will point out the druids or pentagram below when they see the ends. <br /> <br /> 4.) Wowek made reference to Sam Raimi !!! 5.) Why was Gary and her sister in the movie? Being a character has nothing to do with. And is it so psychic that he can not see his death? 6.) When Gary's bathroom died (then the deaths became Troma-licious). How did he hear the shouts at the bottom, but when he had heard the door, he heard them? 7.) Gary's sister says Haggishates, especially a Scottish dish, not an Irishman. 8)> So, the lesson is like Shae and you will not give any fun or a smile. full movie, will you live? 9.) Mutants were pretty nice, but they seemed like Chili con carne dishes. <br /> <br /> 10. When Gary's sister brought her, they forgot that Steve HAD was shocked and asked where he was going? 11.) Is not it more than one killer? Shae won, but never found any more of them. 12.) What was it with the flashbacks of other people? Half of them did not know that Shae was dead or alive, so what was it with? 13.) Why did not Gary and her sister die before they died? 14.) Why does not anyone call the police? And everyone seems to know that people lived in the woods, why never organized an attack? 15.) As I know, they did not have zombies or vampires. So finally how would he become? I'm with the giant's "huh?" end <br /> <br /> It's a better way than a death tunnel, but still quite wrong. I still can not understand why they put Ireland, because Samhain had nothing to do with the plot.
