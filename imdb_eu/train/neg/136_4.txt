*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Teen slasher movies are being born on the original? It seems terribly. First of all, the well-used premise is noble. Does a young nerd that is getting older dismisses and kills all the women tortured in vain? You can not work. But this film is made like the last slasher of all. It can be predicted at all angles of the outer camera exactly when a false alarm arrives and when the killer will strike. Now we know the model. Slasher, the stupid movies, are pushing credibility letters more and more. I am asking myself: who in his head will surprise his friend in the middle of the night in a dark and dark morgue and will be amazed by the blue and only when his body is surrounded? Does that make any sense? <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is innovative from time to time. A good shot ends with Denise Richards. He is trapped in the pool and the killer has a killer with a chainsaw. Soundtrack songs are good, including a cool Orgy track. The music video is part of the DVD features. <br /> <br /> Although the plays have no helmets. All actors sleep through their duties. Of course, David Boreanaz is often stoic, even though he appears as a character called "Angel". Denise Richards is a good actress, but the whole movie maintains a stone. <br /> <br /> As you would expect from "Valentine": unforgiving, impossible, unforgettable, cheesy and frightening. vision. Do not worry too. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 (from 10)
