I felt this movie a thousand times before I saw it. It was totally predictable. Every time I tried to twist a story, whenever I expected something interesting to happen, I only saw what I expected. As a "factory of oven opened another facility, there was not enough bread." In both words: a flat story, a song, a bad performance, a bad special effect ... The republican Vlad, the silent boy, was only fun when he was punished by the bad guys. It was terribly stupid. for a moment laughs at me. I wonder why I missed the time whispering on this insolence ... It's not worse (because it's not possible): D
