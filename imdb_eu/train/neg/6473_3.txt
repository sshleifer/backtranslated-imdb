As a child, the first division ("The Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie. It was full of characters, songs and family movies. One week before I saw the movie again for the first time. I think this movie was a feature film and it was not the original. I think that I feel like I had a great hope and I grew up. However, it's not a bad movie. <br /> <br /> A beautiful son born to Ariel, Melody begins. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgan (the sister of Eursel); So they build a large wall around the house on the sea. As melody grows, it begins to ask the outside walls, outside where it was forbidden. Difficulties arise while Morgan tries to control seven seas. <br /> <br /> I do not want to watch the movie, to find out. I wanted to say that the voices are the same and wonderful songs. I think the family is a good movie in general!
