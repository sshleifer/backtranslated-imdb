This has been one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm generally praised for any movie because of some of the aspects of production, but the more intense behavior than half the characters have been more difficult for me. Any part of this film. <br /> <br /> The most common building was the block that was the result of falling into a mountaineer's fault. Not ok <br /> <br /> In addition, mountaineering slalom style is required. Running at 10 feet on trees will not work. Oh, it's here. As we have already mentioned, it is the fault and stupidity of some of the characters. In a closed space, with a limited oxygen of four years, you do not want to start a fire, it's not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Regardless, it takes around 5 minutes of the film and appreciates it. However, if you have little intelligence, you will get a great deal of this film too hard. <br /> <br /> I produce so much quality story, and yet someone has to do something like that. <br /> <br /> Oh, have I mentioned the last five minutes? Well, you need to follow a hint to see a new hiker technique. Priceless
