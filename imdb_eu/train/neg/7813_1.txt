In my eyes, this is an excellent example of Hollywood's ego, only by the new King Kong film. Superman is the original super hero, and he deserves respect, even though he is wearing stockings. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen, since the start of the movie, he'll just put a cryptonite into his throat. The dress looks like a fool. Although enough, Kate Bosworth chose poorly in terms of lois lane. It looks like a reference, but this movie is like a schoolboy. The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, it's really a superman son, who would ever think ...) and acting was awful. This movie has a good thing and it's called Kevin Spacey. It was a great portrait of Lex Luthor, but he did not even save the movie. This movie was "lois and clark" (except Kevin Spacey) and another story. I saw this movie "I saw the hills look up" and I swore to know that there were worse films.
