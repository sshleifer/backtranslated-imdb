This movie is a bad news and I'm really surprised by the level of talents of the same name, that is, to make it look like that litter. I imagine some agents covered in Hollywood Blvd. Due to this fiasco. What he really does is that he could be good. The director was a huge resource and topic to sell enough forage and selling interests, but this is a flop. Multi-story lines make the end of the pictures bad and nonsensical and at the end you feel like a mouse in a maze that searches part of the rotting cheese. The hope that Spike achieved is dependency when it was a baby or was insulted against the Italians, but rather a number of films that are obsolete and obsolete in Italian stereotypes. As with Spike Lee, there are some really thought-provoking and thought-provoking cameras. It has a gift for catching your psyche and carrying it in your view, only for some memorable scenes. But the question remains ... you're doing 2 hours more from the head and watch the clock, and you'll have to wait for the end to be somewhere.
