Nicolas Roeg? Play a supernatural thriller DO NOT LOOK NOW? Surprisedly, the aforementioned movie was released on BBC this weekend, because tonight COLD HEAVEN has never helped anyone. <br /> <br /> It is unlikely that COLD HEAVEN does not compare DON`T LOOK NOW, because both have the same director and the same structure, and I also thought about the first third of COLD HEAVEN. Unlike a single husband, he was replaced instead of the dead child, in fact, a film that was lit around my widow's head, his husband was late in Venice wearing a red ankle. This is not the case, but there is a short drawing around a whole length of the route and, despite being an indispensable plot, there is not much depth. In fact, very little has been said about the fact that the movie COLD HEAVEN has ruined <br /> <br /> People have mentioned the pretty bad productions of COLD HEAVEN and it is impossible to distract them. If I had not been different, I thought it was a TVM, because they came to white letters with sequencing titles for television. Roeg intends to inject the thoughts of the art home through oral thought processes, but it does not help the film again. It is not possible for Roeg to feel the effort to make it flat on the screen when it comes to the red line. <br /> <br /> The inexpensive production costs, disinterest leadership and a really bizarre premise and bad script make a bad movie.
