For me, it's a story that begins with some funny jokes related to fanatical franchises when traveling to a business meeting ... The problem is that you will see that this movie is seen for an hour. The same fantasies and funny situations again and again. It's predictable. It can be done as a TV story, where you can go and return without missing anything. <br /> <br /> I like Felix Hernandez Frank, but that's not enough. There's more to be a comedy. Changes and types of message about audiences. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
