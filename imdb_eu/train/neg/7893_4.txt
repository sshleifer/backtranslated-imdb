At first we see the beginning of a secret kind of kind of council. It seems totally promising. Alongside supernatural elements, the mystery becomes more interesting for a moment. The main character seems like a good block creates problems because it has the right to money (temptation) and other factors. You really think about the guy and know what's wrong. Usually a person in his situation will have several options. Somehow, he has no choice. It seems to be the only solution in this film, although it is not his fault. From blue, he meets the church, the prayer and the people who speak about God. And they answer their problem. This point of this solution should be clear. Now, say, there is nothing wrong with this message. It is always helpful. But it was really necessary to hide this message. This religious item ruined my visual experience. Although it is a good message, simplicity can not be avoided in real life to solve the issues presented in this film. The mystery we present is never fixed. Then you are forced to face another issue that is unrelated to the plot. Do not be fooled by Malcolm McDowell. Once the actor is perfect, it will be very serious, but if you look closely. He really needs money. Otherwise, what kind of actress would be to act on such a movie.
