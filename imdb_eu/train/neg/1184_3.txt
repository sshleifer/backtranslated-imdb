This movie is pretty good, but the paste was very slow ... very slow. Although somebody thinks it's a classic worship, I think there are many better films in that era. sounds good. good lighting <br /> <br /> I still would not recommend it to the cinema student. <br /> <br /> The movie has no music, and the horses are doing well with sex. and the woman who was masturbating on the bedside was stupid. <br /> <br /> Here there was no profit, without any boredom. I think it's worse, but this is time lost, and I do not have good comments here. especially high scores ...
