Probably the worst movie ever made by the New Zealander <br /> <br /> Jokes are not fun. In other films, it's just honest. Although the play is very bad, even if there is a big boot <br /> <br /> The story is not interesting and boring 1000 times before <br /> <br /> I saw it when I arrived on TV, but it was so boring that it was 30 minutes I could not. <br /> <br /> This movie sucks <br /> <br /> Do not watch it, <br /> <br /> Look at dry paint instead
