Wait, do not tell me ... they throw the movie out and they're out. You know, this movie could be filmed on a back street in New York. I think it's "Gangster Bangster." Gangster Rap, a designer gangster duster clothing, somehow wearing a neck scarf to protect the head from the neck. I think it was protective of the head with K-Mart hat filters. Apparently, "a quote-horsie quote" is provided for horses. The little girl who was talking to the bedroom and the guy who spoke her words ... even though she was talking. You know, it is just confirm that you watch this movie, there's nothing more about acting ... about the look and money. Could not be too much about this movie. Well, in short, I think that this movie has ever been made worse. Just another thing, where was Ice T? Was he finally going with Oprah?
