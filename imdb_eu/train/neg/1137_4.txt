Two times I tried to get this movie, I got the first time and it was like pulling the teeth, and for the second time it failed to make a DVD transfer. Problem? It's much boring. <br /> <br /> You can get to the dramatic scene court that takes the most part in the second half, but it is difficult for that. "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) has interesting lectures at the trial. At the end Lincoln touches and overlaps the statue of his Memo on the screen. <br /> <br /> The story is nice, well-interpreted and ... but it will not be the spark in the first semester and will offer it. see hanging there. I think that the real Abe Lincoln film was much more interesting than that.
