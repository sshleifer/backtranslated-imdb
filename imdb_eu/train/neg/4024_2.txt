This movie is very strange. John Savage, the poor man, had to go downstairs to be in another movie. To clean and throw rare vampires is to help a lady like a dancers from a local strip club. Supposedly, another dancer tasted a drop of blood, it is one of those strange vampires, while the dressing room goes out on the floor. A short head of this strange Vampire race coincides with the 80s punk rock and Olsen twin hair. This movie is totally crazy for Savage, who is dancing and rapping, with a spotted tattoo on his head, rare. He mentioned Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante and I was laughed. That's just it. Then, the most extraordinary effect that Corri could cause himself to throw out his organs and put them in their mouths. And you can say that all is false. His son does not know what his moms do with his new personality and makes him more plague than plague. I enjoy a good vampire movie, believe me, but that's why I am. The photo is also astonished, the camera fades to change the camera and try to keep it fast with the camera, and then turns the camera into a bright after the Savage son. Around Corri until he blinds himself. Avoid this!
