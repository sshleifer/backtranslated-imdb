I saw this trailer and I thought that my real goddess movie, who would like to see this movie and at the same time, I thought, my girlfriend turned to me and said "we have to watch the movie." ... Once I said, so I saw it going around 5 minutes and I tried to boldly face it and enjoy cheap scares but they were not one of them either. I've never seen that the director does not have the impression that the movie in the view should be one of the same shots that were used repeatedly and he did not believe in the suspense that cast was probably just a screaming voice run said. I would like the script in the first 40 minutes when I saw most annoying and bad music, there was no character development. <br /> <br /> The plot just ... basically was not plots, I know we will terrify a high school group, with a stalker serial killer at night promise, that's great! Hmmm Expected in an Australian hope that was expected to play, the main character of the Blondie divine lake was angry with me. The longest line had to be half a sentence, and when each camera was in it, he just pulled a dirty face. <br /> <br /> Please, let me hear if you liked it, do not see it, and if you do not like it and if you do not have it right, I'd like a good luck, maybe an ipod or magazine. This movie can not be believed!
