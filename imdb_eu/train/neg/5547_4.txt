ZOMBIA SUSTAINABLE (2 star five stars) No, this is not the old ancestor of the classic zombie movie George A. Romero. It is a low budget potoiler, probably it seemed very cool to the audience at that time ... but it seems very strange these days. It's really a good scene for a soldier to drop a gun with a zombie soldier ... and there is a good scene at the beginning, and you would enter a bare chest of one of them. The effect of these days is apparently apparent, but in 1936 I am sure that the public disturbed them. Story looking for secret control of mind ... apparently unstoppable to create an army of zombies ... but then to win a woman who loved a character as a resource. The film lasts for only a few hours, but it's slipping into the snail's tempo, so it seems long, believe it! It's not really recommended ... it's recommended that you use "swamp" from a star's "scenery" to fake star studios. Endless is interesting ... so at least once should watch the movie. You can see more than $ 5 in Wal-Mart's "4 DVDs 1 DVD" compilation. Hey, it's worth the money ...
