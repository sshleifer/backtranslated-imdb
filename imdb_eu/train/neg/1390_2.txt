I'm a fan of B5, and I'm only caught by the end of three seasons. When I was syndicated, I observed all the previous seasons, I thought it was one of the best architecture of the stories to make it ever closer to television. Excerpts were also interesting. The films were also well-produced and entertaining could go to theaters. <br /> <br /> This leads us to 'Soul of River'. Of course, after seeing everything else, I had a lot of hope. Martin Sheen seems to be performing in Ed Wood, but Sci-Fi is a serious story. The story itself might have been a good idea, even if it was taken to the storyboard. However, of course, the two-hour movie came to meet this notion. There is no special effect to be entertained before the credible story. It seems that there were little places and a story that improvised the conversation. If it had been a regular season, the worst part would be.
