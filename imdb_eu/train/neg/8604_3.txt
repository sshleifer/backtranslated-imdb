Mike Brady (Michael Garfield, a small part of the classic "The Warriors") realizes that the first person in the community in a small town realizes that slums are dead. It's not just slugs, minds, but the carnivorous killer is normal when it is transformed by the sludge of toxic waste (it's still just as fast as a normal slug, but it's not terrifying, but I'm digressing it). Nobody believes in the beginning, but they will do it anyway. Well, they'll do it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Pardon-free factor Under the childhood of Mork, psychotic strains and the right are above Johnathan Winters. So everything is nonsense evident. The movement is very fun and the variety is "very good". I appreciate that it was said that Slugs: unlike Slug: children's games or slums: other white meats. Probably, he does not deserve to see it more than once, and he will soon forget the curiosities except playing in a pretty dark way. The director of Juan Piquer SimÃ³n is known in his previous films "Pod People" (MST3K deserved dislikes) and "Peices" (this is probably the worst movie ever). <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Rosa shows T & A <br /> <br /> My Grade: D + <br /> <br /> DVD More: Only theatrical trailer for this movie
