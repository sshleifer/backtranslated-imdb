To date, Elvis Presley is trying to bring it, but despite the show's small scene and pseudo-Playboy Magazine sub-infrastructure, Presley himself surrounds himself. A woman by E.P. chooses it Going on the beach and taking care of life does not matter! Dick Sargent is another wonderful sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Try to make Elvis look like two bosses (it's dark, you'll see it). Some songs are pretty good, especially "Almost in Love", but if you want to watch Elvis more sex-themed comedy, look elsewhere. When Elvis and his fierce attack go into the bed, they stand on the wooden board! Get authentic. ** ****
