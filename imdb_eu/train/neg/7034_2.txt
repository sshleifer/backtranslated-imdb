I totally despise this movie. It is not surprising that Jose Larraz "canceled" at a moment and did not want to discuss it. I admire Larraz's work, especially slave / darkest sex thrillers, SAVAGE LUST or SCREAM AND DIE (for example). He has an art that is essential to his work, and it seems that he can not shut it down, thanks to the secondary career of the painter and the cartoonist. It is a very bad thing that the West never made it, its vision would be perfect. <br /> <br /> BELTZA BELTZA is the easiest movie, and probably the best known of VAMPYRES masterpiece. The main idea is a scene, a satanic sound that gives a strange rhythm for the reproduction of a goat's fluid, symbolizing the beast. It will be created by mere evil. Satan as a wife. The scene is staged as convincing, even though the goat's plumbing apparatus has not been featured, with the trusted hatred of the actress, the rituals for petition and a lot of guttural chants. The movie was heard in twelve-half films directed by Jacinto Molina. The evil nature of this scene is more evident than in more graphical detail, this supplicant confirms that the satanic priest's daughter is a teenager. I'm writing this movie but it's been fun. <br /> <br /> The problem is that there is no story that is derived from a woman whose role as ROSEMARY'S BABY was to undo or reflect on her role. A sophisticated wedding of Satan's bride's bride who lives in outer gardens of a very malicious land in Britain. Eurohorroren sensation Helga Line is guided by Satanists Doctors, lawyers, landlords, magnates and other top-class characters owe their professional success to worship the devil. Everything you need to do is sell your soul and the world can be yours, be careful about paying a personal dispute or a sword that you can sell with. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He was amazed that he was under control of Spain under the harsh eye of a frank generalizer until 1976. While his decision came to life, Spanish cinema had no graphical representation of the screen on display. Spanish directors often made versions of both films, sex hidden for their screens and export-covered fertility. It was as difficult as filmmakers to express themselves, however, when the artist was forbidden, it was an interesting tension, a Spanish taste of the 70s, with a very special taste, but a taste that was acquired. It's not everyone. <br /> <br /> But in strange events, Franco's influence on Spanish culture did not dampen the horror of Spanish horror at the end of the 1970s, when they found their Gothic castles and demonic orgies suddenly. With new sensations like JAWS and the STAR WARS phenomenon. And unexpectedly without Franco, suddenly, in the late 70s / 80s, the flood of graphic thrillers were killed, of which BLACK CANDLES is perhaps the most popular debiancy because it emphasized sexual barnyard with an animal. Larraz's horror movies have always been sexual taboos (VAMPYRES lesbianism, SCREAM AND DIE and DEVIATION incest), but here the effect of depravity covers other products. Nobody is responsible for a traditionally cushioned trip to Goat Barn, and seeing a trimmed version is a barely-executed scene in the barn. Sex is not enough graphic to name porn and frosts are not terrifying horror. <br /> <br /> So, KARGUN AURKI's attitude analysis is essential - Here are a great social British satanists. In the West Midlands or whatever their homes would be. In the sex scene, actors and actors sit around and have a lot of controversy. The best thing about cinema is that the atmosphere of the claustrophobia is incredibly undeniable, most of the actions that Mrs. Line has in the inner border of the palace. Most of the paths of bankruptcy are emphasized, as Roman sex lovers full of supernatural enthusiasm will be fun, and of course, the bad criminals among us will be surprised by their chicken goats' scene. But the final consequence of the film is stupid, absurd, suggestive, and surely perfect for forgetting the applied film. <br /> <br /> 2/10; This film without Goat Barn is not the same, and with a scene probably most of the audience. Larraz was right to dismiss this.
