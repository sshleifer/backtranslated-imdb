This movie was horrible. The end was totally horrible. There was no plot in the movie. The only thing about the film was Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were great! The only problem was that the movie was not made by the judge directly. If it happened that next to the story of a short story by the script, it is worth watching. Instead, Robert DuVall's and James Earl Jones's performances have been totally ruptured in a huge divine line ... or missing them. Whilst something was happening in the whole movie, I'm waiting for the whole movie, and the real movie ... not just an unknown character interview, because there was no reason at last. It was only a simple conversation that would happen again in that period of time. There was nothing special about a character. The only thing Robert DuVall liked was how old he was: old man, whistle, drunken and drunk. Nothing worth including the end of the entire movie. When I finished the movie, I was surprised ... I was surprised that I sat down all over the movie because it was worthwhile to watch the movie that was interesting to me. It never happened! The breakout of the characters suddenly began to reveal the movie, the movie was really over and I realized that I had lost 2 hours of a movie of my life without completely seeing and meaningless research. There was not even a story. The whole movie is played at a time of one day. That's it. One day in a plantation it was Southern times (and death). How many stories can be in a single day (except for the film's Training Day)? All the performances were brilliantly performed, but the incident of a movie was wasting ... even if you call a movie.
