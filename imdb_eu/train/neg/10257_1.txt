This movie won an excellent movie: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, and Lew Ayres - all b-movie actors. But this rejection of a movie does not use any of them, any one of them is not on the screen (even though Christopher Lee plays against several scenes). <br /> <br /> In this movie, the motivation for foreigners seems to change the drop of a hat. First, they want to solve the ship and they have to leave it, and then they will turn the main character into the majority of his friends killed and not have the necessary parts to release his wife. Then, nowhere, this "peaceful" race has decided to destroy the planet because it causes too many "illnesses" (although they provide the place of the main character and his wife's society). <br /> <br /> Most of the films are under the guidance of both men and women, either walking or standing around or sitting on desks. You almost prefer to get together with the last planet, because of what we're bored of death. <br /> <br /> Chris Lee or the likes of low-budget science fiction in the seventies. I would give this question. It enters the narrow celluloid range between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target territory.
