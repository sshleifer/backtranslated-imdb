I agree with the good story and other writers with good actors, but they do not match, and I would also like to run. It's been about 24 years since I read the book as in school. But you should know the story of Jane Eyre when she loses the bits and does not make sense. For example, Mr. Jane and Rochester have hardly talked anymore and suddenly is proposing a wedding !!! The actors do not have time to let the viewer feel about the things that happen to the story. Actors are good, but they do not have enough time to do justice to the story. I'm sorry to say, but I did not enjoy this version. The 1970 version of Susanna York and George C Scott Jane Eyre would be my premier movie BUT but you should see the 1983 version of the BBC series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton in 2 major roles. I love so many times. Currently, there is a short version of a complete version of 225 or 330 minutes.
