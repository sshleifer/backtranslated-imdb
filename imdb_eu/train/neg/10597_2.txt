This movie was absolutely terrifying. I can not think about that. The holes in the soil were so large that they could drive a Hummer through them. The play was very bad for Jean Jean to be ashamed and that much said! And the conversation, what interview? Thinking about the first one (I use this comment a little, it's like guilty pleasure). This movie has been shouting in Goldberg! There's nothing good for the movie. This movie is even worse, it does not look like it's not fun to watch your friends so it can be bad !!! This is the worst five movies of all time. Because 2/10 is very difficult to give me 1.
