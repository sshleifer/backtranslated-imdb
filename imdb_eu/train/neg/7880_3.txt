Animal Farm (1954) read about the dangers of totalitarianism. The good ideals that guide head fists with an iron fist change and can be distorted. Unfortunately this movie does not portray one of them. What we show is a piece of propaganda, with a lot of finger and pointing. Animation and direction have been good considering the budget and time, but George Orwell's essence is missing out. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who do not want to adapt to yourself, see the adaptation of this novel or interesting novel. I felt little. A man's opinion, however. <br /> <br /> Under remake, but not much.
