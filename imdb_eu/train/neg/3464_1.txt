It seems that many people who reviewed the movie only saw him first and were shot live from where they live. How much is it to make calls? If I had filmed this film when I lived, I would not mention it in my review. It's a fear! Some opinions mention that this movie is a horror movie, it's not. It's sad to review this movie as a comedy, which is why he tries to make a horror movie as a bad but comedy essay. However, I laughed, the movie was bad. This movie has 2 good things, I have a mask and my chosen weapon, unfortunately, one hour's watch would be more interesting. Seeing rubbish on a table with a mask and a half gun. The social commentary behind the film is also stupid, young and stupid. Do not worry about this movie, you're already wasting your review if you can not read more about this movie. Arrggghhh! This is amazing movies such as horrible. I expected the full directorate to be paid for Alan Smithee, when a person who is a director often does not want the movie, I expected a name that was so bad. <br /> <br /> There's nothing in this movie free, I've spent $ 1.19 on rent and I'm sorry I'm ripped off. Avoid. From 10 onwards
