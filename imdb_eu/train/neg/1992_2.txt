Do not let me deceive the name of this movie, Jake Speed ​​is probably the most strange hero of the movie ever known. Jake Speed ​​is not mad since the girl is being saved by virgin, and often does not have so much a man, it is very relaxing. Perhaps, this adds its charm, but I think that an action hero is not supposed to "exit" whenever this is achieved. Additionally, unlike other brave heroes with a spectacular talent list, this man does not have any talents unless you say what you sleep. However, this movie is basically not valid, writing is similar, and the action, if any, is very flexible. (The Jeep machine guns were not bad, but that's why) So, if you're looking to watch the cure for insomnia video, this piece is perfect for you - it's a hero. He not only sleeps himself but also his audience.
