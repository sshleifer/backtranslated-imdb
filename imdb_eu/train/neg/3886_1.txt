Is the movie stupid? You bet! I could not find momentum in this movie or a horrible movie. Bad moments With many Stupid people You bet Bad effects Nonahi! Rick Baker did things bigger and better, this is not one of them. Well, people have to start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson is drawn. It's the most vibrant medicine I've ever seen. Rumor is running somewhere in the county of Ventura, he is not very happy when his wife is pregnant (probably 55 years old and weighs 90 kg), and there's now no crack. He also wants to find Steve Astronaut, a very helpful non-obstacle. And the local sheriff wants to know what happens, Mr. Nelson can not say anything. They are also random characters that place good measurements with melting. In the end, the movie is over and the monster is thrown into the trash to convert it into a compost. Finally, it's a great MST pass you need.
