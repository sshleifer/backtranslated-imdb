Well, what can I say? "We Know What Bleep" is almost impossible - without leaving the "Postman", "The Dungeon Master", "Merlin" masterpiece. "and, therefore, fourth, the worst movie I've ever seen in history, and that, ladies and gentlemen, is spectacular because they've seen so much bad film. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece of modern cinema has two split links He is forced to resign his husband and take the antidepressants, and a bunch of headache occurs as quantum physics justifies his new pseudo-philosophy. Basically, your day is Enya And if you start meditating for Kenny G, the movie is for you. If you have a stunning mood, if you have a lot of toys and a good deal of good herbs, then this movie is also for you, otherwise follow it away. Take my word. <br /> <br /> "What is known about Bleep" seems to me, first of all, that I realized that the same people who shoot good weddings seem to be edited and assembled. Camera, heart effect Roses, full-screen splashes with the computer and many other silliness. The people close to theater releases gave me a mystery. I think that's what Kenny G does. The movie was immersed in a young GCI, just like we can do on the video editing software we can do on our computer, but they would never be too hilarious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < All the characters and conversations were more than laborious and faith-believing, but "writers" felt that each important information or, rather, misinformation was required. throat. Well, it would not have been for an idea given to the recipients. The main character, for example, passes through the movie tablets halfway. It seems, however, that it is not enough to convince them, so that at least a couple of conversations have to be taken into account, especially when their anxiety pills are mentioned, if the viewers do not want too much pain and suffering. The pill takes a small whit when it feels. Reasoning ... Well, I've seen better Ed Wood movies, and no, this is not excessive. Reason, the small play I had when I was 12 was much more inspiring. He really did <br /> <br /> The story is interrupted here and there with strange mixes of random words, kooky scientists, kooky doctors and self-proclaimed mystics. Physics presupposes an "explanation" that man or woman experiences their reality in life's experience. The reality, you will see, is a probability field of a set of different options, and only the recipient is set, when you have chosen it when you have been alerted. What happens when noticed by more than one observer, but who look after them again. Listen to Enya, think, look, and you will be God, and no one thinks about foolish and arrogant evil, critical thinking, logic, etc. All the reasons are immediately rejected so they can not get their paths stuck. "paradigm shift" and "go in the hollow rabbit". In addition, Heidelberg's uncertainty demonstrates that the principle is alternative proofs, parallel and other universes. Talking about the rabbit holes, it causes an analogy movie. All these people are going down the bunnies. I am not sure what to say or have been shown to be something else, but I am convinced that one thing I have had is anal sex. Actually, the movie is like a sex. In the vicinity, sex is dirty, ugly and enlightening. <br /> <br /> In any case, the heads of the talking speak, the main character achieves harmony and clarity through the whole body. , and begins to walk her appearance is more stupid than before the eye starts over. <br /> <br /> I want to return 2 hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Here are a couple of random quotes that I remember: <br /> <br /> "I think that being real has become much more real to me, which, when I thought it real, was much less than often It is unreal. "- Talking about the spirituality of quantum physics. <br /> <br /> "What does a man require to be a construction? Does he think of himself? There is nothing outside of it, all the changes are inside. He still has an institution" - Some self-proclaimed mystic, his own illustration school head <br /> <br /> [While looking at the mirror] "" I hate it! fat! you are ugly! You have it! "- the main character, the fat and ugly photographer.
