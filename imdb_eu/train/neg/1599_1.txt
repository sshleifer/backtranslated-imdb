The LAMPOON NATIONAL CLASS REUNION was flop when it was released. It was not long at my theaters in my city. Why? It's da !!!!! <br /> <br /> It's not a bad way, but the bad one is really painless. The cast of the actors was unknown and this turkey was kept. <br /> <br /> The idea is very good (a parody of slasher flicks) but the execution is missing in every aspect. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this "comedy". Your time is more coveted than seeing embarrassing shame to spend a nanosecond.
