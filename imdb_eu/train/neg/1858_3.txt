The serial killer has died in a stormy snowstorm and becomes the Frosty's snowman. Then he is dying. Interesting land. Fear of fear And it's terrifying. If you are five years old. Otherwise, it's a cheesy type. I saw the cable and I'm glad I did not see the money. It is the charm and style of a low-budget movie and can become a worship film. I'm sure somewhere fanatical fan. I'm not there. If they had not liked the movie, I found some scenes funny. For example, the scene of the bathtub and the subsequent explosion scene with Picasso's reference. It was also nice to see many of the heroes trying to kill Jack, and it's just that he does not want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a low-budget B-movie comedy, but a low-budget B-movie is great.
