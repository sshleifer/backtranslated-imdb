If you want to laugh like crazy, rent Cage. Cage's two war heroes, Billy and Scott are the best friends. When shooting at Billy Viet Nam, he can not take care of himself, so Scott will take him with him. <br /> <br /> I never saw the movie with the gay references of the two main characters. Billy and Scott love the "wrestle" and Scott tells Billy that he is still "injured last night," among other things. <br /> <br /> Pleasurable words like "Shut the sh! T up" and "Ping". Pang Pong, cut sh! You'll be laughing at each other. The American boys that are playing the Mexican band are also the highest standards, as the saying goes, "the party is right now. "I would always go, but watch this movie and laugh at your $$ off. It was so fun to come out and buy a DVD of $ 5.99
