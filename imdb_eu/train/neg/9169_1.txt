It's very bad. The thousands of ballet effects used by the film are the only ones that earn half quality. Contextual errors are everywhere. The play is awful, save Kirk. The story is as rough as grail, and the movie is a video game that is the same as if it were not dying, if it was not a corpse. So it's totally loss of your life. I would give this if it were zero, with the scaling option.
