Please help the economy - spend your money elsewhere! Summary of the movie: The first Lady killed her husband, because she made a scam. That's it. Anyone, except Cuba and Angie, does not perceive them. It designs and implements a huge conspiracy of murder, nobody knows ... and it is free. <br /> <br /> Some specific points are particularly ridiculous: while the president is moving forward, Cuba deflects the killer bullet ... then goes to the head of the president. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cuban and Angie watch a new movie camera and see ... a track. They make efforts to protect the film, believing that they are the only people with a copy of this public movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba speaks with a presidential staff. The PSM has warned that there is no conspiracy. Cuba says, there were more than one person. Then PSM includes the conspiracy FBI, CIA and NSA. Gosh, I wonder if PSM is involved. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ms Archer, the first lady, is a malicious artist. Cuba can not paint and said: "You are near ... go back ... look from another perspective, look at my point of view." Can anybody ask this idea?
