This bomb is just another "explosion", only with no humor and absurd situations. Really pyrotechnics at the end. Reality is not one of its strengths. I give 10 out of 10 points. I would like to make a zero but this option is not allowed. Sorry, Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. Sometimes, however, we all have to have money. And I continue to go back to Tim Burton with the farce of Mars. Nicholson was daring to admit that he was a turkey. But if it is a turkey, then this movie is not a well. I would like to say, "Give me my money." If possible, I can bet. But this is with premium services, with a subscription variety.
