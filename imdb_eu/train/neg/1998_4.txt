My former roommate No, No, Nanette soundtrack got into a tape as a dub, and she listened to it without interruption. In the end, I was fully aware of the presentation, I thought the songs were not, especially the famous, I want to be happy, but I can not be happy ... but I did not have a movie that came from the soundtrack. it was around. So I saw a copy of the other day at the video store, and I rented that the long version of the movie was lost. I was thinking it would be amazing, because the soundtrack is so nice. Unfortunately, most of the songs I loved were never seen in the video I found. I have not seen the 1930 version of the music, but this version was very unfortunate because there was little singing, and there was almost no dance, and after that the sound was very bad and it was not really understood by people. lots of time Actually, the only significance of this film was the dark fashion of the 1940s. Nanette wears a hat-crazy dress, like a rabbit, and has two coasters on her zipper, and Kitty Kansas has a giant feather in her forehead. A dance sequence is also weird and strange, with a rare ballet with Nanette. In fact, the brightest part of that film was the artist Guillespe, a dream of being a beautiful artist, but now that the girl draws money. I like how Guillespe maintains the old school, and Nanette tells her masterpiece, she wanted to make her career, Nanette is sold by $ 5250 miserely. Did he not realize that this piece was his immortality? Rabbit stranger / little girl rabbit earrings in your hat. When do you learn? Why does not pencil cigar just the men of ads ahead of Lana's move?
