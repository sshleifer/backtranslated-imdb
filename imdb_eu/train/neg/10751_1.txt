Why did I lose my money on the last day of Sundance? I want a translation ... Can I get my $ 16 back? I waited for something that happened while I was watching this movie, nothing happened. I know how fancy the movie really was to read about the supposition. why did the director zoom down and then move away? It was not very artistic. Why has Lulu directed the presentation of the nails for fifteen minutes? Why were they talking when the actors wanted to listen to them as they were reading? Or is that one? Phantom Love has no story, and it was a good time for my friends that holiday videos had more entertainment than this movie.
