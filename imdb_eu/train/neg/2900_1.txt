I have a 5 minute rule (I usually leave 10 times). If the film is not good at first or 10 minutes, it's likely to improve. I have to experiment with any film that has yet to prove to face this theory. Dan in Real Life is definitely not an exception. This turkey and I thought; wow, this is not funny, it's not touched, not sad, and I do not like any character. <br /> <br /> A storytelling / widow's story that brings together three young daughters. fell in love with his younger brother. Do I think that the language "advice column can give advice"? I do not know. The character was not in any way advised as a person. I think this irony? I do not know. Parents, brothers, sisters and children's children have repeatedly seen family retirement, it seems very sweet and stories of good comedy ... The main story loves this woman how she loves her, but she can not be her. Anyone who is pulsed will realize that she eventually plays for her, but you have to be disturbed by love so that the whole affair of the love film is a wonderful end to the "inevitable killer" of life. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.
