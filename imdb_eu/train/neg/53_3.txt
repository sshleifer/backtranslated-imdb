I am studying in Catalonia, and I was delighted to see El Mar, especially a Catalan-language interview, in a video store in my art house. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... he has not been so happy to see. <br /> Yes, as other reviewers say, it's well done and it's a very good picture. Although the amazing sequence of children's opening is violent, it is well-behaved and convincing. (Mostly, this is ... Are Mallorquin killing the corpse buried in the middle of the town, in front of the 10-year-old boy of the deceased?) O, yes ... small details. So far, Pan's Labyrinth has not felt something magical (set forth in the Civil War). <br /> <br /> There have been three children who have been in the process of getting ahead and opening an accident. age Francisca is not working in a tuberculosis sanatorium and both boys, Manuel and Ramallo, are both patients. I know, but yes, the usual coincidences. <br /> <br /> The problem is that, like so many Spanish films (the forgiveness of the Almodovar fans), with an exception (Francisca), the characters are so strange *. . Motivations, personality, and conversations are often not consistent. <br /> <br /> In addition, it goes down to some unhappy abuses. Prepare lots of pain and lots of blood. The "Potboiler" reviewer is very much in the process. If you have done 40 years ago, the poster would have said: See forbidden love! RAPE !! Murder !! Crop! Fanaticism !! ANIMALS CONNECTING! Betrayal! <br /> <br /> The initial sequence is not enough to make the characters' nature and relationships incredible. To work, this should be to boost the various flashbacks characters. As of now, it seems like a curious and depressing "Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction". If this sounds good, you should enjoy it. I think I have to take a shower I feel like I'm clear about the removal and darkness that I'm feeling. <br /> <br /> In terms of Catalan, it is a dialectal Majorcan, Barcelona is quite different. The dialect, but I was surprised when they told me that Barcelonals also seemed to need Catalan subtitles.
