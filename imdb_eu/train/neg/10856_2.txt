Look, I do not lie to you, but this movie got only 3.99 dollars for a friend, Danni Filth, a singer of "Death Cradle Of Filth". I hope, obviously, that I see it as a matter of violence and gore, which Mr Filth imagines between a plot. <br /> <br /> But dear god, I was so wrong. This movie is seriously carved. Having a low-budget movie (haha, wait, ZERO BUDGET to do it), music scores of the orchestra, Howard Stern, and Spielbergen's special effects are missing. No, it's a camera, bad angles and bad blood scenes. <br /> <br /> Say, for example, that our star and evil force, Mr Filth, suddenly kills a blow. He enters the throat and flushes the blood, but it seems that a male shirt is packed with fake blood. <br /> <br /> Cradle fans of hanging: you'll hear two songs on the whole movie, but with a camera shot with angles and a scuffle, drag the general pleasure of DOWN song. <br /> <br /> My latest comment: drive away. Blood, gore, breasts and hey, it's also a shame story to go with. So, if you like great violence, no voice (yes, there is hardly any word in this movie), then, by the way, buy it. But if harmful films are not avoiding your account. Do not waste your money.
