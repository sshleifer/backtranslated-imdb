I caught the film at the Edinburgh Film Festival. I did not hear much about it; It was only a good rhythm that was a thriller, shot digitally with a small budget. I plan to catch the next big Brit-Flick. But I must say, I was disappointed. "This Is Not A Love Song" continues when two criminals, after being shot and killed by the young daughter of a farmer, are killed by the deadly cat and mouse in which the locals decide to take things and hunt them. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that this is another example of the substance style in a British film. The camera's angles and editing are completely distanced from the story, as they surpass their higher performances, and the use of slow motion, which only serves as expensive home video. There are movies that are repeatedly attempts to be exciting and demanding, because they are ridiculous and upright (medicine, fate of compulsory scenes, and fiery zombie cameras). This is not a clich√© to make this story a pretty bad thing to disguise. <br /> <br /> We've seen several things before, and we've done it a hundred times better, especially the John Boorman master "Deliverance." In this last movie we had a great deal of responsibility for the characters, I wanted to capture this movie and kill it as soon as possible. Although this was not so bad if their opponents were terrifying or deserving, they are just a collection of stereotypical and ancient origins. Once again, it is offensive and excessive to other clans. Certainly, there are pretty people in the country, filmmakers? <br /> <br /> In his defense, "This is not a song of love", it has some good moments for suspensful moments, but it's hard to watch this movie just like going straight to the video, or getting a very limited film release. There is not a patch against the Little Budget last year, hunted at the core of "Dog soldiers". British cinema may have to retake if the money had not stopped correctly.
