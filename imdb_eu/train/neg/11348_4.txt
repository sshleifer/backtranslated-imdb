Six IE, those who send and discharge home, drink and enter the Asian worship encounter. Surrounded by hoodies, two dancers want to fight. Behind it, on the altar, a woven basket opens and a painted figure emerges and it begins to imitate a snake and, finally, hanging one of the dancers on the neck. The imitation snake is covered with some rugged bodies. (This is definitely a woman's imitation snake). A member of the hated meeting has repeatedly warned six men that the ceremonies were not interrupted, and they would not hesitate to photograph or hunt each other. down and die Of course, IGs make a picture, worship members become angry with hysteria, they steal the "snake" cart and run away with Asia. <br /> <br /> A boy, who is the most offensive and snarky, is killed by a Cobra snack at the neck, even though no one has explained how the snake enters his hospital room. <br /> <br /> In New York, it seems to describe everything. men settle in their civil life, they still keep in touch with each other. Their jobs include postgraduate studies (David Janssen) and Richard Long graduate studies. They are James Dobson, Jack Kelly, and Marshall Thompson. Richard Long is a girlfriend. Kelly is a pretty woman. But they all fit well and all seem happy. <br /> <br /> Then a mysterious and mysterious woman (Faith Domergue) appears and Marshall Thompson likes her and enters herself. team <br /> <br /> Guess what happens. First Janssen is afraid of a shadow on the back seat and dies in a car crash. Then he gets a visit from Kelly Domergue. Something frightens him so badly he falls down the window and falls on the sidewalk. Long and Dobson begins to suspect the audience already knows - Domergue has something to do with death. They also think that it is becoming a cobra, and that's the case. Dobson confronts his suspicions and proves his accuracy. <br /> <br /> At this moment, Long and Thompson are completely abolished, especially when Thompson, in love with Domergue, finds it attractive. But what is "love" must be explained. It does not matter. Cobra's latest brave attack on women's Long Long girlfriend - is not about six original offenders and Thompson snake must throw in the window. On the lower side of the pavement, the body changes to Domergue. End <br /> <br /> I think that most of the questions raised by the land exceed me. I will mention one of the most prosaic ones before. Who paid the Domergue rate from Asia to New York? Who is the hotel that pays for their services bills? Who paid for his impressive wardrobe? Why does the American English speak so well? What's happening? Although writers and directors have seen some of the horror films of Val Lewton, they have been stolen by Lewton, though there is not much effort in this production. In Lewton's "The Cat People", for example, the woman becomes a black leopard, but, with a small exception, the threat is always shadowed and that's why it's horrible. Most transformations use shadows here, but unlike Lewton, the shadows are awkward and ambiguous. <br /> <br /> Lewton also used occasions when he called "buses". Lewton's first "bus" was literal. The potential victim lies in the tunnel of the Central Park tunnels in a hurry, only by step. Someone or someone follows. He is afraid of being under a street lamp. Something in the bush branches shakes the stove. He looks upwards. There is a whirlwind cry to finish your hair. It's a bus that uses its air brakes to stop it. The producers used at least two "buses" in this film, and they are not worth it. A man, distractedly walks along the intersection, for example, and suddenly he is almost a truck that strikes it. No movie set. It is mixed with a shoe strap. <br /> <br /> I do not care about the films that care for ugly, ugly, and frivolous as a serpent stereotype. In fact, the snakes are not fuzzy, most of them are harmful and they are incredibly beautiful. In addition, they are more masculine than women, with snakes that approach their sinuous movements and goals. Do you want a male symbol? Try a six-line racerunner. It is very fast lizard. When he sees something to eat, he goes up and down. <br /> <br /> However, if you want to see some pretty horror movies, do not worry about it. Find out "The Cat People" or one of Lewton's other masterpieces, which is an obvious copy of them.
