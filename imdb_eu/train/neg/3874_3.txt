This film was foreseeable, all the time a suspect was expected to be innocent, and there is still another great tour. However ... it's not. It's still moving and keeps it apart. Mary found a very opposite find in her place, and she still trusted? And what was this "trapping baiting"? There was no cheat. He confronted him, "Pardon me. Someone must kill me," and that's where it ended. They try to use other suspects (the oldest at the end of the carnival), but they have been underestimated. Actually, all the characters have not been developed. They do not have a depth and the setting is strangely ... hanging on a recycling plant? Concrete and nothing is well developed. For example: when he leaves his place after the beer, he finds photos and exhausts him and captures him and in that car ... they have sex ... what's that? His reactions were not portrayed. He frightened in the car, as it could be almost rape - but then we see everything the next morning shower. booooooooo It could have been so much better ... much better.
