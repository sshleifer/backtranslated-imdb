Resnais, wow! Hiroshima Mon Amour brought us the genius that challenges the French music of the 30s. The old title that opened the old voices was a pleasant touch. Then the camera opens the aperture (similar to the round handles). The camera returns (or, rather, up), it suddenly shows us the strikingly fascinating coloring of an elegant party for a party. This is the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then music begins. The film is trivial and unforgettable, with an incredible choir of 3 girls with no importance for the film, and I speak in French, so I can not blame subtitles. These characters shake the door and represent more people who make them an unforgettable song. They left behind and, finally, Audrey Tautou will appear and we will hear our first honest interview in the film on 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Resnais invented the time and music of the roadway. cacophony. But the impact on the audience on the screen is to throw bolts and attack. I suffered it <br /> <br /> It's not much better. Why i'll tell you There is no known character. We do not even see half of the time (Resnais seems to be looking forward to showing expensive landscapes to keep people in front of the camera). People turn around a lamp and turn it on a lamp, and the viewers can not focus on a particular person or plot. It's like taking all of Brady Bunch's episodes and joining a 2-hour movie. Those with bad songs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept watching me (one hour) was like watching camera techniques, lights and landscapes, I admit they were excellent. But is it enough for you to focus your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe tomorrow I'll finish watching. Aw, who's joking? I have to do more important things. I'm sure too. Skip this.
