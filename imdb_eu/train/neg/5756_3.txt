Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson starred as two-day writer. Director Mike Nichols. Uh uh It's sad and sad! Nonsense and predictable! Slow and unfocused! <br /> <br /> It's a cookie cutter. 'Boy boy girl, boy marry girl, boy loves, girl leaves boy' story. Now there is an original concept! After two hours (it was just two) I felt six. I did not know whether it was comedy, love, tragedy or telenobia. It was made in 1986 I'm sure all things that we did 16 years ago, we forgot them. I hope Streep et al. Begins to heal the damages and the master emulsion has begun to fade. It's not a bad picture. That's just good.
