Films and films unknown have been many times because of the bad reviews I like. This was not one of them. <br /> <br /> I felt that I was watching the Xabier opera using a camera technique. It was a sharpening prediction and he was most interested in taking the movie after asking "is this?". Once I decided to take the movie seriously and from a pure perspective, it became a pleasure. It's still a movie that's over the MST3000.
