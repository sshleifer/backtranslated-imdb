This movie was totally disappointed. I read some other reviews we mentioned here and I had a lot more hope. I expected a drama with a more developed character. But this never happens in the film. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but some reviewers like this would not be believing. Repeated the same group of 4 or 5 in the movie. I'd appreciate 10 performance in 10th. <br /> <br /> Conference: 10th 10th direction from 5th to 10th. The script is the worst: from 2 to 10. <br /> <br /> The movie is removed from my DVR 70 minutes. to film. Films much better than this ...
