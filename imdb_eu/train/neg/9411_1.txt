It is interesting that this film (so far) seemed to have been unexpected. That's the trick. Comparing them, I had optimistic expectations, and that was a mistake. As soon as I saw it as soon as I saw the camera faces, I knew that the director was in the hands of the amateurs. They are always a clear signal, they think it's a camera that is capable or effective. from the actors to a centimeter. The actors in this film, however, had only one face expression. <br /> <br /> If the camera was not enough, the movie did not light the light. It seemed completely shot in the dark film. So now we know that he was an amateur film photographer. "Ooh, oh, we will raise the set with a flashlight! That will seem all intimate!" No, all this seemed invisible. <br /> <br /> On top of serious technical mistakes, there was never a story beyond the idea of ​​an idea that never developed, and no such relationship. it was lit (Maybe it's a new kind of German film, but in Los Angeles, forget it.) <br /> <br /> This film won a couple of awards at the Film Festival that does not indicate quality. Films, but admires the quality of the special festivals. I can assure you that this film did not win anything at the festival. Indeed, it seemed to have ended twice over the film and left the public to leave (this was a side effect of the "total darkness" of the filmmaker). But when he was afraid of the movie, there were gestures to the audience. And when the end of the film was over, it was clear that it was not important if they had finished two points earlier. An ending could save audiences from monotonous out-of-home scenes (folding pages, cutting vegetables, honey spread). Yes, we get it: the lonely old man was boring, but we thought that at first. <br /> <br /> I recommend that the viewers lose that, it does not offer anything. people from sophisticated films.
