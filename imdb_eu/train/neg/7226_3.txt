I love comics. Although problems are completely understandable? Visual style is unique with its dirt, dust and decay. So I thought I knew what was there. Surprisingly, I understand the main plot? But there were totally wrong decisions. <br /> <br /> Do I mean "very GG human agents" look very bad? ?? Why ?! It did not work anymore !! Horus - and other Egyption gods - CG successfully completed and comic version very close. <br /> <br /> I think film might be a worship movie with real actors. <br /> <br /> A pity.
