It's boring ... This is a battlefield near science fiction. Genie Francis (aka hospital in laura) has a small role as a reporter, which, in itself, must be said to be a bad movie ... there is a kingsley (actor who won the Academy Award) in this Stinker and others. decent actors You have to doubt what they had to do to make a great movie. Music goes up and down dramatically as an important dramatic story. If you pay attention, it is also impossible to follow the plot. The effects are also mediocre and it seems really dated. All actors speak with a monotonous voice and have no realism in their conversation. I can swear that this movie is bad. Battlefield Earth is at least so bad, it's fun, but that's just not good. Avoid sleeping if you do not.
