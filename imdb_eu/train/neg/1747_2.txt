A well-born release begins quickly and only begins to stop hope. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Macs (Akshay Kumar) and Sam's (John Abraham) characters are not well-suited to link Mac's bosses to one of three hostesses before making the decision. . The rest theater Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) deal with situations. <br /> <br /> About Cast, Paresh Rawal is a talented actress, I thought it was wasted. The role of a cook mood. Akshay Kumar is sustainable, John Abraham is very bad for furniture and Rajpal Yadav is the only passion to save the movie. <br /> <br /> In the second half of the movie, it's fun, but it's all DUD (the song is boring) and a bit stopping you from waiting for some healthy entertainment and comedies.
