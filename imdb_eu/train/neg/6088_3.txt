Why do I see such films? - When I correct the belief that the masochists are wrong, one day I will find a real gem in all the trash. I can not think of a good reason. This movie was from the beginning to the end, but it was half-ridiculous dirty. On the other hand, you can find in Spanish dubbed movies such as surreal exchange exchanges, such as the honest military type and the malicious head of a secret X-file, like the "Egia" hide-and-seek: <br /> <br /> Frightening: silence is the best for us, UFOs Since it is not proving that they are terrifying reasons. <br /> <br /> Military type: in any case, it seems to me that your interference is too much. > <br /> Man in Black: who is the one who wants to impose his will. <br /> <br /> I rewrote the DVD (I know what I mean) half a dozen times good and I still can not do these lines. to say something sensible. My other fave line was: <br /> <br /> "We can be very interesting with our interests." <br /> <br /> It's Jim English, but we do not know it. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, other prominent points of this brutal plonker of a film were completely separated from the photographer's character. In the history of all things, the worst thing to do with hair cutting through history, it was like a surprisingly surprised man, until some foreigners had seized and looked for a piece of Plexiglas. Foreigners can not be seen efficiently as a POV shot - a man-made camera with a fish-eye lens - scary for the first time, but lost its power once and for all (unexpectedly, it's a shot of the vision, which means that the aliens always stay from one room to another for some reason ). <br /> <br /> He put the film "in England". This means that Italian Italian designers put on the British number plates in a couple of English cars and put them in Union Jack on the press card of our hero ... and that's it. Another attempt at the UK. <br /> <br /> Your favorite moment? Foley artists did not notice foleying characters (for example, a word?) They were no longer on the gravel, but now the earrings are still alive, "Crunch! Crunch!" noises Among others, a 90-minute waste of my life. I hope the UFOs will soon have no reason to be feared ...
