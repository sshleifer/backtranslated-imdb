I rated this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought the movie might be quite fun. "You all want to protect it!" he told the trailer. Well ... it damaged me, because this movie is really horrible. I almost laughed at almost two seconds in the whole movie. And what is all gay in this movie? I am not gay and I do not have a problem, but what is the goal of adding so much a gay scene in a comedy movie called "When these scenes are not completely fun?" I think the director denies or something like that is a gay man. <br /> <br /> So my advice is that if you want to lose money, you've already seen a good comedy rented. Millions of times you will be better than watching this Mom of all Lousy Comedy. It's completely empty.
