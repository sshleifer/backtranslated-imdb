Although positive reviews and screenings at international festivals, the movie is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story is very similar to other films, where a female immigrant family needs to overcome a normal person who has had to overcome a lot of ordinary people. his age problems and also the fight against the ethnic traditions of his family. He does this by choosing a type of sport, and with the help of a local boy, who for some reason is in love with him, faces his problems and triumphs. <br /> <br /> It's Boxing at Girlfight, Makurt Beckham Football, and now it's Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> But Fighter is much smaller than this two products, it was simply shameful to see. In Semra Turan, the role of a teenage "actress", she may do a lot of things, but she can not do anything. His presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy, the dramatic situation that strives to show some emotions is horrible, his body and facial language are the most entertaining actors, the teacher has taught him badly. The rest of the works are better, but they can not face writing this film with stereotypical and superficial characters. In addition to a few moments, this film does not offer anything new or interesting. <br /> <br /> Although the kung fu fight is not the reason to see it, it's so boring. Slow motion was useless, essential choreography and lack of inspiration, and most kung fu scenes are training or standing up in all kung fu positions, really struggling. On the other hand, when a tall and thin little girl is struggling with her big boys and muscles, she looks like a ridiculous look and falls on her feet. <br /> <br /> The only reason why this film was fully realized is that it is European. It's easy to get to know this movie: it's not a first movie of the first martial arts in Denmark, but do not be fooled. The young female fool and her problems, by the way, is not really convincing. <br /> <br /> Shameful films, actors and shameful lines.
