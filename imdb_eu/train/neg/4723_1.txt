First of all, apologize to my English. <br /> <br /> The former Yugoslavia, although there is no Serbs in the extreme, agrees with me. This movie shows the Serbian side and only Serbian. Serbian crimes were not represented. Fortunately, everyone can see that the films were made by the Serbs, so neutrality is not there. The "professionals" interviewed are not professionals. Some people read a book written by some Serb radicals, the other is genocides denier etc ... Slovenia was only lucky. There were not many Serbs in Slovenia, and YNA could not reach Croatia to Croatia (after the Croatian-Serbian war). Every Slovenian accusations of this film are annoyed. <br /> <br /> Every reasonable Croatian will agree: independence was too early. Perhaps the main conflicts can be avoided. However, the mention of World War II and some things that are really unpredictable are just an attempt to justify everything that was pathetic. Imagine being shot by Japanese nuclear bombs of Seattle and Washington and saying that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were justified. You have not found evidence of YNA's disturbed soldier and killed civilians near Vukovar. But you can find a tape to the reporter, who claims that Serb civilians around Vukovar lie. On the internet The director has forgotten the whole bombing of Vukovas, YNA (now full of Serbian and Montenegro, 100% Serbs and Montenegrins), and we will not start the Txetnik movement. Initially, it was just a resistance movement. In any case, the director of the Nazi cooperation, Ustashe, the ethnic cleansing and the Yugoslav Partisan, have forgotten to forget again. There are other things, but everything can be easily verified. There are many deceptive things in this movie. They are only true of all accusations. Every Croatian is listening to the movie. <br /> <br /> I think I do not need to mention the refusal of the Srebrenica genocide, too much genocide. Imagine a movie about denying poems. This movie is the same. And according to this movie Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo bombed themselves. All Bosnian Muslims are angry at this story. <br /> <br /> In any case, the director has forgotten the brief occupation of the Serbs from the small part of Macedonia (FYROM). <br /> <br /> The Croats, Slovenians, Bosnians and Macedonians did not enter the Serbian borders. If you are not Serbs and believe in certain things in that movie, find out that the Serbs are a kind of propaganda, that is, Croatian, Bosnian Muslims and Macedonians are really Serbs. So ... <br /> <br /> The 50% of the Serbs also say that this movie is extreme 'and' is Serb. <br /> <br /> And radical Serbs are very pleased with this film (about 40% of the Serbs are cast by Radicals). <br /> <br /> I think everyone understands my points. On behalf of that documentary, there is very little truth, and my advice is everyone: inform yourself before watching the movie. Then you will laugh at all pathetic accusations. <br /> <br /> See real neutral documentary on Yugoslavia death.
