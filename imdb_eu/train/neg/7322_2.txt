I'll give credit to credit, and I'm saying that Linda Fiorentino gives a good performance as a drummer for what he wants to do. Fabulous, shameless, hard and very sexy; this film is much better than it deserves. <br /> <br /> But that's IT. This hanging movie is fragmented, immediately Stalker Thriller, murderous thriller, storyline of loyalty and betrayal and a stunning erotic thriller. Movies, my friends, are not exciting. <br /> <br /> For example, who believed that he would lose C. Thomas Howell as the most important man? It's not ugly, but shouting, Fiorentino's cookie seems hard to get a goddess in nursery school. Howell does not have the authority or the presence of the screens to fill the lead. <br /> <br /> The script is the worst aspect of the movie. There is no tension as the kind of Fiorentino gets in the way of phone calls, there's no guilt about the murders surrounding this movie. There is no sense of liberation because Fiorentino Howell Howell loses its inhibition. <br /> <br /> Adam And Ant, and Issac Hayes, interesting but badly performed plays, and a really good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino. In addition, my first impulse would be to put this part of the trash and rent something else.
