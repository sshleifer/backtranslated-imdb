Why is it that any movie about Cleopatra, the latest phaoroh, is the worst thing in the movies? Although not all attempts were made for most of the women in Rome, Julius Ceasar's successor and his successor, Mark Anthony, never seemed to be on the screen above the sexes of the elderly. Despite the many sets and costumes, the movie is just as bad as 50's sandals and Italian toga. We should admit this kind of spectacular screen, which is why "Gladiator" has gone well, but "Gladiator" is not all the novels of the genre of love. <br /> <br /> Miss Varela has a talented playwright. Like Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton's talent replacement. Some pains did not cleanse the others.
