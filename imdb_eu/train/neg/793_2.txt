I was not sure how to rate the movie, it was so bad because it was really fun. I'm not at all Gackt's hobby, even though it's a great talent, though a cat is a pseudonym of a cough like a cough. I always thought that Hyde was a talent, but Faith is an interesting album. <br /> <br /> But people around the subject. This movie is ridiculous. So top and nonsense is like a parody of supernatural action films. <br /> <br /> The film has almost no plot here, just like vampires with gangster friends. Somehow, this movie reminded me of almost Spider-Man 3, that there was too much idea and one of them was not enough time to pay attention. <br /> <br /> The action scenes were insults. Fast editing, hardly understandable, choreography so laughably bad. Although Hyde seemed very elegant among the scenes of action, but this is the only exception. I'm selling for a good movie for action, but action has been made. The final shootout is fine and, moreover, the protagonist of this depressing film has been outstanding. <br /> <br /> It jumps between genres, it's not a good thing. He wants to be a drama or an action movie or a horror or a romance ... what a hell. <br /> <br /> If you make a review crazy, why? Gackt and Hyde are your love? Do not be fooled, VIDEO is wrong.
