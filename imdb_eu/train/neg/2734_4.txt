But, let's go ... he has got some nostalgic sighs for me. <br /> <br /> The show is so rewarding as some rumors. I get a new season, which means that I have only 2 days to live. I like the idea of ​​enjoyment, but it was much more at the end of the season, although this would explain: The only explanation that they could think has changed the rotation of the episodes or that they had to be shot again from the beginning. <br /> <br /> And my friends why hell is bald. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show is wonderful ... bring the ninth season.
