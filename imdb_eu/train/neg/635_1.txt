Luise Rainer received an Oscar for The Good Earth. Unfortunately, his role was not necessary. He did not say much and the movie appeared very pale. Luise's character was a slave dedicated to the marriage of Paul Muni's character (he did a great job for his performance). Located in the ancient Asia, two actors were not Asian, but they were very real in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni has won an Oscar for his performance, which is why Luise should get his Academy Award. It was a must have been an actress, one of the first methods of methodology. Hollywood seems like something that often does. Al Pacino has played for the Italians and Cubans. I thought Luise's performance was too low, and when he died he did not change from previous scenes. He was the same throughout the film; he changed his expression or emotion twice. If it was so subtle, its great performance, I did not see it.
