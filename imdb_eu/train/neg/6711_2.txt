It was in 1993 There was a lot of Phillip Seymour Thomas when he won an Oscar. Who would have known a separate movie with him? I was actually paid extra for "My Boyfriend's Back", thrown into a suburb of Austin called Georgetown, TX. The original title was "Johnny Zombie" (thank God the producers had a heart change!) I was at the theater. I was dropped out of the movie to watch the day they released at the theater. Comedy is more than a horror movie. But ... to get a good laugh, maybe you can look. There is nothing beyond the "Dead Dawn" or "Shaun of the Dead" quality, but the cheese factor is enough. hello
