Why would this part of the trash in the world? Zombie Bloodbath, the first two films were stupid, but this is the worst trilogy (perhaps one of the times). He is the director of Todd Sheets, but he is no longer a scriptwriter, that is, he is not negative or positive, that is, as cheerful as a man he writes. Writing f-word is used in excess of 200 and 300 times nausea. The play lasts two times the Bloodbath movies, so naturally, the worst thing I've ever seen. Special effects are better than 2 of the latter, but they still look fun. Earth has become very complex for its benefit, and a bad government experiment took place and zombies were produced. They are also called ice-cream mutilated ice creams, and they are never the most idiotic extremists ever seen. After the movie, the outtakes go, that is to say, the whole movie is strange because it is an outtake. See to laugh at this, if you're serious about this, you might die for yourself. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 95 minutes.
