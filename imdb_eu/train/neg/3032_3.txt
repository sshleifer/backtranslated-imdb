Someone told me that it is one of the best adult movies of today. After seeing this philosophy, I undo everything I have said. It's really awesome. Without entering the long descriptions of different scenes, take the word for me, the sex scene does not have much interest. At first Jenna Street was a remarkable movie (she looks good), but she's down.
