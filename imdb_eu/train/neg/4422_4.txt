This is a real bomb. We believe that Merle Oberon is a demeaning daughter who needs to demonstrate that Tom DeLay was a candidate for politics in the 1930s. Merle's poor man can not go anywhere, but politicians and their noises are surrounded, his wife is terrified and accepts Harry Davenport's uncle only. The two maids meet in a blind date and Gary Cooper has appeared. Things that could be animated by some Rodeo shots, "Misfits", but that's not a luck. Then he goes into a formal dinner that Garyk Merle heads into, and while sitting and invited to join the group he reads a talk about their snobbery. Where does this eloquence of that cowboy come from? The most awesome scene in the movie When Gary finished at home, Merle is a ghost party at the end of her house. Will it ever end? Avoid one.
