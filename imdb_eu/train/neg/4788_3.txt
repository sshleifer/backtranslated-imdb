In the third entry of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie Tall Man continue, a brilliant actor 9, G.I. The spirit of the deceased brother Jane and Mike (who died in the original Phantasm). The number 3 is a disappointing success, Gore and the black comedy is much less inspired and exciting in Phantasm II. I felt the feeling, just like Reggie's lover, his incompetence and his talents were just as talented as stand-up comedians. The humor of the previous movie was much drier and overwhelmed, since such a story was better suited. Also, settings are not as magical as here, and Tall Man's constant presence (Agnus Schrim) is not evident? There are still many gores but half that do not satisfy this time. By the way, be careful about a sharp version, because it shows the most beautiful deaths on the screen. The whole series of Phantasm is Don Coscarelli, and it is the fifth achievement that has written and directed until now, 4 episodes. The first is semi-worship classical; The second is a horror party of gore and violence and the rest are easily skipped. A. Michael Baldwin Mike returns, although James LeGros represented his character much better in Phantasm II.
