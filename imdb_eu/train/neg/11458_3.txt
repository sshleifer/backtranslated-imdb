I can emphasize the good news of the Bo Derek newspaper and the press in the United Kingdom (especially eight newspapers in the world), following a small role called "10" with Dudley Moore. Of course, his photogenic face, clear blue eye glasses and his breasts of revelation were totally noisy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's acting, and never had it, its fort! I always think they should make a compilation of compact discs on the DVD bins - Orca, Tarzan the Ape-man and Bolero. All these films can be named "So Bad They Great". <br /> <br /> A guile would be "I must buy" mine! If you read your press or read this Ms Derek's comment, please do not panic. You have always had your place and places that are more important in the world, more concerned with your theater's ability. Love.x much
