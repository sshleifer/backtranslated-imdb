... or audience. Quick review ... <br /> <br /> So, this doctor who is experimenting with the stolen experiments on the part of the body has just cause. The transplant seeks to perfect, but believes he must do it in his basement. WTF ??? And then suddenly, unfortunately, and comfortable, he is in charge of a traffic accident that he cut his fianc√©e head. With agonized pain, he keeps lasagna in the pan (or is it a strudel?) And pumps it to maintain the "adreno-serum" (sic) pump to keep alive. And then he wakes up, speaking to himself (in some way), though his neck is cut in the nose, and his lungs have not been able to speak. Apparently, his ingospector does not recognize everything his daughter has done for her. Like a woman ... <br /> <br /> Then her pain becomes a heart, because she sees the love of the head of her lover in the body of the sharp bimbo. Meanwhile, a doctor's assistant, an Igor shop-shop, comes in with philosophical arguments that have friendship with the "monster" wardrobe of tele-connectivity, including a mad scientist. In the end, the screenwriter realizes that he can not mislead his misogyny and intimacy issues in the infinite audience, and thus kills them all, and then thinks he will go bank to the movie before the financial sponsor can stop the payment. on top <br /> <br /> I guess it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Turner Classic Movies without showing that edited version. When the assistant was pulled out of his arm, the pyrotechnics that were made with blood without blood all over the house were highly prized.
