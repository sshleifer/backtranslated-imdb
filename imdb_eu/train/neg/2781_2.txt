It is a movie that tries to keep track of the history of Thai history located in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this movie because I thought I had come across many Thai Films that I saw and enjoyed, which Thai actors and martial arts talk about stupidly. Well, that's not it. The movie is filmed in English, Anglo is full of actors and the production values ​​are so serious, laughably bad ... but it's not fun! Who can blame for this garbage? Most of the plays, interviews and sets were very bad. Some of the wrestling scenes were choreographies for local high school drama clubs. Special effects were also very poor, but just a few were released on the screen for cheap animation, especially the cheek effect. He has a large-scale, epic-style outdoor battle where thousands of extra dresses walk through the field, but when the two armies are fighting, HA! What a joke! The film has two beauties. They did not show any more pain. At least, good guys would be. Do not worry
