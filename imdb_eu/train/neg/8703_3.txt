Primal Species (1996, Dir. Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists are amazed at their merchandise for living dinosaurs. The Navy command team needs to think quickly if they want to avoid the disappearance of the human species, instead of reptiles. <br /> <br /> Look at the cover and get the first impressions of the film. That's pretty much. The performance is only acceptable to a few characters. The story is poor, with the whole series based on efforts to kill the dinosaurs and the navy. This movie was 'Jurassic Park' after three years. Instead, this movie appeared 13 years before the 'Jurassic Park'. Dinosaurs are very poor clothes and I mean clothes. People dressed as seemingly, and this film does not try to hide this. A scene that runs down a corridor by a dinosaur is created in a way, and it seems that someone seems to pass through creatures. This movie is a good thing. Short duration It's only 15 minutes from time to time to lose your life, but you still want to avoid it altogether. <br /> <br /> "It's like a nightmare on Friday 13th." - Officer (Brian Currie)
