I know it was that, but they gave me some laughter and maybe it was fun. Some of my reviews have been pretty easy to read. I do not think I would negatively feel this. <br /> <br /> An ancient army that will take over the earth from a huge serpent that destroys the whole world, unless elected heroes choose heroes. Is it a responsibility? become one ?? good dragon ?? or something I do not know. It was so stupid, I did not make much effort to keep it. <br /> <br /> It's really full of stupid and ridiculous storytelling. So many events were random and sudden. <br /> <br /> I suppose there is a study interference or something is because the main problem of the movie seems to be the story. Great and epic, however, everything happens so fast and so fast. I feel like I'm just a big ball with a million plot points and action sequences. The film punching on the face. It's not much time to set character or drama. Imagine "Lord of the Rings" trilogy in 90 minutes? You may have most epic sequential wars, but you should not have any assent and you will not be responsible for the results. That was the case of the Dragon Wars? My 90 minutes were not empty, waiting until I finished. <br /> <br /> Fantastic CGI with good judgment, but a great performance, fast track and a dumb story has been very difficult to enjoy for any reason. . I would probably love it when I was 6 years old.
