Home Alone 3 is one of my favorite movies. If you grow cream or have a cynical sense, things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones are there (or down): Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, they could be worse than these two, at least regularly, to laugh at their stupidity. This made me confuse, and when I started to play I started applauding. Another film has not been mined. Now I will explain why this film is so horrible. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is ridiculous. In a remote control car (?!) It is located in a chip and how terrorists want it. Stupid things <br /> <br /> The following actions are similar to two other home-based people, boobytraps and the other, but seeing these boobytraps run is fun rather than being fun, to be very unpleasant. I did not laugh (although I used to smile more than once, but I was constantly working on it, and I hoped that the terrorists would nail their baby. Instead of offering poultry relief, it was not like it and it was annoying. <br /> <br /> The effect, like a bundle of unnamed names, is poor and painless. There is no good performance here. Alex D.Linz is as unfocused as the baby, as they have appeared on the street while they are terrorists (and the credits of their film) ... And well, that's it. <br /> <br /> Some say: "Man is for kids, do not want man." Well, MAN likes children, but they can get much better. See Monsters Inc. . Not taking into account the Toy Story. Hell, even though Scooby Doo and Garfield (sucking - to see more of these reviews)! <br /> <br /> So, after all, this terrifying huge film It's one to get money right away It was recycled two times, since it was almost completely distant; The only thing that is both the first two completely insulting. There is no human, no reason, to see the house alone. That's a bad thing. <br /> <br /> 0/5 stars
