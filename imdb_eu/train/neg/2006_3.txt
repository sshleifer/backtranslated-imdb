A book called 'The House Next Door', adapted for film or TV, would explain why it took so long to get rid of it. The book was redacted in 1978. There could be a reason to design a 'house'. The life house in this cinema is really so ugly and I can not imagine what it's buying. In fact, it is so blind that someone probably came and built it. <br /> <br /> I am not crazy about horror book genres, but this was difficult when I came to it when I came back about ten years ago. The main characters are not people who are looking for something hidden in life, and this is one of the strengths of the book. It is not an architect who was a type of demon ... without witnesses and studies of events so well described in the book that people (or the devil of character) would conclude. However, it's mostly a rough book, and I do not think that Lifetime attracts people. Maybe someone will come up with another version of the book. Better house ... Better music ... Better script and darker lighting ... would definitely help.
