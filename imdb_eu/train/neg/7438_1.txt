This movie loses time, the plot is horrible, the conversation is awful. <br /> <br /> The play is fine, but the actors do not have any plot or script to work. There are some good effects on photography and effects, but again there is no interest in watching this movie. There is no logical progress in the story, the storyline is stupid. It's not terrifying too. To make the movie terrifying, there must be at least one small credibility element. This movie is not credible. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the film. Each character has no skin and no personality. <br /> <br /> The special effects and most of the works that make up are misunderstood or cigar. <br /> <br /> I hope you read that and do not waste time in this movie. They are curious to see a totally horrible movie.
