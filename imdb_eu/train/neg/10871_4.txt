I read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel ... so my expectations were the same. But they were more than expected to break. The film would be a decent movie if he had not read the novel earlier, maybe it was forbidden to me. <br /> <br /> However, for some reason, they moved to a bowl in the workplace in Toulon. loss slaves. Bishop Myriel's scene was fine. Actually, apart from the loss, things went on until the Fantine release. We do not want to have bad things because it happens to good women, it does not cut your hair, sell your teeth or become a prostitute. The worst thing is to get into the mayor's office and spill on his face. Bamatabois is completely deleted. Even children who do not want to marry have to talk about them, Tholomys Fantin's husband is dead, rather than a dandy careless. Valjean won Cosette for Fantine before Champmathieu's affair, so they're happy again, another change. Then comes the convents to make the scene difficult enough. Fortunately, it was saved. After three minutes of detail, however, the movie begins again with classic sales ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While Cosette and Valjean walk through the park, Marius will speak at a meeting. About the prison reform When Valjean and Cosette distribute fliers, she said the movie that screamed to me on television. "We are not revolutionaries." I heard Victor Hugo knock in his grave. THE COURSE IS RECEIVED! They want to make a rebellion against the pseudo-monarchy in favor of another republic, mystical scriptwriter! True historical is that it was a rebellion against the government in 1832. <br /> <br /> At one point, Cosette gave his father a donation to Marius for the reform movement and he knows Eponine. ... No Eponine. Or, at least, Eponine in the book. This eponine seems to be a good secretary girl who works for prison reformers (Universal Caf√© working for Cafe Universal). They do not like the audience, they want their dress to be unexcused, cut off, tightly dressed and suitably dressed. <br /> <br /> <br /> Prison reformers (who have thrown in the Enjolras badly). I have always seen them) I have decided that distributing brochures is no longer enough. Barricades will be built. I do not know about yours, but I have never heard the reform movements to break the streets and build barricades and attack the government troops. About three hundred people (it was not so much), the National Guard was attacked and barricades began to arise, etc. Eponin happily kills Mariusk. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is accurate, because Javert understands his self-sufficiency, thanks to the minimal screenplay and the extravagant interpretation. The film ends in Valjea, jumping into the Javert River. This is once again correct because it was not overvalued by Valjean Javert. He saved the life of man earlier, why did he kill him now? Afterwards, the complete denunciation of the murder of Valjean's father, the destruction and salvation of his death by Marius and Cosette next to him. <br /> <br /> In general, I guess the script mostly because of the problems. While I was happy, they appeared at least in the movie Enjolras and Eponine, they were very badly interpreted, like the whole barricade. Removing fantasy's suffering prevents us from feeling most of it. Cosette tells Valjean about the earth from the beginning of the past. I did not see Thenardier and Mme. Then he had only a few minutes of the showard. The same is true of Gavroche. Frederick March likewise liked the interpretation of Valjean, amongst the restoration features of the film. On the other hand, Charles Laughton, in other films, seems to have lost his mark with Javert for his great work. His lips trembled, unnecessary cries, and his whole activity was completely wrong. I did not see a threat as much as I have seen in many Javerts, something that the person asks for. <br /> <br /> Again, this movie would be much better if I did not read the book. But I would not recommend reserving purists. In addition, I would say that the film could be a good adaptation at the time, but the previous year there was no exact French version.
