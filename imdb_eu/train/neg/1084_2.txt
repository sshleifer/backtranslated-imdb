I rented this DVD for two reasons. The cast of great actors, and the director, even Robert Altman can play. In this case, it was lost. Altman's attempted suspension collapsed. After seeing Kenneth Branagh on a good movie like "Dead Again", I did not think he could help this turkey, and I hope he did not ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have been one of only one Oscar winners. In the downward spiral, that is, such as making money-making movies. Duvall was a great actress in films, although his best game was "Tender Mercies", but "The Great Santini." This movie lost a lot of time. I give it 10 to 10
