This movie was awesome. I saw it three times and not even that. It is impossible to see, the story line is horrible, disappointing and very boring. I do not write anything writing spoilers, so it's annoying to know why you want to see yourself. John Savage was a good start on this movie, an initial interview, and some of the films. The little girl in this movie is annoying, and the whole situation is dirt. I watched this movie in American outlets, so I thought it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I was wrong !!!! The play is horrible and the nudity is bad. Another thing is that Starr Andreef, the main character, has not been a bad past movie, which was quite good. It's the same with John Savage. This movie SUCKS!
