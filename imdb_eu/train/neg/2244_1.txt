At the beginning, I have to point out clearly two points. First of all, we know what this year's Oscar is about this year. The people of the academy were no racist way, and it never was. They wanted to clear all the ideas they thought about themselves. Secondly, making notes about this symbol is not intended. Really, what's the difference? But it's fun to write about it. This year I was healthy with Oscar! I will never see the show. Every year they make mistakes. When Crowe won with "Gladaitor", the real winner was Ralph Fiennes for "Sunshine". If you have not seen the movie yet, see and agree. The name "Eyes Wide Shut" has not been nominated. And this year, well, bad opportunities were in place! Baz Lurhmann did not get a "good director" appointment! You're kidding! "A Beautiful Mind" has been created for "Improvement Makeup"? "Training Day" will be named? It was a horrible movie, and it seemed like Washington did not turn on a performance, because, as a result of everything, he knows how to use four-letter words! Which won the prize! Move the language and bet I almost play it! I liked Gosford Park, I really did, but why did 7 appointments? And how could Altman be on earth? Do I mean, if you give the prize to the public to unleash the bad feelings, Altman? The man has been in the public eye for 32 years and he does not have Oscari! I got a lot closer to this year's Oscar, but I live with her, even though I do not have to watch another show! The main point of the show was when Woody Allen appeared before his first appearance ever. That's one of the most important moments in the history of the show.
