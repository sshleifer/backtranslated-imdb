I would not see this comedy! I would never have seen this comedy "I see this documentary" if it were not for foolish stupidity. This movie is full of bad guides and horrible moments. One particular issue is that the Afghan police / soldiers were arrested for filming on the streets to keep the cameraman in search of his arrests and then continue shooting at his plush hotel. Then, a car crashes a car that is reversed and parked well along the side of the road without crashing or without an explosion. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised I'm currently getting a rating (5.8 / 10). I thought the IMDb users had a sense.
