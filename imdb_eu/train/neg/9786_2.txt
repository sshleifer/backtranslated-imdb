Okay, I bought this movie from Woolworths because of a joke about my birthday for my friend, because the front cover had a rays of sex. <br /> <br /> But we still decided. Only for purpose purposes. <br /> <br /> And sorry, but this has been one of the worst movie in history. <br /> <br /> It started out well and we thought "This would be fine." But we spent about 10 minutes, unfortunately I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It started when the most mysterious "mysterious ballerina" began, because Scouser / Australian (I say that it was an accent, which can not be identified), I just said that he was abysmal. <br /> <br /> Then came to an end, and then we all lost our will to live. Final paint ball. <br /> <br /> The only thing we like about this land is that they really did not win, but they were mistakenly won by default. <br /> <br /> And I know this has nothing to do with it, but the name given to the team was horrible. Critical damages. I mean to choose a terrific name like "destructive to God's destructive". Or, anyway, it should call the movie.
