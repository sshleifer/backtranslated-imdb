Well, so I'm not a great video game, but did the House of the Dead make a movie really famous? Of course video game clips were fast-paced, just like violence justified a specific scene, but there are dozens and dozens of games that are the same, at the bottom. The screen, in your opinion, having any weapon and going to any foreigner, or putting the dead or snipers or in any case. <br /> <br /> The house is very interesting among the dead. For college children (UNDERTAGHT college children, such as children who have paid $ 1,500 for fishers after losing their boat) are trying to get out of this island. year. In the first place that tells the House of the Dead, it has become increasingly clear that modern horror films have become more and more fashionable to get more exclusive outfits worn by so many young people. the same situations In this case, at least, the girl dressed as a fashion came without excuses. They misunderstand the socks that go through the woods, but at least they get dressed for this outfit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Clint Howard is an interesting character of the film so far, he has an incredible performance, a greatness that covers all the movie's actors. I can not stand up to the popular actors to change the accent in the film, which is so inexperienced, and Howard tries to show here how hard it is that the actor knows the hardest fishing potential. years of breathing salt water He was not well plunged. He ate before throwing a roll of cinnamon, and unexpectedly he was breathing sugar or something. Really hard, Clint! I expected more in her, but once again she agreed on a part of this illness. <br /> <br /> After arriving at the island, the film becomes a temporary one on Friday the 13th. Place in Camp Crystal Lake. Teenagers overwhelmed many teenagers who played the actors, and then died. I think nudity, but think for a minute. These kids pay almost two grandchildren to go to this island, to go to the Break Year, NOT find it, and they say, who wants beer! There was no reason why the guy who had not gotten out the hundreds of cashmere did not even think that they had found nothing on the whole bar and no lonely person. Here is the introduction to the director of Uwe Boll. Alcohol! They do not realize that those who come will not be anybody else! <br /> <br /> So, not only do they start to drink, because they do not seem to be leaving the whole island, but when the girl goes to dark woods to find out where everyone is (dragging another girl and a boy hard), that guy and behind The remaining girl decides that it will be an excellent idea to get rid of them faster, just because they are. As the island was expecting to be empty, and the rest of the people that had come for a while, they would have little privacy in the meantime. Brilliant! <br /> <br /> Now, everyone hated things, depending on what I've read about the movie reviews. Yes, inserting the video game shots into the film, especially, the movie was copied directly from the video game copies. Of course, the idea was stupid. I can not imagine what this little nugget would have thought, but it's worse than that, the Matrix style bullet had time and occasionally threw the scenes. For the first time afterwards, I found that there was a lack of folly and folly that could have been a movie like this, as if it were an original, it is more evident than the actual technique of the film, with any dramatic significance or creations. Any tension in the film. <br /> <br /> A zombie movie that is terrifying on the edge of your seat is slowly and steadily transported to human beings. They are much faster, but they get tired, run out of places and fight against zombies with a terrifying fear. The first two films are made live, children are terrified and do not run many places on an island, but after being smuggled, they are armed. And I want to say a lot. I mean, those people who do all the machines guns and grenades, that is to say, that eliminates most of the tension of the dead. <br /> <br /> Then I call the techno-slasher scene. Since Rav has never happened, and I think Uwe Boll thought that people could not hear a techno music in the movies, and there is a scene in the middle, where all human beings are fighting dead and surprisingly enough. music becomes something of a video. There are explosions of tech-music, the shots are quicker and faster, together with a boring shot, it only lasts up to 5 frames (approximately 1/6 time) with flashing speed on the screen. music Actually, I think, but it does not have a horror movie because it totally eliminates the tension of the effect that is totally frustrated or falling, you can not cope with this enough time to deal with it. You are watching this plan on the screen and asks what he thought the director decided to put something similar in the movie. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of people comparing this movie with Resident Evil, especially copying its premise, and they're fine. I appreciate here that, at least, in the case of Resident Evil, there were no human-generated viruses that could infect other people and turn people around, as vampires transformed others into vampires. 28 Days Later had a clear inspiration for this film, but it's not too bad that the house of the deceased did not make any of the original things, but a bit of an idea for quick video game shots. , in this case you will forget it. I really think that this was a much better movie. Clearly, I can not say that I know much about the base game, the title and film poster deserve a better movie, but unfortunately it's not horror movies. It is really sad that when a movie is released and therefore it is announced as a horror film, and it is the closest thing to the whole movie, which suggests the possibility of a sequel.
