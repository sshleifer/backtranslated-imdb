Scenic use of scenes cuts. All tracking will be lost, both awful scripts and lethargic directions. This nasty robot ... was a jazz mustache dancer? Also, one of the worst sounds I've ever heard (the musician usually drowned monologues.) And ... where did they get their props? This vessel is like a dairy bucket ... I made the best special effects at the age of 8 at age 13! It's NOT to learn how to produce the movie. Or ... was the editor's fault? <br /> <br /> It's really bad, because the scenario was really a good concept ... it was poorly executed around. (Forgive Malcom. You should send a "Double Stunt", you're a good actress with such a rude bomb.)
