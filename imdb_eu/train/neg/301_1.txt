This is the worst document ever released in Canada! I'm glad I did a movie that has no boys. Anyone who wants to do will have to make a movie and do not have to type it. Scripting is changing the people they are recording. I could not get out of the theater when I saw it at the Toronto Film Festival. Please never watch this movie.
