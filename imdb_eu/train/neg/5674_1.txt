God, what's up? Uwe Boll movie and positive comments? Wow! <br /> <br /> Kindly note that most of the positive reviews come from Bollen's work from beginners. In my opinion, as I stated in previous reviews of Uwe Boll, I only see his films, one day to do something really good. I mean ... THAT'S FOR YOU! <br /> <br /> Oh, the Son is not that day. I do not know where to start with a crazy attempt at a horror movie. People remember that all of the world's diseases have been seen in various ways in the video or network ... or so Bolle thinks. I still can not think of myself for the rest of my life why it was necessary to kill real-life animals and kill them in the first 10 minutes of the film. I understand the concept of Seed (killer) sicko and see such things ... but I do not know why he thought Mr Boll was working to get REAL playing. Maybe it will surprise us? Hmmm ... well, I am not credible with myself and I do not see anything in the movie. I have not found, however, that the footage of the real cruelty of animals is not so entertaining. If you wanted to impress me, it did not work. He reminded me of what happened in the world, as well as Uwe Boll for making movies. This context may work for the 70/80 film (now the Cannibal Holocaust), but not the current market. <br /> <br /> All this, along the way, Uwe has made Eman a very cheap, very similar feeling to the movie, like BloodRayne 2. It seems that there is not a large amount of money in production. As usual, Mr Boll really does not care. For a decent story, we also watch videos from the victims of Seed victims, and in the first 25 minutes we are watching various police officers. Each of these videos ends with a decompression of the victim more rapidly. It is very boring and boring. I'm not going to comment on the toddler scene because it's a cheap factor for shock and other shock. <br /> <br /> If you want to sit in the first 25 minutes, you will go to police officers to catch a dark house to Seed. Here's a huge illumination and Uwe's old 'I did not use a stable' fiasco that has made with BloodRayne 2. Look at the police never get stupid way to die more and more until they get caught as Seed. This scene is stupid, innocent, and that is to be believed. The police say that Seed could shoot. For an unknown reason, the police did not shoot him. Seed is the seizure that kills children and adults, which we thought would be the dominant moment. <br /> <br /> From now on, we are dealing with stupid scenes of execution, followed by the police buried in Seed (and they know he is alive ... why not shoot him in the head), after leaving Seed, he dies a random woman with a hammer and then kidnapped. about the police family <br /> <br /> I try to get everything you're looking for here, it's just STUPID! Hollywood's fear is not stupid ... it's just. Uwe Boll can not be corrected **** Any such unpleasant ship would agree with this statement. Anyone who views this movie finds an entertaining form and form, should look like a serious person. <br /> <br /> Again, misread, directed, clarified, produced and written scripts are directed to us.
