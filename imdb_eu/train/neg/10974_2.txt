I am Irish and I live in Denmark a bit, when I plan to go home last week, I could see Intermission. And I'll keep it in the record: <br /> <br /> It's a GREAT FILM. <br /> <br /> Not bad as bad as "Ireland's most prolific man", but there is no doubt about other Irish films, such as The Commitments, I Went Down or Michael Collins. <br /> <br /> Some of the aspects of the film are quite fun, such as the American style guard Colm Meaneys. But the film itself is completely wrong. The camera bounce and the constant zoom and zoom out make the film look sharp as if it were a crazy theater. But it is not. This is Irish Lock, Stock and Two Smoking, which is why shooting. It should be a smooth move from one shot to the other. The movie just looks like it's dull and thrown together. <br /> <br /> The performances are fine, with a great script. A friend told me, exactly like Colin Farrell continued for a week in Dublin. It's a decent screen in Dublin Dirtbag mode, but it does not compare to Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth for its performances. The best result is a woman with half-frustrated women given by her bank manager for a young woman given to Dierdre O'Kane. I think of leaving his stand-up divine and going over to himself. <br /> <br /> With all that, the Irish press has no hope of giving it to the expectations. It is also considered one of the best Irish films. <br /> <br /> I expect a reaction with these comments because most people said it was great. Before answering, ask yourself: Would we think that movie well if it were set in England or America?
