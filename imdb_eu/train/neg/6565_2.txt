This movie just reminds Bollywood of being a Hollywood parasite. Bollywood also goes to past warehousing in its industry. <br /> <br /> Vidhu Vinod Chopra filmed "Deewar" and "Motivation on the waterfront" with a motivation to bring a cocktail with Oscar. He has failed again. <br /> <br /> The title idea is also inspired by classic Elia Kazan. It's original that Brando symbolizes the peace symbol. <br /> <br /> Bollywood needs to take it out of the shade of Hollywood if it is to be taken seriously.
