The screenplay of this Columbo movie seems to be a TV series of the 1980s. Very well-aimed characters are very good films, but if the characters are compelling. And in this film, the desire to change the channel was mandatory. The criminals are like his writing written by a romantic novelist. The great Lieutenant Colonel does not have a wonderful, lovable, foolish, and wrinkled head; and you're wounded / kidnapped by the victims and single-sided boys (scared of fear by the hand of his ruler, afraid of his little right handbag)! Your hand and about 2 minutes have been tasted, you know what it is. In any sense of reality, this character would have to at least fight or at least fight. And talking about reality ... stories have been kidnapped and solved by the police around a kidnapping. Police ?? Give me a break. Everyone knows that the FBI takes every kidnapping case. Columbo was NOT, that is, a completely predictable budget of 2 hours long, written and extended by the famous Lieutenant Columbo.
