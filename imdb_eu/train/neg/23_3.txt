I rented it on DVD without prior knowledge. I was suspicious of seeing Michael Madsen appearing in a movie I ever heard, but it was a freebie, so why not look. <br /> <br /> Well, I guess Blonde liked him pretty much. I forgot to say that the shame of a movie has been a part of that. <br /> <br /> It seems that if your scripts and conversations are awful, even good actors can not save the day. No need to mention this movie without the need for amateur actors. English speakers who speak English do not speak too much English speakers; Thus, they read the lines of a script to be thrown out and do not enter into the film. It's incredible how disbelieving the sound of the movie. Music is horrible and completely out of place, and the whole thing is playing like a bad look and sound. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you see that you are better at watching film. That's why I gave it 1 instead of 1 worth.
