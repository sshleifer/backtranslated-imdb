Jay Len is the only part of a four-letter word cut, that is, the only part of the memorable police couple's unequal couples. At COLLISION COURSE, the comedian of the pelican facial collides with Pat Morita to find a stolen turbocharger prototype (do you think the lover of the car has played Leno's hands?). Both directors have tried hard, they really do, but Leno is not an actress and Morita's fish habits are aging in a hurry. The film makes an appeal to the 80's, but the good times are decreasing, reaching a 100-minute long period. Leno's enthusiastic comedies will feel the fans; others will get bored.
