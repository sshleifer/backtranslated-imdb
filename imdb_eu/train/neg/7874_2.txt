Somehow, Time Corridor is a story that is successful, because the movie gets its purpose: see thousands. Even if he does not laugh, <br /> <br /> Les Visiteurs has succeeded, because it's an original way of thinking about the journey time: forget to come back to Zemeckis, the old one. In France, middle-aged knight and his life almost barbecue. Full of pride, it uses fun thanks to ancient words. Sometimes Montmirail is boring, but keeps his homage. Then comes the follow-up. <br /> <br /> No one planned the great success of Les Visiteurs. And it's not worth a film-maker who realizes money making movies. <br /> <br /> The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs, and immediately the attempt continues for a while. The second thought needed a paradox. Explanation: Jacquouille has not been able to steal the curiosities that are trying to be available; Do not you remember when the first step was over when it bought a bright and expensive red car? Where do you think he has found the money? Selling Jewels ... And this is among many holes. He tries to avoid poisoning ... and he fails. <br /> <br /> Let's see the characters: Montmirail does not change, it's a bit more. boring. In regard to Frenegonde ... another story is: Valérie Lemercier decided that he was not committed to this pursuit in the role of the bourgeoisie. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her as she felt so embarrassed. And Poiré does not realize that a cast of humorists is not enough to make a good comedy. <br /> <br /> Forget about trips, digital effects, the story, and you'll see it in a postmark, it's a good place to write 10 times. <br /> <br /> The main interest of this film are landscapes. A young movie, let's say, until 13 years old.
