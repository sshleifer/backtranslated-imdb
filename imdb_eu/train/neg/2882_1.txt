This movie tells you what the biggest pillar is, taking it to Wichita Kansas and growing it; I know that 90% of the film is Bogus. Apart from the names of some of the victims, it is not correct anywhere else. The film seems to have made me use the father's use. I think the footage taken from another movie with the stock of a murderer. I usually enjoy watching happy movies, but because of bad performances, poorly trained or non-existent groups are very violent and short. I wanted to see the final battle. I recommend that you do not waste any money for this film, or sorry. Crunch
