You know that you're in trouble, rather than John Cassavetes's half-heartedness, rather than confirming the whole movie, and "The Incubus" is the worst and worst scenario in which the bills are to be paid. . Actually, the Hammy script and John Hough's 'Baroque' art direction, can not be blamed for it. The film takes place with a series of rape killings that take place in a small town, mixed with supernatural hue. In a way, the direction absorbs interests from outside the scenes, and Cassavetes seems PO to be visible. Sometimes. The same incubus, without appearing until the last scene, is a well-developed one, but it's not worth waiting for. <br /> <br /> 1/10
