Well, it's been said about that movie and I hate writing what I've written, everything they have already said. But the thing is, I've seen film zillions and I'm writing reviews about all the films I've watched. So I have to write something. <br /> <br /> The effect is stupid. It's a very stupid news as the anchor flies toward the plane crash. The little girl is nice and a professional assistant who helps her take care of the child. The three main killings of the movie are so weak because they ask what the stupid movie may be. They do not realize that rapists can still be terrifying. We do not see how grandma dies. They felt they felt they felt they were killed by dentists and their helpers, you just give them kindness. And the uncle tossed in a way that could work better in the tony garage. We hear the scream and do not see anything!
