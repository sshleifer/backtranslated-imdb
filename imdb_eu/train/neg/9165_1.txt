There is no comment in this review, what's shown in the movie trailer. I am trying to balance myself in my review, I am strongly accepting local movies, but I can not accept the reaction against this movie. Slow, boring, and no limit. Although "almost pretty and unbelievable moments" immediately caused painful touches and performance. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, who I usually love, were only good at this movie. The director felt like he wanted to make the TV Soap melodramatic, and then they took him and decided to put on the big screen. I'd like to come to the Jumping Years with RA rating (Terrific rating), but I do not change my faith in local movies. Good movies will come, such as no movies.
