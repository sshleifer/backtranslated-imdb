I'm going to talk about all that I am agreeing with, not asking for a short moment that you do not see this fascinating movie. High efficiency, incorrect production values, pedestrian direction, and script so inept and innocent have never been written, produced only. Hollywood also "professionals" seem to work only for pay-per-view jobs, although no one has to pay for that bad job. The jobs would end up properly on this clear conclusion. <br /> <br /> Oh, there's something weird about seeing something bad. And Chad Lowe is terrifically and consistently bad.
