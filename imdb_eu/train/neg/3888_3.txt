I go down to make the review as short and delicious as possible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is not this astronaut, and he will spend in a spacecraft with two other men, you know? As it happens, it attracts radiation and then returns ... well, it does not matter to others, but our astronaut is melting! Do not just burn, but MELT! Like an ice cream cone in July! Well, maybe it's not fast, but I know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Either way, it gets red and gooey, and it melts everything that melts. I think that he has supervised the "melting handbook", he suddenly knows that he must melt completely, he must eat human flesh, so people start to extract it. <br /> <br /> There are other characters, but the man melts and melts and melts in a movie, do you really need others? It is important that the WHO will continue, and WHAT will they be left? How long should it melt for nothing? WHY is this movie first? Where did they get the money? When will you sleep while you are watching? <br /> <br /> I have almost completely mixed up, but I still have enough time to say that this movie is boring, even though the idea is very nice and enjoyable. raw. Make-up is clean, but everything else ... SPLAT
