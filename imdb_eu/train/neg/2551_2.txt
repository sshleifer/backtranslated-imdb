Misled by the deceit of Azalaren, "American Pie is fun", waiting for the comedy that sat down before the girlfriend and the television ... and that's not the other. You will probably not laugh, you're never one of those heads. It's not an erotic movie, at least something, about sex ... <br /> <br /> So what's this? The earthquake is about a guy who wants to lose his virginity (zero in originality, I remember it as a "loss") and his friend's team. The rest of the characters (ie, the girls) come and go without reason. Let's go, there are also dwarfs (so simple: "dwarves are fun ...") Theater is a very television (a video that looks like the whole movie) and the girls are most amateur. ... <br /> <br /> A horrible movie. Amateur, poorly produced and completely NOT DUE. Children and teenagers would like to see their friends with rumors and sexual jokes. Also, do not think renting this movie.
