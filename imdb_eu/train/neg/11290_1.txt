It's the worst movie of all time. Although Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey. I've heard that the movie was originally titled "The Treasure", but it changed to "Sharks Treasure" as "Sharks Treasure" to take advantage of the excitement created by "Jaws". I think sharks were in a scene in this movie; It was supposed to sell tickets for the inclusion of "thriller". It did not work Whenever something is "good" in the film, the crew of the ship eats together when it is being developed with a brand of beer that was introduced at that time. Do not you think beer could be a sponsor? Could not they know the obvious? It is the only thing anyone can do when they break their beer. That's enough for celebration.
