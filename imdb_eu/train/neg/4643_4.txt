I rented this movie on the DVD. I know that the movie that was ordered in the back of the movie would be welcome, but when I saw Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) I had to rent it. It starts well because the movies of the tobacco are broadcast by cable. However, the main character is not for him, to let himself fall ill, and he really hangs on the end of the movie. There are too many unanswered questions. It was a brilliant scene at the end, I was shocked, it took me completely, but in general it was a very sub-movie movie, but I think it was worth paying $ 3.99.
