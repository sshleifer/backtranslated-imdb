This film, although not quite bad, was where real events were to be filmed. Grand Island, Nebraska, was destroyed on the night of June 3, 1980 in seven tornades. The Grand Island is located on an almost plain valley of the Platon River, in the province of Hall. The authors of this film were filmed on the hillside of Ontario, and the entire event was taken to a different town called Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island were very hard to forget about this awesome night due to a bad movie.
