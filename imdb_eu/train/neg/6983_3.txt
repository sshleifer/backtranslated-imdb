The Revolution is a horrible movie, I do not care about the story of a teacher, news writer, Al Pacino, there's no way to win this movie '10'. <br /> <br /> Pointing to the Key Landing Tom Dobb (Al) is trying to get money if radical patriots take the boat. Everything is based on that note. His son, Tom, joins the army to complete the release, pushing Tom out of the army, trying to get out of the army, and later the war is over and eventually turn their note into the ship. . End <br /> <br /> There were several fighting scenes that were very modest. Scene transitions used "five months later" and magically portrayed the characters in a famous historical battle. The love story is a joke and the movie is generally difficult to follow. So keep your "Notes" and see Patriot instead.
