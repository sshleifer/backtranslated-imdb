It's available in Dark Sky Films, "Drive In Double Feature," and since I finished "Barracuda", I also saw it. At the same time, it is a film that is very ambitious and inept. <br /> <br /> We start with two young women who travel through the streets of a foreign country, but where are they? Do not stop seeing necklaces from some Chinese retailers and try to shop in Chinese clothing, but do we see some Aztec dancers? And, at the same time, the girls follow two boys, girls who have not had to go after girls, and eventually they are forced to flee wild in the whole country and eventually capture them. It seems a little girl has a coin in his neck in the chain and these guys want to find robbery and where did he get it? So, in the flashback, we go back to find out. And how did they know that this coin? Really, really. <br /> <br /> Now, every day, when these two women were 10 years old, with their sisters and sisters, the boyfriend of his boyfriend came out of the boat to get out. In their tents, they bring this young man to his house, to take his grandfather and invite a "young" herb to his lovers. But no one eats at home, but Todd has returned to investigate young girls, and when they are away they break the ship and, when they return home, their friends have disappeared mysteriously. Well, these "nice people" seem to lift their vegetables, but they wait for their flesh with sorcery and serve herbal tea. <br /> <br /> But girls and toddies have left the island, but now they are returning, escorted by their catches, and there is a treasure trove there, even though no one showed them the girls. There seems to be someone else on the island, and the thugs start to die mysteriously, one by one, and only three are not long. And there is a happy ending, which will leave the viewer as shameful as the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Two wicked people seem to be angry at speed and combined. They have no abilities without actors hilarious hilarious. The family-owned mountaineer also has unstructured ability, although his grandfather was Hank Word, which featured many feature films and TV shows. The action is confusing because the premises are more confusing and the island is like Southern California. <br /> <br /> So what's that hell? I'm not sure, but definitely worth seeing, thinking (or saying), right? From 10 to 10, very curious.
