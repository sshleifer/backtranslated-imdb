There really is no way to describe this movie really, really. It's really sad that I was sitting by this movie, a very tiring and predictable movie. What's wrong? Performance: There is also a performance similar to being a sub-peer (at least very nice). Soundtracks (songs): "If we get into the Orgy soundtrack, everyone knows they see a horror movie!"; Soundtracks (scores): Okay, but with the keyboard, anyone can play a soundtrack these days. Do not even start with me "What the hell?" a few moments, here are some: the murderer can move to the speed of the light - the door becomes an actor, nobody is there, it goes back, there is something in front of him; So far, where the killer comes out with a drill, really great! Filmmakers score at least those who connect, but I really think that the killer will take time to find an electric current to get out. I feel the patron saint at the beginning of the Holy Grail and I mean "Where do you get the drill?". I can keep that movie bad, but I have only 1000 words. I'll give you two ten stars. One star laughs and duplicates another star. Seriously, do not waste time with this.
