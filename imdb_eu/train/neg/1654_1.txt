Last score: 0 (from 10 onwards) <br /> <br /> *** Possible scene spoilers (but whoever plays it) *** <br /> <br /> Yes, it's: zero. And I rarely give them up. For most movies, music, cinematography, imagination, humor, as well as good rhythms as a point of view. Look inside its genres or sub-genres. But there's nothing here for free. I can not rememeber when a movie was going through the room when I really finished. The only reason I had finished was that I could not change the channel. I was sitting there simply, incredibly, and seeing the innocent peculiarities of what would happen next. A snake was like watching a rat. <br /> <br /> But enjoy and let's take this baby. First of all, there is nothing technical about "whipped". Visions are all style of sitcom. Cut scenes are just images on night traffic. Music and scores not only involve films. It's unexpected However, he has not given any contribution. Playing is cardboard around it, which is for Amanda Peet (it is clear that the "star" of the train's ruin). Good friends think these boys really do not have any chemicals or sense, since Peter M. Cohen has spent a few minutes round the bus station, <br /> <br /> there's no creature's original bone in the body. No imagination. Thousands of times do not show us anything. The whole premise of this film, or "twist", is based on male bashing and "power-driven women" as they are "based on the" idea "they play. Anyone who thinks of anyone who thinks or is not a natural way, of course, has never been able to turn on the television. Female twists and covers are common. It is a male bashing rule. It does not steal in any way, it is worse: it stole from clich√©s. I can not imagine women doing a movie that depicts a woman based on stereotypes and contempt. I want to rent a "Men's Business" or, in other words, "There is no Mary." This movie aims to be "Edgier" "There Something About Mary" to see sweat. <br /> <br /> Movies do not even know women, men, dates, sex, or anything. Cohen is just enough to reinstate other sexist film films. On the other side, the movie does not work as a satire, even if it is abusive, it may be "satirical", because it does not have satin. I do not know what is satirising. Then the conversation, which is roughly the obscenities of the characters, is screaming with each other. For example: 1 character: "F ** k you" Character 2: "Oh, yes, well f ** you" (repeat) <br /> <br /> And the bottom line, which can all forgive others. discrepancies: there are lots of movies without plots, unreleased, morally repulsive characters and lustful conversation, fun, and therefore good. "The tough guy" is not fun. It's not the second one. It does not have comic ability or time. The situations are totally false, they are not based on the slogan of truth, they make us laugh. Generally, the characters drawn may appear related to the smallest common designation. Check out the "classic worship" of the "room of the tent". One anti-hero against us opens the medicine cabin and sees it shaking Mena (Peet). For some reason, the light is reflected on it as if it had found the Holy Grail. Why does Cohen think that men react to vibrators in this way, I do not know. While he gets tired of himself, he goes down the toilet and then tries to bare his hands when he finds Mena with her. Oh, on my sides. <br /> <br /> But surprisingly, people really like the movie. Of course, people are also like "Friends" and I am not surprised by real-world dating shows. All this, however, is a common thread. "The tough guy" is a great proof for me, it's just a huge pocket of American people, who will laugh at any joke about sex. They would like any show or movie (or they think they like it) for dating or relationships. Any quality lack is that people do not hesitate. More people are more endocrinated to sell more demanding teeth and thinner body manuscripts and lose weight programs, such as selling cheap, blank, unstoppable TVs, movies and any product to sell blindly lap dating / relationships. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, when I'm dead, I'll be the only console I've ever had for my whole life for 80 minutes. <br /> <br />
