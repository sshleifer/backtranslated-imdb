Rob Schneider is a famous comedy for his movements, facial facials and "non-human" performances. This time it is an animal. Marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero, and one day, no man is attacked, so Marvin needs to take this case and save him from attack. On the way to the crime scene, he collapsed his car and was really damaged. He does not remember what happens and in the next ordinary day, his life is not identical with knowing the animal's instincts. Of course, we are trying to try our character our main character, but his attempts are not useless. Collen Haskell works. There are no negative characters. The character is a negative one, the destiny that can be used for this metaphor. Marvin should know how to become a common man. By the way, the sense of his animal helps in some situations. Schneider's performance is so. The movie is so unreal, it sometimes makes me stupid, but it's one of those films, as I have written as an outgrowth fun. So see the monkeys style for Rob Schneider, but it's definitely not one of the best comedies or one of the best films in Schneider. He is a good comedian, but this is not his best film.
