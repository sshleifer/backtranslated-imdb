Never watch this movie. <br /> <br /> He pretends to be a scam against film and thriller in the 1950s and 1960s. However, accepting all that is wrong is that you want to see one of them and not. <br /> <br /> It's very bad. It must be a party that is more than just parity. This movie has no part. <br /> <br /> Save yourself. It's too late for me, but ... do not miss it.
