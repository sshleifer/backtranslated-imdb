Well, here's a movie to take on another role. They were worth seeing, even though the plot of gender reversal is tired. However, this is not. In the previous reviews, I think that in the late 80's Haim films have made a general decline. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> 'Just One of the Girls' is about a high school child (Corey Haim), trying to avoid his running of the bulls as a girl and go to another school. She joins Cheerleading and joins Marie (Nicole Eggert), the beloved cheerleader. Of course, it can not keep longer characters. <br /> <br /> I thought that movie was pure, and it was not fun. But most reviews seem to see Alanis Morrisette or Nicole Eggert's queen of sex. If you are looking for a good Haim function (or roles comedy change), look at it before 1989. We're talking about the point that Haim puts on his career.
