"Les visiteurs" was original, hilarious, interesting, balanced and near perfect. LV2 "must be the first one the safest worst good movie". In LV2, everyone shouts that when a gag does not work for the first time, it is repeated again 5 times with a vague hope, which will eventually become fun. LV2 LV1's parody is horrible, of course, a parody must be a guesser. If you love LV1, you have not seen the movie, watch LV1 again!
