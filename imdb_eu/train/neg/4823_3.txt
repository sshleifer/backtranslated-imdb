Lame plots and two-dimensional scripts look like characters with a card cut. Needless to say, that is, feel any empathy for the characters, especially fianc√©; She looked like a cartoon. In summary, I can say that it was compared to the usual TV. He uses some book summaries. Salsa and a classic tortured musician. An unmarried friend who combines personality with "beans". I will not list it, or it would be a spoiler because it would give the whole plot. Dance is fine but there is nothing special. I've seen worse. Good music for 3 stars. The group was really close. I watched YouTube. Fortunately, I do not pay any money in a theater. I'm still a little surprised how much innovation this movie has been wearing.
