You like this collection! <br /> <br /> I rented it, thinking I'd really enjoy it. Man sucked Fast-paced cuts, very annoying speakers, and fights they edited and shortened themselves (I'm thinking of Jet Li's legend, Legend's fists and Jackie Chan's 2nd drunk fighting). <Br /> <br /> And what about street fighters with them? Why is it "cool" about that? I've seen more interesting battles around the Martial Law! <br /> <br /> This stupid cuts collection is stupid. <br /> <br /> Never buy this movie! Do not induce people with this calcium to get out of this crap! <br /> <br /> Instead, go buy the movies, the fights coming and all the battles in their unprecedented mode!
