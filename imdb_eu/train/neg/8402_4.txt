The Three Stooges featured western comedy music? Perhaps "Rockin 'in the Rockies" was the short Stooges comedy combined with the musical western, in a matinee; If so, a Saturday afternoon was a pleasant way to rest. Jay Kirby (Rusty) is a beautiful young hero; and Mary Beth Hughes (blonde as June) and Gladys Blake (as Betty woman) are beautiful women. Hoosier Hotshots is a harmonious group; their songs are very sterile; However, this is not the 1940s, nor in the 1950s; so the film does not "rock". There are few laughter; But Stooges's humorous brand is weaker than usual. The talking horse is rarely used. <br /> <br /> **** Rockin 'the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
