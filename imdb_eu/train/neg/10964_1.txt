I was glad to see this at the Espaloian Film Festival. Suddenly, he was a pedestrian desperation and he was the last nail of the coffin. With Lewis Carroll's "Alice" book, I was very excited about the premiere of the movie, and that's why I only saw it more uncomfortable. Normally I'm happy with the modern newsmakers, if they are treated well. It is usually interesting to see parallelism between the past and the present in a familiar story. Unfortunately, this movie has not recovered any more modern and more pop cultural pervertions. The adaptation of the original characters seemed to be young and it was usually very annoying. It was probably not very good for the actors. Most of the shows were supercharged at the top, which I think was a bad leadership and an attempt to achieve a bad script. I did not definitely laugh at the movie. All the jokes were obsolete references, with the certainty of the event that loses joy with time. Actually, the only recognition of the film was the sequence of the white rabbit that encounters Alicia, but then the score was a bad imitation of Danny Elfman's work. Also, I should say that the croquet game was terrific. It was undoubtedly a low point in the movie. <br /> <br /> What a joke. Ignore this movie. After conclusion, I was really annoyed.
