When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it would be a good sasquatch movie. Usually when you have these types of movies, there is generally no sasquatch BAT, but here's what it is? 7 or 10? Good works, the drawing was fine, I liked the scenes that killed the first victims, the camera's work was very good. I was expecting a gory movie, but it was very little. This film was better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel really needs a sasquatch movie, Sasquatch Mountain really liked, Abominibal was not good to me, what is being reviewed is fine but Sasquatch is not a movie, but I do not review it. leave the track. This movie is Saterday afternoon afternoon, but in any other case.
