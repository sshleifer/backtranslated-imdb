When I saw the television preview, I thought "it would be a good movie of his pale man," but it was not. he was not afraid! It was a good practice, it was an enormous plot, military offerings were stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel can do better than this gap. In the movie, Arron became a dog that felt like a dog, became a psycho-psychologist and took off the doctor's throat. If you've read other versions of these films in other films, it's positive, but it's not because the story has been awful. 10 max. Are you sure you wait for some shades of bush, but I do not expect you to. More than any movie that was beyond the Loch Nes, better any better film on the science fiction channel is better than the movie.
