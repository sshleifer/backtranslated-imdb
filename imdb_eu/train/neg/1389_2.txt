I was very disappointed in this movie. Plotwise was weak because the stupid one was unlimited: Arimas act like reality? Does a mission seem like a Soul Hunters dedicated to a younger member? And the whole story story "holobrothel" and the anti-station issue were so huge that I came to a television at a moment: "Why are you wasting this with this?" Thematically, "Soul of Souls" did not enter into a deeper question of the soul than the original "Soul Hunter" episode. We see that Soul Hunters make mistakes, but we still have no sense of their culture. (Are there some women Soul Hunters?) <br /> <br /> Efficiency was due to the materials they needed to work, and the first effects, especially the planet badges, were very impressive. But, in general, I would say this to give a miss.
