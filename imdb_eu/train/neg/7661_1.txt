The improper title of all times is delivered quickly and frequently. In most cases, it's an overwhelming event, but I would like to approve Alone in the Dark in a short list of real candidates: Plan 9 Outer Space, Battlefield Earth and Pluto Nash Adventures. <br /> <br /> As I saw a 90-minute turmoil, it was hard to be awake while I was trying to laugh at the movie. But I only hated the darkness (I tried to avoid punishment, but I could not resist) I looked around when I saw Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Well, my friend and I had to give a comedy to the whole movie. <br /> <br /> So ... about the movie. Let's talk about actions and effects because it should be a positive part of the film. The film has a bad creature with the Cross of the Xenos (called Xenos), and the Pitch Black creatures. The invisible becomes invisible (and I guess it's random) and complicates the light. Likewise, there are small creatures of human beings that control humans, and transform them into something like a zombie. All those special effects that had a breakdown in 1997 were outdated. Action scenes are chaotic and can not continue. A random set of monsters embedded in the blue screen or in the mailbox by randomly shooting people. The light flashes in a dark screen, because your students burn their work excessively, while leaving behind bad rock music. <br /> <br /> And these were the main points. A story about a paranormal storyteller (Slater) surrounds the story, a tough idea that his wife is wearing a black trash in Tshirt with a trench coat and does not shave for 2 days. An archeologist (Reid), but inept. And the government agent (Dorff), because the line is barking. Three would be wrong for their performances (they have not really done a good job ever before) and casting director should be ashamed. Reid and Slater are in love with the movie. The movie has the strangest scene of love I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Then comes the plot. Quietly, the sensible parts are not interesting. The rest is not the best one. The land hole can have collective egos of all three stars. The movie begins with the text and begins with a voice that explains the background story. This opening lasts more than a minute and the audience knows that something is horrible. This initial narrative is repeated over the adnausem short film, which is very clumsy and heavy in fashion. And the end is not a sense ounce. It is not sensible in the world of film, it did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Finally, Uwe Boll was the direction. Forgiveness, all this can be said. Shake the camera to simulate suspense. His conducting actors. See Reid's main focus on the scene. Special effects money for waste effects. And finally, when choosing voices, choose something explaining something that might be painful to the audience. And he laughed at me and the people he gave me were worth every quarter. I would advise them not to pay more films. Take about 3 people and rent rent costs and cut a new movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry for your Uwe Boll. Lotsa Tara Reid. Lotsa Christian Slater. Lotta Stephen Dorff. Somebody has been linked to this movie for anyone.
