I have read other comments about this movie and I try hard to criticize myself, because I want to be a nice person. However, this movie is one of the worst movie I've ever seen (US Network Networks and Cinemax Lots of Nights.) One of those who thought about this movie EVER would not have to prevent another. This movie never left me any other movie ever. I really think these people are crazy. Save your time and do not see this fllm. Please, I want to. The play is horrible, the plot (what a plot) is STUPID and is abominable and insane. Actually, I do not think it was necessary to become a movie. But that's my opinion, and I try to stop wasting your time.
