Drones, ethnic rumors, bad synthesizers pipes, children singing. The most inhospitable "world music". It's a bad and bad film of tourism. The incoherent sequence really kills. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc., etc. There's no transition, there's no visual explanation why we're suddenly ten miles away, no imagery ideas. As other reviewers say, there is only a footage about the third world. Constantly walking, as if it were a deep meaning. If these guys want to make the third world music video, they shot the best parts of Koya and had to travel hundreds of miles south of Mexico's cinematic cinema. That transformation would be better for "transforming life." <br /> <br /> But not. As they decided, they were mixed tourist routes that covered half of the globe and the filtered filters of the head to the head. The only recommendation for this film is that it was sucked just as Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> RstJ
