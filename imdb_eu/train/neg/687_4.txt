I am Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. And also, Charles Butterworth (a very pleasing actress) was in this movie ... so why do not I really enjoy it? Well, despite the good results, I've never seen the "A pictures" I have ever seen and is one of the writers. Given the talent and money they make for this movie, it's fun to write how it's coming out. I know the movie was going to be boring at the beginning of the movie, and when I announced it would happen, I found it something to happen to me. And this is not because I am a "movie savant", because it seemed almost no imagination or effort. Actually, the film seemed to be just a long cone linked together. Also, it seemed a bit annoying that Fredk Carole treated me so badly in the whole movie, and yet, according to the agreement, he eventually ran. Uggh! Lassie is still in a movie ("Will Timmy bring a rope to hang or hang around?"). <br /> <br /> Although the script was very tired and traceful, there were some positive aspects of the film. It was very nice to be aware of Fred's appearance at the end of the film. He was very compelling and he did not eat it for days, he was shaved or he did not sleep. Charles Butterworth's "liar" also gave a few humorous moments. All of this, however, was not enough to make the movie look like "B movie". It's a pity ... it could be a lot better.
