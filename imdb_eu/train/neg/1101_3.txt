This fake trip never coincides with the rigor of the great adventure that made the first movie. He tries to avoid out of this installment attempt to take blood from one joke to another, but the wrong turn and travel is not that interesting or funny anywhere. <br /> <br /> Almost half an hour is wasted when the rock concert (and many people watch on "free" on television) from what happens?) Surely, script writer can do something more creatively; Check out the first movie in the random presentation of all the random elements. It's not in this movie, because the Bill & Ted franchise ended quite well. The joke was over. <br /> <br /> Grim Reaper is thrown into the mix for any reason. This infusion, like the whole plot, is wrong and lack of sparks for comedy or audience participation. ZZ Top impression is made without reason. There are lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing is really creative or fun. <br /> <br /> Overcome defective stuff.
