When I was 11, Grease 2 was like crack. He was a dependence, inexorable, insolent, euphoric and powerful. My sisters and I would look, delay, and see again and again and again or again, or we were too confused and we became enemies from each other. So if you are 11 years old and have reviewed this movie as "excellent" or "funny" or "better than a genuine fat", you're guilty of your young teenage hormones and you can be sure. it will go through pure repair. <br /> <br /> However, if you are not a girl, you have no excuse, because Grease 2 was so shameful and shameful to everyone who attended. In its production, distribution and / or consumption. <br /> <br /> For criticism, I'm going to be honored with the movie why explaining the blows? <br /> <br /> 1. In an adapted music, the songs must be narrative or develop characters. In Grease 2, with a few controversial exceptions, music has no sense. Most songs relate excessive and general resemblance to sex ("Score tonight", "play", "our country" and "prowlin"), without telling any of the characters or issues of the film. Also, all the music is stupid and no one can sing or dance in Castan. <br /> <br /> 2. T-birds should be bad, and at least it might be nice, but each one is wussy-dufus-losing, and in the end, When Johnny Nogerelli, the sacred T-bird champion, when Michael enters and enters the gang, pushes Michael on the ground, pushes him on his spit and forces him to forcibly deceive any body. But, of course, he admits, like gold, a bunch of headaches There is one because there is no greater honor than a T-bird. <br /> <br /> 3. Michael is beautiful, intelligent, useful, useful and at all times (his own Although it is a musical sun, it is possible that Stephane would embrace it when she reveals that she is a man behind the mask. Stephanie, in spite of her melancholy, stinging, bubble gum, and dirty sweatshirts, the merciless rude is a rude and trashy dingbat. So, aside from being beautiful (I think), it does not take nice qualities, so the viewer is not justified by the depth of attraction to Michael Strogoff. <br /> <br /> I could move forward, but I did not want to mention a few more people in the face of the previous one, apparently so many curves are there, but it seems that this comparison is unbalanced. I will say that, among those who think that you want to see this ancient mess: 2 fat is the first time to live a kiss again. You are only 32 years old now and a 13-year-old boy with acne with musk acne. Magic has disappeared and you feel dirty and disturbed. Believe it.
