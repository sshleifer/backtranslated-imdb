I recently found that Madeleine L'Engle's novel had become a Disney movie and ordered the DVD. The book I liked for my book and I read it several times. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters that did not play the novel, even the characters described by the novel, have been cast by the Murry family. Meg nice (very nice) in the middle and Charles Wallace, who is surprised at how old is he. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is just as promising as a good job of establishing relationships with the protagonist and the scene. Unfortunately, when non-human characters appear, the adaptation is cleared up and when the children leave the ground, the whole thing falls. Alfre Woodward is the youngest, and Mrs. Whatsit (for example, Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright) and Kate Nelligan's face are so massive and expressive that he has had to visit the plastic surgeon Faye Dunaway in recent years. For some reason, when they give birth to Glinda Morroi Oz, it seemed like a wicked West witch. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a very bad thing to do. effects and art direction. I understand that it is a television movie, but CGI was something that could be done 15 years earlier. Andr's Whatstarren central flesh is a disaster like Chewbacca Aunt Beast's behavior, which is a gentle and elegant herb on the novel, just like the thing that is here. I could continue and move forward; Almost all artistic options had a disaster, because they believed that there was enough budget for doing this justice, but that the work of the design did not even have good imagination and opinion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> That really needed Spielberg's surprise in his first films. It's amazing that anyone who has the honor of adapting to the fantastic children's literature series has not thought of adapting A Wrinkle in Time and screen-shots, giving them a framework that deserves.
