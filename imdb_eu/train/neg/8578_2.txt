One of the toughest movies of the 1940s, with an awesome comedy with music by Kay Kyser. Kyer, an orchestra-led and radio star (and a college -friendly goof-off), was a pioneer in Spike Jones, who backed his guests and the sad group of his musicians. It is owned on a birthday party, in a dark palace, darts imported from Africa, stuck and hung on the wall. Shindig is a terrific judge, a terrifying teacher, an awful swami, a huge number of mothers, and has a bad joke enough to fill three shots for Bob Hope. The songs (Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) are not forgotten, and Kyser is not full of trust, with a material that has a ribbon rim that lasts ten years in 1940. * ****
