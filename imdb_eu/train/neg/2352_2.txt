That is, a summary of Madhur Bhandar's latest work: page 3. It has no empty perspective, superficial and funny in stereotypes. What is the movie? To inform the socialist party about the socialist population that is so populated and so busy, that is, to advance the profile of these types of life. And you are both indoors and outdoors. Is not there any press to report everyday events? Madhur Bhandar reminds us that there is a major newspaper and page 3 is just a complement; maybe the animator who is who and what to do. Do not mix two. And then there is the representation of power - that would happen in every way of life. So what you said after all - nothing, otherwise fewer guys in the film with fewer directions.
