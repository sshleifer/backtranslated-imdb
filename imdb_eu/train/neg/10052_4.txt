Warner Bros in the 1930s made many potoilers, most of them quick, economical and very entertaining. I really love how to use the studio in our most glamorous items of everyday life. This is a bit of a Warner oral melodrama that does not work. He is the editor-in-chief of Edward G. Robinson's editor, and retrieves thirty years with the tragic story of a killer. Robinson gives a lively show, but is surrounded by actors that do not cut the mustard. H.B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but Frances Star and Anthony Bushell's second performance have been bad in the film. Starr is particularly bad at the dramatic scene near the end of the film. In addition, the moralistic tone of the film seems to be ridiculous in the Hollywood pre-coding context. LeRoy's management has innovative visual touches, but it can not overcome bad actions and unexpectedly exceeds the funny situation. Sol Politoren's camera is a solid work. Somehow, this piece of dreck was nominated for an Oscar for the best picture ("M", "Dracula" and "Frankenstein") for a year.
