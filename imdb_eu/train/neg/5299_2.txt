I really like the movie slasher, but this is really horrible. The actor is a lama, the script is bad, and the atmosphere does not exist. Soil is: Charlie Puckett, a deformed gardener, dies in a small American town. It's true - this is the plot. Very original, eh! "The Night Brings Charlie" is not enough to be boring-if the movie was not terrifying, they should be at least bloody. anyway. If you want to see the good slasher shots, you want to watch "Madman", "The Burning", "Prowler", "Just Before Dawn" or "Humongous". rubbish
