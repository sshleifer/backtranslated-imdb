Will we be right? Al Gore is not really responsible for the environment, rather than contacting shoe fungi. It's a hook! Do not worry, Al Gore IS POLITICAL! Three years ago, his card was in his home / 70,000 kilometers in a 55 km radius, driving a hybrid NO, a yoke or a GM subway, even a LINCOLN (go to google if he wanted)! Or, such as Mr. Gore and Hollywood friends continue to use a private rumor of private fuel to make their debut "Truth Nonsense". For so much conservation, Al? However, just a few minutes look at the "True False" section and get to know the main flaw. While filmmaking shows that there are many seemingly awesome scientists to say "General Warming" farms, there are no scientists to say so, KAUSERA. For example: I will bring a hundred people to the car park and point to a car that does not fit right. BUT, can you make sure that surely WHY? Overall, no! A second mistake, 100 years ago, the weather tools were accurate (the toilet was not yet invented)? What is a June bug in a game box? Hell, even 50-60 years old? Therefore, how can we surely know that the planet is "warmer" than when records are very controversial in the past? Or is this man the only reason? We do not answer: Science is never a consensus. Thirty years ago, Time Magazine made the cover of "New Ice Age". In truth, any science scientist from Earth Science in Science at the 6th will tell them that volcanic eruptions, Solar Activities, and El Ni√±o's climate conditions are more than "warming up overall". In the end, Al Gore is the one who is correct; Even if America decides to follow the global gospel, according to what Al decides to establish and recommend everything, how can we get to keep track of the rest of the world, but to achieve something that is as evident as terrorism? Answer: Gore thought, Mr. You know you are Gore and the US VP! If the people who produced the "false lie" were really honest, they would be titled "Al Gore Wenter Attention". But I'd really like someone to ask this VP; Why were two major North American pollutants (AKA China and India) to survive Kyoto Agreements? However, I am going to hear that producer A.I.T will be working on his next film "Gnomes, fairies and goblins: our threatened friends".
