I saw this last week after receiving a cheap DVD. I wanted to see the years, the plot seemed very interesting to me. So at least my disappointment was great. The actor was very flat. This part required a performance such as Johnny Depp's The Ninth Gate (which is virtually totally violated), but I think television quotes are not always in this theater's ability. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the direction was confusing and sad, that reminded me that Carpenter did not make a decent movie behind madness. In the story, I was very disappointed! I think I did not respond to hope, but I thought that profits and explanations were scarce, and eventually it was the least anti-climatic film. <br /> <br /> This is one of the main AICN contributors and you can say that you love cinema, but I would like a better starting result. <br /> <br /> I took the DVD to the store. the same day!
