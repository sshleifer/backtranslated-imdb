This movie is really wonderful! At 11, I thought it was ridiculous! This movie would only be recommended for under-12s. I did not really care about it, but I think that the good questions to be taken by the children are, for example: 1) Have you bought the money? happiness 2) Do I have to lie about my parents' lies that they do not have to accept? 3) Is money reconciled? 4) All the money? 5) Does not I tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt? I give them a very realistic situation, but I think parents discussing these issues for children, maybe they should watch the video to show or show their children their mumble.
