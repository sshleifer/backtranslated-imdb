I'm surprised that this film gets a ranking like that! I have never seen a bad movie. Years ago this film was very bad. Splatter is not enough (almost funny) to describe blood scenes. If you do not like the hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) ... this is 10 times worse. The story reminded me of RL Stine goosebumps.! <br /> <br /> I can not play the performance since the script was so scary. (Why do I have to write 10 lines? I have never understood.) <br /> <br /> Here comes a spoiler == <br /> <br /> The story is a story about a person who dies. We're talking about a thousand murders, and nobody notices. Actually, these people are missing them. There is a guy who tries to solve the mystery (there is no mystery to us from the beginning to the bad) and unlike anyone, he does not believe it! what a surprise! In the end, the butcher is dying and dying with the butcher's shop!
