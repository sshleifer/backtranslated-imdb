I rented it on DVD, and I feel bad that Dawson and Lugacy have been so passionate about DVD reviews. It's not a bad movie, but it's one of the films that want to be a disappointment to the deep human being, although its story is almost a genre. Additionally, the problem is much easier in many ways, and the behavior of the characters often strain the belief. Film / television / literature / life would be a movie that you will not get behind (I have seen that almost the story is true in horror comics). Otherwise, his point has been made before and more. And this is a serious problem, which is, in fact, that cinematographic interest does not have that point. The basic story is a pretty movie that invests in the whole story that is amazing and compelling, and does not really pay.
