This movie is really awesome, Ben's eye candy allows you to complete everything wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> Probably the writer / director / producer / green acter ... an idea to create a film about gay issues, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crime and other issues that affect all gay men of those times, but trying to make every possible attempt at a badly invented film for just a few reasons for these reasons. <br /> <br /> The script is poor, a very common casting, but dialogue and acting is not quite the same. This is the biggest actress who hates his brother, and there is no chemical between the two main actors (I think I saw a passion in corn flakes). The play is hard, and the interview is forced (the brother who detects his scene is his most prominent line). <br /> <br /> I am glad that it is not the creator of the disaster of the train. He pushed the distribution into any other garbage, and if he thinks that way, I need some advice - JUST DO NOT NOT DO IT.
