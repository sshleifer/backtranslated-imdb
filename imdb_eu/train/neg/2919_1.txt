Geez, as a gay man in NYC, I can say that they have never seen a Gay Culture that has been portrayed in this movie and I'm glad! This film, which was broadcast on television in the United States, would be a great anti-theater Gay and I can not say their fault. The people in this movie are not Gay Gay media or American Trandgender media. They represent the pure nightmare. The reflection of the characters of the low age is horrible and clearly racist feelings (anti-whites whites) are shameful and disturbing: society can not be blamed for dropping drugs, unemployment and education as casters of the film. The actions of these people are not despair, but rather the exclusion of personal obedience and self-esteem.
