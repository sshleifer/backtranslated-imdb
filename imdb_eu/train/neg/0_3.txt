A story about nature with natural feelings for a pig. Starting with a start-up scene is an excellent example of absurd comedy. A crazy song of singers has become a form of public orchestral form. Sadly they are absurd all the time, in general, without narration, eventually making a mistake. Those times can also be shut down. Shakespeare's cryptic conversation seems easy for a third-year student. At technical level, you can imagine it is better with the brilliant Vilmos Zsigmond of the future with good cinematography. The protagonists of the future Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.
