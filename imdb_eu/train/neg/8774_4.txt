Instructions: At four hours the film covers the best details in the Land Criminal sector in 1999 when Pakistani infiltrators crossed the LOC and entered Indian territory and Indian revenge. To find out more about the story, readers would like to read about Kargil's news. <br /> <br /> Comment: If you are looking for a formula story in this movie, it may be certain that this is not there. LOC is a pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and a lot of bullets and the story of Blood. I watched this movie when it was full of whistle and cheers in the cinema hall, it shows Indian Indian courage. The viewers like Indian and Pak cricket seemed like theater. <br /> <br /> See a tribute to the sacrifice of the Navy's army and the characterization of the real war heroes (4 famous PVC heroes). who can sacrifice his life to see this day. The film has created an excellent portrayal of the Navy, who have struggled with the worst meteorological situation. The negative film is too long and the songs are very boring.
