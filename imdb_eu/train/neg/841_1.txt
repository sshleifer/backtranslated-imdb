I watched this film 15 minutes ago and I still do not know what I saw. I especially think of a movie about a "S & M star" on the CD-ROM "real-time" as realistic as CD's drawings. Someone has killed him and his sister and two FBI agents kill him. He is also investigating the distribution of local killers in Big City (USA), although most of his work can be realistic "real" through the use of real CDs. I know Wow <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is one of the only films behind the film. He takes around 15 minutes in the film and half of it hits the main girl without apparent reason. I do not even end it, I can not leave myself in French. Before the last scene, we are treating a 3 or 4 minute film. Honestly, they could complete the final scene and would have the same effect with the cross and all directions. <br /> <br /> In the end, be this film. I love filmmaking, I love them and I love Michael Madsen. I used about 80 minutes in something else and I was very happy. Like you, this game is playing knife where you have a hand once and again jab. Over 80 minutes would be more entertaining.
