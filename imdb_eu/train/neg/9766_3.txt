Roger Corman, undoubtedly, is one of the most versatile and invaluable directors and producers in history. In any case, he has been in charge of my favorite horror movies (Edgar Allen Poe's "Maska de la Muerte Roja" and "Pit and the Pendulum"), as well as some cheap and stupid waste. Haunted Sea "and" She Gods of the Shark Reef ".) Corman also made several unclassified films and simply put it" it's almost impossible to judge correctly. "Travel," such as "Gas-ss" imagination They will name psychedelic exploitation, in other words, hippie is a strangely strange culture, for half time you do not have the slightest idea, what characters are going back and forth on the screen and where all that hell has gone is it very effective and very effective. They are: a strange but deadly nuclear gas that is triggered by an accident and destroys the entire population of the whole world with more than 25 years of age. Post-apocalyptic sci-fi framework, but author George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to become a road movie "trippy" comedy. The next deaths are not being avoided, they have been released on the street and they have encountered small delinquency for young people. "Gas-ss" is not boring and he tries to make it very strange. The whole script seems to improvisate immediately, and it's not fun. Certainly, it's not my tea cup, but the movie has a loyal fans and enthusiasts, so who am I saying that you do not have your time or money worthy of it?
