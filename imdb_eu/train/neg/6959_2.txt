I saw a few days ago and it is difficult to forget the movie ... for the wrong reason. The movie must be fun, not a single laughter in the theater (maybe Jose Garcia and Gerard Depardieu), and boring, boring, boring. Although it was hard to understand what they sometimes said. They speak fast and do not understand enough to open. I was with a friend and, in 4 or 5 times, I said it was fun, "what, what did he say", and I'm French. I mean, I think good films are created here, but I would like to apologize to all the foreigners who are going to watch the movie beforehand (we'll never see it outside of France). <br /> <br /> We feel kr @ p. 2/10
