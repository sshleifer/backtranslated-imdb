I read some positive reviews of this film and I was really surprised that it was a great thing. With the AIDS story and the "Spirit" / "Spirits Blithe" as a cross between a story, this film can not always remember what it is. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark are gay couples with "open" relationships. Simon is capable of being an anonymous (though secure) sex. Mark is HIV + and it seems that Simon and himself have no sex life. When Mark dies, Simon tries to eliminate his memory and continues to be a bachelor - after his father has been reluctant to abandon emotions after a few years now. It was not Mark that his behavior before death was very different. But Mark returns the ghostly form and draws its mistakes, so that Simon accepts and gives his true feelings. Sadly, Simon SOB is selfish, it's impossible to feel empathy for him. most of the movies. If you are older, it's too much attention. Mark, on the other hand, follows the steps of Demi Moore's "Ghost" crying through the whole movie. <br /> <br /> There's a strange tone when Mark returns. Suddenly, we get some crazy attempts at mum, in the "Bewitched" television show. But this will not last long. When emotional health provided by Simon is at stake, the whole thing becomes more and more; For the amateurs are trying to make you jerk in your heart. Lastly, while a golden angel with a muscle boy driving a tear-shaped sky that drives a tear, Simon greeted a flashing lightning flash, it's amazing, especially since he does not deliberately entertain.
