In a distant galaxy is a planet called Ceta. Original people worship cats. But they love the people who love dogs and have no conflict on the ground to go and people to eat. This is what I saw in a movie f # @! One of the stupid ideas of Ng. Let Ted Mikelsi make fewer movies than the one set in the previous films. Limbo enjoy playing the game is like strip. How many can go? The only losers on the stage are US audiences. Mikels and his handlebar mustache stupid second to buy these people have not yet received. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Ted Mikels's comment; The story behind the story (9 minutes and a half); 17 minutes, 15 seconds behind the scenic movie; Ted Mikelsen filmography; and "Worm Eaters" Trailers, "Girl in Gold Boots", "Doll Squad", "Ten Violent Women" (nudity), "Blood Devils of the She Orgy" and "The Corpse Grinders"
