I watched the MST3K version of "Deathstalker III" and I liked the movie - "unmystied" too - I decided to watch the whole series of "Deathstalker" movies. I bought II and II and I wanted to laugh. <br /> <br /> "Deathstalker I" was nothing fun about at all levels, and when I was released I was ashamed of having bought and I would regret it! Abuse and too much nudity. I think that "DS 3" was cleaner or MST3K edited a lot; I expected something similar, that is, stupid and responsive and simple. I was wrong. Even though $ 6.99 seemed to lose money. I did not open the "DS 2", because I will return tomorrow. Now, most likely, I will throw this DVD, I can not return, and nobody wants to, myself included! So really, do not worry about this. Even nakedness (much sweet) is not boring.
