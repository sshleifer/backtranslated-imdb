I will be compassionate and I will come to the point. This movie is not good Some part of my filmmakers hated the play, script, story, direction and almost all edition. Amanda Peet has proven that she is capable of acting because it was the highest point in "The Whole Nine Yard." So, at ten o'clock feet, this film should be avoided. However, the part of my child seemed very funny to me. If you forget how to forget about the quality of production, and if you find funny jokes, you should be well. And for those who can not remove your armchair, that's your chance. My inner son did not die, and I laughed. So, only ten of them, as a movie, is everything.
