This I have ever seen in the movie! Molly (Molly Hall) could not work it out! There was no emotion, as if they were all blah blah blah, as it was reading in a boring book. The intelligent children and the boys who love food (they did not remember the names they deserved were not remembered) made me crazy when they were so angry. He talked about a science or a meal about it. Mollys did not show enough emotion for her daughter. The police and Molly's father said the same thing four times. it was horrible Everything was repeated a lot. Beatrice was so bad that something bad happened to her. I was wasting some time in my film!
