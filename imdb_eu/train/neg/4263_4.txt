Inappropriate film. The screening of the cast is poor. The settings are fine, they could be better. The story is also weak. The battle is a horrible sequence. The sound and quality of the movie are trashy. Kazakh history was very badly said. This movie should have more actress journalists in major roles. And it should also be the language of Kazakh. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hernandez are Hispanic sources. I do not know. When Hispanics strike Turkish-Mongolian people. This movie is Kazakh film shame. Rustam Ibragimekov disappointed me. He is one of the best filmmakers worldwide. The director Czekh is an excuse, as it is not nomadic, can not get to know the true spirit and history of the nomad.
