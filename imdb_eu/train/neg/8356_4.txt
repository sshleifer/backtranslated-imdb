Peter Fonda actively activates himself as an actor, whose lachrymose lines read the irony or humor of the interview. Brooke Shields sells rugged and non-spiritually damaging claims as if it were a wooden block with red hair; Even though his smaller touches (like a lifeless vibes face), he reveals a character as a sure-proof actor who does not direct himself, but a sure filmmaker. In the Southwestern 1950s, the poor gambler (in spite of a few cheats) had won Lolita's orphanage and a young original teenager in a bad poker game; After joining a map of treasures that waits for the Grand Canyon, the bows become strong towards the road. Beautiful views, an interesting but interesting one of the Henry Fond's canyon as a pink man, Henry Konda, are the only clear-cut offspring comedy, both directors bring out cartoon killers and they will not stop until they stop doing anything. map Shields is very nice, but - although the camera loves its bright and bright beauty - it has no screen presence (and its tiny voice has no means); Every time you open your mouth, it is bent or duck. * 1/2 ****
