Frank Sinatra plays former non-goodnik, frustrated writer, lives hard and hard to drink, returns to his native Midwest, and his unmarried brother (Arthur Kennedy) is reunited, now with wives and disinterested wives. famous daughter Frank Dean Martin is involved with Shutley MacLaine, who has some law, but wants to write and consolidate with a good woman who wants to do it directly. A more dramatic play, MacLaine's role is very "colorful" and a shameful feeling (after its drunken make-up, it's worth noting that in "After You've Gone" it is handled with correctness). Directed by Vincente Minnelli, he is in charge of direct rumors, but he has a spirited rumor and the biggest scenes are flat or compact. The image looks beautiful on the panoramic screen, with a nice look with detail and composition, but the story and these characters are cluttered. ** ****
