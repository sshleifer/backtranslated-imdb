What an insult to the industry of SA! I have seen better films from SA. Hijack Stories's comments on ten stories worthy of it are pretty scary. The assessment of the movie would not be needed ..., "OH, DEVELOPMENT COUNTRY FESTIVAL. CONTINUE YOU ABOUT YOUR INDUSTRY ON SUSTAINABILITY, IS PEACE." We have a specialty in film making. Do not swear film industry as Hijack Stories thinks. We can tell stories, such as Cry the Beloved Country and Shaka Zulu. Weep the dear country. I'll give it to 9 out of 10. I'll give Darry's great direction, a great performance of two great age actors, from anywhere. Hijack Stories ..., I gave it to 10. I could be a high score for people who participate in the project. The same would be if it were my movie.
