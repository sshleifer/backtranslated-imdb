'Succubus', a version of 'Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden', is sitting on 76-minute lines; Euro horror trip was terribly boring and awkward, and maybe I entered the comma. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jess Franco has a giant garbage of the 60s, because it seems like a cast. A class A out of the hallucinogenics group, because there was no second sense in that mess. Apparently, this is one of his 180 more films better? It is hard to believe that there is less effort. <br /> <br /> The unlabelled plot deals with Franco's sex, violence and lesbianism, and delivers a bit of S & M in the right way, but still manages it. to keep the mind boring. <br /> <br /> Can I leave it for some time before re-entering the Euro Horror dodgy world again? Life is short enough to continue to see the light as this.
