Well, I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy, thinking it would be fun and wonderful. That's it, without fun. This movie is really untrained, there is no development of plot or characters, nor any story. The basic problem of this movie is to kill and gore. Basically, all killers are the same. ZOmbies rip someone. Yes, it's okay, but you also need original killings. I would like to say that it was really empty, all murderers seemed the same, shot in the same way. That's what I killed. I love gore, and in this movie Gore has not done anything for me. It was boring. It's not a storyline, the same scene with another person again and again. I also liked this movie. I love video gore movies ... videos like Redneck Zombies. But I can not kill myself. This film has good points, but none of them is in the movie. I understand that many "zombies" have contributed to the flood and more than 100 zombies have been similar, that is, it is quite well how people got involved and assisted in the world. But, in general, the movie is horrible.
