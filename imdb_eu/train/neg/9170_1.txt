This question, when you see a bad movie, is not necessarily "How did you get a bad movie?" or even "Why did I see this horrible thing first?" But "what have I learned from this experience?" Here's what I've learned: <br /> <br /> - Terrorist films have been cataloged and satirized "norms" over the last ten years, it does not mean that someone does a movie that does not go forward. It uses ALL of them without humor or irony. <br /> <br /> - If your movie ** was ** know if it is based on video game, you have script problems. <br /> <br /> - The black character may not die for the first time, but the Asian character always knows Kung-fu. <br /> <br /> - While you might be proud, you should know how to make a "Matrix effect" budget, which does not mean you should use it with nausea again and again. <br /> <br /> - Ron Howard's brother is not a choice. <br /> <br /> - When a scene has not edited together, just use video game footage, nobody will notice it. <br /> <br /> - Your cousin would like to rap the metal band to write the subject of your movie, politely. deny. <br /> <br /> - Zombie movies are not the people who kill zombies. It's about the people that kill people, if possible, in the most awesome way. That's the NONE <br /> <br /> - Those who pay $ 1600, worthy of admiration. <br /> <br /> - If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know. When someone asks you what you will imagine in your lines, "What's that?" Or, "Where are we?" <br /> <br /> - Blackbirds are not horror-bred. <br /> <br /> - A helicopter boom shooter and Sega licensing agreement transforms magic from your films to "Student Movies", the first major study studio. "Try it! <br /> <br /> - George Romero's not what" Living Dead ", or Paul WS Anderson. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse movies, but I've seen" Mortal Kombat: Destruction. "
