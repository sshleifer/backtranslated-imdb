I have read some comments about this film and I can not believe that people are easy to entertain. This movie is nothing. He is so wrong to write, direct, and dramatize that he barely makes an impression. Characters talk about clashing and situations are totally impossible. This could be campy and fun, but not because everything is so alive, the movie becomes dull. For example, Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality, but then the studio managers did not allow her story to be tense or unrelenting. This film could go through encyclopaedia on the bad Lifetime TV movie.
