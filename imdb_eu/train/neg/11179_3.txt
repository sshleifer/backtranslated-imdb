As we all love Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this movie. An hacker of the apparent publicity of the endless and stunning time has Pacino's bed and a paper that attacks the southern accent completely false and incoherent. <br /> <br /> The plot comes out of the head and there are endless blisters and weaknesses (and then retire). <br /> <br /> <br /> There is not much Kim Basinger doing. Pacino's scenes are flat and convincing. It's hard to say that they have a lot to each other. There is no energy. <br /> <br /> Tea Leone has also turned the screen on. It was electric and the scenes with Pacino were very interesting in the film, but it is not enough to save Al's embarrassment.
