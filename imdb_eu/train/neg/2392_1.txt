We watched twice in the theater, because we could not believe it was the first time it was bad. Maybe we would lose something ... no, what happened was lost from the beginning of the production. Actually, I came back to the Robbin's novel to see if I could find the problem, and I thought it was fun and exciting in the day, it's just a disconnected and fuzzy junk. <br /> <br /> So the initial problem of the film was to decide to do it, and the rest of the train's disaster progressed. It does not work, not a blessed thing. Some beautiful outdoor photography has driven camera random locations on the inside planes. All actors feel at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson is positively astonished - except Rain Phoenix, it seems that she's ignorant of her performance that she is truly aware. The dialog is long. Scenes do not make sense from the second to the second and there are no connections between them. And yet, the movie is blinded, saying that he is convinced that he is saying something deep. <br /> <br /> That's also a bad thing though it's fun; It's boring. Gus Van Zant has made many other good films, I encourage you to see it, and I'm happy (and it seems to have learned) mess.
