This show is annoying! Forgetting that the actors should have fun (especially Bob Saget), tries to avoid laughing jokes and "Awwww" track is not necessary to create time. Dramatic children have no exceptions, especially Olsen's twins. Moreover, this show is a common city. If you want to search for the word Klixe, it would read Full House. Each last line will learn the end of "life lesson". A bad discourse improves everything and, at the same time, the ability to unfold GASP's ability to grow a child is also bad. This can not happen in real life. I do not know how I can see this show without the behavior of the characters or the behavior of the lair. I say that I was shouting on the TV if "if it were NOT / SAD / BILA", if life were so, the world would fall to the ground.
