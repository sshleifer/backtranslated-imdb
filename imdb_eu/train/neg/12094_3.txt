This film explores the perversion character. Some reviewers have been gulled, because they are depicted perversion, because the film is psychologically profound; Indeed, considering the salable material, it is surprisingly boring and superficial, it does not have any substantive motives. Why is the main character? You do not know about the script. To better treat the same subject (and a fun movie), try Bunuel's Belle de Jour.
