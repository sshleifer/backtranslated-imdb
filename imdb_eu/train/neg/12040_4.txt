I do not know anything about the Iliad, so I can not comment on the accuracy of that story. However, as a single movie, I was very boring. The battle scenes were great and spectacular but CGI were obvious. <br /> <br /> The performance is inadequate and, undoubtedly, she pushed Brad Pitt to attract. But he does not do a good warrior, I'm pretty scared. <br /> <br /> It's a good design point. This movie looks good on landscape and castle buildings / spectacular walls. I like a movie like at least trying out movies, but it seems that the movie is totally ignored. As we anticipate a movie about an ancient ancient civilization, we hear the ancient English and Scottish Americans. <br /> <br /> In the end, I do not recommend this movie for a family. It's long and young people get bored. <br /> <br /> For adults, it's ok if you do not care about realism.
