In 1985 I caught this thing (I can not call a movie) with the cable. I was at the university and I was with a high school friend, the hormones were out of control. I thought it was a short break. A stupid script (young boys to show how to show boys boys), performance (with an exception) and jokes. The ugly barefoot woman kept her friends a little happy - but she was even bored after 30 minutes. Remember - This was a HIGH SCHOOL baby! This was back on the internet and such nudity was so easy. We continued to see something interesting or fun, but this never happened. The funniest thing about this was the studio's original campaign, when it was a trivial movie! (He had a poster with a fictional review, "This is the best movie I saw this afternoon!"). Only Leader Grant Cramer has only shown talent and has really been in business. Unsuccessful and boring. Jump.
