Born in Scotland, I grew up and learned it. I was amazed that the man was less or less than a man from the ranch. Worse, however, the whole movie was a kind of sex, either by implication or by word. See, XVIII. Century Scotland could populate the set of pervert and homosexual sex. Lange was a joke that acted as a young mother at the age of 49, but Liam Neeson was even worse! In the Scottish lake, "bath" is NOT usual, as they portray, but it also gave them another chance to show off sex. Save your money and see Pinnochio.
