Do not miss the time to watch it! If you do not want to analyze all the wrong things you do not want to do. I do not review a movie, but this is personal. I can not miss the withdrawal time. I feel obliged to write this report, to warn others that they do not have time to watch it. If it was a student project, I did not have to say anything wrong, but in the first 15 minutes alone ... I will be annoyed. screaming, bad audio, bad video (camera good man could have much better). And yes, what is Blair-Witch effect? budget? I expected it better, but not. Now, what's the hell worth 4? 2 is more reasoning, but 1 for my loss of time! I said my peace.
