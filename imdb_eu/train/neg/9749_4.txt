Professor Paul Steiner is currently investigating matter transfer. It has developed a machine that can use an wrist-watch or a rodent to re-materialize this object in another location. However, there is a research facility, which does not like his experiments, and does not do everything he does. After an exhibition that can contribute, Professor Steiner decides to try his own machine. As expected, things will go wrong and transforms the innocent scary, which will kill only the touch. <br /> <br /> However, maybe it was not such a good idea to see The Projected Man again. In the same week I saw the curse of The Fly, Return of the Fly and Fly of the Fly. It seems that a large amount of material transfer movies and a person who can have tremendous effects on the human body can last three or four days. I do not know what the film makers are The Projected Man, but much like Fly Fly, it's not a coincidence. However, Projected Man is not as good as the Fly Fly trilogy. <br /> <br /> In addition to not being very original, The Projected Man has other problems with the enjoyment of others. The main theme is dominated by Bryant Haliday. Such a horse is an ass, not only do I care about his suffering, I'm really scammed. The cast of Mary Peach and Ronald Allen are almost as bad. They are so soft and almost boring. In fact, there is little to be expected when you are watching the projected man. Soundtrack ?? It's not very memorable. "Appearance" ?? I would divide it as much as "mud." Plot? predict Action ?? there is not any In general, this should be avoided. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I saw the Man Project through a copy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Fun things Is not it absolute, often, the poorest movie? the better MST3K will be riffs. Men almost scored The Projected Man. I will be very keen 4/5 on my MST3K scaling scale.
