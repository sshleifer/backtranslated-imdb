I had to see this, it seemed a seemingly terrifying premise, the prisoners who find a magical book! It creates a claustrophobic terror, and so on. <br /> <br /> But it does not seem like a story to go with a great idea. Instead of tremendous or physicological fear, it is open to effects based on effects and fear of the OTT body, that is, it does not fear more than 12. <br /> <br /> In the end, logic is ridiculous. , the characters are destroyed more than bodycount. The good character of the debris ... the best thing about this film. Clearly, a small budget, that is, does not deteriorate, the movie is nowhere, of course, I will say ... I need a Hollywood remake. You only release this interest in this version. Undoubtedly, in the last few years, there are no other leagues such as other French films, at least they were red, they were, at least, as watch / fun, malefique is not a good end to the clock. And you can bet that you can finish before watching the movie. really really depressing - it is impossible to recommend.
