I must admit that I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> This version does not compete with version 1995. Because I saw it, I was not happy with Ciaran Hinds as the captain of Wentworth and thought that Rupert Penry-Jones seemed much more like I did when I read the book. And he was also. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the quality of the movie is only a bit annoying. The rest is not like it. <br /> <br /> Miss Elliot could never walk in such spas. It was not because of his nature and that of any of the women of that time he did not. She was a lady of the book, Anne Elliot, and she was dignified. There are other painful anachronisms, but this is the worst. <br /> <br /> Although there are three important quotes in the book, it is a very good time, another important part of the book that warns those who know the book. it will be missing or will change completely. <br /> <br /> And if this version does not have a shorter one, it seems that everything is in a hurry. He was very careful to introduce the characters, to show their provisions and reasons. Major scenes were discarded. How could this be how they extracted the last scenes? Disaster And so far, it was not the most beautiful photo. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austen, do not miss this time.
