So the great rewriting of the story continues with Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> This was a ridiculous, absurd junk. <br /> <br /> It seems that it is possible to produce so much money that is what it is. the worst and most misinterpreted movie I've ever seen. It's amazing. <br /> <br /> It seems like the short flirtatious breed of Nic Cage's performance is over. I suppose I'm leaving Las Vegas to fail in some other lousy movie. <br /> <br /> Diane Kruger demonstrates that her performance in Troya is not uncommon, she really can not act. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel should be ashamed of working out. <br /> <br /> It is only recommended for recovery from the latest lobotomy or America.
