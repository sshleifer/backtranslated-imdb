It's a guy, I love men movies ... I was looking forward to a special battle with an army with a dragon. This happened, however, that the movie I ever saw in this movie was worse. <br /> <br /> It was a standard story, but the story was awesome. The scene transitions were the worst I've ever seen. Why are you going to relax at the beach when your life was in danger? The actions of the snake dragon were very badly written ... and the serpent dragon attacks were widespread throughout the movie, sometimes the main characters would be killed. <br /> <br /> The director wanted to give a love story. In the middle of the film, at the height of stress, this film, of course, was not overlooked, I love movies, but I had to leave it, thank God for not buying this, I borrowed a friend. . <br /> <br /> Do not buy this, do not rent, watch the discovery channel ... it's much more exciting.
