This movie is like real life, that is, I mean: it's not available for about 2 hours, and there is a lot of game plans or plots that often prove that the invisible cast (as its invisible "experimental" lighting has been referred to as many reviewers ). <br /> <br /> A big head. It's not surprising that Altman was a very versatile performer (but we also loved "Gosford Park", but "Pret A Porter", Kansas City? TT and Women? Aaargh), but the story of John Grisham's story is true. It is a great work that you can choose through your encounter with an impersonal sleep and a masterpiece of a bad movie. And no, it's not "so bad it's good." <br /> <br /> It's just a bad thing.
