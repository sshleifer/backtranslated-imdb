Bob Clampett's 'Porky's Poor Fish' cartoon and a nice moment. On Porky's Fish Shoppe, 'Porky's Poor Fish' takes on an uncomfortable area that has lived up to one of the standard Black Porky drawings and some of Merrie Melodies' famous celebrities around that time. Usually, Porky is one of the first cartoonists, far from the Porky star, which only appears as the musical opening and the main movie. Over time, the star is a rodent, and fish store is a free choice for lunch, but it gets much more than that. Unfortunately, much less than the audience did. Sometimes as the series of books-life happened, this spot was thrown into seal signs that could work well on non-animational animation. Laughter is scarce and cartoons are scarcely in front of Clampett's energy management, but there is very little Porky's poor fish under the Porky cartoon below.
