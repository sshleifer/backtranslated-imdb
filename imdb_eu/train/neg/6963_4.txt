The Japanese always had amazing ideas in fantasy movies. They have always been willing to destroy cities through space giants that are in space and elsewhere. The problem is that they never had any money to convince special effects. The movie published under Les envahisseurs de l'espace in France is no exception. His ambition is to show the three giant octopus, to show the giant otter that surpasses human beings. It is very difficult and ridiculous, but very pleasant too. After all, we like these creatures and their films, right?
