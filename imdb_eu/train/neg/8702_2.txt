This is one of the strangest movies I've ever had! After seeing the first two times, I expected this, but I still remain the kind of film "maybe this time I did it". No - not even close. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? With special effects ... to find out why SFX is passing through, a soldier fights in a "Raptor" while running down the corridor. With less than one second of the screen time, the viewer can easily see it as just a man with a silk-shaped tail. Bad bad bad <br /> <br /> What happens with the performance? If you can call that. There is a character, supposedly, to be in the South. However, after living for six years in the South, I have never heard of this way. It may be a strange impossibility, usually the inability to talk. It seems amazing to me that nothing makes this character accentable; so that the actor did not reason. <br /> <br /> What happens on the plot? It's pretty basic - Raptor escapes, they must hunt people with weapons. I'm wondering why these dinosaurs in the movies seemed to have entered the closest tunnel system ... Would not it be caught out in search of prey? Well, at least they have a good sense to think very little about the movie they have around them. <br /> <br /> Other things - Let's say you're in a building and you know that you are a man. the prey go around. Do you decide to get a better time out who is better? Navy or sea? And then you decide to make a fight for the arm fight? What is the foolish idea they need to keep track of nonsense? Divided into two parts. Have you ever watched horror movies (or at least Scooby Doo section)? In short, this is one of those films. If you do not want to miss it, you want to cross it through a movie.
