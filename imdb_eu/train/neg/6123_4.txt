When I saw this movie for the first time among teens, I thought it was one of the best films ever made. Obviously, this is the reason Bo Derek and his disloyal situations in this film. However, when I'm older, I can say that this movie is horrible. Note that Bo Derek is absolutely beautiful, and you're sure to see John Derek and her husband's director. But when you take the film out of the film, it becomes a dull walk. And Tarzan, yes, thinks he should be a muscular, but seeing Jane (this is Bo, of course) for the first time, he does not know what to think. This is true, even though Bo is wearing a shirt that looks great when the breast is visible. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on this planet that would have this problem. If you are looking for a movie that is looking for a slobber on a beautiful naked body, the card could be filled out. If you are looking for thoughtful, entertaining, and worthy movies, go somewhere else ... almost anywhere else !!!
