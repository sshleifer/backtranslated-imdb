As I hate to try to find an era and to be disappointed, I'll tell you first of all that the movie was horrible. Disgusting And not surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review. I thought that I could agree with him, it was worth the film he gave me, but he was sad when he read about what he said. I am afraid that I would like to take the same part of the movie, "without a doubt, it was a good woman." Let me first say "Wow! Certainly, that was a thorough review, there, I hardly know the philosophy of this movie any more." Actually, the lack of "good looks" is not the key to a movie. If you're disappointed enough of "beautiful women", you should see other types of films, if you do not enter into the science fiction category.
