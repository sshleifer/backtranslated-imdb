Spoilers <br /> <br /> Well, it says a whole line summary. Melville's "Le samurai" is an original and "Leon" elements. They are better - much better! <br /> <br /> In a "Samurai", Alain Delon is a lonely bird that steals a bird that keeps the cage and steals its car. scenes!). Even at the end they are the same: the samurai looks for death with dignity and shoots with an empty right gun. The world has changed, it realizes that there is no room for it in that place. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Delon does not kill many people like Ghost Dog. But Jarmusch liked "Leon" or Rodriguez liked "Desperado". So he added this. And let me guess: will the girl become a professional as a ghost dog (like Natalie Portman "Leon")? <br /> <br /> So what did Jarmusch think? Where is the only original thought of this movie? <br /> <br /> I can not see carbon (celluloid) copies. Macaulay's 4/10 rating Connor
