Being an independent supposedly horrible movie. He needed something with addiction. <br /> <br /> This completely miserable film is in charge of Irish interactions. "Crash?" Would they imitate a wonderful movie? If so, this movie has completely stopped. <br /> <br /> There is not much going on here and, of course, the buses and cars that cause the cause throw rocks. > It's boring to work on the movie. A woman loses her husband after she is 14 years old, after her young sister is taken out of a bride. As a result, the former sister becomes a bitter vegetable and walks on her clothes that she does not believe. The oldest sister is angry, but she soon finds love. <br /> <br /> Then we have three losers that buy a bank robbing masks. Of course, the robbery goes wrong, but it does not seem to be punished for crime. Perhaps the penalties should be aimed at writers unless they create a cohesive film.
