This movie is very bad. He plays around the paranoid city of the seventies and the 80s and enters a school context. I do not say that a city crime is not a problem for many people, or schools are not a serious problem, but it's a strange operation, it's cookies. Violence can be something that can be realistically imagined, but in this case it is not the case of social issues, but a high school white class student will become the crime of his great local scholar. And, of course, he knows how to play the system. He knows that. Yes This turd is a violent exploitation, a loud work. Disturbing violence is dressed as a social comment. It includes the same category as Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on, and so on. It's worth noting that Michael Fox had broken things like that.
