In this way, Fellini is a disaster that is working all his life. The line between many absurd and associative masterpieces is very small, and in the end, depending on the type of cinema, it depends on personal feelings. That said, "Casanova" has given me some cold admiration for her sets and that she perfectly summarizes Bukowski: <br /> <br /> <br /> "Casanova also died, big chick With a big cock and a cock, there is no long tongue and no head. Saying that it was really alive, it is true to say that you could not even feel it without feeling. Women can usually find the greatest fool, so that is a human race where it is today: We have grown a clear and sustainable Casanovas inside, like gaps in the interior, like the Easter attacks that impoverish our poor children. "<br /> <br /> I think that Fellini's attitude is about her subject; More empathy given, but nevertheless bored. <br /> <br /> Casanova's environment is made with imbalances and instability, and Fellini worked on "Satyricon" issues more rigorously. Soil monitoring according to soft characteristics, without coherence; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and shiny to the point of distraction. <br /> <br /> However, maybe there might be a point to portray Casanova as a stupid fool. And I encourage anyone to appear without formulating it. Fellini could not. It seems more than ever like a dirty old man: surely a master, but nobody who drives it. I find it difficult for the audience to enjoy this movie. A story was not worth it to tell.
