I do not know who to start. "It's about the family." This should be the worst line of dialogue that "horror" has heard, although this could not have been a horror movie, even if it has been tested !!! Ugh !!! And I know Owen Wilson is a better actor. He must stop playing the character that dies in each action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). In the end, the man wrote "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore". Has a talent Also, Lily Taylor should associate it with indie films. There's no place here. In the end, Catherine Zeta-Jones would become a star star. There's no legitimate place. I'm serious. One of the worst movie I've ever seen, EVER.
