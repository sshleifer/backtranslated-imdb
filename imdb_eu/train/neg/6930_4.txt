Dr. Tarr is a journalist who travels to a physical attack on Torture Dungeon to write about a new technique used by patients. However, the journalist immediately finds that things are not the case, and they are led by sick asylums and doctors have cages. First of all, some parts of the film are boring and you want to sleep, and interesting are interesting for all the wrong reasons (for example, it thinks of a chicken). I must admit that the story is really good, but the film itself makes bombs. The movie is very curious and like the comedy it would sound like in some madness, and, in fact, milk is chicken dancing, which I want to turn off the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Rate: R for violence and nudity.
