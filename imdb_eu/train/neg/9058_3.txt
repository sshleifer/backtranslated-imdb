When the movie is playing on TV, you can save up to 90 minutes and change the channel. Here you do not need to see anything special. Story Arkansas is about two couples who married a trip together about Reno. Number of couples: Lonnie Earl Dodd (Billy Bob Thornton) is the car separator and the marriage problems. His wife is Darlene (Natasha Richardson) and has a low opinion of herself and has not been intimidated for a long time. Lonniek Candy (Charlize Theron) is sleeping, Roy Kirkendall (Patrick Swayze), best friend's wife. They ride to Reno and there are four suites in a luxury suite. Roy and Candy are trying to have a baby and at the end of the day, Candy is pregnant. But Roy invites his doctor to Arkansas and says he's a child. Candy and Lonnie accept their relationships, and now the journey is all chaos. Jordan Brady directs this film and has made some other low-budget films, but this is his first spectacular show. Sadly, Brady does not show a lot of comedy flair, but you can not blame him. This script is not fun and one of the most serious problems is the characters that are written to the sitcom. Not all of the South are simply mean to be naive and stupid. Thornton's character is not sophisticated to show more than $ 1 in Beluga. Swayze's character is called a stupid and silent movie, and at one of the few moments it's time to ask everyone back at least one day. Penelope Cruz will appear as a prostitute and she is completely absurd and nonsense. Over three or four lines do not speak! I think that Harvey and Bob Weinstein are doing business with executive producers of this film. The only bad person is Richardson. We see ourselves as more confident, a very vivid and plain picture cartoon. They should know all those actors better, and it is difficult to read the image and like it. Time is for these unnecessary actors, but they have been paid at least. As regards the audience, you do not have to pay, so skip it!
