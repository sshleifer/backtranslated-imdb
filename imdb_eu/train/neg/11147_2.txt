I have not commented on this movie, it's not so bad. I have had the first comment on the website of the IMDb to allow the audience to save some time and make something more interesting, nothing more than seeing this "movie" ... it's something that even better look at the walls. <br /> <br /> And when I have to write at least 10 lines of text, I will also tell you about a low budget movie, performance, unnamed actors, a stupid mutt. wolf and so on The story does not bring anything new, the 80's special effects are made in style. <br /> <br /> The film is as bad as "Megalodon". <br /> <br /> So, enjoy it! ;) (without seeing this movie)
