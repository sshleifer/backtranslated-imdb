When I saw it in 1994, it was finally released. Apparently, because they missed Orion's photos, I think the movie was not released a couple of years ago. I remember that I am very annoying. I continued discussing or not going out. The store was not interesting or passionate. The imitation of American Graffiti was 3rd. <br /> <br /> Also one of the shows. One of the greatest reviewers in one of the local newspapers gave one of the biggest disappointments.
