I read lucky before reading the movie. It was an epic teenager, the dream of summer disappeared, a great indie film or a great budget drama. Somehow, he came into the hands of a hack, clearly alerting Boogie Nights and Rushmore, without actually learning anything. The scripts lose the flesh of the book with violent emotions and faint faces. Forgiven by the actress, because the characters in the book were rich and textured, but they were not insolvent in the movie. Mason Gamble is a good choice, as Dylan Baker, but the skeleton that remains in the story plays like a bad after school. Poor people = GOOD, rich people = MALDIA. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching the southern California beach where Gary Sinise looks forward to seeing her trailer in the Delaware bay. <br /> <br /> It's a good book, but for the first time the director Mills Goodloe is shy. <br /> <br /> K.
