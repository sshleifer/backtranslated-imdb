I made a great effort to see the movie and I was completely disappointed. In the paper, the screenplay waits and the selection of actors leaves with hope. Pacino I like The smell of a woman and Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller I have seen some French films from the 70s and 80s. But I've forgotten about the importance of playing conversations in the movie, and this movie is absolute ... trash! Shooting locations were also attractive, but conversations, pretentious and forced conversations led to the whole thing under zero. In addition, I have a great allergy car racing and I do not find the sport's interest. The unforgettable conversations of "Love Story" were better than those in this film (and what they say!). I really expected this movie better and I was so much disappointed that I was so damaged.
