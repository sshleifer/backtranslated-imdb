First, the CGI of this movie was horrible. I saw it in a marathon of the SciFi channel. In the end, when the owner of the park dies, I am surely one of the worst examples of CGI. Even Night of the Dead had a better animation. <br /> <br /> That said, the movie had almost no plot. Why were they particularly on the island? Well, it was not stated in the film. And why would people continue in the cats? It has no sense. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film was a good measure. For the "B movie movie" movie, the theater was very good. Parry Shen especially stood out. <br /> <br /> If you do not have to do anything on Saturday, watch this movie. It may be a curatorial memoir.
