I like the book written by Robin Klein, so I was very excited when I heard that a book-based movie was made. <br /> <br /> But I saw when I saw the movie when I was very bad about what I loved about the book - Erica is a very fun and interesting way of seeing the world. <br /> <br /> Since the start of the movie, I noticed that things were not. I imagined the same thing in the book. So I continued on the route. I was not so bad, I think. Mademoiselle Belmont was very different to me with what I imagined! I did not think it could be smoking and drinking - Jean Kitts, who plays, is the horny! <br /> <br /> I thought that the film and its actors and actors really did well. work, but oh, I'm a book fan (one of my favorite books), but I could not help feeling disappointed = P
