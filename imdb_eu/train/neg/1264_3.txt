This movie has nothing to do with the "Robot Jox". This is also the name of "Robot Wars", not the replacement of "Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars". <br /> <br /> "Robot Jox" was basically a fun movie to see in the near future a pretty premise of gigantic robots struggling against each other. This concept has been abandoned for this film and, instead, it has a totally sad story, which is also very original or clear. It was terrifying to see so much different from the previous one, otherwise it might have been a fun movie. <br /> <br /> This "Robot Jox" is a B-movie but a big difference is not very good. Perhaps when "Robot Jox" was made in the 80's, the B-movie hit the charm and class a bit, even though the movie was released in 1990. It can be said about this movie. Just hands, bad things, bad looks and not exciting. There is also an end to thinking: "Is this?" That's it? '. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When the story is missing its main plot is there Perhaps a good evil boss may be a good idea and some other things, for example, certain points, actions or main characters about the story. <br /> <br /> Seriously what they thought the actors chose. for this film. All of them are simply not pleasing to their roles, and especially Don Michael Paul is the most annoying main character, God's gift is the woman and Mr. Perfect as anyone who can compete with behavior. Were not the actors want to take the first movie? <br /> <br /> For this futuristic movie, the concept of having great martial droids definitely does not lack its action. If they put more and more action on the film, the movie was, at least, entertaining. Instead, we have a movie that can not be imagined at all today. <br /> <br /> Further on you will be able to see a section "Mighty Morphin 'Power Rangers" for more action and patterns. <br /> <br /> 3/10
