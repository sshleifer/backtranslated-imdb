Zombie Nation 2004 R <br /> <br /> Hey, I was bored. He looked at me to find a movie in my thumbnail. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. The filmmaker says following a description of the type of comment. It's funny how not to warn me to see this movie. I have been using this tip. <br /> <br /> Zombie Nation is like the Troll 2, which is completely named. They have little zombies with zombies (depending on your point of view) and they occur in a single city. This film works around a wrong policeman. He acts as bad as he can (he needs to suck a lot), he arrests them and then kills them. Yes, it's a serial killer. This movie is not only a zombie movie, but its serial killer is totally wrong. Serial killers are happy to die, that's why they live and they get it. This man brings out women and injects some poisons. Although it does not break or break the sex with the body. Talk about boredom! In the end, one of the five women who die is backed by Voodoo and, apparently without reason, waits five lives and they have decided to kill that guy. They buried everything or were thrown into the ocean, but you do not know how to buy clean and sharp clothes. Women play badly and take revenge. Oh yay <br /> <br /> The movie dropped in every category. The role of criminals, crap writing, crappier sets, and crappier make-up effects. Women do not look like zombies, if you do not tell the make-up really dark in their eyes to be a de facto definition of being a zombie. Everyone can talk, behave, think and act perfectly. Gore is weak in many PG-13 movies, and nudity is short. In the initial sequence you can see breasts ... Then the same breasts later! Go to the image. It only means that a single actor wants to emphasize. Police have been commercially built and, of course, you can see the wall paintings that are being filmed. Even if you do not see bad pipes and lighting and excessive setting and even blindness, unless you are blind. , the director will see you crashing. Clear the guided, it's time to lose. <br /> <br /> 1/10
