This movie could have been much more than it was. But not only does it seem to fail because it simultaneously carries a false predicate of self. <br /> <br /> Beforehand, John Cusack was flat at midnight and good. The difference is that this time it has a southern accent, supposedly losing every scene more than once. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino does his shtick, but it seems that he walks through this movie and collects a check. As usual, but not hardly stand out. <br /> <br /> Throw in support - a romantic feminine interest, although it did not add much to the story. Speaking of the story, a confusing story of "really caring" where Cusack is self-righteous Mayor may be "just the right thing to do". <br /> <br /> People do not act. that way. Cusack's character ceases to be credible, and without revealing it, he is preaching and nauseous. The last scene looks like a deep silliness on the mainland. It is completely indeterminate, but I will not legally enter. <br /> <br /> This is bad, the numbers are filmed. For the first 40 minutes I find it interesting and the last minute, proselytizing and self-correct. Better a fanciful fool than this dog.
