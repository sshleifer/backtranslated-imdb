When I read it on the back of the DVD case, I thought it was very interesting ... so ... my mom was thrown into the movie "$ 4 dollars $ 20" in Blockbuster. When we got home, the movie appeared ... twenty minutes later, turning our heads "enormous. We put something else." I confess, some of the friends in the cafe leaves us a bit smiles. But come, at least get decent actors! Gradually in the movie, if the play is bad and the movie is not slow and really interesting, I can hardly get it, and I laugh as they're doing it (or under it). ) lines. But I can not take that much. As the theater seemed like the scene, the actors seemed to be hysterical laughs, they did not deliver their lines ... amateur does not approach this movie's performance. <br /> <br /> He came here. While saying this was a good movie, they were really happy with some good films. I have nothing to do with what I have never seen. DO NOT USE YOU USE DO NOT KNOW EACH OTHER !!!!!
