Well, you know the rest! The movie I've seen for a long time has to be the worst. I can not imagine that Stephanie Beaham had to pay some bills when performing this task. <br /> <br /> The main role played before (for me), and I would think that the darkness was disappearing again. this turkey <br /> <br /> Bruce Lee picked up martial arts in the early 1970s and since then the martial arts scenes have to be martial arts or at least they need to be brutal using street fighting techniques. This movie makes quick cuts to showcase martial arts. However, this can not dress the lady does not know how to throw a punch. An average 8-year-old boy would take him to his show. <br /> <br /> Excuse me, how did the unique mystery shown here is that he did not win the gold medal for his time.
