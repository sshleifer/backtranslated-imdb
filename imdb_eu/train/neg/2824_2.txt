I'm a fan of Porsche, and the car has been the best player in this movie. <br /> <br /> Haim is a dry drug in the early 1980s, which is a rare drug, as usual, and the slightest character / actor will not make any sense; For example, they were very average. It's a cool movie for the 80's. With strange clothes, some good looking Colorado backgrounds and a very dangerous line that is full of excitement. <br /> <br /> All in all, please give 'If you're losing the party to movies like 80s, Corey Haim, or like me, I love the old Porsches school (this is especially great) because short life is short to see it.
