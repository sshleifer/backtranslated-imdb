This movie is bad. Bad Bad Bad Now I got the way, I feel better. This movie is bad from the beginning to the end. The story is lama. The 3-D segment is very bad. Freddy is the worst cartoon character. Thank God they were killed. And who wants Roseanne and Tom Arnold to see kameas? <br /> <br /> The good thing about the movie is a little backstory given by Freddy. We saw that he was living in the family, and we will see his alcoholic and alcoholic father (Alice Cooper). That's just a bad thing. Here are some quality actors (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto), and they do the best, but the final result is so bad. I can not return for half an hour and a half I see this movie.
