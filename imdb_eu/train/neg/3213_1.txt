Well, to be honest, it's the first time that it's literally meat or potato that I've not experienced there. The whole movie was felt as the main salad. The story was fake and horny, the characters were in a single dimension, realism outside the window and the animation was done by four young people. Does that cover? I have never been ashamed of a concept in my whole life. I have never read the comics or have seen other programs with this character, but I am not based on my observations from the rest of the reviews. <br /> <br /> To start, the story has moved faster. For a new character and situation, I needed more reason to find solutions instead of solutions. I have seen other anime (that is, if they have called an anime) with characters that do great things, because they take time to develop them. Lady Death did not do anything. In a few short scenes, we see Cremator with his crem and soon became the beast of Hell's beast. It was difficult for me to swallow it, before joining her father as a weak and weak woman. Suddenly he is immersed in hatred and can fight with the existence of millions of years. That was nonsense. The Lady Death presentation was inadequate. I was sorry I was just an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge. For me, it did not work. There were just eye candy, and immediately the large amounts of leather that grew on her chest worked when she trained with Cremator. Oh, I felt myself only ill. The same thing happens with Cremator's character. Who was this random person? The explanation provided was not enough, and instead I was left without a real dialogue of development. Hell is a sad day for the characters to show more violence and action, especially when we consider it as an animation feature. <br /> <br /> Then Lucifer was the same. Let me tell you that you can fight and survive with the King of Hell. She was weak, her voice was dark, and she just imagined me. It was like Disney's control and half-PC. The darkness and nature that Lucifer had captured corrupted. It was not the rule of hell, but it was a vacuum that had a greater living space. Talk about living or killing, how can you die again in Hell? Without a doubt, it was the concept that needed more explanation. Most of the characters were dying of concern, although they did not take into account the possibility of dead ones. That's how they got Hell. I think that this level of thinking has ruined the movie for me. I did not quite catch the soul that your body was strong in hell, but could that be me? or maybe this story was NOT a DEVELOPMENT. Get ready to do nothing. <br /> <br /> The fights sequences were hysterically bad. The animation of this cartoon was felt at the beginning of the 90s. There was nothing spectacular as this film was drawn to. Why are we America, behind the animation? There's a lot of fun in Asia, and hardcore is getting into here, like movies like Lady Death, who do not have any challenge or imagination. We are cheap and this film shows. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was a bad thing. Animated animation was cheap with animation. I was somewhere in this film somewhere in my mind, that is, it's hard to understand, because I think this movie can be. The production was awesome, as well as the story. Nothing was developed, leaving almost everybody falling into a huge hole. The strength of the characters was lacking and nothing was explained. I waste my time with that and when I am going to warn others about the death of my time, I am not part of my memories that I am not in vain for 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> bla! <br /> <br /> Grade: * away
