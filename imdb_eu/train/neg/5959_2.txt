Spoiler. <br /> <br /> What three words does the horror movie give you? Canadian cheap production. BRAIN perfectly adapts to these words. Awesome recordings, stupid performances and hilarious effects of variety are essential for all fans of BAD. It's a horror mess. The post-production team seems to have surrendered. THE BRAIN is admirable in the second half, it tries to be really good! Is there a joke already kept in mind and a bit of consistency? <br /> <br /> It's Christmas Day. A mother and a daughter have killed one of the funniest villains ever. The next day, a rebel teenager suffers enough for psychiatric analysis. <br /> <br /> If the head of the police is cut off and with a blood strangers and an ax will tell you some children, who would believe? The fun is bored and the trouble is when BRAIN tries to be serious. A child can not frighten her for fearful moments. BRAIN concept is very fun and we will try. The Psychological Research Institute is bigger than big manufacturing plants! We've seen some of our ugly bad guys and their cohorts taking some of the worst actors. The audience discretion is highly recommended.
