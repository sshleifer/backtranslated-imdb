I am slowly tired of people who misuse God in their everlasting vision of the world. Well, I do not exclude Armageddon's ideas, or the arrival of anti-Christ. I refuse to see the ideas we see only very well-minded people (most Christians seem to be white children) will go to heaven. We had to endure the rest on Earth on Earth for a thousand years, because we were not enough. God may be a judge, but I do not think he will measure it at all divine levels.
