I was very excited when this series was released in 2005. The premise was very easy and attractive: each section would be one-hour short film, directed by a famous horror director. Then, when I finally saw it, he left for a moment. Some good episodes from the first season were created, but it was a totally handy bag. I assigned the learning curve and I thought it was much better during the 2nd season. <br /> <br /> I was a boy with a blow. We have had good stories at least during the season here and there. Season 2 ("The Black Cat", except Jeffrey Combs's excellent star) was a complete and complete loss for me. "Sounds like" may be the worst thing I've seen on TV in the last 10 years, and most other sections do not look much better. I really hope the 3rd season comes next year, but I do not breathe.
