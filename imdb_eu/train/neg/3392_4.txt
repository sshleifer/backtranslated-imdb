What is music in Indonesian cinema? I have never seen music like Indonesian movies like those in Bollywood. They have lost their minds of the story and only have a series of "poetic" names of poetic lines <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < special notes It's a simple story (but it's pretty straightforward) between these musical stories (here and there). <br /> <br /> The moody characters that must be preserved by the great actors are forgotten. The main actor can try to live a character, but it can do it better, trying. As regards the questionnaire, I do not have the story to put on a balloon student and, of course, it is not the only unmissable characters. <br /> <br /> I would like to see why it's strange. movie Maybe for mango ...
