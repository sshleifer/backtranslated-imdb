I have been somewhat absurd in a film based on a historical image. The huge joke of a movie. A horrible mind, dull, distorted and half green and half truths. <br /> <br /> Ian Kershaw, the famous biographer of Hitler, was the advisor of this film. However, he found that the script was so historically exact and ridiculous and that it also called for the use of its name as a source (thinking that people were ashamed of what was involved). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> A scene showing Hitler stirring his dog. There is no source for this. Hitler loves animals above people. Europe brought about the most demanding animal welfare laws, prohibited living and animal experimentation was banned. It was also vegetarian. <br /> <br /> The film turns its Iron Cross into a fart, it involves bribery. Narrow lies. He repeated his courage for a long time. <br /> <br /> There is no historical document with Hitler's sexual relationship with his nephew. It's not at all <br /> <br /> In addition to these, it describes it like a rage of Hitler in this junk layer. <br /> <br /> Even if you're half ignorant, this nonsense was demented and thick, like in real life, you should never know. Do not mind becoming a German leader. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this film was totally awesome. <br /> <br /> Go down and give this one very wide.
