Certainly, I think the exorcist is a classic horror, but I must admit that I do not see that as many other horror fans do. As a result, I have not seen a lot of Trash in the Exorcist, and if there is something in Exorcism, I must say that this is a good thing because this film is as boring as hell and it is definitely worthless to spend. about ninety minutes! Correctly with the corruption of other Exorcists, this is often the worst, and so it might not have been the best place for me. It is not difficult to guess what is in the plot: it's basically the same as in Exorcist, and a girl is aware of the devilish spirit (that is, the spirit of her deceased father). The country priest calls for exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this is Paul Naschy, the best thing about the film. Exorcism was directed by Juan Bosche, who led the originator of Giallo Spanish "The Killer Wore Glove". I have not seen his other films, but from these two: I think that originality was not one of its strengths. No good film can say good things about it; It's mostly done and the scene of exorcism is not expected. I definitely do not recommend it!
