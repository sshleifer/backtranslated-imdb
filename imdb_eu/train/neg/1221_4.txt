I recall that Kim Basinger remembered typical characters blondie and was just a pretty face that looked after dangerous interest or a dangerous maid. But he changed everything to the Oscar for Best Actress. The excellent LA Confidential movie, and I believe that I was not the only one who surprised me with its strong performance. However, from that moment on, his career was not a good way to continue. Surely, thanks to this film, he made his fame to participate in prestigious films (People I Know or The Door in the Floor), but we have never seen him again about his important nature. She She Out Out has nothing to do with it; and it's not just that it's not just tasty, but the movie is really crappy. The script of this movie can not be pure and basic. However, Basinger thinks his character and that's wrong. To win a few points in the movie. This film is full of clich√©s and criminals. The work of Susan Montford is very disastrous for many reasons, but above all because the movie never has a good pace and good tone. ridiculous I do not recommend it until it's exhausted. This movie makes the sin of the capital of being boring.
