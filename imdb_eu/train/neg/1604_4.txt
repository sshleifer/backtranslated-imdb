Remember that a movie that seemed to enjoy you in the past does not have the same feelings for an adult? That happened to me when I got back to school .. National Lampoon's Class Reunion. Laughter is a great opportunity to make fun of, but surprisingly, as we see a surprisingly acclaimed collection of characters, he sold his soul to the devil and shot fire flames, a man who looks like a vampire. , and a man who dies and a slaughtered man sacked in his head. The president of the class is that he thinks it's the best thing for sliced ​​bread (but as we can see in the movie, it's a coward and a joke), a couple of smokers who do not know when they are at their class meeting and knew that a man named Gary (even if nobody He does not know a man who remembers his name) is a joke that I liked. There is a pervert grump that wants to capture women with inappropriate places, when she calls her a dog, and she's a scary chef who knows the woman and "got her mother on the train". Who loves to give food to the people with the dishes! In essence, the movie is about a nutcase (or at least trying to take revenge) of his classmates (he slept with his twin sister!). The film continues with old figures looking for a murderer in the drawing-room of the old high school dancers. The psychologist thinks he thinks foolish to himself. The movie has some gags that work (at the beginning much faster), but the movie gradually shrinks a bit less. The real problem of the movie is that I really do not know where to go. The movie is almost a joke, because it is rightly correct ... it really has a direction. Throw is hard enough, but the fun stuff you do not have a lot of quality to keep you interested. At the beginning of the 80s, it is a curious story about forgotten comic reefs (that is, anyway).
