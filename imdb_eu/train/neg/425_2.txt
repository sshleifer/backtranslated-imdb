I can not believe it, as I see it so terrible, that I am writing my review for the first time in the IMDb. <br /> <br /> This Disney documentary is not just confirmed by Planet Earth. I now know that I was entering the "People who brought you Earth Earth", but I did not know they would use the same cutting-edge miniature versions of the document. I only pay $ 8.75 to see something that the DVD already has. I'm sorry to say that Disney has not warned people that they have nothing original (keep James Earl Jones in a voice and sailfish in the 90s I do not think Earth Planet). <br /> <br /> But the biggest crime, while Planeta Lurra uses tragic history of polar bears while dying to our planet and is used as a catalyst for ecological change, turned the Disney story into family friendly trips. After the disappearance of the male polar beast, they revealed their cubes that grew a year later, and were aware that they were disposed to carry out their memory, and the earth is a really beautiful place. It has not been said that due to the death of deceased adults, due to the same event suffered by his father, it would not be a problem for future generations if we did not achieve our joint actions, nothing. It's just a montage of things that we have already seen in the whole film (and several times more, if you have already seen Planet Earth) than a million people. <br /> <br /> I never let the theater so ashamed and deceived me in my life.
