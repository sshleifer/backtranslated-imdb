It's one of the worst films I have ever seen. The story was boring, atrocious and pessimistic. I do not know if this movie had been the result of a film project at home cinema school. Continuous success continues to appear as a permanent single act. The wonderful camera wallets are a cheap and innocuous way to hide cuts.
