After seeing the first ten episodes, I must say that this show is awesome. <br /> <br /> Mostly my hate, the show was filmed in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but they should shoot in California, so we could have a scene in the desert. This would be more about the movie. The first scene outside of another world is in the mountains, where it seems cold. This is not a very egyptian feeling. The film worked so well that it felt that it was in ancient Egypt. It feels like they are facing foreigners in Canada. And it is so fierce that it also comes down to other planets. You can see the leaves on the ground, just like in the outskirts of Vancouver. The show is more fascinating and silent. <br /> <br /> Then it's Richard Dean Anderson. Kurt Russel is not. He is sure to do a decent job and he tries to copy Russels' performance a little, but it's not as fresh as Russell. And it's not as good as Russell. And the way Russells O Neill was cynical. Andersons O Neil, it's too soft. I really liked the Russels version and I was not having problems until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks does a good job with Jackson, despite James Spader. <br /> <br /> Teal'c is a great character. Jaffa da. Not a Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! Former sponsor of a pathetic character, only seen in the pilot, and so far in another episode. Teal'c speaks and acts as a robot. I've seen a better performance by Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> And the people who kept Teal'c and Ra, who saved the character and movie, suddenly find themselves in English. dumb Those who were so terrifying of the movie aliens spoke of the ancient language and were real monsters. <br /> <br /> In terms of special effects, they are really good at the rider. The very bad result of the current show is wrong and looks cheap. Especially a planet that visits crystals. So they walk clearly in the background with a paint that is drawn on the scene of the sound. Our opinion is so cheap that it seems the viewer. Especially when they could do so before a blue background screen. <br /> <br /> X-files had a better effect when they provided the first sections of 1993. SG-1 started 4 years earlier. SG-1 did not have a $ 2 million budget estimate. They have to spend the money to spend. I do not see on screen. <br /> <br /> An incredibly boring and nonsensical spectacle, it would be perfect if the Hollywood show has a bigger budget and better writers and better characters.
