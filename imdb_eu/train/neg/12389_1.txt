Model by Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway), a teacher at Kathy's (Mariel Hemingway) rage (Chris Sarandon). It leads to judgment, but it's free. Then Kathy rapes! <br /> <br /> Violations and disgraceful movies. This video is announced as an important drama about violence. This is poorly written and dramatically misunderstood. He has opted for the rape victim, but his face strikes the scene. To make it absolutely honest, however, Hemingway's performance is so bad that it loses any real impact on that sequence. The test scenes were boring. And the movie has gone too far when Mariel's 15-year-old raped (fortunately it was not shown). I admit, however, that when he brought an end to it, Margaux captured a gun and killed Sarandon. But seriously, it's just a matter of raping a young girl. <br /> <br /> It is not true to act. For example, Margaux was no actor. Certainly, she was a beautiful woman (and I think she's a real model), but she wants a lot of her work. Shrinks movie Mariel was fine but it was one of her first films. Sarandon can do it as a rape. It was not bad, but the horrible script worked against it. <br /> <br /> I remember when I heard some women in 1976 gave up and encouraged women when they killed Sarandon. They have it. It was boring, simplistic and really sick. A 1 full path.
