Really, what's this? Hooper has made classic movies such as the Chainsaw Massacre in Texas, then this god made a horrible movie, what happened? did he drill a little too much? This movie is about a man called Sam, who has the ability to light things on fire (Firestarter, anyone?) The play was moving, the plot was rough, and the special effects were very rude; Van Damme should be glad that Derailed was no longer the worst movie, and what finished? He started to bright blue, he turned blue, took out his girlfriend's fire and finished the movie. WHAT WAS THAT? EIN? When I finished, I hoped to save the DVD with Spontaniously Combust when I planned to save myself. <br /> <br /> STOP ABOUT THE CINEMA. <br /> <br /> Do not think about it, you were right. thank you later.
