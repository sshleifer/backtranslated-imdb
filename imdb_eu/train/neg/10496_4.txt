Gday Mates! I just saw the movie Croc Hunter. It's ok but the show seems real. This was just the AnimalPlanet episode that seemed longer with more fun lines and more characters. Some things: Steve described snakes like Fang's like hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! Reality knows that it hurts. and can not they jump high? everything kits tail and things. This was TWO MAJOR dubbing film shots. When Terry finds this baby, he goes to sleep, "we must nourish, like the baby." Woah! I thought that the child would give her a breast. However, it was PG-13. In Terry, everyone warned the movie and Terry's conception was a lot of coverage. She knows her sexual issues. The film takes place in Queensland (Austrailia). I want Koala, dingo and joey! <br /> <br /> Steve's dog Sui really targets this movie. Despite the fact that it is a tiny little frog against the hottie hottie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if anyone else sees it, try and agree with saying that this fat-girlfriend in the dog-country that says with me is right. krok She ate sheep! I would be too much!
