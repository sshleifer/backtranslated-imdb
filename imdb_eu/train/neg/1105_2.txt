Oh yeah. How can movies with beautiful movies, but they are very bad. I mean, though Uwe Boll does not like that. There's no decent story, layered character or attraction. It's just a random sequence of unrelated dialogues to make a "movie". I think that being able to enjoy only 3-year-old children, because the world is so unimaginable that the story is so incoherent, older people would be upset. For children under the age of 6, it's terrifying to be terrifying, no one who can not see this movie is afraid of it. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and stay away from this movie. Your little daughter can make the story better and, surely, she can not draw this beautiful drawing, but her story sounds much more worthwhile. And please, on behalf of what you believe, do not let your children ****. I'll give 10 to 10, and that's just how graphic, story, and character development are so scary that they deserve to be a negative rating. <br /> <br /> And if you decide if you still see ... remember that you have warned.
