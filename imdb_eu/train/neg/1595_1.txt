The movie seemed to me to be the new type of Pokemon Celebi. The crust, of course, was not as interesting as other films. It was time and money to lose. Equally sharp and bad moods. The movie was not available to become a famous Pokémon. The movie would not be related to animosities such as Dragonball, Digimon or Yu-Gi-Oh. Drawings and adjustments are not above the original anime standards. It's hard to talk about this movie. I bet that Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the results of the film and give up with Pokémon. Digimon is an anime and is not approaching Pokémon. The second movie will end in 2002.
