Predictable, poorly written and poorly written. I argued stupidly that this work would not be worthwhile if there were no merit. I believe that the competition between actors is so strong (and worse) that nobody can choose much more. We started early when someone was murdered, and since then we have been lying down. The movies did not intrigue to get to know the victim and the only cause for murder. Some discourses, in fact, were shameful. It's hard to imagine anyone would spend ten thousand dollars making trips.
