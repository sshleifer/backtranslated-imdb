The worst film competition by Warner Bros Kay Francis is hard. Maybe I've only seen eight of them, but so far the Broadway kite is the worst. The best thing about it is that it's short. Oh, and Orry-Kelly costumes (of course) are fine. James Wong Hower's cinematography is not. Entire Kay Francis looks fat and much more attractive than usual. On the other hand, Minna Gombell, otherwise I do not know, is a "dumb dancer" of the "burlesque" (it looks like a fashion show than Burlesque). Closing shot - Kay Francis and his son (when did Kay learn that his mother was Kay Francis? I'm not a bit?) It's a great way to climb a dirt road leading to a jungle path. The whole film is so cheap that it is so impossible and so irresponsible that a sour cynicism feels infected: Warner Bros does not know what garbage is thrown into the cynical estimate of Warner Bros. What they get is rubbish.
