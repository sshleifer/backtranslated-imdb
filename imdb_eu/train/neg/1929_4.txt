Some have praised - the Atlantic: - The Lost Empire - as a Disney adventure for adults. I do not think - not least for adults. <br /> <br /> This script suggests at the start of a live action movie, that is, as a type of basket that someone can not handle. Many of the "crack" old-fashioned adventure films have done well (think The Dirty Dozen) but -Atlantis- is a movie that's worse. The characters are weak. Every partner's back in the background seems to be in stock and awkward. MD / Medicine Man, his father always wanted a mechanic murder, at least if we did not see them, the mixes and pairs we saw earlier. The story by Vinny-assisted director by Don Novello (Guido Sarducci) was completely persuasive about the flower shops. <br /> <br /> The main character, Milo Thatch, was an obsession with young Atlantis. Michael J. Fox has said, it has a depth. The grandfather who was looking for Milo Atlantis continues to be the one who lifted it. In the early scene on the knee, Milo is much younger, with his grandfather putting his helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And while the characters were very good, -Atlantis was the best place. voice talent Commander Rourke, James Garner, does not lose anything. Although Rourke's narrow military style, Garner shows his ability to breathe life into his own, because he just delivers. Garner's voice interpretation is the highest point. I'm sorry that Leonard Nimoy's killing king is mandatory. Also, as Vinny Santorini's demolition expert, Don Novello emphasized for a fun and good line - but I always liked Father Guido Sarducci. <br /> <br /> Well done was Computer Animation. BUDGET animation, that is. The character's animation did nothing, since flat characters already seem flat. Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is no wonder. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say they are fake. I am not sure of that. The useful plot with the right treatment can become something new. Shakespeare often went from famous stories and land, and was only known for the painting of the coat of arms. So treatment is the thing. -Atlantis, of course, is not missing it. <br /> <br /> I can not enter all logical spaces without a spoiler section. The plot was bad. Land bridges end up like grooves and the end does not make sense. In addition, the script and animation are covered with an annoying mess. <br /> <br /> ** REQUESTS ** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At first Milo shows symbols or celtic symbols. It has been transliterated incorrectly and should read "Iceland's coast" Iceland "coast", we will start to get into trouble. The scriptwriters should know the British as "Ireland", which they should take to Eire or Eire, and completely disband the ancient terms of the Latin Hibernians. But they also need to know the Vikings conspiracy to call Iceland and the Greenland island of the Greenland island. <br /> <br /> Because the "letter" is misunderstood, writers have the conflict to ask for an English version version and post-Roman scriptwriting date. Since then, Atlantis sank in her underground cave. And despite the fact that Milo's technology was not spectacular, the inscription was much more reliable. <br /> <br /> The shepherd's diary could not write before Atlantis sank, or he knew nothing about the cave or crystal. "Lying in the King's eye". It was written after sinking, but Milo did not even have the technology, how did someone get in Leviathan? So how could you know more after this? And why should it be written in Atlantis? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clarity, or astral travel can explain these things. However, clarity and astral travel do not need to be written in the Atlantic. So it's a bit of automatic writing. As you can read from the left of Atlantis, the spirits of the crystal must be the ones that send messages. This would have more meaning. But the film could also be explained: Milo found that shepherd was calling it all his life - he dreams, and so on. It was necessary to explore the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> Atlantics should be able to understand modern languages. The Indo-European people know that they do not know in Europe, they will know that the "c" hard or "days" of the French are "sh" (no less!). <br /> <br /> The current Atlantic could survive the cataclysm survivors - apparently *, but now they can not read what they used or similar machinery to operate. <br /> <br /> <br /> The Mass Illiteracy represents a key mistake in the film. KRISTINA has not happened to this culture anymore. He is suspended in the air until he can save Milo. Although life is not an ongoing struggle, nobody wants to write poetry or write novels, maybe Atlantis is a combination of school systems and lack of good fiction that fell from Atlantis. illiteracy <br /> <br /> If you want to know if Kida machinery does not know how to read or operate, it would be impossible to find out when Cataclysm was stupid when it was young. Deification !! Kashakim's stupidity almost completely erased the existence of his people. He killed a series of Cataclysm, stopped progressing (there was not a lot of death here, but he had a massive slip on culture and progress). If someone could not kill everyone until they could take a crystal, they did not cook the lava in the first place. <br /> <br /> A blue balloon power should break the image of Kashakim when he tried to join Kida's father's image with the Royal Atlantis Circle! <br /> <br /> Even though Milo was the only one to read in Atlanta, Rourke and others had enough to look through a creature book and found a page of a crystal - this is a crystal and not some astrological stylized or "known in some phases He had the "sun" diagram. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If Mr Milo's grandfather speaks about Rourkeri, he has not yet explained how Rourkek Milo reads as part of the book. He dropped the page in Rourker's hands, but found that Milo had no sign of broken pages on the book, even though the viewer was "not doing something right". If the word "crystals" were canceled by Milo's warning, Milo would not try to steal it, Milo would have nothing to think about. The head is just a preview line. <br /> <br /> The "double cross" of the crew is not a character change. We learned from Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie Rourke since the beginning. However, the flat "heart change" falls. It was a change, and it was motivated. To get started, nothing hard to do with the characters. <br /> <br /> A little lava flows out onto the dome instead of completing the rest of the area we see. . It's liquid; It does not emit above the protective dome, until all the fields below are filled. <br /> <br /> The end is over! - and it does not make sense that it exaggerates political sincerity. With the backward source, Atlantis is no longer a weak power, which needs coddling. They shoot huge robot guards and blue lightning, of course, they are less afraid of fear. Technology is better than ours and, definitely, XX. At the beginning of the century In the end, Milo needs to read the Atlantis, what? The whole idea is to leave his quiet little culture, demanding only, and not pushing him forward. <br /> <br /> ** WOULD SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Maybe I should give a suggestion to the Pulpesei in the Lost World and Subordinate settings . The errors found with the film are in agreement with that idea. But I do not know why I pay to see thin characters and holes as many centimeters of novels. However, the stories of the pulp make up "mature flesh can not sell". We have gradually become more sophisticated and we have to grow our crumbs. The lost Arche Champion have not sucked themselves out of sensibility and avoided so much evil. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10: the movie is nice, but as I think about the plot, it's never too much.
