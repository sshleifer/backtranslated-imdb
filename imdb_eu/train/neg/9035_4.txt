Born in the 1960s, I started to watch TV movies "Weekly" at the beginning of the 70's, and I loved the amazing movies that were shown in "Crowhaven Farm", "Bad Ronald", "Satanas School", "Kolchak," "Crowhaven Farm". Night Stalker ", etc., but this is just a plain mute. This is, of course, trying to capitalize on the horrific manson writer Manson a few years before. The movie is Dennis Weaver "McCloud" and "Duel" famous for his father's family camping at the beach. Some families find some hippies, for some reason, who want to terrorize their families. The reason for this is never explained, and the impassable attitude of Weaver is hard to swallow. In God's name, call the police, attack one of them or something, just sit down and joke around. The cast is pretty lame, the story is incredible, etc. Susan Dey looks like a bikini in a bikini, but that's it. Ignore this if you ever go to the TV.
