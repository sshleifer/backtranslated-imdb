I signed up for making this movie very annoying for comments. Apart from being a corruption of terrorist acts or executions of Air Force One or any other kind, it's a kind of movie that you like to watch a movie that can take on the same basic idea. It is very difficult to blame the actors, when they make a stupid screenplay that is stupid and traceable for that work. It seems bad enough for a season when you find an insult to your mind, but if you cough again, you should conclude that the director is not the movie's brightest business bulb. These are the producers who decide to bring this story to the screen for the first time. To do this, you can offer most of the most unexpected actors to get money and exposure, because there is no participation in this movie joke to win or acknowledge these awards. Perhaps such an embarrassment of insolence is to get involved in that loser. I do not see any reason to give a summary of the plot or to prove my case, for which it would be a cruel and unusual punishment, no one who could not be involved in this debacle. As you are doing well-done movies, being a good and skillful artist of art and beauty inspires you, the only thing you can learn when you see this monstrance is NOT TO DO AND NOT work! Take into account.
