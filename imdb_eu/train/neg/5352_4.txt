The Honey, I Shrunk the Kids franchise business was incredibly popular. I loved Honey, the children I slept. It was the original story and it was an exciting plot! The sets were so amazing and cast seemed to enjoy a mutual business. Now, honey, little girl, the little girl was stupid, so I think they wanted to get the story they all loved. <br /> <br /> Essentially, now Adam is a little bit older and the mother goes. on holidays to leave the husband with their children. But when Wayne's favorite element jeopardizes the rubbish, he wants to crush him and save it, but he and his brothers are on the way. But when the wife returns to her son some medications, the wives return after they have returned, they are caught in the machine, leaving only children at home! <br /> <br /> Plots are stupid, but as I said, it was just a family movie, some can get a shot. The original honey, I'm little baby, I think everyone's best. The third one was not so bad, I recommended at least Honey, about I Blew Up the Kid, at least fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
