Bad guys The great reaction and the shorts that the Directors started to create from nowhere were very much liked. This film is thought to be considered as a prize at the Gij√≥n Film Festival. <br /> <br /> All those who came out of the theater had the same opinions I - what was the movie going on? Iraq's references were strange or not well thought out. I am happy that this movie has been released, very, very depressing and my loss of time. Sorry, a very negative review, but luckily some people have decided to make the wrong mistake. We did not have a shame at the end of the Q and A movie - now it might be interesting.
