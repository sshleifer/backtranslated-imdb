Sometimes this movie was fun, sometimes in hell, it was totally fun. <br /> <br /> I received the underlying message from the film that women were responsible for every man's problem. Every time a woman is depicted in the film, she is lazy, unproductive, or without apparent reason. I do not think the message involved is appropriate for women or men. <br /> <br /> But it's a comedy and a work of art, so it's just someone's perspective. However, although they do not agree, they still have the right. <br /> <br /> An entertaining movie, but the comments made by others are stupid. The best movie ever on my foot.
