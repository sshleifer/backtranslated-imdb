I wonder who was responsible for this mess. Gilligan's island would not work. If this were to happen in the series, would they be joking about Auschwitz or would Eva replace his oven, Adolf would only propose 50 seats? I love Lucy to compare this show with another show. Lucille Ball was a matter of physical comedy and strange situations, and this malice was wrong and he was insulted to my understanding. <br /> <br /> Against the Nazi against England and the number of people killed, I believe that it is a simple concept of a comedy by Hitler before any ordinary episodes that kill ordinary people. they were produced.
