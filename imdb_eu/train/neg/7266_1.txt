... and yet they told us to spend another hour and 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Why, why there was no editor to write to the writer or the director. snip It seems that the writer / director has made short films; Short, that would be fine. After twenty minutes, when there is no conversation. A lot of music is missing. Rear noises (conversation, traffic, and especially an ubiquitous helicopter) are aging rapidly. The worst part is the story. There is little more than a short distance. <br /> <br /> After about an hour, we had seen the variations of the scene itself and watched it over and over again. I almost screamed at the screen: "We get it, we get it !!!!!" It is amazing that after leaving the theater, we could take home, see the Daily Show and the parts of the Colbert Report, prepared for bedtime and learned that the viewer was trapped in the theater. <br /> <br /> It's not enough to leave your view. You have enough people to share your view.
