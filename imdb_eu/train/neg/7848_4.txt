This movie was just plain mute, I did not think it was terrifying when I expected it to be amazed and scared, but I especially laughed that some of the scenes were fake and together the blood scenes were cg and more mutants. They thought they were suckled because they were gay and that they acted as acting because they thought they were hated by the good actors and most of the people. They supposed that they acted like they had been foolish and upset, even though they were in the military. watch the movies free and I see many people imitate because they imitate so many dumb mourners, I did not see DUMB ASS MOVIE in payment I did not see ... but again, it's my opinion.
