This show looks really good. Kyra Sedgwick is an actor and I like the police series, but somewhere in the production, this program has been wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, writers should have more than one suspect, you know who did it each season !!!!! That makes it boring. The main character is wonderful and not incredible. I know they wanted to be hard, but he says, stupid and bad mind. Crimes are interesting and bland, and just lame all the way. As I noted above, I hate it ... <br /> <br /> In the end, this was a great and very bad disappointment ...
