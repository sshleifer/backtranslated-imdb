... and I've seen badly. <br /> <br /> I can say anything about this movie. Playing Jennifer Tilly is inadequate - as expected. Daryl Hannah works well, but there's no way she can keep this movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake in this movie is that the plot is so weak - even if the writer was based on a good foundation, the writer was also a writer. to create an invented suspense that he considered "foolish foolish hero." All Daryl Hannah should be hiding when they should, he ran out before his follower. The hospital scene is absurd. Without showing too much on the plot, I think it would be difficult for a bloody woman to take a pregnant woman in the hospital, without realizing it. Lame Very mud <br /> <br /> Keep up for a while and select another movie.
