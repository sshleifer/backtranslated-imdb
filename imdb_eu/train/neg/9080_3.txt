Well, I only ordered this payment in the household, I was bored at home and I needed a laugh. I have to admit, I have laughed several times, but I do not remember how fragmented it was. I do not understand why they made the movie. It's a comedy, but seriously, I did not find any song hung, or a 70-year-old babe is really fun. This movie tried to enter into comedies of recent years, such as American Pie and Road Trip, but failed to fail. It was a lot more than a raw comedy. Also, why did Cameron Diaz name his movie?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought it was sexy and nice and well made. Also, avoid this movie. 3/10
