Please let someone stop using Ben Stiller in any movie. Write the studios, hell, write in your local congress. I got more laughing when I went to a funeral, I saw Stiller Flick ANY. Jack Black wants to do something about a dog's disappearance, and Christopher Walken, perhaps one of the greatest actors of his generation, is ashamed to stay there. Stiller is his auto unknown, but now, even though someone who trusts him is proving to be overrated as a comic way. It's not surprising why this film was filmed, and after a few weeks it was available for the dollar theater. I will warn you, and your friend must warn you, Do not watch this movie, it's horrible, the worst of Gothic (personally, I would never think so), worst Plan 9, Ishtar worst, worst. then Golden Child. Hollywood, please allow Ben Stiller in your movies, it's not funny, it's a great god-actress, and others bring it with her. The next movie has been placed in position 1 because the negative score is not allowed; So while saying a table, I'll give it zero.
