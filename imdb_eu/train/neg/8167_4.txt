The forest is not just the standard slasher / backwoods cannibal price, but also an interesting mixture of supernatural elements. The story is two pairs of people walking through the woods. A cave home, the cannibalistic forest and the ghosts of his wife and two children soon terrorize. Every slasher is something you do not see. Don Jones makes an effort even though the film falls on all levels, but just the average except for Jeanette Kelly, the dead wife of the forest (Michael Brody Gary Kent), except for the average. /> <br /> The movie begins with a beautiful forest of a couple who walks through a movie valley. It's too late to realize that someone is looking for them. The slasher rates are both typical. Our murderer uses a trustworthy knife in the whole movie, unless he returns his right hand, when he implements his basket and shovel ash to send his scam to his wife's lover. <br /> <br /> The forest has a good story, but the movie just works together with it boring, just to act crappy. 4/10
