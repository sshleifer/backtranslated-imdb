After a ten minute episode of Stella Street, I was waiting for hope and anticipation for the movie. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> It seemed almost horrific for me to get rid of gag and liners directly from the TV episodes, much more enthusiastically and with comic time. The actors once said, and could not say it again. On my DVD I bought my copy and I was scampered to see the jokes I had made to win the money. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The movie's story starts at Stella Street (a regular English one begins). Surrey Street), gradually, some of the most famous people on the screen and stage of the last forty years, such as Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson, or The Rolling Stones. All the celebrities in the street have a local scammers out of all their belongings and are forced to be like tramps and ordinary people. There are some nice moments, but, in general, writers take an interesting idea and it's pretty boring. * END OF SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> T.V Episodes, all the characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including female), but is added to the cast of Ronni Ancona. I think this was a mistake. His cheating was not fun, and his characters seemed to be involved in the story. <br /> <br /> If you had a fan of the Stella Street episodes, you might find it. This movie is entertaining. But if you are a fan, I think I feel a bit deceived. 4/10
