Wow, what talent for agents is a waste. My husband and I were both sitting on the floor, thinking both, this should be improved, these actors are very good at losing time. Non-appealing characters, short scripts and unrestricted stays are performed for two hours. Actually, I could not attack and make food shopping (cat litter was more attractive than this movie). The husband has stopped and confirmed that it is not improving - Buddy will die every time, all cars will hit him and end a wonderful life. It would be very fun. Beautiful scenery and clothing can not keep that alive.
