This movie could be much better with a rewriting text. I do not think the film is very credible, but you think that homelessness and urban housing also wanted Jack Mason to hire hunters as a guide for a group of hunters. And when it comes to hunting, the poor Ice-T has its place, as if it were going to take them to the forests that it had never seen before. <br /> <br /> And how does Jack Mason find Thomas Burns in Seattle for Seattl? <br /> <br /> This movie is supposed to be based on the story of Richard Connell's "The Dangerous Game". A few years ago I showed the movie after reading a class for students of the 9th grade. I edited the movie again, I cut all the absurd scenes and all the deceptions. It lasted 43 minutes.
