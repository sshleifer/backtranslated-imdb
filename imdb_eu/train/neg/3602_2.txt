I am a fan of B-Rate horror filmmaker and I watched the slasher's photos, so I have a great deal to judge this movie. It is easily located in the upper-class horror movies of the 1980's. It's not terrifying like Night of the Demons, it's not as penetrating as the entertainer, and there's no external value outside. That said, this film is not valid. Please note that films are completely different films. The photo frames on the back of the film are not removed from this movie. <br /> <br /> Violence: $$$ (There is a lot of violence but we have seen it all before. A killer dies by a nubile. The students and temporary members of the facility cut off using horror films that were used by horror films. > <br /> <br /> BUDGET: Nobody <br /> <br /> NAME: $$ (The story focuses on Francine Forbes's name, he changed his mind to Forbes Riley after making this film. a work that teaches, people start to die and Forbes thinks that the murderer is his director Libido-deceived student Honestly, it is impossible to watch out for the script that does not have characters outside Forbes. <br /> <br /> TIPS: $ (level Everything is horrible, it is a feeling of a school production - that is, it is better for college students to be better than this. Forbes shows a kind of talent in Semina as a student, but others perform "plays".
