The plot of this movie is in no way strong, a lot of holes. As you approach yourself as a self-movie, it's not a bad thing, a lot of great cars. Why do I like it because I'm on the spot where I shot it. I've seen how to change the popular places in San Cloud MN and the town since most of the 89's delight. It is an interesting historical piece for its inhabitants. It seems that every time a movie is created, everyone wants a relationship. It is not possible to find a copy in local video stores, when they were stolen once it appeared on VHS. I had to get a Japanese copy in Ebay, I think it's interesting how the race race is in the whole country. I did not know the director came from St.Cloud.
