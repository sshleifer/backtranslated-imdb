As everyone has said, a horrible movie. It laughed me by the appearance of Scott McNealy, awarding one of the murderers who programmed a wall of SUN logos. McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, Microsoft is a company that defines its hatred. They have been required to file claims for defense against Microsoft. So, would you be stupid enough to think that a bad movie would add fuel to this fire? <br /> <br /> The public record of SUNKI participation is not seen, but clearly the authors of this film know Scott McNealy. Interesting mystery
