In the end, after seeing this movie completely, I am absolutely mystified by the worship of critics and online users. Is Western the Worst? No, I would not say. But what is "the great western American", which I've applied more than once? It's not so close. <br /> <br /> Such stories need credible characters with conversations with incredible attempts, and it's a meeting place and topic that I have never seen before. The film can be measured in minute groaners; In a time when how many times a screenwriter forced an actor or actor to say something that man would not say in real life? There are so many events there. Cheesy lines have come to you in the waves; Predictable, common and often. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind bad conversations, then what's wrong with a bad gun? In addition to showing a few of the Western guerrillas that are totally incredible, you try desperately desperately. It is well to have a comic advantage against these weapons, for example, in Silverado, but in Tombstone it is very hard and very hard to get rid of this movie from the list of the best Westerns. The latest show raises the director a little bit according to this score, but then I was so disinterested in the movie beyond savings. The movie is well shot and the settings are very good. Playing is right, especially considering the way the actor works. However, if you are looking for a great western American, do yourself a favor - rent it Away. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 3
