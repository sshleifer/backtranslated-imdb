Think of the Chinese Syndrome by a zoological student who puts an unqualified John Woo and "Power Play". It was a good idea, but executions, plays and interviews were completely killed, rather than mentioning the horned amount of violence and disaster, to offset the development of the most interesting parts of the film. > <br /> The story of this is that a group of guerrilla activists are investigating the disappearance of members of a mysteriously disappeared group after having joined the earthquake in a power plant that is suspected. This reporter, knight, could face a lot of bargaining of the company's authorities, it comes close to the people (along with anyone who speaks it) to clear the decisive evidence that can be caused by plant defects. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no sense of urgency, because the characters interact with a hesitation, with a stupid conversation and a great performance. Not to mention, the viewer can only be attracted to the film because of the action genre's appeal, the body count counting and the number of violent abuse to be subject to earthquake disaster scenes. Everything was put in the wrong place to offset apologetically the propeller story to compensate for the corrective and apologetic sequence of events. It might be much better if filmmakers focused more on a thriller and more focused on developing corruption in this story. Terrible wicked people, naive reporters, and reporters who are doing wrong. Formula, but at least entertaining.
