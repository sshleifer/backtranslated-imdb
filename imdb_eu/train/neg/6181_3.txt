If you are a fan of the Mystery Science Theater 3K, with the giant Leeches attacks or Pinata Survival Island, the movie may be for you. <br /> <br /> I live in Nashville and I did not know before the existence of this movie was released, the advertising company took the doll and Music Row featured dolls and ads. However, he stayed two weeks in theaters. <br /> <br /> Bad action, bad writing and bad production only begin to describe the embarrassment of a film. First, the names are a bit like Bo Price, Angel and Dixie? Eesh. <br /> <br /> Toby's line loads slowly down the heels, asks what camera-camera production assistant wins. Angel's character slickers in his city as quickly as he goes to the cowgirl, into the southern rims and two days in the ranch. His costume goes from the versions of female and female versions of Toby. In fact, in the last scene, local clothing is identical, asking if they have wardrobes worn by the patient. <br /> <br /> Audio is not consistent. Perhaps the most striking example is that Toby decides to make a bath and he suddenly hears his voice when he suddenly cries out at a gym. <br /> <br /> There is never enough explanation or character development on the screen. Overacting, exasperation, grimaces, and moodiness are the best described actress script for the terrible star interpretation. <br /> <br /> This movie is best enjoyed after a couple of alcoholic beverages and your friends wittiest company. But that does not mean much.
