Although this is a 3D technology (I think in the 1950s) this animation has been made. I remember a cartoon with Donald Duck specifically with Chip and Dale. At that moment I did not remember the name, but at the plot Donald worked in the circus, feeding elephant peanuts and Chip and Dale peanuts were stealing. It was this 1960's that was seen in the 1960s. If you saw Meet the Robinsons on the TV show, this picture was shown before the movie and explained the source details. There are probably about 100 cartoons that you can see through 3D glasses. This claim has been a bad move, because they are not difficult to prove wrong. In addition, the movie seems bad.
