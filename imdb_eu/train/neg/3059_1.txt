It's good to rent this and now, to conquer Santa Claus sacks. Although children are much more sadistic in the SCCTM, I would say that the Santa Claus movie was much worse. We saw Spanish Spanish work 5. I will tell you, when we usually watch the movie, we're all eating and eating food, but not for this movie. Only people kept their jaws open, Mr. Pitch had to do what was next to do evil. Merlin would help Santa Claus !? Or did his robot reinvent the day's savings? I would recommend renting because I have the largest litter I have ever seen and I like it. : D
