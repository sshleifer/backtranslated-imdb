Oh dear. Some of the best British talents in the TV series made this series, so I can not imagine that they work under the belief of time pressure and have been confronted with the first demands of many scenes. <br /> <br /> Fear is that the scenes of this mysterious Highland (especially when it attacks "monsters" and we see from its perspective), but I am afraid of a funny part of the story! For example, he has found a demon-styled corpse on the golf course: looks, his hand is ... oh, and his other hand is there ... this hmm is a bit confusing ... <br /> <br /> For many years British worship television fans fans of the series released on VHS or DVD, but BBVA has always said no. Now I understand why!
