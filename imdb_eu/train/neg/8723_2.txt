Very bad movie. Film very, very, very bad. It's a rarity, but defenitly it's not worth hunting down. This Italian rip Jaws does not make sense for most of the time, and the rest of the sense. "Alligator" is not convincing, and many sub-sites do not have anywhere. If it's in the local video store, you might be able to watch monster movies, but it's not worth forgetting.
