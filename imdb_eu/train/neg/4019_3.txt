Dakota (1988) Lou Diamond Phillips was another vehicle. This movie is similar to the one published later by Harley. There are few differences but both are the same. I do not know which one was first. I will continue to be one of the mystery of life. But both are "life" confusing, who want to turn their lives. Bicycles instead of horses. Basically, it's the same movie, and it's cheesy hell. L.D.P. then I recommend watching both of them. Extreme mugging and post.A.P. You will get it from the post. If you play, go. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, L.D.P. fans !!!
