The Germans think that the smile is fun (Americans think they are mime sexy and that they are women with English accents). I had to cross my eyes again with a huge face filled with the screen again. The story of a "mainframe of the home-grown household" defrauded a bank by clicking the random keys on its home computer, which only connects to a socket. The director, of course, loves a pretty young lady. I can not say I share his feelings. It's a little bit fun with the whole family sitting up in front of the TV with nonsense ads. It seems that revision must be a line so here.
