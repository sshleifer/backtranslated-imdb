It's a bad movie, only 5 police seem to be in HK, they did not use the gun and I feel like a Jacky Chan movie. He used his gun to make him suspicious all the time. In the end they use guns when they kill each other, what a fun movie. The movie, like all the friends that have died without good reason. <br /> <br /> The movie story is awesome, the story jumps up here and it gets bored. If you want to see a bloody movie, I think this is a kind of movie, I think this zombie movie by the United States is more bloody than this.
