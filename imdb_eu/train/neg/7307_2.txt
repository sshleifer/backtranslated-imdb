This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Their events are completely random and they make little or no sense. That there is a stroke that is so ill, perhaps, with a case of bomber fever. I describe it as a bug on a newspaper, it seems that there are several things that are mixed up. For example, Kevin pancake carat boy is a strange and curious boy, after which the police is a bit dangerous and perverted, then it is drug addiction and then attacks a random guy who clearly needs help. Then, suddenly the main character is having sex with friends with his girlfriend, because he says something stupid about an airplane. Then, in the end, he continues with a good breed of old families, Kevin's rabbit that works with karate children. It's really reputable that racism can be used as a joke in this movie. There's no reason to enjoy this movie for the public: if you do not love Eli Roth, even though this film did not tell me. Hatred is a solid word, but it has to be the only word that allows you to use it. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
