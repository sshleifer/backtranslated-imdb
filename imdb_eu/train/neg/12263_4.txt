Given this movie, as I have seen in Turner Classic (first name "Dangerous Female"), the assessment of the Bogart-Astor version of 1941 can only be multiplied. Ricardo Cortez must be surprised. I hope that his dentist and his Brylcreem sales have reminded him of his will; did the actress All women are good but not better. Yes, a Merkel is a little better. More interesting are the "originals", Joel Cairo and Gutman, as many as many of their personal remedies, but there are hardly any roles, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor, in some way, changed the essential seed of their characters in the remake; Here, Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) can not. <br /> <br /> This movie is not odd; There's a big slice of ham. The current key value is "41" that excellent films like Falcon are not reminiscent of. From 1 to 10 I get 4 points on the scale, especially the camera's work and assistants.
