There was no sense and it was so scary ... I think Hollywood has such movies ... you do not see. I have to tell people what to say about eating or eating ... it has got me sick! my God! The film is about people we do not know, but it is fed by humans! They have teeth that are blah blah ... do not you know? I can bet when I saw it in another movie. The cast was so great, but I think the scenario was really huge. and I should say that Bradley Cooper was absolutely wonderful ... with so much talent ... I really said it to myself, but I think it's a great scene ... Let's just let's get it. Do you ever eat a language? But a person in the film did it! It was really awesome ... however, I think the movie would be so good with those horrible men and / or cropped scenes ...
