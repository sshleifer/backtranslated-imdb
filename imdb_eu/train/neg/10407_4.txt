I found 4 pats: the legend begins to be dull and boring. All action scenes were stupid. The so-called "GRABOIDS" reduces the size of a current household cat, if not smaller. This film was just an unnecessary movie in the Tremor saga. In fact, despite the fact that the graboids were made, the story is so muted and useless. Also, if you want to tell a story back in time, make sure you use SAME ACTOR (Michael Gross) to make somebody else in the past, someone else's current one in Tremor movies. Geeez ... If you have not seen this movie, do not waste your time. To the rumors, 1, 2 and 3, for good time. However, sitting next to this movie remotely, the STOP button is withdrawn far away from this nonsense.
