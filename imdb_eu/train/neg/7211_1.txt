I grew up with the Student Inspirator. It was my favorite cartoon, and yet, if not my absolute favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from the spin-off of the Field Trip in Inspector Gadget. I wanted to peel bananas and I wanted to become the biggest detective ever. <br /> <br /> But the movie has ruined the reputation of this wonderful cartoon. <br /> <br /> Matthew Broderick, the potential actor. , undoubtedly NO was the role of Inspector Gadget. First, in the movie, Inspector Gadget is smart. It's not cartoon. In the movie, Gadget solves the mystery solely. Cartoons, almost always Penny, Brain, and a book that was wonderful (I still want the book!). If Gadget had fixed the mystery, it was an accident. The film's documents seem to be a competent detective, but the cartoon was quite mute, where humor came. <br /> <br /> Another thing is "Good Guy v. Bad Guy". to film. Being in the cartoon of Saturday morning does not mean. Gadget also has no love story, but Disney Corporation is full of idiots. The movie was a chic convertible. In the cartoon, he was a police car and he became a van. He hardly had any device, and especially to move from one place to another. <br /> <br /> But, if there is one, it was a great movie about the movie. Inspector Gadget was a silly drawing on Saturday morning. The movie was very serious, it was too much wrong, it had too much plot and it was not fun at all. <br /> <br /> Tip for those who have not seen: NEVER see. Never See cartoons, it's a real classic.
