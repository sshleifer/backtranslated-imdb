I loved Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought it was superb in the Top Model and was really glad when it won. Chris Knight liked it too, it seems great guy. But the show SICK! Both are angry at what happened in that show. I did not like being different ages, I know how old can not be between love. But Adrianne, you've been together for seven THOUSANDS. He did not suggest that he was not surprised. And I do not see the appeal that someone is willing to marry. If you want to, why not just enjoy each other's company and love each other, and leave it naturally? The marriage ring ball and chain was totally useless, it is obvious that Chris loves you, with or without the ring. And Chris, you're so embarrassed to break it up and propose it! You have failed in two weddings, how would you push to enter another one? I hope that this relationship will last, but I really feel the marriage in a hurry and for the wrong reasons. Maybe now they can breathe and find the right reasons to get married inside the wedding.
