A woman has advised her on the road to go to a mysterious town, and she listens to her two alleged ghost stories, both linked to zombies. But perhaps fate will also be saved to save something ... <br /> <br /> Zombie Chronicles is one of the worst movie I've ever seen. In fact, I must admit, it was so bad that it was overwhelmed with most trash. And here it was a lot, believe it. It only runs 69 minutes, and it's still full. You are doing some skinhead push ups, sweet teenage girls (who rhyme, tee hee), make a lot of dumb-kissy drama scenes and fine people for some reason why you never become an actress. <br /> <br /> As for the characters in the title, there is also no footnote in the film. Why, you get more dead activities than you did before on the web! However, considering the headphones and the brain sequences as pathetic (in other words), it may be a disguised blessing. <br /> <br /> And to get it all, it seems you like to shoot someone's cell phone to Youtube. Camera with round work, friction on the print, flashing lights ... I had to rub my eyes when I realized that it was in 2001 and in 1971. Even if clothes and fashion look like they are about three decades away! <Br /> <br /> If I have not reviewed my chronicle, I have not seen the whole movie, I have not seen it before. When you try to sit inside you will not even try to make it look like a blue-and-blue surface first before making excuses. He really charmed anyone who has freed him, and honestly you'll get a lot more fun with your drink on the disk than resting your DVD player with this huge horror excuse. In fact, do not be surprised if we sell bags and leaves in the morning, we see VHS tapes for your entire life. You have warned ... 0/10 <br/> <br /> P.S Which 18 horror fears have women maintain in a massive sports bra during the mandatory sex scene ?! See, the movie can not get that part straight ...
