I watched the movie. Finally. And that was not easy. Very boring, bad gameplay and almost all the details stolen from "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" you can not believe the authors take it seriously. Even harder to believe, this "product" was made on VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> So if you want to watch the horror movie, watch "Scream", but laugh, loud and enjoy, watch some kids go through the woods, shout each other and report inability to see the dark area .
