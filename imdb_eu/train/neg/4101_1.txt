I could have been one of the wrong films I've ever seen. I do not see how to describe the horror movie, or even a thriller? It's like dramatic. The dreadful music is EXCELLENT, but it was not as horrifying as the director thought it was about using everyday activities to go down the drives or stairs. The movie was so potent. They had nice cinematography (sp?) and interesting characters, but it seems that the writers thought they already knew. They should undergo special activities without explanation or what they meant. This is just one of those films that says one of these things and is something that is completely different.
