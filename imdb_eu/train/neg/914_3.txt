(Review in English, as it is not allowed in Sweden) <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with very small expectations and unfortunately I will let you know that the movie is almost impossible to live on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The story is very thin and jokes are used and those that are predictable are not boring. I smiled three times in the movie. <br /> <br /> The attitudes of discovery Swedish products are fun (unintentionally) fun, why not say a big signal; "Findus happened!" <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 does not have to watch on film or DVD, it only has to wait for the television to air, it will not be too long.
