I'm a Christian ... and I feel that this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> Nobody likes any book. The message is just your face. If you want to touch a wider public, you need to be in a more subtle way. You can not shake the father's bible and move it to each scene. Ridiculous! <br /> <br /> Poor direction. The vision of the lost people was to be terrifying, but it was very scary. Do they leave their clothes on the floor? The old Ed Wood movie reminded me: "God! People are missing out!" The scene of the plane is just stupid. Think about it: If you find your brother's clothes next to you, you would not shout "Oh, they disappear! They are missing!" and weeping and beginning to cry. You would first deny it ... you would just leave that conclusion. See Jodie Foster on FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite shot is that the dog is sitting on the lawn, next to it with cloth and boots. I fell on the couch so hard I was laughing. <br /> <br /> Music was so bad and so strange. It was like the composers got their own film in their own world. "Here is my chance to make a thriller", "Here is the opportunity to do my work!" WOULD YOU WOULD LIKE TO HELP YOU COVE JAMES! A good score accepts what happens on the screen ... this movie needed UNDER for more scores, but the message was so much in the face. <br /> <br /> It was a gentle writing. Also Christian Kirk Cameron captain. Chelsea was worse: "you do not understand, people are missing". Brad Johnson was gloomy. When they saw "performing" these two performances that appeared in the old and most ancient Christ ((sorry, I can not remember their names)), they only deceive producers, filmmakers and actors: "they will reach broad audiences we are "and" Johnson is amazing "and" it's like a Hollywood movie. "I have concluded that I no longer know what he's doing. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to the effort, it's a wonderful idea to bring the message to the crowd. It's the best way to do it, check out WIDE AWAKE, SIGNS, CONTACT, PASSION of Christ, O'BROTHER, NOW ART ... In that sense, the film is a must-have for people with talent and vision.
