I'm working on the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and XVII's THE WITCH 'MOUNTAIN (Monte de las Brujas). It's something like a movie. <br /> <br /> The film has not kept my attention. The plot is not consistent. The conversation seemed improvised. The performance was inadequate. The characters were sterile. <br /> <br /> The scene is the best home, apparently an angry woman driven by her daughter's daughter's smoking. However, this only scene with the rest of the movie is Mario, with its muscles. But that is it. <br /> <br /> The film did not have any effect. Music was very intrusive. The lighting was very dark, some scenes were almost completely black. Actually, we can not see: what else can I say?
