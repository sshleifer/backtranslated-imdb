If you have not seen it yet, I said to continue, to walk in the park, do not waste your time. It's not on stage and not acting that deserves your money. * Spoilers * - I can not decide which one was worse: the movie itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's theater talent is very doubtful, I hope you can improve over time. The story is incredible. Loose cannon American police raiders fight Europe on their own? Wicked Slave Mafiosis were only protected by two hangings ??? An emotional art teacher directed a band stimulant ??? The Spanish police chief sucked several sacks of hamsters ??? Give me a break. There is only one good thing about this movie: production costs must be at least smaller than "Ocean's 12", and it was as sane as this.
