I hate this movie. I hate the show. I hate everything about it. It's so annoying and stupid. Everyone says that they are heroes of the world of music and alex wolff, and they will do great things. DO YOU KNOW ANY NEW DRUGS? !!!!!?!?!?! Nat and Alex will end up, either as hobo or as Jane Hudson as "Whatever Baby Jane happened?". I could only get 20 minutes like that for 30 seconds of the show, and I was about half an hour away from "Guild Band". The Kid's Choice Awards could encourage people to cheer up on audiences, I have no idea. Just a few days before Nick's release, Nick's (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) most of the boys and girls turned their heads to children's commercials, Nat and Alex Wolff. First of all, they did not deceive me, and the second, Nat and Alex, I'm sure that I paid for a lot of money or money to say that and to say so, I do not see anyone who can find this exhibit. entertaining movie music is horrible. Nat's singing is like a disease, it falls on the root. Alex is a great movie / television show EVER. It's not funny, it's annoying, it's really strange, and it's hot, and knows everything to every girl. That guy may be lucky if he ever gets in. You know that this show is false, knowing that there are no characters (real life)! Jesse's character juxtaposes Draper and Alex's cousin (they had to be a quote problem). Their father is not a single, she is married to Polly Draper, but she does not appear in the show, since Wolff's mother does not seem to. Rosalina does not even exist. Her name is Allie DiMeco. I'm telling you, Naked Brothers will have fans to know "fans" when everything is done. 0/10
