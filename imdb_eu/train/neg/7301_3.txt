There is a great difference in the original life style, seat, fear, release of gore-parties, and have done with Eli Roth and her team as "Cabin Fever", and they just played that way. The film is followed by five university graduates in the forest cabin, another one that begins to be deadly after the mysterious and rapid illness that drives others. Friends return to each other and do not overcome each other's sight, and want less as they want. It's just as serious as the sound, the basic necessity of this film that could have worked with the lesser director of cinema. Unfortunately, what we end up is the few characters that are drawn, and the only goal is that it seems to be a splendid decomposition, a generous script, so profane to leave the conversation and leave it incomprehensible. which motivates more than the subplots (for example, Roth) on the screen of the director. It's shooting in different ways! Avoid this time devourer.
