If I had not read his name on the cover of the DVD, I would never suspect the old and old music made by a man with a new wave of music. Indeed, the movie is so far away, I'm asking people in the 50s and 60s that their authors would hate this type of film, so ... so unreal. And it seems that it has not been with previous films. This is not necessarily a bad thing. It's just amazing thing. <br /> <br /> Also, it was amazing that some opinions were given to me by this movie, especially if it exists. There are better French music. The songs in this movie were not very interesting, and the characters seemed so pale and stereotypical. If I wanted to see a wealthy person with a desire to get a rich sale at a designer outfit, I would encourage him. <br /> <br /> The basic line is like American. musical, French music is not gold. Although this movie is not present at the "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (HIER Femmes) and "Audrey Tautou", I can not see this for anything more than just curious.
