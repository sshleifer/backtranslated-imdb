The title says everything. The "Tailer Gunner Joe" label was given to the Senator, based on the ignorance of the World War II aviation. Back craftsmen could rely on the back of the aircraft tail on the back that was on the back of the pendant on the back which was based on the movement, avoiding pointing the gun tail. When the Senator practiced on the ground for a day, he managed to get the tail of the aircraft. He could not do it when the gun was well aligned. He was responsible for the fact that he was responsible for the fact that he was responsible for a camera - he made a mistake, not a senator. The movie has not been reported, and on the one hand it shows how it shows. This movie was designed to do something to destroy the reputation of a complex person. <br /> <br /> The PBS special was much better for him. The politician was a tough, intelligent and ambitious job to overcome extraordinary disadvantages to climbing the heights. He made mistakes, some serious defects, but shooting one aircraft tail was not one of them. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this movie is that people like a simple story, one ... stories so they do not have to think about it.
