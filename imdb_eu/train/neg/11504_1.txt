AQU: Sun on Monday <br /> I do not know what I saw. The three men walk along the road and drink it, they like everything and go to the people. This is supposed to be a dramatization, but, definitely, the entire film is deteriorated, without the only quality of recovery. <br /> <br /> I've read stories here as "beautiful, beautiful," and "heroic." I am afraid that I do not agree that these men suppose that they never walked out as the most well-known proto-humans. <br /> <br /> With everything? It was not a movie. It walks around and loses people, but it's the audience. I've seen them three times and I do not see anyone who lives in rough life. There's nothing deep in this. It's wrong. < br /> <br /> It values ​​a ZERO / 10 ... <br /> <br /> Source :.
