This movie has played a lot during the day in HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that people are interested in comparing Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks with the same capsule. Matt Lattanzi is the only reason to see it. Yum! Even though Matt said it was a bit longer to play a high school tooth. If she was a woman, she was playing a high school AMAI! (Is it just for me, or is it my daughter's appearance of Shelley Duvall?) Yes, on the plot - who cares? Adult playground.
