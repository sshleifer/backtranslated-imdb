This is probably the worst movie ever made, which is related to Roger Corman. I was able to understand when he had lower budgets in the first years, but there is no excuse for this to be born today! I am a perverted "B" movie and I love films that we love, "regular viewers", but talk about it, I list the best Vampire club. . Imagine yourself, vampires with no vampires, music scores are completely out of place, sound effects are not effective and end up. Savage does not say he is suffering from being a vampire movie. Except for "bad career" at all. Tell me what a motive I remind you when I do not like a movie I forget the good side.
