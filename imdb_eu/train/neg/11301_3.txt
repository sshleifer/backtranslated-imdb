Nothing can ruin movies with poor script and bad guides. This is what happens with "The Mummy's Tomb". <br /> <br /> The script is a better idea of ​​older universes, like "Dracula" and "Frankenstein". The direction is trite and obsolete. The performance is mediocre. Although Chaney's Kharis is also weak with Tom Tyler's "The Mummy's Hand", producers are quite absurd to add footage to the great predecessors of Christy Cabanne and to express the weakness of his film! <br /> <br /> Universal realized that the movie was bad, and essentially reiterated two years later "The Mummy's Ghost" with a much better screenplay and better director. The result was probably the best movie in the "Mummy" four-movie series, though it's not like Karl Freund's 1932 original. <br /> <br /> Cabanne's film raises the image of the movie 3. 2 is best. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were surely happy that their characters met, so that they would not appear like that!
