I watched this Indian movie with some Christmas days. The quick summary of this movie MUST EVOID. JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this film, and did not do any of these. <br /> <br /> The film tells a story about Pakistan's land in India in 1999 in Kashmir. . Indeed, based on the fact that the Indian army is getting a suggestion on the difficulty of recovering Pakistani troops from this movie. But instead of telling the story to be compelling and heroic, this movie makes all the military Indians look stupid and stupid, but I know they are not true. <br /> <br /> I almost saw this movie as a whole Indian Spectator, they were very patriotic and clearly liked the movie, but at the same time, fun-like scenes laughed. <br /> <br /> The script was totally noisy. Dutta did not know the operation of the army and gave him an impression that he did not know anything about war bad films. The result is a headless and repetitive script. <br /> <br /> The performance of most of the principles is not a star, but given the given script, it is difficult to criticize too much. As regards the cast of support, I say they hope they were fans. <br /> <br /> The edition was pretty bad. It was quite a while to go on what was happening for a long time, and music would change the stage changes. <br /> <br /> Good things: Cinematography was pretty good, although it was a bit wounded. The movie did not seem to be corrected in color (color scales often changed significantly inside the scene). Similarly, the songs that were in the movie were not very enjoyable, at least at least one or a dozen at the beginning. Unfortunately, more than a LOT passed. <br /> <br /> And among all crimes? This mix is ​​four hours. It's just a good editing here since shooting a pretty good 1.5-2 hour movie. Unfortunately, a good editor was not working on this movie.
