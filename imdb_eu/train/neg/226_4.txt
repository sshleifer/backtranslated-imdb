Andie McDowell is a handsome 40-year-old woman who starts a serious relationship, a younger man, and gets 2 long-term girldfriends for a long time. <br /> <br /> Watching a gigolo / Gold jewel in the honest youth, "girl friends", when you finish this "stupid relationship", go and go with the help they call their duty (of course, because this gigolo has blinded). <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The short sequence of situations is absolutely ridiculous. Obtain is no longer covered. Without this unbelievable scene, maybe it may be a sweet love story. There is no thing that causes unwanted minds, just like these things do not happen! Without neglecting the cliff detail, I will warn the audience that this film is a great hope; Most (like me) will be very disappointed. From 1 to 10 on the scale, this is 4 of me weak. This material is much better. This is not worth your time.
