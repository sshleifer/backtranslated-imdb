THANKS TO THIS, END OF THE TERMS OF TODAY, FIND, DO NOT EXPRESS, UNDERSTAND NEWS. <br /> <br /> Oh, my God, where do I start? Well, here - for the first time I've come to a movie and say "I need to get an IMDb and write a review of NOW, it's my duty to the citizen." It's the wickedness of that movie. <br /> <br /> * Begin digression * But let me explain something before starting. I'm not the black-and-black art film of Harvard (I learned at the University of Cambridge at the other end of Mass-Ave, I'm going to go with the intelligent people and trustworthy people of the Father, that is, to me, to whom- Want-obsessively-comic-book-movies I'd like to be a nerd-group, and I still hate this movie ...). In my eyes, it is the film that Die Hards, Bond Flick, Secretary and The Graal play with. Titanic never sank, did not lose so much life, but we would not have depended on that thigh of a movie. The only reason I'm going to watch a French French movie movie is Emmanuelle Beart who is young and often dissolved. I also gave him a Top Overdrive on the IMDb for a few decades, in God's name. So I've come across a bit, so I do not criticize the movie because they're looking for the standard of cinematic excellence. Elektra is like a three-week-old made with goat's goats. * Ended digression * <br /> <br /> Ok, here I tried to classify so much malice here. Here it goes: <br /> <br /> MS. GARNER: One of the strongest reasons you want to see this flick is to see JGar hot (I do not know why my wife wanted). Between me and "Finding Nemo", I think that the latter was a sex movie. Do you know about the frightening commercials that you see in the red dress you see? You can see it twice - at the beginning, once at the end. Bummer In the rest, he seems essentially a Morrissey appearance. She has a lot of black and busty clothes. This brings me a huge set of expressions that JGar shows in his acting - full "shake" in "crying and weeping." Oh, you guess God, Ben Affleck, or something horrible. Wait ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> The intelligence and theater's identical abilities show that a grapefruit is a bit too much to expect Because you are. At least with the JG performance, it's not bad at all. The role of a person is standing up and it is a giant, another must be up and running, and women's role should be to stand up and / or kiss. They try to stun incredible feats. All bad men are the most difficult task - SIMULTANEO A) must be annoyed and b) appear Asian. Good job. I think the fifth man was bad, but my brain starts to block parts of that movie in defense itself. <br /> <br /> TUTUES! This movie has a lot of surprises in the Democratic National Convention. Let's take it this way: my wife, who only has half a year in the US and only speaks a small number of English, whispered to me that this was the first time under JG and I swore to God: "he goes home to kill the girl, father too. " And this is NOT ACHIEVING AROUND THE SCANNER. Now, my wife is not a fool, but Mensa does not dare to offer her presents, and she does not face Daredevil's or the comic genre. And he represented this .00015 seconds, without any information. It's obvious from that movie. <br /> <br /> STUPIDANCE before you see it! OK, so this movie is a great guy. It can take a shotgun blast and it is like a brush, and Electra can take a lie in the chest and tilt the metal (or melt it, or something, giving more defenses, thanking God). JG but he jumps in his head and exploded? An Achilles Noggin? ADOS! The stupidity of such a movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> Ack. I am beginning to feel a brain bleeding, so I have to stop. But warned you. If you want, you need to cut your tires to see this movie, DO IT. And if Armageddon came in, let it> before> this goes out on DVD.
