Oh, Hamlet weak. I knew, dear reader, and let me say, THAT VERSION, get bored! I do not know who everybody will save money to make money, but I hope to be proud of himself. They took on classical play and turned them into a boring melodrama that can be imagined. This version is quite literally bad, because the presence of a large role in Maximilian Schell can also not be saved. The librettive quality of the film is a great deal of "MST3K"; Mike, Servo and Crow had a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> But in a way, I'm sure Shakespearean, if he were alive, when they did, he would not have his name attached. was it This "Hamlet" is not so bad, that's good; It's just a bad thing. It's horrible
