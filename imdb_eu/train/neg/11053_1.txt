This is one of those films that you have never seen before. Troma, unlike deliberately bad and bad (and I'm not funny), is 100% serious. <br /> <br /> However, he's supposed to be a super-lethal killer robot. Solid Gold Dancers entertains an acid on a journey and the first magical lightning and turns the Eastern Good Witch into a whole circle that pushes him back to the point where he strongly pushes the whole circle around the edge. <br /> <br /> That's why it's pretty impressive.
