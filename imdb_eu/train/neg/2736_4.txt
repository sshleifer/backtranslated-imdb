The only reason I notice, finally, I learned why Dr. Cox was bald. Without a doubt, this week we realized the same period, Dr. Cox is bald, because they did not show up for those episodes. The last episode of Jesus, resurrected by Robinson, dying of Cox, dying, Cox bowed his head. Perhaps they showed us for some peculiar reasons, and they forgot that they had thrown in continuity. Shame, scrubs They made such mistakes before. I recall that Elliot is trying to date Scott Foley and wet his hair in 2 seconds before tapping water. I try to notice these things, but my favorite show has to be violated.
