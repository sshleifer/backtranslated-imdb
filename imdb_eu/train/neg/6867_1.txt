We can start with wood play, but this movie is a disaster. After living in NY, I can say that this film is a murder of anyone who knows the community or the people. I am not a defender of culture at all and I found that a Dutch trash piece is unknown to Seinfeld who see their fictional, ridiculous culture presentation and language that suits anyone. The loss of time is horrible and, even worse, it is not very interesting, since the result is clear, and the scenes of the conflict are laughably bad. Who works like that? Nobody. <br /> <br /> The name of the writer is heard by Israeli or something of that nature, but it is clear that there is no idea about the topic being written. Looking at Bio, it's amazing that he lived in New York and asked how real a connection was to the community. Even outlaw-borne films like "A Stranger Our Us" are better and closer than this dreck. Reading of this boy's reading is not surprising that he has written films in all grades of C. shocking Maybe someone knows this script because it is smaller than a bad movie by Dolph Lundg.
