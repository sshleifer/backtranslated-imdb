Okay, I rented this movie for the director ... He has made interesting films of the past (if you have not watched Waxork, you're missing out on a fun ride). However, I had doubts about this initial movie, but I decided to suck it and give it a look. It's bad Very bad. If you have not seen the movie and do not mind reading havoc. First, the old phrase: 'You can not cover a book, its a book' is applied here. It emphasizes that Flick's box highlights Jill. Kutxa's back with Jill in red leather and other shots. Description wants to rent the movie, because SOUNDS is good. You start to look and suddenly the movie (inexplicably) takes place in 1977. Jill is a dog that is not in the skin. The film does not seem like it is, and that's not good. The characters make stupid things so motivated ... watch it shaky. 10 days before the movie ended Dolph and another woman without good sex. Also, what Dolph helped someone else to kill that cold blood. The director Anthony Hickox should see a stink when reading the script. If you entered the new millennium and if the characters were half intelligent, it would be decent. Establishing it in the 70's is meaningless and has no effect on the story. Avoid it!
