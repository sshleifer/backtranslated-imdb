I rented a movie that waited a few laughter, I was lucky to be fun, but I was very wrong. This movie showed little humorous moments and I joked that I was ashamed as ever to hire ... It's targeted at a 10-15 year-old group and, definitely, this movie does not feel happy for the audience outside these borders. More than 3 times do not recommend anyone who does not want to lose 2 lives.
