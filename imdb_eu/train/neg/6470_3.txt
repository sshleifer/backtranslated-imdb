Disney enters the well, many people who have seen the original LITTLE MERMAID will be ripped off. Her daughter, daughter of Melody, Ariel and Eric, will be presenting her with King Triton. Ursula's sister, Morgan, Melody celebrates the killings that Melody wants to use as a defense tool to get the king's trident. By arresting the attack, Ariel and Eric build a wall around the ocean, as he asks why he can not enter into Melody. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful and awesome video that describes live video clips. LITTLE MERMAID 2 seems like everything you see is directed to other Disney movies. I think Disney can only plagiarize! Do not give me penguins and dogs, I remind you of another couple of LION KING! <br /> <br /> Other dismal moments include the recovery between Sebastien and Louie, the royal chef. They played very well! The supreme feeling between Morgan and EVERYONE seemed to be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> I did not give anything, but in 75 minutes everything seemed to be bad and too bad. The shame of Disney, LITTLE MERMAID 2, is better to rent and laughter. Then you can prepare the rest of the sequel, later Disney will drown you.
