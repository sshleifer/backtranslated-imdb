First of all, let me be a LDS or, rather, a Mormon. So, when I watched the movie, I automatically gave the question. I usually find something in every movie I see. And this is no exception. He has his rapturous moments. But they are a few and far away. <br /> <br /> One of the first things I was very worried about was the Halestorm seemed to be ashamed by our Church! In the LDS church, congregations are called "wards" and in the basketball court there is a "cultural hall". BEFORE these two names have already been mentioned. The Church has never referred to any name and is "standard" as it refers to what our Church thinks. <br /> <br /> As the head asks me, do managers really be LDS or LDS wannabes? This movie had so much potential! In truth, our Church could show clearly and not only people but also those who believe they can be offered. Instead, it was light entertaining and much wanted. If it was not LDS, I would still think I was ashamed of the Mormon's stupidity, stupidity and embarrassment. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend the movie ezLDS to my friends. <br /> </ strong> Sorry bad. You can do it better than that!
