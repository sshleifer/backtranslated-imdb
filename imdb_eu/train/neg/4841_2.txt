BENETAN ??? <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised to see the bright opinions! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movie I've ever seen. Pathetic, grainy, is a great clich√©. I would laugh aloud and a lot, but I had a military date with a military man. I could not hide the other response, BOREDOM. Yes, I think my date was like a loop of "old boy". That is not a compliment. I know the actor wants to work. But Ralph, you're going. <br /> <br /> Ralphe had a grief. I give 2 votes because Ralphe was amazing. But I must say, Ralph, how can I do it? And why? <br /> <br /> When I see the End of The Affair when I will heal and recover ... C1
