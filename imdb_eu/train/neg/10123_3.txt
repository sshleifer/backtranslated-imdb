When I think Hitchcock experts and experts find themselves together, there is no debate about the great films like "North By Northwest" or "Strangers on a Train", but this effort has not been made since 1931, dark and flawless. The great director demonstrates. <br /> <br /> <br /> Emily and Fred Hill (John Barry and Harry Kendall) are a middle-class London couple, they go on. It worsens their source; admits The change looks like an uncle's letter, he says he'll set it to enjoy a luxurious lifestyle. They plan to make a world cruise. But their problems have begun. <br /> <br /> Just ask Richard Hannay, Roger O. Thornhill or Marion Crane. Marion does not like it at that moment, but you get the idea. Travel and Hitchcock go together to set up seats and candles in a dangerous trip. This is Hitchcock's first issue, and it's not the greatest or most memorable success. Hitchcock tries to combine comedy with other elements, in this case more than a home-made drama, but they do not have consistency, at least not here. The Hills are dull, flat, and chemical. or identity When Folies Berg√®re finds out more than ten years older than the rest of this film, women's costumes are violated. "Curtain is coming soon!" Emily leap. "They are not dressed." <br /> <br /> When the mountains are far away from each other in an ocean cruise, it seems to kill more than one of the tragic things that seem to blame, though it spills the people together. too. Emily's man, Gordon (Percy Marmont), finds herself seated next to empty seats, which emily suggests. Freden's "princess" (Betty Amann) has the eyes of Clara Bow and Wallace Beery's five shadows. Hitchcock always has a bad puppet with abuse always. Subtlety was yet to come. <br /> <br /> Everything is shot in a violent way, with confusing lock and transient conversation. Hitchcock tries to get Fred out of the air with his umbrella and it seems that Kendalle wants to laugh when Berry tears. When Fred and Emily leave, they see the giant rickshaw, one of the loud attempts to make symbolism. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Her husband and Gordon's affections, especially because of Hitchcock's many magnetic beats, like botticelli on the platinum rings at the Chinese end-of-day open table, as a result of the film. > <br /> The protagonist ends up with a dangerous thing as a fictional piece of directing, and he thinks they solve his relationship. Only the active participants in the resolution, except the fate of the friendly cat, end up resonating nothing. <br /> <br /> At least you will get some beautiful views of London in the early 1930's, and Hitchcock still watched food is still working. "Rich and strange" Hitchcock pays for his fees and is studying his business for scholars but not vice versa.
