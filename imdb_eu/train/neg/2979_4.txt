"Gone With Wind" is the most recent film in history. Mum, grandmother and movie loves movies that go on after five years. As a zombie movie, it's a blow. The corpse is not seen corpse, and it is incredibly clear in the gore section. "Zombie 3", on the other hand, has scary bodies and blood flow is quite generous. That's why it's better than "wind-up". It's not too much. Most reviewers make no mistake as they are dirty. However, it is not a boring litter. A terrorist stole a virus after helicopter falls and chemicals enter the ground. The terrorist, who has suffered a bad mix, is hiding in a hotel room that slowly becomes a flesh zombie. His first victim is a cleaning lady. Once bitten, Lucio Fulci's birth breaks the mark. As usual in the Fulci film, the theater is very horrible, the story is packed with lots of plots. It has turned out that this film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, so he explains his schizophrenic nature. Badly filmed, it's poorly edited and the sound design is flat. However, the murderer is fascinated and retains his relaxing stroll. Without a doubt, it is worth the money if you are monthly. Or do not like the "Gone With Wind", definitely the worst film zombie of all time.
