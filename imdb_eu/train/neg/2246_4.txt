I have never seen the original version of 1954 with Judy Garland, so I do not compare means. Likewise, a few years have passed, but this story was not that fascinating. The film tells the story of two fans that start off in the opposite direction. John Norman Howard, a disillusioned star, is a downward trend in a star, Esther Hoffman, who is rehearsing a new song and a new tale. His dramatic success only underlines his decline. <br /> <br /> The main actors, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, are good at their roles, but there is no chemist, nor do they leave the plot with me. The film stands out for me because of a single party, Streisand's beautiful interpretation of the winning song 'Evergreen'. He really has a powerful and powerful voice.
