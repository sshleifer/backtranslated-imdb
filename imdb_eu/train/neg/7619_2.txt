Because Mystery Science Theater is a fan of 3000, I can endure any image of my mobile image, but there's no reason to believe it. <br /> <br /> They rated "Super Action" in the blockbuster video section and gave a "frightening sticker with reduced Napra" film creator (HA!) Robert Napton assumes that at least 4.50 people could use a minimal person to get an unsuspecting one. <br /> <br /> Shame you Robert Napton! It's amazing that the American theater demanded a great deal of hope for exploiting the poor Mexican actors. You're disappointed! <br /> <br /> There is no time in this movie with the least action. Did you use these guys? Oh, look, they're rave in a field! Like them 6 And is not a secondary Asian guy? Why is it always during the day? Why did he take the movie 1/2 to show anything ... and more importantly why did we see the other 1/2? <br /> <br /> PS: owe me 4.50.
