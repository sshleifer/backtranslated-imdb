It was an excellent idea and it was a beautiful landscape, but it ends there. It was impossible for Set It Off to the West. Plots hardly make sense. There were so many people there and it was not enough to develop their personality. The excesses may not be those that belong to the plot, nor the story helped. The crumbs were also the longest moments that could be investigated, but silence or unnecessary interviews were used. Scripts should be more meaningful and directionful. I had a question mark on seeing this movie on the head. But I thought it was a big question. If you only see eye candy, this is the movie for you.
