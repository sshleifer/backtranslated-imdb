In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed the 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', was a hilarious and humorous comedy? the best ever done. After ten years, "Alone house" has been recycled in the second episode, not related to other films, but it is equally inspired and sadistic. Four attackers? That's four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, this revolutionary reported the series change! ?? They are electrified with metal chairs, made with barbels and painted blind. Ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new child is less charming than Culkin. Leaving the main players of the first two films, Hughes hopes to stop fossilizing old habits, but it's not surprising that this was not "Alone 4".
