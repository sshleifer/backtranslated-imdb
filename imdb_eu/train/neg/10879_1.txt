Lame, fuck, lame !!! It's a long 90-minute party. A mature setting with an atmosphere and atmosphere (an adult convent) damages a wonderful atmosphere full of rough and rough roots. It's mostly shame and they stroke gonzo horror attempts (there was a sample of the interview on this movie: they also showed their artillery and shot a barrel in front of a careful purchase of the Barbeau character: Hyuck hyuck hyuck). Taking into account bad activity, stupid jokes, homophobia and creature effects, this director seems to see 'Evil Dead' in many ways. <br /> <br /> My friends will pay my friends for renting this turkey for ninety minutes. What is.
