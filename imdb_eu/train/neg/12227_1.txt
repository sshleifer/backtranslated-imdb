This could be the worst film ever made, and that's why it's worth it to just see that reason. Streisand is laughably disbelieving as a young woman posing for the male judice. Soundtracks are tortuous, emphasizing some of the weakest fever ever found in Barbara. And do not even start to plot. There are really more comedies out there than rumors that come out of that movie, which is why it's horrible. Streisand's rashing ego, so to speak, the thought that rose to the height of Oscar, led to disaster. I am sure that the novelist Isaac Bashevis Singer hates this film and never forgives Streisand. I can not blame. This movie is like watching a car that stays for two hours, and the sound of Music is rotated together in the old round plate. It's really bad. Everyone from Streisand liked the movie that was directed at this level.
