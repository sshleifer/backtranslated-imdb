This is the worst piece of trash that I have ever seen, ultra cheap, stupid, senseless, meaningless, in terms of immediate worship. If you think that Ed Wood's "9 plan" is a bad thing, let's just ... let me say, "It's Citizen Kane." "Special effects? ... again" is "Plan 9" "Star Wars." Is it ... Thor Johnson Al Pacino ... it's so bad, but if you're looking for incredible movies, it's for you! American International I'm a fan of horror movies, Price-Corman-Poe saga and some beautiful things for busting, but they go down with "Star Creatures" Z. Of course, my 1 to 10 reverse is for fun movies to watch movies (It's a great boy who plays Indian heads) and so enjoy yourself and enjoy ... if you can.
