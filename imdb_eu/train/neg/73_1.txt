I have to be the worst piece of garbage I've seen a bit. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is a heart attack? He looked deformed. Of course I would like to know that Naomi Watts is an element of real life, asking what he saw after 2 hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Orlando Bloom is the heart? Looking sharp and deer-headed, I can not say I agree. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It was his usual wonderful, but Geoffrey Rush could not look like that. wait to kick <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I need bankrobbers and killers? This is Butch Cassidy's fact that it was a fun movie. That's it, it was tidy and boring. We stopped because it would have been better. It is not. <br /> <br /> The last 10-15 minutes or so, unintentionally, they were hilarious. Heath and his gang are shelter in a hotel, and women and children die for their presence. It's not fun But it was a great time when they came out of the hotel when the armor left, because Monty Python and the Holy Grail Knight Black. I continued to wait, "I'll bend my leg!" Laughter was surprised, many other audience members were upset. When we went, almost everyone was talking about this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not pay any money to see the disaster (preview preview), but there was definitely not much. It will cost me 2 hours of my life. I will never return.
