This movie should not be seen, if you're trying to kill yourself. I think this film can cause serious damage to the brain. The main characters are Kevin's non-heroes, Amy, Kyle, her lovable lover and conservative, a redhead trousers who enjoy sex phone, Daphne, must be "cool" and have nothing. Dressing mode, and Nick's boyfriend, who is disturbed, picks up an army and, thus, can cause those who know nothing. No, I'm not a pervert, the movie goes about doing it. The movie is the Gremlins sex virus in 1986, but you have never seen Gizmo's trace. No, these Hobgoblin, left by Wimpy Man (I'm sorry, Kevin), we make the most promising dream come true, and then kill the victims. Yes, you guessed it! Finally, they end up in a bands club, the biggest dream of Amy's nerdy dream is to be a stripper! Look, I saw this movie through MST3K, and Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot also laughed at this cinematic excitement and jumped out of the two eyes. Not really, but I want to. I do not give up any more plots, which is why recovery makes them very keen on my brain. Also, there is no land to be mentioned. They should shoot a general Surgeon Warning.
