On a short 40-year-long ground, Jack London made the breakthroughs and disturbances possible. This 90-minute film, as a biography of human life but as a fiction, does not draw on the surface, and is a contemporary story. In it, Michael O'Shea portrays one of his first roles in London and his performance is hard and handsome. The problem is not here. Susan Hayward is not a beautiful young man who plays Charmian as his future wife, and London is the biography of the movie "Base". London's life episode has several episodes that sheds light on the movies. So, we have short events as a London oyster pirate, a seal offshore Bering, a gold researcher from Yukon and a correspondent of the Russo-Japanese War ... a colorful event, surely, but almost nothing like a treatment. And Alfred Santell's direction (in 1939, he also directed one of Susan's first films, "Our Leading Citizen"). Here is a rough and high quality DVD with a crisp print source and hissy sound. Perhaps, for me, the best thing about this movie rental was a DVD rack: the catalog of all Alpha Video movies, posters of hundreds and hundreds of colored films. Let's hope these films are better than "Jack London"!
