This was a great intellectual concern. The chief leader wants to give a "deep" meaning (in front of the voice frames naturally) and undoubtedly caused the "method" of the fifties and sixties. and they gave the spectacular results they deserved (see Clift, Newman, Winters). But here the story is abysmal. Moving too slow, you can edit at least 20 minutes, including a reversal of the point and the plot line would not have changed. Sometimes, it is very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his "Uncle" nature and his portrait is often immersed in parody. Only an interesting part goes beyond: the young / heroic relationship is the same heroine as saying to a young child, saying no one was harming it, some welcome tendencies arise. But it fails and only the last scene is returned. The wise man : Take Foley's "close" instead: he has two great actors (Christoph.) Walken and Sean Penn together!), It's also an offbeat movie, but it's a passionate, suspensful. Here my hitchcockometer has zero surfaces on all points.
