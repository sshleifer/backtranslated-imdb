For this review, list of good points and bad points. I will start with evil. <br /> <br /> Bad points: interrogation options (especially Burt Reynolds Boss Hogg), the wrong choice performance. Boot, story, movie, idea to get the idea, direction, edition, sound and, above all, a start-up movie that does not start off. along with a reputation. <br /> <br /> Good points: Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ... that's it! <br /> <br /> We can join Analogy here. Jessica Simpson, daughter of Daisy Duke, who continues to work with Michael Weston in Enos, asks: "Enos, where is Boss Hogg and Roscoe?", Says in his lazy saying where they are. You may also have asked: "Enos, this is a good movie?", the red bikini would have blurred his opinion as if to say, although he would say in his mind "No, it's not really." When she looked at her bikini, she could be naked, and that would not be enough to save the huge part of film making. Keep it from Hazzard!
