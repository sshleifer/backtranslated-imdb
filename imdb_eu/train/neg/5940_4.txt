Look, I read and read the comments and I mean a lot, but I will shorten it but I will make it clear ... <br /> <br /> First, you can leave everything that happened ... how bad did this movie ... how not There was nothing to show at Notorious and I agree that most people say that it was "Hollywood", what would you say about a real life story? When people will wake up and you'll never see that they've ever found a true truth about 2pac and Biggie ... All of them are covered and buried deep. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm not 2pac or not I love Biggie both, but 2pac and Lil Kim I'm sure I'm in this great movie ... <br /> <br /> Next, the movie is awesome and because you say everything you can not see the truth. You see too much blindness, because you know something with BIG or something you do not know about and love this Hollywood movie teenager. Use the mind and see the clouds ... What you can say about this issue, I did not say 60% what I have to say is that the topic is very broad but it can only be said that it could be a bit of a bit, much better. But, nevertheless, I'm just a person who gives his opinion ... I do not feel the toughest feelings ... <br /> <br /> Look, I love hip hop and that's why I live but after seeing a bit of character I see the minds It may not be that way someone wants to live. With all the time we respect 2pac and BIG, all other artists like this should return to the page because the youngsters are getting damaged ... To bring the child's message wrong is to not go to school but live on the streets, hustling the paper and just grabbing ... . <br /> <br /> Real hip hop is supposed to be love and intelligence, smart and all. <br /> </ p> <p> I know that you think a lot, but this is my vision. Look, maybe I'm wrong around something and I'm not saying that the movie is quite bad, when I'm hip-hop for 17 to 18 years, I do not know anything about what I've read 2pac or Biggie, or how many articles I support and listen to their music ... Like most of you. Only those who were very close and the killers know this. <br /> <br /> And to the end, I mean, Biggie and Tupac, all the fans and families, these two men were the greatest of all time, as a lifestyle, but in the future try to improve, learn and love each other , think about what you do not like at the end ... .ITS does not count how much money or FAME U you could get and how quickly you can get U Up, your total use of AUTO and nutrition, your body and MIND ... Why U manage it If not, Let's LIKE A LIFESTYLE LIFE FROM FEATURES !!!! Peace and love YA ALL !!!! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LEFT EYE, JAM MASTER JAY AND CHANGES ALREADY CHANGES IN THIS WORLD !!!!
