After reading the reviews, it was obvious that everyone was intellectualized. Which is very boring. Oh well about days and there's not something like that. No comment from any of these comments to this or another. <br /> <br /> I grew up at the end of the Earth's time and along with Dan'l Boone the movie treasure matin√©es on Saturday afternoon. . He made routines an annual movie and filled seats, such as spitlings like monsters like jokes, templates, templates, horrified. It was a fictional theater of that time. He's as big as Oz Wizard. <br /> <br /> The IMDb stresses that every criticism of something about the plot. The problem is that it was a template. Goes here Randolph Scott (cowboy / hero) brings together friends and goes on defeating these evil people. Hooray! <br /> <br /> Our kids all figured this plot to drop our quarter. That's why Scott Scott, John Wayne, Roy Rogers's line of movies was all. If you want to go back and review each movie, do not ask for a surprise. <br /> <br /> It has to be remembered from an old context. There was no TV. No children. There was a school. Wide outdoors There were toy guns. It's not Cyber-time. And he just fell steamy. Such film provided entertainment and filled the imagination of young whippersnappers. Girls have also joined. <br /> <br /> This movie was entertainment. They are as absurd as today's products. She wanted to be a propaganda originally. But little children came soon. <br /> <br /> Our parents lived a real thing. And it would not be that Sam Peckinpah, a decade later, who eventually vanishes the red spell of imitation blood in realistic and copious amounts. Under his direction, no one dies slowly, painfully and strictly. Peckinpah's war and gun fight was quite bloody. Thank you Sam. <br /> <br /> The film had little or no blood, adults did not care. I think they would not tolerate it. A trip that does not break the plant life of extinction. So this film had no glory and no horror. Gung Ho was good for kids. <br /> <br /> I'll see you assigned to this point four. Why will I do that? Well Film is horrible. No matter how I love him. I love this movie because it has brought one of the happiest moments of my childhood. But the quality of a movie is not good. In essence, the novel for children Gung Ho becomes an affair. <br /> <br /> Seeing people. Of course. I do not mean to stay away. However, in realism. The plot is easy. Are the characters superficial? They are cloths. You can love a bad movie.
