Although many people praise this movie, I have to warn you. It has no logic. I think Basinger plays a decent job, but you can not make an excitement when there is no realism. <br /> <br /> This scene is a good picture of the movie: Basinger continues to kill the killers, and decides to sit down and look at an image that he finds from his pocket. The picture is from the daughter and she reads "we love mommy". Who has something like that? Who is? And believe me, I say it's not nearly stupid with other movie scenes. Someone points out that it is a "hidden treasure". Well, I do not have to agree, this movie has been hidden for some reason. And it's not a treasure. Oh, and please, I do not even want to comment on the box office. My brain is sprouting: D Usually the lack of logic is not worrying, if there is a small amount, but this movie is basically possible due to lack of logic. But I still think that it is a 4, although the logic is very shameless, it still has some moods that keep me watching the end. <br /> <br /> So, if you decide to watch that, you know that you have warned.
