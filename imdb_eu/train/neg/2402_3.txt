Larry Cohen (God Told Me Too, Q, etc.) is an amazing mistake of regular trust, Full Moon High makes it so hard to be fun and fails, Ed McMahon (!) And Kenneth Mars with sharp turns. Alan Arkin is embarrassed in his performance, and his son is just like Adam. This is like Teen Wolf's classic comedy.
