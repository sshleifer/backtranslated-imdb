I would call this movie an emotional rape on the viewer. The film caused a rather mixed confusion among the Cannes critics, but the final scene for me was just a pathetic attempt to become a director for beginners. It's hardly a question of a voice, violence, drug consumption or youth delinquency (or any other problem). <br /> <br /> It's an extreme metamorphosis of the main character, but it is not overwhelming, but it is not overwhelmed by the confusion of the boys, but the scene of rape ("orange clock" is dragged over the scene of violence) and I do not comment on its aesthetic values do it The artist does not have to do something to try to achieve his goal. At least, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Storage: surprisingly violent, rebellious and NOT your time. See "Orange Clock" or "Le pianiste" instead.
