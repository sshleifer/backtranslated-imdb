This movie was just a single star, but the only reason I missed the end. I have had great expectations, as I usually love dreadful horror movies, but this was not accepted. It's really a bad attempt to show a slide of a character, it's not a bad plot again, but it's wrong here. There are some scenes (for example, the end) that do not want to be fun, but they really laughed me. I thought the movie was two times that I was really in an interesting direction, but it has never been and needs to be fulfilled. In my opinion, if you are looking for a Christmas line, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
