My brother is a DVD collector. She looked at the cover (two common models) and added it to her collection. I was left in front of him to see what was the cheapest movie (I did not use that term), I felt obliged to feel. I did not dare to see my relationship with my brother, he was sure to be cursed cursed in his tight fists. The biggest name of the film was Michael Clark Duncan's only show and decided to make a total of four (roughly) total "filmmaker" film. In fact, the whole movie follows this suit. He was shocked by the DVD footage footage. (But I went to bed without seeing it). To my surprise, I found this album behind the TV a week later.
