In the series, the good things about this year were the winners. <br /> <br /> Although the ceremony itself was quite short, it was still boring. I think seriously looking for new directors and producers of the show, which can bring something new. It's clear that the show has been 'hip' and this year to make it more attractive to young audiences, to play Beyonce and to introduce P. Diddy and Prince categories. Chris Rock was the presenter to showcase the show again and make it more attractive. Nothing really works. <br /> <br /> Sure, Chris Rock is fun, but it was not really a good presenter. I really saw him alone as he spoke in all categories. His presence was not really "great" for example in Billy Crystal. <br /> <br /> Also, the distribution of prizes was quite unclear. In the middle of staging, some awards are not distributed and nobody leaves them strangely. <br /> <br /> Still, I can not remember being happy with these awards. One of the films was not eliminated, for the last two years the case has always been. Does that mean that it has been a good year with many competitors with feature films? I do not think so. I think that most of the movie will be forgotten for 20 years except "Million Dollar Baby" and "Passion of Christ". I am convinced that I do not agree on any of the awards that were delivered this year, such as Caleb Deschanel's best filmography, but I do not like Robert Richardson's work. He really did a great job for Oliver Stone for most. I worked, but I really feel that Deschanel is worth more. Also, Jim Miller and Paul Rubell won the best editing mode and John Debney's best music. But, well, for the Oscars, there is no way more pleasant to everyone, I understand that. There will always be people complaining about the winners. <br /> <br /> It was also fun to have been much more nervous than most of the winners of the awards ceremony and winners. Did the Prince name one of the selected names at once? And was Sean Penn's humor? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I Hope I Crashed" Irons were the best night presenters. <br /> <br /> Overall, without forgetting the show but pretty with the winners. <br /> <br /> 4/10
