I have very little to say about this movie. I'm convinced that ideas and scripts are good on paper, but I'm afraid that filmography and theater are not the norms I expect from some talented people. I would really doubt this in terms of its curricular films. Michael Caine appeared in the doctors' wood, and I did not believe in his character at all. The land was incredible, especially for the victim's son. Some scenes reminiscent of other films, sometimes I asked if a thriller resembled. Sometimes the lighting was dark, which was added to one of the stars with a low budget movie, and I wondered why I had to watch it.
