The path that leads to a small town that has won the track (but it looks like it is close to a motorway) is a strange cyclist who wants to help a reporter to go straight to his destination. A rare man tells the horrific stories about the environment: the first story, the couple's pair to kill the woman's husband, but, at the end, it will suffer a worse fate when attacked by a zombie; And in the second story, a group of camps cut off vacations because of a tumultuous tomb stalking his tomb. Zombie Zombie is an essay by the writer Garrett Clancy and Brad Sykes. to make a good idea for a zombie theme anthology, but with two simple stories, it's terribly short. And this is not the only way that this low-budget film has little budget: it's playful (with Joe Haggerty, as a story by Ebenezer Jackson, one of the strangest performances I have ever seen); locations are inspired; the script is sad; It is a sex scene with zero nuances; and the end ... well, the belief of the escalators. <br /> <br /> To be justified, Sykes's camera creative works are effective (although the red techniques used in the woods are very bad). excessive) and Joe Castro's "cheap gore" is keen: his ear is poured out, his eyes flowed, his face vanished, the brains are terrified, and the decomposition is wrong. Although the movies are overwhelming positive, but warn, The Zombie Chronicles does not park in the park, as well as z-rating for seasoned audiences. <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generous upload my rating to 3rd, because I do not watch the movie for the benefit of 3D (although another dimension that might have a bad idea would not make a big difference).
