I can not believe that those who praise this movie do not think of another movie. This would be terrifying for anyone who was terrifying, but he made a nonsense movie (or a lack of it). In a positive way, hands-on manuals of actors and technical crew are very competent, but when you get a tree to get an ear you can not make a silk bag. Ben G fans should have any other movie. Dorothy S fans must stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans must continue with the Last Picture Show and Target. For those who are asking questions about hilarious laughs, Peter B's terribly surprising book, must be attached to what should be killed by Unicorn of Killing.
