Being a fan of Notorious B.I.G, I was waiting for this movie. It's a shame to see that it's a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not convincing or realistic enough Notorious B.I.G. Many stories Notorious B.I.G. In real son, Christopher Jordan Wallace Notorious B.I.G. child. Unfortunately, he probably did not think about his father. Derek Luke Sean is just as simple as "Puffy" Combs. In a nutshell, no one is convinced enough to fulfill his mission here. This is a serious problem for real people who are playing. It was boring and he was not Notorious B.I.G. not even fans and non-fans would know. I was particularly disappointed with Angela Bassett, a vain actress like Voletta Wallace. Film Notoughs B.I.G. fans will spend a lot of money there. It's a shame to say that this has happened. There is nowhere near film. I expected so much time, but unfortunately I did not get something. I think this should definitely jump.
