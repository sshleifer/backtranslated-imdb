<br /> <br /> This movie (not a short film, posted on a cheap camera) could be one of the biggest cinematic film bombs in the history. Caution: the ship announces it as erotic research on sexual addiction. The film is not analyzing anything, and it's not erotic to look at one's own warts. The script is meaningless and meander, all elements of the plot that serve as a segway among some scenes of sex scenes. However, even if the sex scene lame tear. Except for the first, they last for about three seconds (again, maybe my version has been cut) and comedian overwrought. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a decent movie, you do not want to. If you're looking for a terrific movie, you do not want to. Whatever your life's goals, wishes or perspectives, you do not want to watch the movie. How did they get Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski and Ed Begly to act on this stink bomb, they understand at the end.
