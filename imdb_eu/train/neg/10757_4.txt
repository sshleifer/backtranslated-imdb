I watched this movie on DVD last night, and I decided to see reviews this morning. It seems that "I, Robot" has polarized the critical community that he sees in the IMDb (and has also called him a number of suggestions). <br /> <br /> That seems amazing to me, this is what it is. cinema is not great (nor good), but it is not horrible (nor really bad). This movie really is depressing. Because the US filmmakers' population is ready to warm up and enjoy themselves, and to accept them as a spectacular new work. This film is "reconnected" in full-blown plot on the plot line (Asimov and its current uber-mixing action) with Smith's character (with a titanium backbone with smart cinema), to special effects. Matrix and others). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> "Robot", unfortunately, is a perfect movie for today's audience: superficial drawing, wonderful conversation, and a lot of adrenaline. . Smith is mediocre, but we all know that (that seems to be the latest Hollywood Hollywood attempt to create the latest Bruce Willis blacksmith). The story has many holes, of all sizes, but I do not think critically speaking people drawn to this movie. Maybe today's standards have been very successful, but B-movie is very good compared to real winners.
