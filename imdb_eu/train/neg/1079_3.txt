Branaghen's performance seems to me to be the only town that was annoyed to me. Most of them are good actors, but they just could not get the southern accent. I mean, it was deplorable. He was just like he did not want to get out with Yank. One of the previous reviews questioned why US actors were not thrown into this movie. I have this second idea. It is wonderful that the actors and actors want to expand their boundaries, but another thing is to try hard to diminish the performance. Maybe he was Altman, but he is a great director ... <br /> <br /> Well, I do not want to bring Branagh to his overly overwhelmed accent too. Everyone deserves to go back. But it's hard to see something so annoying that you prefer a chicken man if you prefer or eat a bowl of food just by sitting on Gingerbread Man.
