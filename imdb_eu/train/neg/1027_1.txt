Usually, I have much better things than writing reviews, but I was so bad with that movie, I spent an hour registering with the IMDb to get it out. <br /> <br /> You think that the movie made with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a fluttering bet ... well, the movie was very awesome. It is impossible to "disquiet dismay"; I really tried to enjoy it but Justin Timberlake did not let me. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should get music, what a nasty performance - NO presence as an actor, NO character. I can not blame Justin on the page: the movie also has a rough plot and it's a bad time; It's definitely a "F". <br /> <br /> After watching this, I'm going to ask what motivates the actors. I mean, surely Morgan had read the script before taking part. Did not he see how poor he was? So what would motivate him to take part? Money? Of course, acting is sometimes more visible, rather than actually developing quality work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is an excellent actor; In this movie Freeman or Spacey gets more time on the screen, and he really struggles to play bad guys. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the viewers say: "What's going on here? Do you have to believe this dirty thing?" <br /> <br /> In the end, Justin would play well. run - very depressing.
