I totally hate this program, what kind of people sit and see this garbage? I agree with my dad and mother, I love lol but I'm sure I'm leaving the room well before I get out. So it's so penetrating and sad, but the worst thing about it is that all the detective programs that play this, such as the detectives, are wooden and heart-warming. What have happened to real mystery detectives? Would you like to know what happened to those who died in fictional characters over 20 years ago? I'd like to add more BBC BBC1 comic books to the dibley that the Vicario has just finished with that crap.
