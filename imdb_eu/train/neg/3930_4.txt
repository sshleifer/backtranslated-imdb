The first parts of the Second Renaissance show that the first machines rebelled against human beings. However, it starts in a single case, where they say they have the right to have machines, as humans say they can own everything they want and what they want them to do. > Although the premise is interesting, the story is totally insensitive to the rebellion of robots and humans (violent!). Somehow, it seems to be incorrect, as another reviewer has indicated, it is quite clear. <br /> <br /> The best animatrix stories (especially Osiris) that are close to the matrix core. As regards Part 1 of the Second Renaissance, I would like to say that it is violent and very stupid. 4/10.
