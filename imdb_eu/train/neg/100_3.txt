OK I have never seen the best movie, but I've sat down and watched twice! The story line was quite horrible and I asked what I was watching in the first part of the first story, but at the same time it was so great that laughter laughed me. <br /> <br /> And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie. Only the only thing that stopped people calling the strangest name left was the name of the person left behind. <br /> <br /> Generally, the movie was quite perfection, but if you make a cheap laugh at your future and see yourself lying on the floor.
