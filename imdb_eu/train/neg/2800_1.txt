One of my best friends brought this one night a movie: "To watch Earth's horror movie ever?" I always feel a horror movie and I always say it. I expected the typical b-slasher of your liking, but this was not what B. This Z-slasher is the smallest one. With a small budget, bad performance, bad lightning, no plot, special effects, heavy cameras and a great soundtrack, such as the House of Wax films seem like masterpieces of the Oscars. The beautiful thing about 15 seconds ago is becoming a topless person; she has very tits. The biggest part of what has been said about this film is 'Wow this is SO SO BAD', 'this is the worst movie ever' and 'I'm not drunk enough'. So, do not waste time (or money!).
