With Steven Segal, the film is as follows. The teenager was just a poultry for spit. This leads the scale and then falls. The character is cardboard. The story is loose double. I can not finish the disaster. You know if you've seen all the films of Steven Segal. Goes here Super-dooper is a non-governmental agent, so that many people know how to release him, so he decides to cure the brain until he is not dying until he dies. He escapes, of course, arrests him and his old man is facing a global man who needs a million years of experience to recover a terrible air force from a group of Afghan terrorists. Surprisingly, Segal was trained. All heroes, except Segal's character and his dark girlfriend, are dying heroically and Steve-Baby saves them all in one wave, or enters. Whatever Made up of over-the-air airplanes and army airplanes. And lots of boom booms. Get Popeye cartoon instead.
