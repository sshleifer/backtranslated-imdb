I have a problem with movies that come with my TV, when I do not see it. To some extent, I have come to be very bad movies. <br /> <br /> But this was quite enjoyable. The concept of being alone in the Earth after a comet, knowing zombies, laughs at me. That's why we gave this movie 2, instead of 1. The story was stupid ... but that makes you laugh (very stupid> funny). <br /> <br /> I only saw that. Star Trek's team was leading. I was surprised to see a younger guy ... and, nevertheless, the only funny character was.
