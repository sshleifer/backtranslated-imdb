I found myself a melancholy, especially when I saw films and tears. But not this (that is, I was surprised!) And it's amazing how many people have so much praised the movie. <br /> <br /> There are several disturbing events in all the films: 1. Although it is a blame. The real intention of Ben's real intention to exchange 7 his life to save his past, I'm worried about the fact that movies are suicidal. Some believe that it is a heroic act and others believe it is cowardly, and eventually it has been a worrying act. <br /> <br /> 2. The story of the films is dramatized, but logic is simplified. Medical, blood type game is required to be an organist. At the end of the film, Emily had a blood type of blood that could limit the possibility of lenders in the short term. However, Ben seems to have had a rare type of blood, to be a customer donor and despite the rare type of blood of Ben, his heart, but also the kidney, his cornea. and, in all cases, it also requires a bone marrow and a tissue antigen that does not require a blood type. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < However, some disturbing events described by the previous ones will happily help you to review the movie you want to see in this movie. If you go for a soap-opera movie, go for it. But if you're looking for a smart entertainment, give up a missed one!
