Man, I really wanted to like these shows. I'm starving into a good TV and I applaud TNT for "some options". But sadly, I'm a minority, as far as film director Stephen King is concerned. It's just as beautiful as writing King, it's irony, it just does not return well on the screen, big or small. With a few exceptions (very few), King's experience can not be filmed as the same effect on story-reading. Many people would not agree, but I am sure that they should accept in their heart that the story of King filmed is pale of what he read. The reason is easy. The story of King's story takes place in the intelligence step of the characters of the story. It gives us inner thoughts, emotions, and sometimes we find ourselves breaking or unreal. In summary, King takes the place of a reader that can not install a Panavision camera. As a viewer of the royal shot, we have less information than half of the readers. It's not too far from being said that the story of King's reading becomes a character, restricting the small voyeurism of the same character recorded in the film. While writing for King, Hollywood tries to shoot everything that comes out of its word processor, whether they need it or not. I do not challenge filmmakers, but there's a lot of talent and respect for King Stephen's elusive adaptation. The task is to make the lead gold, or the remote Master Zen. Well, the next good luck.
