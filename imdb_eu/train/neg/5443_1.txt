Bad, I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. The director failed together. There is a lot of action, it's a promise, but it's all. The director did not do any work. In that sense, the promising action is extinguished. The film is created in a desperate despair. This version of "The Rage" (named DirecTV in 1996) just deserves to see it. Another director would do a better job.
