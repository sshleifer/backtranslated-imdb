The "Mathematics" party is trying to put this television program apart from other police shows. The only look for this show is Rob Morrow. However, he had to travel through his Northern Exposure (continuous) career, if he had signed up for this schlock. <br /> <br /> The generosity of the "math" aspect is embedded in a episode that appears alongside Lou Diamond Phillips (this show confirms that it is the last refuge of the damned). To capture a fugitive, some "mathematicians" will use some "bubbles". Therefore, if we see a suspect in places A, B and C, we can use "bubble theory" to calculate where it might be. All this makes one think, or maybe with a stick with dirt (I can not remember it). <br /> <br /> However, if you look at the finished product, it basically took three points and received a point. in the middle and say "Well, mathematically, here's surely finding the fugitive." At that moment, another character emphasized "O, this point also happens when the quiet guy's cabin". Is Math Matter? It's not connected-f ** k ** g-dots !!! This exhibition reminds me that I was collaborating with banks with the main maths, because others agreed to a mathematical analysis, because "mathematical analysis" made less complex or meaningful analyzes. <Br /> <br /> Just the way to show it: you're a hammer, everything is nail. I can not stick to the OSAMA NUMB3RS group ... They will use calculations, they will call an airstrike in the middle of the mountain and knock Osama and do not use five children as a human shield ... cuz hey ... about all numbers. <br /> <br /> It's totally playful on TV.
