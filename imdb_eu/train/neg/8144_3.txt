I saw it at the Vancouver International Film Festival 2006. The synopsis of the festival's guide was pretty good, we decided this. I'm sorry I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> In addition to being a bad man, it was boring. I'm not taking off the actors, this bad script could not do much more. <br /> <br /> The first bite was tidy, without being ironic, without a high level being fun. The movie would have been better if Hunt Ho came with a horror feeling. Instead, he took it seriously, which resulted in a boring movie. I can not recommend this film. He felt long and was very weak.
