I really liked nothing about this movie. Clearly, there was a low budget illumination and camera work (almost like the Blair Witch Project, but it was not supposed). There was not much in the plot, and the movie was just medicine. I really sent the film back through the last 1/3, but this did not matter much. It might have been a good idea in the box, but I must say again: nothing about this movie really sounds like it. No good actors, special effects were fake, the camera's work was awful, and the interview was wretched. On my personal scale, I'm giving this film a fee of 10. Yikes!
