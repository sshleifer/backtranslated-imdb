Carl Monson was one of the most prolific directors of horror films in the low-budget Mahemi area. His films include strangers, dark performances, sub-plot and awesome conversations. This figure dies in a family mansion in a poor way. Unfortunately, this is almost a filmless film. You do not really watch the murder unless you have shadows and a little blood. The rhythm is useless and the plot is not very interesting. I'm sorry, but I've been disappointed with the gore and mutilation. A 10 generous 4 10. Just be careful: do not miss Monson's film Andy Milligan with the "Legacy of Blood" equally weak.
