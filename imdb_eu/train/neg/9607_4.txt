Do not listen to the misleading "Werewolf Woman" title. Europeans are known to pay attention to sexuality and nudity in horror movies, but it's too much here. The "lax woman" seems to have a mad person with a title that could have a noisy scene and die with her. Fun for the first time, but a hundred minutes rapidly becomes monotonous quickly. He's not a homosexual boy, but he's a licanthropy. The film can not decide on the tone, the first ten minutes (retrospective) being made of supernatural fear (I thought I was looking for a classic litter) that women had repeatedly mistreated and tortured the relatively weak research. revenge thriller In the end, the director stressed that it is based on a real story. Yes, well. <br /> <br /> In order to be fair, there are some fun aspects of production. The title looks like a widow and there are some beautiful effects and nude scenes. However, they will be quickly converted. Also, the duplicate interview is a fun campaigner, especially the swinging physician around the world (he drank work). Unfortunately, the movie makes it very enthusiastic. There's really no plot or anything else. It's a pity, I read a description because I had a real potential for the movie. "The woman tree" is a long, slow, and excessive movement, as well as the exploitation genre standards. (4/10)
