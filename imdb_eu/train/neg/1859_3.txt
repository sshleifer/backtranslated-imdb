This guy was fooled by the movie. Honestly, I thought that there was no horror in that horror movie that was terrifying, boys, then I had cold sweat. This movie was true, and I'm pretty damn. There was no fear that the film and the humor peeled this movie interesting. Some of them were so impressive and visually impeccable to the clich√©s, I almost laughed at what was bad, but I liked it a bit. All murders are related to snow sports and Christmas, which made them interesting. POV camera angles were awful. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a liquor killer who dies in a car accident with a chemical truck that carries an accident. Then he regained that the same chemistry itself was mixed up in the mix. These were the ingredients chosen for the perfect snowman. He is reviled as a snowman, he condemned the police. <br /> <br /> This movie had a bad performance, except Christopher Allport, that was fun. I also say, it is quite disappointed that this film is not afraid, but indeed a dark sitcom. They had a good story with a good plot, but it was not corrected. I like everything from the first movie, but now it's really annoying. This movie is better and darker than the track.
