It's a very tidy film, with instructions from somebody dressed up in Stella Stevens (I did not guess who I guessed) to make money from the Las Vegas Circus Circus hotel at the Old Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens directs his three girls team and they must play much faster than expected. In Las Vegas's 70s, it's a very mean, but most compelling, among the participants, and a line that is likely to be a plot, Las Vegas Lady makes a boring egg. It seems like eternally a movie gear can be rolled out, and that's where it's going here and there, and it never hurts. This movie was pretty disappointed. Of course, I did not expect much, but at least I think that one of the noble films of the 1970's could be exploited or something like that. It's not close Nobody kills Stamart Whitman and a sharp shootout written by George DiCenzo. A year before, Bugliosa was a lawyer attorney before Helter Skelter's civil lawyer. The shoot lets you see a waterfall. They hit a drill and a head with a forceful one. This is only a matter of action. And as for the girls, do not expect much. Stella and her girls (very small, but rather pretty, pretty talents, include a sauna and a bathtub. What we see is just a flaky side profile, Stella opens the blouses with her real talents, but I would like to., A little more revelation with her performance so I could write a movie that would recommend the movie. Oh, that was not it and I did not say I'm in favor of this movie. It's not a horrible movie, it's just nothing.
