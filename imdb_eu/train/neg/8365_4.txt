It's a simple story, but it's very manipulative. Pathology is lacking because it does not allow a place for reflection or imagination or personal thought. <br /> <br /> The animation is well done, but I think it is very present. I would like more images in the background, more backgrounds and I might not feel like that. <br /> <br /> But for a Hollywood style movie, it works well but Aardman is a very derivative. movies and that worries me. Perhaps a longer film will test the author without a voice. <br /> <br /> I think the voice is too much.
