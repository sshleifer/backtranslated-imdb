This movie can not say "humans are evil and bad and they are delicious animals and they are" never going back into the water. " A fisherman (Nolan) comes up with a killer whale, it's a very bad thing, but unexpectedly (it's OK to mark you), it hurts a pregnant cow instead of his mother, I use cow and word in every way - who is, of course, a psycho- A sick bitch and the evil canon of the piece - want to try to kill himself without mentioning the most effective method that kills himself. (Certainly, it was the first one). When his unborn fetus leaves his terrible wounds caused by himself, his wife becomes revenge and swears as well as murdering and mutilating all human beings who speak Nolan. Of course, amongst humans, the total psychosis is a total of the other psychosis. <br /> <br /> The film creates a half-minded message against human beings: "Poorly poor bale! They must suffer and kill evil men!" and yet he did not get Nolan devil. It is true that when he stated his reasons they were selfish and cruel, he became the heart of the first whale's whistle, and as the film progresses, he grows more and more compassionate to overcome the pain of the whale. on the ice and give it to him, to be a bit better. <br /> <br /> The movie Nolan follows a whale in a strange trip to the north and reminds me. The immensity of Melville's man-bale, and in the end, an interesting interest in marrying his wife and wife, thinks he is interested in joining one another at some moment, their own moods are respected, Nolan's wife and unborn baby have lost an accident. It's clear that Nolan respects the whale and feels his loss. However, it never goes away. The whale character does not have any compassion or respect. <br /> <br /> The last scene loses this focus and becomes Jaws, where the sea monsters eventually die and Nolan and undoubtedly fails to supervise it. I confused the whale-hugger (I thought a bit earlier) I love animals and I hate whats and I love what is the orca whale, but I feel that the aim of this film was the whale being victims and the people being evil and abominable failed He shows mercy and growth, and he feels in others, and all whales think he's dying and grieving. <br /> <br /> Only one message away "If you see a whale, anywhere, run it in a different way, if you put it wrong, it will hunt you down the ends of the earth around you."
