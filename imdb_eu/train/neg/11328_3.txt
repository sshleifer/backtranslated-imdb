Occasionally I will rent an action / adventure movie with a great way to relax and take care of myself. That's why I have a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - it's not a quality movie, but it makes me laugh and lets me bind a bit. One of these days I've probably bought copies of Princess Bride and Monty Python for the same reason. <br /> <br /> In any case, I rented this movie because I wanted to challenge it, without questioning it. . Mostly, I got what I wanted. Land was a kind of misguided episode of Xena, and Kathy Long's performance was very community-like (not bad for professional boxers and amateur actors). Some important points were cyborgs. Somehow, they helped create good actors to play bad. Unfortunately, most of them die very quickly. <br /> <br /> As you fight most martial arts films, you will be more emphasized when you enter the film. There is an action and plot (initially not strong) is just as fast as acting. However, the more you fight Kathy Long, the more time the director dedicates to his back. When I finished the movie, I started watching it for the second time, and Kathy Long's short red films were counted in the magazine. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was not enough to satisfy curiosity worth watching flesh cinema a second time. If you are looking for a fan of charm, forcing yourself a few hours, you should go to the grocery store and rent 50 cents. There is a lot of similarity between the show and this movie. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect it to be nice for a few hours. <br /> <br /> Of course, if not, you like Kathy Long. Then you want to buy a copy.
