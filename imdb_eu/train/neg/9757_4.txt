Paul Naschy is not the biggest movie to remember. <br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is the worst sword I've ever seen. The purse would be ashamed! His only salvation was as bad as competition. <br /> <br /> This movie is adventure and fear. Forget fear: there is not. There is no nakedness, no blood or monsters; Robin Hood's adventures (Paul Naschy), who wants to be King. fabulous loss Where did he go?
