Oh dear! What a despair! I have seen decades ago on the British television scene, and I was not aware of it until yesterday was revealed - the majority of Scott Western's coming a year and I usually see it again. <br /> </ strong> </ strong> </ strong> </ strong> <p> Rich colors and outer sets were good, but I can say all about this movie. I have to agree with most other negative comments. I felt several times turning off, and at last I did something I almost never did in the middle. <br /> <br /> Scott seemed unusual for charming girls. thief And the uniforms of the army seem to me to be a modern 20-year-old, that is, those who are not responsible for many other Westerners. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's better in the second half, but I could not wait to see it and see it.
