A thought focusing on Love by Floored comes almost immediately, "My god seems to be a really bad sitcom." Surely, the FBL seems to be a pilot of a series that can begin to fall Canada, Poor poor Canada. <br /> <br /> Cara (Shirley Ng) and Janet (Natalie Sky) live lesbian couples. In Vancouver Janet has already left her mother, but Cara's parents are still in the dark about her daughter's homosexuality. Pressure comes to her parents for the marriage of her little brother, Malaysian. In the same week, British Columbia legalized gay marriages. If you want to get married to Janet, Cara needs to give homosexuals to her conservative Chinese parents. Al du? Would you like it? Could he not? Cara's story is compared to Jesse (Trent Millar). Jesse, at the age of fourteen, has written her homosexuality twelve years in the world. His biological father Daniel (Andrew McIlroy) will soon visit. Norman's (Michael Robinson) fear of her child Jesse's end up admitted that she would feel Daniel's terrifying that it's not. Is 1-800-change-image help? <br /> <br /> Dialogues and distributions come directly from a smaller 1950s program, along with excessive physical emotion. The melodrama of the entire house suffers from occasional confusion and comedy attempt fails. McIlroy, Millar & Sky are the only interpreters who approach the acoustic calculus, but taking into account the materials they need to work, it is not surprising that nobody is surprised. It is possible that the campaign was mandatory. It seems that many interpreters are not really bad, trying to imitate the sitcoms below. That is, in fact, this review might need to be rewritten. Writing rewriting should be noted that incorrect and efficient Submission of old Sitcoms messages. <br /> <br /> Desiree Lim, a writer and director, has completed a totally unforgettable, bland number. It was a time when the homosexual was clearly the protagonist to make the mark on the screen. This time has disappeared. We also need quality today.
