In Texas, seven people gather in a bar to make a Halloween night party. In the meantime, American Nightmare is called a pirate radio and is deeply concerned about their inner fears. The serial killers, who listen to their confessions, make the nightmare true and each one satiently satiates them. The "American Nightmare" is a curious film with a huge initial budget: without a previous explanation, a woman dies two pairs in a separate external area, on Friday, as in the 13th. Then the story will change to a bar where seven people celebrate Halloween. From that moment on, the story has a great potential, and the unknown casts have a very reasonable performance, they also show beautiful breasts and naked bodies in this typical C production. However, the end of the screenplay is not supposed to be the alleged cause of Jane Toppan's behavior, here's a quote that ended before the quote ended. With a better start and ending, this strange story would be a low budget slasher. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Agony" ("Agony")
