The story of history must be the majority of Spanish film. His certain nuances and complexity and complete political correction are not really a baby, but good / bad. The world is not like this, and good films show complex characters, paths, dilemmas, etc. However, I hate most of this film, Bola is the father of her friend. The director tries to teach a good lesson: tattoo artists whose bearded heads are not always bad; In fact, the average father looks better (wow, this is ... philosophy or something). Thanks, Achero. I will propose a Nobel Prize for Literature.
