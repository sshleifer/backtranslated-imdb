I could not believe it. I had to rub my eyes several times. Was it true? <br /> <br /> Yes, there are Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins - they all have some talents, but here everyone adds them to a movie-style movie cover. Entering a ship space! <br /> <br /> Sad as it is, the only "Alien Intruder" tries to call a computer virus / demonic / demonic devil / harp / when you want to call Ariel (Scoggins). In spite of the fact that his captain (Williams) reveals that he was allowed to live up to their fantasies by allowing them to live up to their fantasy in high-technology virtual reality station <br /> <br /> interesting? Maybe, but here everything is just like a good section of "Red Shoe Diaries". Williams looks at all the left and right lessons and seems to prefer anything else. People get things done for money ... <br /> <br /> FX is quite static, maybe it's somewhat lower than expected to get cheap for such a video. Sadly, female nudity is also less than expected. SEXUAL INNUENDO is a real star and, of course, it plays the best scenes. <br /> <br /> If you like the movie and have no brains, check out "Alien Intruder." Of course, you probably do not have another look at Cinemax in 2 or 3 in the morning. <br /> <br /> It's not a star, it's not even a star-pot. <br /> <br /> Leave this out of space.
