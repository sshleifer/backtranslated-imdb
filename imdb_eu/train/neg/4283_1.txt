Unfortunately, it's true. "Legion sträinä" clearly explains the unknown parameters of Daneliuk's failure. <br /> <br /> As the author already said, the author consistently assembled its contents and factors and artistic intentions. Taking responsibility for the mechanical trick and unifying legitimacy to collect issues of bad warning, he has only mixed up a lot of events, who can not follow the story hair. The level of the script is similar to the similarity of Cântarea României's realistic socialist realism - only from the top down: the communist line worries only with positivism and covetousness, nowadays only Daneliuc is obsessed with. Negativism and disgusting scatology. The content of the ideas is zero, and "message", nursery and didactics, kindergarten. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he also forgot the basic work principles. It can not organize a dramatic situation, it can demand the right scene of the movies, following the easiest rule of adaptation and correction of grammar film. In his film storytelling to tell his story something similar to what he says: "Main sheet man is not nuthin right," and it's like all the people! "Great distance from the spectacular artist of 1976-1984" "Cursa", "Proof of microphone", "Vânätoarea de vulpi" and "Croacia" and "Glissando" works ... Sic transit gloria mundi ...
