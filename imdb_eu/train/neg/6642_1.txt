This movie starts with a funeral funeral ... and it's so hard that I've lost interest in this funeral within 5 minutes and I started watching. It seems that anyone who has made this film is bored with being trapped in a permanent mess, he can only see death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of the darkest sons of Southpark, in 10 minutes I want a movie that brings me an interesting story, I do not sit down and see thirty minutes instead of a funeral funeral. My grandmother was fascinated by funeral in recent years, maybe "movie this would "like it.
