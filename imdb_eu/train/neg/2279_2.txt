What a mess that was for the boy. It only lasts an hour and I pay only one pile for that reason, so I live ... unlike the whole cast of the wind that is in 1933. <br /> <br /> So, however, a small town begins to create a body that has drained all its blood. Vampires start talking about local knights, of course, and after finding each body, a little more. or whatever, as Melvyn Douglas plays, he tries to say otherwise. The dead have a huge hole on each side of the neck, two holes instead of the representatives, then they just say the locals. A giant vampire. The vampire stressed that vampires do not exist and should be guilty of human beings that kill them. <br /> <br /> But it seems that Melvyn does not have much trouble. Faye Wray to play in the socks of her candy. It's also a simple town that Dwight Frye plays. He seems to have sworn in all the films in the same way. It is more common for citizens to catch bats and drink their blood. Lionel Atwille plays the town's doctor trying to solve crime. He never feels like an actor. It's as close as possible to the paper cartridge. And Lionel Barrymore is also this thing ... to have some great names for guano. <br /> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> <p> Although this movie has a terrific title, the name "The Blood Sucker" is much better, this movie is too dull and bold and it 's a fool. <br /> <br /> For me, the height of the movie is watching Frye, it sticks to a curious peculiar town, but not just that, it's not much to offer. Then, when you know the cause of rare deaths and when you see all the special effects you need for this blood. I will truly leave you. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi made a lot of images, but at least it was fun and interesting to observe. The bad Lugosi clunker of this movie, Lugosi does not feel like GABA, to make it really bad. <br /> <br /> If you can not get a good 1930 horror film at least Lugosi. was it
