Carl Panzram lived a stunning life and wrote his memories in addition to the pieces of paper, probably the only person who did anything with himself. Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long's "Panzram: Journal of Murder" appeared after a century after Panzram's death, which provides a historical context for the first-generation American to escape back home. Going westward and being a cowboy, caught, he was thrown into the house of the boy, escaped repeatedly and thrown into a jail repeatedly tortured and sodomized. As Panzram was a giant and powerful man, he wanted to revenge himself from the wickedness he traveled to South America, Europe and Africa, and he did not care what raped, robbed or killed people, because they are not the same. . <br /> <br /> This movie is being filmed by James Woods, a skinny neck, sheep butt, the son of a bitch, Carl Panzram, a "drunk", over-dramatic and emotional, and who never mentions it. The joy of sodomization of men and boys. The film notices other travelers and charges of being imprisoned, once again, the former Taft president or robbing him from the jail in Oregon, as he promised to return the word. In conclusion, I do not think Carl would be happy.
