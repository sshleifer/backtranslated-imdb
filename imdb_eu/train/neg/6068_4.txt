Vodka Lemon Arminiar is a very charming and highly versatile movie that looks good on others and borrows others. Although quite reasonably well-known, the film is lacking in the real "zing", but there are many scenes that seem to be the most common ideas of the viewer of the art house. Films cover a few moments of cinematic filthy film, but, unfortunately, they deserve a movie worthy of their genius. To make the darkness a dark comedy and become a serious drama, Vodka Lemon will unleash a lot of insight and ultimately it's cheeky. You can laugh, but these moments will be very limited, with the snow-covered landscapes and the end of the sea buses. Noble effort, ultimately, in the absence of narrative cohesion.
