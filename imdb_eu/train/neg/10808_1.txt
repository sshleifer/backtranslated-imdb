Kazaam's version book was given to me 8 years ago, and people always say that the book versions are always better than the movie, but this time they were wrong. The movie is soon finished soon. <br /> <br /> This is a terrific performance, that is, I expected from a movie by Shaq, a magical genius called "ghetto blaster" (that is to say, it was not there). probably good reason was trapped). The little girl in the movie that plays Max is a horrible and horrible actress. Kids of the neighborhood are amazed, and I do not blame them because they're a small bag. <br /> <br /> The story is stupid and very topical. The father is always talking about a boy who is always working and never finds a new friend around him who helps him improve his life and eventually helps him with his father. <br /> <br /> Even though I thought the idea was stupid at the age of 8. . It is amazing that all the people who have worked in this film have taken care of the tracks, because they were shy and never had to do it. I can swear how to know more about this movie, but you should know by reading the plot.
