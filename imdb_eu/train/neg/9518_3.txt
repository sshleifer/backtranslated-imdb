Performances by Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Very developed underdevelopment characters. Awesome talk without land. At the end, it's more vague than a pancake, you can loose more than four tracks on the ends (if you take care of the wooden characters) MacLaine is the only real asset. The second sequence in the "Chicago bell" The second sequence in the search for the character of Sinata is not horny. The music of this sequence is inadequate. And the last scene, when the character of Martin was stripped off by the "pig" woman, I found out and found a stone on the TV screen.
