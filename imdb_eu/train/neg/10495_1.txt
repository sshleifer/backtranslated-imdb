I think Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I would not go 5 m from the croaker. <br /> <br /> But all this movie is bad. Kidding, eating people who eat, and the President's issues, make them the worst of all times. <br /> <br /> It's a very bad movie, so you can stay away. Everybody's "jokes" are so young, because they make you laugh, they are stupid. The plot is so bad that if the scriptwriter asks for 4 years of age. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised if Croc Hunter did not ask for a crocodile after he had eaten.
