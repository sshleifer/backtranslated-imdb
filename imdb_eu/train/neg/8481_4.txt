The play was awful and they both got both bad sports ... They not only got the skating rules wrong, but also the GIRLS Ice Hockey Rules. You can not check GIRLS ice hockey. You do not even have a BLOG. All the girls do not care about it. I play hockey and I'm just 4'11 years old and I'm asked to go to schools like the movie. Also, all hockey players do not hate skaters' image. Today's many girls hockey players were once represented by skaters themselves. We also skate faster with LATZETAKO LATZETAKO. I was ashamed of the movie, it gave me the idea that people sucked us ... but I must point out that it is difficult for the transitional sport to be selected for roller skates ... some cool ... KAtelin's two movements in the ice hockey game among them. In essence, people obscured. Likewise, it is not realistic when he made a skateboard that he would get a HOCKEY scholarship. This was really annoyed by the fact that the scholarship could usually be used by someone who could benefit the group.
