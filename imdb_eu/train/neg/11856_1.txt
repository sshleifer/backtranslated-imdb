I watched the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival last night, and I was seriously asking whether the people of the festival had chosen before selecting the movie. The movie was just awful. What I said was not a hyperbole or a reason for understanding - it was horrible. Matthew Modine's days went by as the main man. Gina Gershon had an English accent that was incomprehensible and useless: she should be ashamed of participating in this film. Gloria Reuben had a curious run: she would be ashamed. The script was horrible and we did not give any reason to look after the characters. Certainly, I think this will be collected, but once again Hollywood people are sometimes mistaken. I really think the worst movie ever I've ever seen is "Kettle of Fish".
