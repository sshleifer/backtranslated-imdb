Justin goes home to live with a strict policeman with a fathers, but he seems to make two of his father's three-story apartment and strangers alive. Justin is immersed directly in secret, in murder, in the world of drinking other people's drinking. Ho-hum <br /> <br /> Wow, did I see the same movie here other reviewers saw here? Intelligent, compelling, original, intense, thin, genius ???? !! I did not even see one of those things. What I saw was not interesting, soaked, meaningless and commonplace, it was very unknown and there was no tension as soon as the murderer was teleported in the film, giving his monologue / talk / talk. And where are these hilarious ridiculous? I was never so laughed, maybe I was not busy fighting to sleep with the movie. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> DVD More: audio comment Dave Campfield; Second comments with several collaborators and solo music tracks; 4 featurettes (Making of, set on the room, converting 4 rooms into a black circle); Interviews with Felissa Rose, Desiree Gould and Raine Brown; Replacement scenes; Bertsolaris: video called 'Addiction'; A trailer for this movie; And "Shock-o-Branch", "Chainsaw Sally", "Skin Crawl", "Sinful", "Bakterio", "Hillbilly Lagoon Star," and "Millennium Crisis" trailers.
