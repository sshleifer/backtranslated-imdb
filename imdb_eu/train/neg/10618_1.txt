The film is terribly terrifying and ravages the victims. On the front, it can be a brave movie about violence, but if you pierce it under the surface, there is a false message about the violence. Aishwarya victim is a victim of rape as a victim, but a woman. It helps a MAN man to help. When he reflects on society and when he casts his own comments, he does not defend himself. Anil Kapoor has let Aishwarya cry out. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The Director (Satish Kaushik) erroneously retorted the victim's rape and addiction. It was more effective to portray a powerful woman who rebelled against her enemies. The director is known for being a bachelor. His films are full of weak women but he tries to hide in controversial roles. It must be read that the role is controversial, does not mean that the character is strong. <br /> <br /> The abominable scene of the movie after Aishwarya "washed herself" only after she was raped. Father makes his father think he is dirty. It must be acknowledged that although Shah shows a clear stigma against rape victims, it does not show us what Father's father was wrong with her daughters to do such things. So, we're confused about a violent message. <br /> <br /> No comedy is in such a powerful issue. Even more, comedy is not fun. Ash is a wood in his role while Anil Kapoor cries out. Music is different, in terms of title, which is beautifully pictured (the only great point of this film). Sonali Bendre's mission is disappointing. In general, a great movie that can be considered will be a mish-mash, which will give some serious digestion.
