I love special effects and science fiction is a testament to new technologies. The special effects of this film are very good. I've watched the biggest part of this movie, as it has been published in HBO over the last few months. I have to admit that I missed some scenes, but I usually get into the movies and have seen some scenes more than once. However, whenever I see some of the "Hollow Man" I feel depressed, almost like a "black movie". I do not know why; I do not want Kevin Bacon to be a bad guy, and that's why he does not. But I think, how is it going to report bad despair. In any case, I can recommend this movie with excitement (although some pieces move slowly), but I do not recommend them under the age of 14 (maybe 12, if they are adults).
