This movie was great. They should warn them that a sneaky sneaky writer strives to name himself one hour and a half before trying to get rid of rubbish. What is rubbish? Excessive use of peoples time, poor energy, and waste of all kinds of educational systems that teach them to read and write. You are a bad demented loser of the Talia. Your psychiatrist should give you more medicine for your problem. <br /> <br /> The performance and the line did not allow me to move forward in the rubbish. I finished in an unfinished scene. If you want to learn how to stroke people, watch a Larry Clark movie. The entire cast of this film I lost all respect for "no more support for me". How could a group of actors or actors be reflected in the gross representation of human behavior in the minds of a psycho? I feel like all actors involved in that scene. The devil now knows what the writer of this movie is; Congratulations you have earned his attention.
