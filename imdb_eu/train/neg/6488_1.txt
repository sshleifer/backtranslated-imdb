Yes, the subject is a live movie quote and I think it's pretty accurate. I was bored with so much effort with the dead. In the first 20 minutes, all the rumors that are unwise are just a matter of doing bad films. If you are epileptic, you would die at least five times. Of course, all fans of David Lynch would bring a flag to the turkey because it's no sense of being the "best movie ever". The movie is always good. Right? I'm wrong. This kind of catching art is just a pathetic way of showing you this kind of filmmaker. Actor Anthony Hopkins must act as an excellent actor.
