I saw this two days before the official opening, and I must say I was very disappointed. Most of these problems must be decided by Claire Danes to roll out. According to what you think about Danes, it was both incredibly confusing and far removed from the fact that the 2007 Razzie favorite could be the worst actor. In my opinion, sympathetic sympathy. Instead, it's totally unlikely. Other "great" actresses do a good job, but definitely not a clear screen. Among all the "big" actors in this movie, I said that the best work was on Natasha Richardson. Streep is hardly in the picture and only appears at the end. <br /> <br /> Great screenplay too. Reads more lines than "characters".
