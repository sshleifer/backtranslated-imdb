This movie is not the only billing. Girlfriend and I love movies of action. Especially the fight scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer were wonderful), but this movie was not entertaining. At five minutes, speaking thirty minutes and "angry" facial gestures. The main hero is a conflicting character, and he has watched the fight and, therefore, it is seen at all times. The Armed has stopped his bowel movements to improve his fighting technique. Music is not good too. They fight the rap and hip-hop style of the streets, these guys are awesome. The other soundtrack is a low-budget drama that is a regular noise. <br /> <br /> This movie is about classic B. The actors hear their lines when they read the cue cards and set the lines on fire and put them on the streets of Hollywood. The movie is called "Honor", but it's not an honorable movie to do. It was just a loss of money, and spending wisely seems to be something of an honor. <br /> <br /> Go to Felon. Fight scenes and situations are more real.
