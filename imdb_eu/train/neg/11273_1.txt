How can you put together this cast of British actors? The awesome recording, an angry and noisy camera, which was very edited, was badly played. Rhys Ifans only tries to accomplish his mission with life. Other "some" show that they are the same as "dreck". Why do people miss money with pre-written readings? Please do yourself one side: do it yourself and do something else, such as a suitcase on your knees. This movie is more painful and fun!
