The worst film ever created is roughly unhappy and absurd. It's hardly felt that everyone involved in this project does not try to make an attractive movie. This is not a continuation of a series of films that try to make Smokey and Bandit a success to succeed, that is, I think the best of all the movies. Regarding film waste, Burt Reynold plays the entire film, Jim Nabors is wasting himself, the other actors do not do much, it is a visible material in car racing, humor is not inspired, and many of them are sadder and more boring than the scene facing the walls of both walls. "Stroker Ace" is just an unnecessary movie that has nothing but unique or distinctive.
