WOW! Awesome things Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor joins the roadshow on Earth in Sardinia and Joseph Losey with the artistic director of the Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor tells a widow with a widow and rich in a craft island, very loudly on an island, for a patient secretary. When Burton's grudges appear in the proclamation of being a poet and a friend, Taylor realizes that time has passed. Extreme play is very difficult to determine whether Taylor and Burton are playing badly, or Williams's characters seem so uncomfortable. If that happens, then the theater is great! Burton tears his lines, including BOOM several times, and Taylor tells himself. It's really awesome. He is also a confident Noel Coward Taylor, "Capri witches." <br /> <br /> Regardless how much BOOM passes and how fast moving life --- the two standard Williams-related topics, but Losey's, which Taylor and Burton did not have for audiences write In most of his monologues inane, any substance with the film would be diluted. <br /> <br /> BOOM has a stunning photography --- no camera should be focused on the salience of Sardinia! Assistance works Joanna Shimkus, the excellent Romolo Valli, a doctor of Taylor, and Michael Dunn, the guardian of his dwarves. Yes, both his dogs and Burton!
