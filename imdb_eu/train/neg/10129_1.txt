I almost do not know what the words of this film are absolutely terrifying. They sold me with a promise of action, with Segal and Stealth, usually a fun action movie. I can honestly say I prefer to take a movie with a stick instead of seeing the movie again. The play was so funny that it was almost fun. The story was very weak, because the holes were large enough to fly F117. The script was so bad, when I wrote a 10-year-old boy, I would not be amazed. Management and production are so amateur, I did not hire those people to shoot my worst enemies. Sharper Those who are responsible for making this movie break the art and their shame should be. Steven Segal has never had to show his face in public, I can not imagine what he agreed to do with a star, the worst film I've ever seen in life.
