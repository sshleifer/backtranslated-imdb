For romantic comedies, I often judge the quality of the film in the darkness of the eyes at the end of the experience. Unfortunately, with "The Wedding Date", I can rate four of four possible tears 4. <br /> <br /> I'm forgiven for Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney lovers, but I do not see much of the chemistry between two characters. The premier film is "Pretty Woman", Dermot plays Nick, a male escort hired by Kat Kat from Deba Kat, to go to England for her sister's wedding. A romantic relationship develops between supposed clients and friends. But the conversation seemed deliberate and artificial. And there was not enough relationship between romantic spark and Nick and Kat. <br /> <br /> As an assistant, Amy Adams emphasized Kat's sister. When Amy appeared on the screen, it was a spark bulb and a catalyst for the film's energy. Perhaps if Amy Adams cast Kat's role, the movie might have a dash. But when this happened, instead of getting to Kleenex instead of looking for Visine, at least I wanted to have this feeling and real love.
