This is a bad movie in every way. We are convinced that knowing what happened in the last 12 years of the movie and sometimes it works. But new characters are not interesting. Baby Melody is awesome! Unfortunately, while man maintains logic that can not be flooded, other basic physical logics will not be ignored. It is cool if you are not wearing cold weather in the Arctic. I do not know why they say that the return rate of Jafar is worse, I think this is horrible.
