I remember watching ATTACK for the first time and finally caught it. The science fiction channel is worse, but not much more. In Jurassic Park, the shameless stumbling block, ATTACK replaces the dinosaur shoe shoe. And they are loose, swallowing as much as possible. CGI is pretty bad, and giant heads of prosthetic cats are not dark. We get a gore, which helps a little. Wait until you see how crazy scientist who started the whole mess. Robert Carradine has nothing to do with it. Apparently Fiji shot it. You can get a nice job. In the 80s and 90s, it reminds me of all the low-budget monster STVs.
