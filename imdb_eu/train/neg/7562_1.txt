I did not see the original, but I wanted to download this note to anyone who goes away: Wicker Man is the worst movie this year. Maybe in two years. I'd like to ask for my money for theater, or to turn myself back to see myself. <br /> <br /> I will give two positive disorders: CÃ¡rtar's character has lain at least laughing. In me and the beautiful landscape of the island. Sorry, that's it. Here are the jokes. The movie plot is only progressing, because the other characters will not give Cage a direct answer, and it does! It might have been a long way from my time (much less days in the movie) beyond me. <br /> <br /> The soil is full of holes. You are going through theater-based questions to fill out the library. Someone read this script and thought: "Yes, people would have to pay $ 11 that would look like this movie look" is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Do not go see this movie. Or rent on DVD too.
