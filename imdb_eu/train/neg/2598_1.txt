Even if there is a bad movie, there are usually some things that are sad, and that can be too dreadful, but this performance, or part of the script, or this special effect, this is just that great. The effect was fluttering, the script was horrible, in Tiffany's references. There was a lot of unhealthy comprehension and even special effects were harmful. It was a very bad movie and Drew Barrymore also erased the wishes of history. If you want to look: a) suffer from severe pain caused by oneself. b) See what a bad movie is. The film that can be used in this film is "just about ninety minutes of my life I will never return".
