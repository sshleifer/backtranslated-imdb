The Russian soldier warned that they had raped "drunken drunk", which is completely false. This movie is not for this reason. <br /> <br /> Also, as someone has stated, the KGB "Jews, Gypsies, etc." He had sued them "worse" than the Nazis. The KGB was called agents of the imperialist agent (KGB) called "him". This is quite different from the fact that the Jews are going to go to the whole nation, just like the Nazis did. Gypsies were never prosecuted. The KGB was a political instrument and was used politically, but from an international point of view. Communists did not really distinguish between nationalities. <br /> <br /> The whole movie has been considered a mistake. The main hero is not speaking in Russian. The signs in Berlin have typographical errors, the general KGBs are very fake. They are made up of those who are called "Russian proverbs" and they are still on the list. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended to watch; This film is full of lies and fake things. Go to "Good shepherdess".
