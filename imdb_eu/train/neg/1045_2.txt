Raising Victor Vargas is trying to overwhelm it: it's real. Unfortunately, there is no reality for this film. Characters and situations feel completely artificial and false. <br /> <br /> Reason? Bad management Peter Sollett uses his tools in the Arsenal for incorrect tools. It seems Sollett would not turn his movie somewhere with a real feel. Wrong! She gives her a bad feeling. Also, shaking your camera does not give your movie a document style, it gives the audience a headache and reduces the appearance of the screen. <br /> <br /> Of course, the screen is so painful. False, Mr. Sollett wrote his script for trying to find himself with Sundance friends and try to show him "sharp" filmmakers with him. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a permanent impression. This movie has left you the bad director of Sollett. Next, do some writers and conduct classes?
