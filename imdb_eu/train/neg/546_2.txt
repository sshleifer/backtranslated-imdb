These 2 points will offer Akshay Kumar's sensible performance. I know Bollywood films are not realistic, but Walt Disney production is more realistic than this plot. Dad dies and all parents do what he does ... his son will leave his son to his wife. Some things to swallow sorrow - 1. Priyanka's 'bedroom fresh indoor pools' and from where would they go to hang hungry hungry in the neighbor's garden ???????? 2. Suddenly Akshay worked as a stunt man, rabried dogs get bitten, then just walk off. This movie is our intellect is an INSULT. They helped me to see my "people" people who really believed in this movie, they left me with movies, I did not see it, I did not take my advice and did not 'drop'.
