If you hate redneck accents, you hate this movie. And to make it worse, you will see Patrick Swayze, who wants to be a puppy. I can not really accentuate the redneck. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was very good at Slingblade, but this movie was annoying. And what's the name of Lonnie Earl? How much more hickish can this movie have? The story was stupid. I am not usually condemned by these films, but I can not show this movie. If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, go see Slingblade. my granddaughter at Christmas Otherwise, I could not usually play strained reds or I was not Patrick Sway. Maybe Patrick Swayze was not there. I did not laugh at the movie anymore. Normally I'm laughed at something stupid. If someone showed them that they broke their toes, I might laugh. I accidentally break my head with people's fingers.
