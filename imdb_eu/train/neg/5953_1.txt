How has this piece of television survived? It's horrible Someone wants to shoot me. It's so fake that the 1950s is worse than a sci-fi movie. I prefer to see this nonsense. I remember when it first came out. I thought, well, that it might be interesting, then I learned that stupid madness was completely stupid. It was so bad that I got out of my pocket and brought my hand to the table. <br /> <br /> Please people, stop watching this and all other realities, they are nuts that block the networks. and create some thought that can stop canceling a quality program.
