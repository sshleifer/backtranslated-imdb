This animated film Inspector Gadget is pretty lame. The story is very weak and there are few activities. Most characters are given little to do anything. The movie is very entertaining, but it does not really go anywhere and the signs are watchable but it's just not the 80's animated television show's' quality is not a repeat watching film, at least in my mind.it only About 74 minutes including credit. Like a TV show, the characters are not worth the show here. You wanted to keep the snippet gadget up to date, but there, who looks after it? However, this is my opinion. Gadget's last case is disappointing 3/10
