After spending a lot of space in space, Krypton looks for the remains of the planet, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to the Earth. Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is married and has Richard White (James Marsden). In the meantime, he draws a nasty plan for Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey), stolen from the Solitude Fortress to create a new land using crystals and immerse himself in the US. <br /> <br /> Superman's superb films, unforgettable Christopher Reeve, or "Lois and Clark" (and Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville" television series, created Superman Bryan Singer's great expectations. Unfortunately, the story is awful long and boring, unnecessary, lacking emotions and overcoming the IMDb. Also, the love between Lois Lane and Superman is insolently ridiculous. Kate Bosworth is in a bad situation for the twenty-two year-old actor, who is a reporter for a five-year-old boy and mother. Brandon Routh is younger than two years old with Tom Welling, who plays a teenager at Clark Kent in "Smallville". Parker Posey's character, Kitty Kowalski, is a horrible caricature. Last but not least, although Lex Luthor is horrible, Kevin Spacey is fifty-five years old, so they are older and older than the lead. A polite result looks like a TV series and it's horrible. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
