In 1999 he will go through history as a year for film critics as a citizen. First, Eyes sent us WUT SHUT. Then BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA were the worst movie of the year. What is? Who knows everything She enjoys herself and has bad performances. I always like to see credits, but when I finished this I could not get a movie theater. Most of the public who participated in the exhibition was there in the same way. Dates were discussed together with even strangers. The ugly and hateful movie will be ugly and hateful.
