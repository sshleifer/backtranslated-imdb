Where do i start The movie started pretty well, but after 30 minutes, I got a watch. At the beginning of the film, it was a terrible horror but then the story came in. People were just a little overwhelmed and stupid. <br /> <br /> The actors performed an average performance in this movie, however, Vinny Jones is bored in the film, constantly breathing. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, and I gave it to the word, it dragged on, it got more and more. <br /> *** *** SPOILER ALERTA *** SPOILER ALERTA *** SPOILER ALERTA *** The movie could not go worse when I thought the monsters that look at the skeleton on the end of the load seemed to just not eat that. He had no sense. It was successful because it was a kind of worship and eventually the boys were dying. At the end he really laughed at me how bad it was. When he is led by Vinny Jones, he becomes a new killer. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film has looked like the best horror movie ever made. I gave him a star because he did a pretty good job, but he could not save a movie!
