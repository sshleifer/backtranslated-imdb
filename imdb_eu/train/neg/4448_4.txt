What is it about when a movie opens when Julia Roberts' character faces Mrs Patrick Bergin's abusive and anal sex husband and I was ready to be a great movie like Farrac Fawcett's The Burning Bed. Well, according to the summary, I was mis-lead. This movie was similar to Burning Bed, he had power and Farrah was a part of a woman that really felt, and felt his pain and survival. Asleep with the enemy, after the first action, Roberts was able to escape from his death and became the first act to escape with his husband and live in Iowa. Initially, his wife believes that he is dead, but they are suspicious that they will still be alive and start after him. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and a mouse playing in the little town of Julia, getting home from the Iowa house and changing its personality ... it's known how to make money, but I did not like it at this time. He knows the guy (Nice Wimpy Mr.) and falls to him and his husband finally plays for himself, but he does not re-organize the soup bowls and direct the kitchen. This I think gives audiences a cheap emotion. But I do not like much abuse, because I have already said that the movie has deceived the audience. If he had stopped, he had felt before his situation and his situation. Without a doubt, her husband has died and everything is fine Mrs. Roberts. If the real world happens if something like this happens ... See Burning Bed and understand what a movie is like to be a matter of domestic abuse.
