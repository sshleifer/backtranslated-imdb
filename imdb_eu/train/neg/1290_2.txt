This film was a horrible two and a half hours. Did someone please tell me what was it? <br /> <br /> I mean, I understand the historical context. Missouri-Kansas is a group of confederate terrorist (terrorist) group of confederate boundaries, taking revenge against US sponsors and abolitionists in the US Civil War. But in addition to violence, there were not many points for this film. Perhaps it was a political declaration? Is the war much more than just a violent crime? If this was done quite well, but I did not think it was that. I think that the producers think that they were doing the movie they deserve, but when I was worried there was no plot. It seems to me that I was seeing a paperback novel, as you would see in the covers of the novels. <br /> <br /> This movie is supposed to be burned with these gangs. torched!
