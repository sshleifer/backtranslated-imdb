At the school he saw this and it was horrible. Movie obsolete The episodes make them confusing, with the story of fiction more interesting. The teachers talked about it, but it was really boring. I read that few people appear as agents, but most of them do what they do in real life. This works very often. In addition, often the story becomes very bloody and scarce. I do not like how some of the lines are written and what they want is more meaningful. Although educator, funny, suspicious, and silent hip was written, it was boring, dry, scarce and old. I hope that no one takes the time to watch this movie because you do not see it well.
