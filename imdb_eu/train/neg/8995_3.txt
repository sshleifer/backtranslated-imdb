I lost it early, but I've seen most. A friend has been picked up on the DVD at a cheap FYE room. <br /> <br /> Skits are very short, but most of them are still too long. Mostly, it seems to have forgotten something fun! Very funny racist / sexist / "homophobic", based on stereotypes or topics that use racist terms for people. , and I have problems ... The logo of the Tunnel Vision network is a lipsticked eye. The mouth opens from the eyes and is covered as eyes. Shameless <br /> <br /> What a despair. Most actors were better things, and that fortunate bomb was not thrown back.
