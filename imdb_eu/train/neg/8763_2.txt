I thought I read that it was the last time Monogram was produced, but that's not true, it does not matter, except it should be. John Carradin is a deadly illness that kills his hair, the youngest scientist in gray hair (Robert Shayne) is experimenting with the help of livelihoods. Every time they are revived, they seem to have a marble face, because they are tight in marble, it is tightened at the lab table (big deal). Carradine regained his faithful dog after his death, and mutt recaptures unusual ability in mood across the walls as a fantasy (wooooooooohhhh). It's about what he wrote. <br /> <br /> To get a fast ultra fast monogram, this thing uses at least one fancy-schmancy lab configuration that is usually provided. The funniest running of the movie mentions Dr. Carradine as "the" old "Shayne" "young" assistant "when he is 40, Carradin was 40 and Shayne was 45!
