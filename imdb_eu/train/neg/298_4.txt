Daraar started quite well. The first scene left me on the edge of my seat, asking what would happen next. In addition, the first half of the movie is BORE. In the first part of the film Rishi Kapoor is in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, are not you a bit old? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < and what am I lunatic! It was over-protective and incredibly plump, with cold temperatures! He did not even hit the poor Juhi! One of the reasons I am not pleased about this movie is that Juhi (my favorite actor) has not seen why they abuse me. This movie, in general, has excessive abuse and blood spills; It seems so bad to me! <br /> <br /> Denaar, if you're thinking of renting Daraar, you should find everything you're trying to say, go back and select something else!
