Where do you start out as bad as this movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> Do you refer to some popular heroes? Everyone's top-of-top? Great script <br /> <br /> No. Everyone who pays money should say that anyone who watches it as bad as a movie. I know For the empire customers (a bad sign when there is a bad preview when a copy is not available for the bad movie quality). However, filmmakers should really think about giving out refunds if they did not please the customer's finished product. <br /> <br /> I went three days after opening with two other friends. The only other person in film was his block. <br /> <br /> And that was a cheap night. <br /> <br /> The advertisement campaign failed incorrectly or spread in most words. That's why it's that. <br /> <br /> I have not felt so short since I saw the movie from The Avengers (1998). If the video clip is rounded off for a few months, make sure that you are paying for the electricity bill. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald deserves a reward, not cracked or routine; Keith Allen maintains dignity in the midst of filmmaking; Barry Foster's performance was arrested, after Rhys Ifans succeeded in winning Notting Hill's career, and only Dani Behr was pleasantly secretive as a secretary. <br /> <br /> Note, considering that it was in The Word. Audiences have hoped for the ability of actor-actors to be relatively small from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are not bad, of course, the budget is limited, but this script is very late. . If you want to hear a series of strange characters say "Fak!" For two hours, you should go straight to the street. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bargepoles are required. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
