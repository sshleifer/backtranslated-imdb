As mentioned by other reviewers, I'd like to know what the moron script reads and I'll go ', "Yes! That's right! This is the next movie!" And who is that, he should look at the actual activity of the brain. Those who are really responsible for dinging money by reading the handwriting handwriting, well, I would like to give you my email and you might just want to give up more money. The movie is all atrocious in every way. <br /> <br /> Wayans are fun, at least they can be. They have done good movies and have some fun. But here, the premise is not to challenge all the logics, not only the horror of the theater, not only the whole movie is offensive from beginning to end, not only because you find yourself as an amateur, but really want to pay for this movie. Maybe it would be free ... I would, it would be a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would like to write so much detailed review of why this movie is very bad. It's enough to leave my summary speech. This is the smallest common name for short films and is as unfamiliar with a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 0 / 10..this is the list of the worst films in all time!
