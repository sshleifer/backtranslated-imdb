Nicholas Walker is Paul, a town in Reverand, married to Marthar (Ally Sheedy), but is also a regular mummy and decides to make his death to escape with a current affair, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However, it gets amnesia (hence, the movie name). Sally Kirkland, too, is "generous nightmare" thinking of good Reverand in "Misery" ways. It's sad to see a pretty cast like that wasted like that. John Savage is not an unforgettable role as a minimal private investigation. In a movie written in "Black comedy", two elements must be taken in this film. The first one is double, but unfortunately it is not one of them. Also, you can not emphasize the characters, so you do not have any interest. Technically not a completely bad film, very forgotten. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich does not turn; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin <br /> <br /> My Grade: C- <br /> <br /> Where did I see it: Showtime Showcase?
