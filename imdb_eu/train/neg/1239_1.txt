As a fan of the "other" APES of the movie APES, I rented this DVD, despite everything worried about Tim Burton. Once again, he does not disappoint his alleged leadership. Although monkeys' makeup is secondary, this is undeniable considering the tremendous budgets of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg repeatedly proves that he is not an actor (unless BOOGIE NIGHTS proved to be). I was ashamed of the great talents like Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. Without a doubt, their types of payment was motivated, they could be a fake dumb script. I rented this DVD for a special $ 1 a night and I still rip it.
