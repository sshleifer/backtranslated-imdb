An amazing plot! ;) I have seen fewer plots (I do not mention Asian movies but ...). The camera was not bad, such as an inexpensive movie, and it was not a bad night. There is no reason for most people doing things and how they react to what happens. Although I think there has been a lot of movies, in this case, it was horrible, of course. <br /> <br /> It ripped up so many rugged movies for single scenes. The play was awful, but I've seen it worse. The movie was bad, but I've seen it worse. Watching this movie is one of the low levels of boredom, horror, death, sadism, oracle and entertainment. <br /> <br /> So, if you like whites with white, you're the perfect film. . <br /> <br /> I gave it 3/10, it can be entertaining if you do not expect to see a good movie and you're a good mood.
