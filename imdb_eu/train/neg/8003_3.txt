Do not be fooled by the 'bright' opinions mentioned in the DVD box. "It's very entertaining," "terribly frightening," and the worst of all, "PAR YOURSELF". This movie is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Normally I'm not writing bad reviews about writing movies, but I can not believe it in a convenient 7 on the IMDb. <br /> <br /> It's not worth it. <br /> <br /> A monster that was caused by a day-to-day attack, what else, scientists had laughed down on lazy people, this movie goes pretty far and goes there sloooowlyly. Basically and unstable, a girl takes away monsters (I'll give them a good design creature, but this is not a WETA creation) and their semi-comedian family spend about an hour and a half. ... There are sewers around the river. The search does not contain suspensions, does it mean that someone has paired with Jaws again? -You realize that they are in a completely absurd time. In addition, a large part of the film is committed to the quarantine of the government, finished in a fun scene that was silent in front of a large bus station. <br /> <br /> Blech. This was a bad thing. I'm not joking. Do you want to see a rotten monster movie? Rent Deep Rising. You'll save at least 30 minutes of your life.
