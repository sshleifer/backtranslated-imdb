This movie was a bad thing, there was nothing interesting. It was a remake, but not once again. I was very disappointed, considering Tim Burton's tools. He has made use of makeup and CGI and a lot of money ($ 100 million) but, honestly, we say that we achieved less than $ 6 million in the original movie? No heck So, in that sense, the movie fails. <br /> <br /> At least in the original film, the state of freedom was a moving scene, but in this movie there was nothing terrific because you could see the final scene. coming out And, in a way, if you think, and I did it, you can figure out how it will end. I just wanted to get back the time I thought about it. <br /> <br /> This film would be brilliant and fun if the first line of the film was behind it and "Under the planet the planet" Apes. "Here's how I wanted to write: <br /> <br /> An astronaut ( it should be more than Marky Mark, because there is not enough good care of a movie, so I would put three men) that it was on the ground that they would think it would be another planet, to be found by humans (not mute), a monkey-led city, Friends who made good friends found themselves on the ground to find the destruction of debris destroyed. When crazy human beings live beneath the earth, war breaks between mutants and monkeys, and then ... well, let your imagination get disturbed as you end up. <br /> <br /> But I think this movie could have a lot more. Unfortunately, Tim Burton knows something good to sink. Consider what he did in the Batman series. The penny is rotten around what people think. It's fun, well-thinking goes. Sorry, but not. If someone else made this film, it would be much better and it would be much more encouraging.
