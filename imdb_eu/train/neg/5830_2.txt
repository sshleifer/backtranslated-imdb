Drawing Appendix 9. dir: Matthew Barney. <br /> <br /> How do you know when art is in the midst of a pretentious movie? There are eight interview lines in 140 minutes of the movie? Is it dressed in a pseudo-Asian ritual when wearing a Bjork dressed up like a giant dry pita? The ghost holes and spinal columns may be used in a whale-manta experiment. Or, at the same time, when you are ready to kill Philip Glass's minimal and still annoying version of the score? In any case, Drawing Restraint 9 is among the many films of modern art. In 135 minutes, he adds his need to make it start to get boring. I called the use of amazing colors and the beginning sequence, but the rest of the films were filmed for the Discovery Channel documentary. This is trying to shoot P-ss Christ's version, but it will come later. <br /> <br /> Actually, the pieces of the documentary skiing were the best part of it. The surface plots are about whale vessels, and then there is a ritual for whaling. Later, guests of Bjork and Matthew Barney are welcomed by a ritual of humiliation that is welcomed on board, head shaving (thoughts), nicotine patches and beetroot. . Then, with each other, evisceration, cannibalism and not forget the giant. Matthew Barney wrote the "relationship between self-imposed resistance and creativity". This is almost saying, "If you do not get it, then you are not creative in your interpretation, and therefore I am a young artist." Oh, wait, this is the interpretation of the POST and the POST-modern movie of this phrase. But he wants to be a supposed modern art. What is it about art? <br /> <br /> So, to start the whole bit of interpretation, right? The following lines are 3/4 very serious and should not be taken as a realistic attempt to interpret the movie. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is pearl diving and the construction of a giant road. It is clear that the ramp expresses the urgent necessity in love, and the pearl divers find pearls of food. Then, in the whale's ship, they build a ship that looks like a whale. A predefined raw element. <br /> <br /> On the boat, the whale fats take place inside the whale's shape and extract some birds. They represent the spinal column and then the giant turd. These are the situations of the movie itself. This fat is entertaining but bad for you. When the spinal column is part of the "important" part of the movie or somehow it's a backbone. Then the giant turd is in the middle of the film, or when the movie is empty. <br /> <br /> Bjork and Matthew Barney go to other ships, which are also promoted to strangers. NOT SYMMETRICAL, they think money is money and Barney was trying to burn. So they put their head on the patch. They make a ritual and learn about the Japanese scholar about the ship, when he says that the ship is being robbed of a boat by another vessel; crash or intersection, if desired. This means that Bjork and Barney, when they are different from the outside, inspire one another to cut their legs and eat them so that whales can become the same and have the same person. They join together. Oh, do I forget that Robbie Williams has made a video? Then, the pearl divers have come back full of puzzles to make a stupid diagram filled with mouth. Barney got to the level 8 geometry, of course. Or, perhaps, at least some social studies. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I forgot Bjork's ear? Sometimes it's hypnotic, but sometimes you just want to kill. <br /> <br /> An art film is a thing, but you just throw all kinds of symbolism in hopes of getting people out of the reaction. , the joke becomes self-destructive. When do you cross the line between being art jokingly? Dali and Bunuel made surrealistic nonsense and were more coherent and / or entertaining than trash. One Chien Andalou had less than half an hour of accumulation of as much simplicity as possible. <br /> <br /> So I can not recommend this one? ARTICLES OF ANCIENT FILM ONLY, just like you are a symbolism and a flat image. <br /> <br /> D +
