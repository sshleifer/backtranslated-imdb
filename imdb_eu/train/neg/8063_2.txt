I planned this year's different types of Sci-Fi and Thriller this summer, but I was so disappointed about this specific movie. While some people quit the movie, I decided to stay away from it, just like laughing at the theater's other filmmakers, a suspense, a ridiculous ending and a story line difficult. I was confused as the main character of the movie. The only free quality of the movie was the soundtrack. This is one of those amazing star films that will later regret. With retrospect, I did not rent it, and I paid less than $ 5.
