Crispin Glover's "What is it?" I saw. Ann Arbor Festival. In fact, the movie was nominally at least well-known, because the author / director of the brilliant sense did not respond. In the subsequent quizzes and response session, Mr. Glover said the film was originally intended to show off a short film for the use of low-level movie actors. However, the reason for creating a movie is not enough. The actors think that they are broader views. Higher views, at best, were in a bad state and in the worst they seemed absent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Also, he said he wanted to address taboo issues. Well, that does. But why? It seems that the film has no reason to correct any attitude. Does the taboo feel like you do not have taboos? The film does not give any of this. Tabua is not very interesting for any reason. He can not even care for the taboo at all levels, either disturbing or passionate. <br /> <br /> For a moment, ignoring the problems of the concept, what was most surprising was how bad the movie was. Editing, cinematography and other technical aspects frequently appeared to be very amateurs. Glover added 125 to 150 thousand dollars to the movie, and I think that money should be spent on different designers (Glover made some designs, I know I've seen at least a sound design in credits). Painted sets are fine (not very good), but poorly used. Pieces feel like a photography theater play. That would be fine if it happened with this purpose, but Glover felt a gap. The other parts are shot like a kind of home theater, because first-rate filmmakers have a good deal of quality with many things that they do in iMovie. <br /> <br /> Maybe "What is it?" It's the main problem. I do not understand what film to take seriously. There are a few things that you think about Glover. At other points, it seems in his little joke. Perhaps he was somewhat ironic or meaningful, but I felt that Glover could not get much attention to his film. <br /> <br /> He said Glover originally wanted to. It's a short film. If it were only Sixty-two minutes later, the film's images and ideas last for twenty years, and it is arguable that these ideas are said to have been in this period of time.
