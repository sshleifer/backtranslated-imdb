We saw it in Hulu (too many ads!), So it was paused, but it was still like the early movie of the sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis play Jerry Lewis in two parts. When I was in India, I'd like to protest the portrayal of all men and women as musicians. Western music video clips were deceived and used by many western models to make them feel like men, and so I enjoy a lot of Indian movies, but they were much more disappointing, especially modern Indian movies. The story does not happen in India (Uncle Mac continues saying it's back to India), but I can not know where it happens.
