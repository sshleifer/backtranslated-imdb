Bad Laurel and Hardy are not better than Bad Laurel and Hardy, but I think almost. Sadly, Fox gets a great deal of DVD on the DVD, people who do not know L & H know more about their classical outfits. <br /> <br /> Once again the boys are saddled. invisible rays with a mute romantic plot on a guy who has a guy. He has fallen in love with the Daughter of the Blessed, who hates and the guy. It is incredible that Fox thinks that L & H believes they are necessary in their films. <br /> <br /> Without guinea pigs, the boys seem old and fatigued. The only scene that works in these photos is that night-time nightmakers are trying to get out of the window and stole Robert Mitchum's strange scene, because of being a bad guy, Oliver Hardy tries to sell "insurance". <. br /> <br /> Otherwise, this script is empty. Forget and see "A Chump Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Sons of the Desert".
