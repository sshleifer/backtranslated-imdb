I'm a fan of Steven Seagal. Hell, I probably weigh as much as he does, even though I do not have a funny sneakers on the street-sailor-ponytail hair sport. After showing my affliction and love on the American scene and the favorite screen hero, I must admit that it has been the worst film in my heart. I am not sure that this movie can do less than that. <br /> <br /> In his defense, the main problems of this film appear to be post-production. It's clear that this movie is another story. As a result, Steve's voice is not synchronized with the almost dubbed voice. The edition is sneaky and, in general, it starts bad, it gets even worse and, in the end, you want to upgrade Da Vinci Code. Yes, it's very bad. <br /> <br /> After that I do not know what to expect from Steve. My friends still laugh at listening to their CDs. Do I have time to watch directly from Van Damme's DVD records? If you are tempted to watch this movie, rip your eyes and clean it in the toilet. A dark life is better than 89 minutes.
