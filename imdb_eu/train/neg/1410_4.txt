A famous but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) has not shot for four years. When invited to participate in a new project, he asks the director's cousin to investigate the work of a small supermarket director in a poor latin district of Carlson. Scarlet (Paz Vega) sees the beautiful ATM and attracts its ability. His driver never returns to catch him and gives a walk to the actor Scarlet. But, first of all, he has a conversation with the secretary's office in a construction company and helps prepare the actors; Then they spend the afternoon together pleasantly in time. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, the significant "10 elements or less" is a disappointment. This low-budget movie does not look like a storyline, and Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega support chemistry and improvisation and nothing happens for about 82 minutes. The ambiguous open conclusion is ridiculous, so Morgan Freeman's character returned to his world of silver spoon and told his simple staff they had never seen each other again. He was afraid of his love and his perfect world to be destroyed with his family? Or was it a collision between classes, and realized that his wonderful neighborhood was not suitable for a simple working class in the lower classes? My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Astro em Minha Vida" ("One star in my life")
