Oh dear. This movie could be under the title "When the writers strike me!" What a stinker I had great expectations of this, especially after reading the reviews in the IMDb, which questions the entire classification system of the IMDb, but this is another issue. I loved Steve Carrell, Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, The Office, etc., so I expected great things. That explanation of that year was felt badly. There are so many things that are wrong in this movie, but I'll limit myself to (a) impossible for any of these people's families (aerobics mass training, what on earth in real life?), Rough script (Killer of Love? Please), and asks Dan, a character that is so unknown Do you say what she saw to be able to fall in love with her? This movie with a loud conversation, crisp direction, covered with hilarious plays, slow, sluggish and sluggish. After about half an hour, we would not have been with my parents, we did not expel them much, and we did not lose money. Unlike the makers of this movie, it would be better for him if he could throw away all the money he had made. That would be more entertaining. If you like cinema, avoid this like plague.
