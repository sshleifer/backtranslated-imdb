When I watched this movie in the theater, I always remembered the great first film that I had experienced with a good commercial movie. It was a great commercial, but later I discovered that all the movies (around 4) had an explosion or "special effect" and some were not in the movie. There was a plot about aliens, but I never showed them to the movies, as far as I remember. It was clear that someone who removed me from a cheap movie designed to make a scam. I think my innocent world ended that day when I found out bad people who did bad films.
