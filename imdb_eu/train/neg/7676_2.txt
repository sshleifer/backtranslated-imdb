I was honestly surprised Alone in the Dark. It was so bad, I hardly could not believe what I see. There are no characters, there are only some stereotypes and they die. The character of each person's development depends on the name and occupation of each character, and it's about it. There is no real plot, and no character seemed to have any motive. In fact, multiple action scenes started on their own, nowhere, with a techno music track. While I was watching this movie I asked: "Where does that happen? What's up?" The play was a high school drama quality, with rigorous wooden delivery, as the actors were reading from the cue, without understanding the lines. The lines that delivered their problems even became even more evident when it came to sound design. ADR was engraved like an open room. The actors were constantly taking care to hit their brands, almost looking at the robotic movement. Thus, these non-automated lists can create fake and confusing scenarios, often without the need for transition scenes. They were here, they are now. This happened, what is happening now. Random scene with rhyme or small reason. I was happy to see No doubt it's worth nine dollars.
