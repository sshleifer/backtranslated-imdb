This movie was something I expected, not very good, but not so bad. In my opinion PG13 movies are not so scary, that's why I'm sure I'll get bored in the whole movie. We're sure of the terrifying things in the hotel room, but we have not seen anything. I think I did not like the birds and I thought it was too many times. It was old and repetitive. Also, I did not understand that all the things that Cusack lived in the room were real or not. There were no events to come. He drags the movie and wants to move forward when he finishes, because you're still waiting for someone to say about the movie. I liked the special effects. In addition, it's not so much to delight. Maybe it's just for me, but I thought that was below the average.
