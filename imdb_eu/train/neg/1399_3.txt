Oh, what a scary Sci-Fi BORING Scorpion movie! Especially wonderful because the inauguration was about 15 minutes ago because it was a great and very beneficial action! During the introduction, we continue with a series of nervous safety officers and male men hired men, escaping from a mysterious laboratory with a top-secret file bag. To execute the incredible and inhumane events that occur in the laboratory, it has run. Figures ?? Since then, the "action" moves between two locations, the laboratory and the supposed rural house (or something) of the said laboratory and it is soon clear that the experiments are really disturbing. More dull, nonsense and fuzzy. Scientists chose randomly four people without living relatives, and it really really is really true if they talk about truth, but a giant machine reads the content of their minds. They hide all dark secrets for their past, and people reveal it when it is revealed; However, I fail that tests can cause humanity's threat device. Maybe I missed something, but I doubt it. The interaction between patients and physicians is even less interesting, since there is no one at all. So basically, "The Brain Machine" is just about handling a bundle of bouquets immensely decorated in a room. The movie could be half an hour even shorter, if not a MULTIMEDIA of the building's race! Recovery from the laboratories to the villa and vice versa is done through a single five-second period each time. The makers really needed the padding or assuming that all Sci-Fi viewers could not change their locations. It seems to me that, facing a pool behind a palace ten minutes below ten minutes, I'm sure. James Best's mindful mental behavior is as reverend, but a man can certainly not save that thing without losing time. Avoid!
