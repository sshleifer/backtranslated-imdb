An awesome amateur film director (not Todd Sheets), his new friends and sisters explore a cave. Friends and sisters fall and are saved. In the meantime, a group of innocent girls are defending their "herbs". It means whatever Heck is. This movie and the use of IRABAZI is so bad ... it's really bad. Pain is painful, sad "action". Now, I've seen some terrifying terrifying "horror" of my time and I've failed to see low budget movies, but I still cry for anyone who wants to sit through it. YOUR COMPARISON, but the rest runs away FAST! <br /> <br /> My Rating: F
