Although I watched the "Gymkata" in a joint manner, in the 85th, I could not remember the earthquakes, except for the faint figure of Kurt Thomas, who struggled with the backdrop of the walls and worried about the end. > <br /> After reading other reviews, I recently received a copy of the recently released DVD to enter the Gymkata world again. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films created in these films. In the 80's they would go straight to the video. The film has Kurt Thomas as the gymnast champion Jonathan Cabot, who has been awarded the "Parmistan" national team and has won the "Game", sponsored by Khan. "Yak Power". The purpose of the mission is the Star Wars defense system. Jonathan Rubali never spoke or left the house to train in martial arts. She tries to mix with native training wearing a bright red sweater with blue and white browns. No need to say, Cabot will fight for himself and his life on the stone streets of Parmist, to get a date with fate and fight the game. <br /> <br /> Robert Izar, Robert, served Robert. Clouse, who looked like he was never there. This script is not trivial. See all new reviews reviews. The guilty people have good moments, but they eventually edit it. Finish ... meh However, there is a germ of good adventure action. A Hong Kong version can be a bit faster and faster and can be quite good.
