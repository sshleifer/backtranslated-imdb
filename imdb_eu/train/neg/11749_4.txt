Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films, where humor is more than mere nonsense <br/> <br /> <br /> At the beginning it was very funny and funny, but as the movie progressed, I did not move forward. find jokes or a more entertaining curiosity. <br /> <br /> It's a low-budget movie (it's never a problem in itself), there were some interesting characters, but eventually I lost interest. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is calling the receiver that is currently participating. <br /> <br /> Something similar, but better try "the brother of another planet"
