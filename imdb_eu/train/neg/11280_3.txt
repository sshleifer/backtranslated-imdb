This film makes a man's life bad. His business fails, and he can not avoid wives despite numerous attempts. <br /> <br /> The whole earth is chaos. It just does not make sense. In fact, there is nothing in the film. The story is so badly said, I just can not understand. It's a shame because the sets and the costumes are fine and the visual stimulants are enough. The plan is very well made in the whole movie. However, these confirmation functions can still not tell a bad plot and a poor story. I mentioned the names that were agreed upon out of this movie. It's a waste of their talents. This movie is very bad. Avoid it !!
