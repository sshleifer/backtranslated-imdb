Now I like science-fiction cartoons. However, in 2006, when I saw "Robotboy" appearing in Canada, I saw the premiere and I was unexpectedly surprised. Characters are general and stereotypical (African-American men have to wear tiger-striped clothes and talk with Jamacian's accent, why do all the Asian characters have yellow and fast? She has to be frozen and breastfeeding and constantly complain?) Realistic, predictable things They become raw and sometimes disturbing. There are even more resemblances to Astro Boy. Leave me an explanation (youth names dub): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay, etc. "My Life A Teenage Robot A", "Star Wars", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Kamen Riders", "Sailor Moon" and short collaborations. they're doing it Without mentioning numerous racial / gender stereotypes. Do not get started with anyone. On the other hand, I say they are hidden and quite dirty. But seriously Do not try to see this. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
