Drugs prevent this drug from making drugs. I was ready to start using them, I waited for something to happen and never did anything. This movie is not horror or drama. It's just the paranoid of the user's methods. This movie may be so many times useless as the word "F". It was not well understood, but I felt like they did with Meth, someone owed them to replace them. Hector got worse and more paranoid as the movie progresses and the girl gets more disappointed. The end does not make sense. The film does not make sense to show that there is nothing in the midst of annoying things in a house in a house. I had other comments when I decided to watch this movie and the rating for this movie was a bit lower.
