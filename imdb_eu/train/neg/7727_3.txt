I'm making comments about this ministry from the point of reading a novel. From this point of view, I can say the truth, though it's nice, why we do not just forward it. Specifically, this mini has some serious problems, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) It's terribly confusing. The actors who played the younger generations were 15 or 20 years older than the characters. Ali McGraw (at that time 45) played Natalie Jastrow at the age of 26. Jan-Michael Vincent (at the time 39) was Byron Henry, who was 22. Other Henry children, and Pamela Tudsbury. , the old actors also played for the characters that were to be in the 20s. <br /> <br /> 2) Some operations were absolutely horrible. Ali McGraw made almost mini. I've seen more robust performances of credible students. <br /> <br /> 3) Management was inadequate. To be correct with Ali McGraw, bad performance and character development were probably directed. Hitler's portrait was in a bad way. His character was like a nasty cartoon, sometimes charismatic, sometimes charming, but he painted the diabolian genius of Herman Wouk in the novel. Other characters make stereotyped (Berel Jastrow). They do not get the depth of the character that Wouk has created. 4) This mini is very dated. Wonderful music, a flawless narrative (a resemblance to the narrative of the history of secondary school), and in all mini-hours, the feeling of mini-pain was almost comical. Byron and Natali are often dressed up and in 1979 they look like they might look like in 1939. <br /> <br /> This looks at someone who can not read the novel without being the first, he probably does not sit on the seat. At the end of the 70s / early 80s, I would "seriously take it" because it would come as a dramatic soap, rather than a modern American television version of the classic. <br /> <br /> Older movies and the like are sometimes badly executed, but possibly in these cases a creative and inspired director can produce very stunning, memorable and critical sound. I have never seen a remake that is seen should not take place long (15 hours) or longer, and if we do not pay much attention to most of America's current viewers, it would not fly.
