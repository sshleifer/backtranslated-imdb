"Can it be a great documentary everything"? Yes, the head is silent and blind. Everything is meaning, intelligence, visual style and just a matter of interest. Besides. . . <br /> <br /> Really, please. This is a completely authentic movie. An adventure adventure document, a war doctor doctor, with a pure spirit. It does not mean anything, it does not feel anything and carries an implicit message. Not surprisingly a lot of IMDb fans! Of course, if you know of a movie that is protagonist of Skip Lipman, it does not recognize culture, intelligence, no intelligence (no more than an intricate corrosion of adolescents) and an unknown human emotion? adrenaline "Darkon" is not a movie - it's a terror attack! Avoid. There are too many real documentaries and they live little time in toilet waste such as "Darkon".
