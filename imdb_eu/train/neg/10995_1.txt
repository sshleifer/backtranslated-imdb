Anyone who has seen at Comedy Central at midnight in the last few years has probably seen ads for this movie. In 2001 I saw advertisements for this movie. It seemed fun to me, but I did not want to call my phone on the TV screen and could not wait to watch the movie for the first time. I should wait until I had rented the movie at Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> About a year and a half later, I was in Tower Records and I was less than "DVDS $ 20". A copy of this movie. The DVD was just 6.99 dollars when I decided to buy it. When I got home, I put the record into a DVD player, and I laughed a bit ... and I waited for more. The laughter never came. <br /> <br /> I would agree with almost any other comments on this page saying that this movie was horrible. The UNDERGROUND COMEDY MOVIE is an atrocious piece of garbage, unintentional and poorly written and directed, and in my opinion, it is the worst movie of all time. There's no star
