By defeating the wicked king, the story of a sword and horrors of a hateful and rude "hero" serves almost every detail. The play is horrible from roles contributors. The glee goering with the blood of the heroine that shows the director is totally annoying; It is not given by justice to justice, as bad as the people that fight it. There is a huge edition of the Z-movie, including a scene that says a character "very". Very clearly missed a totally lost sword! <br /> <br /> The film clearly plays the role of Barbi Benton and the female directors. Work Clarkson, who is naked throughout the movie. Like 20 men, I do not intend not to attract women's flesh on the screen. But the treatment of their characters is so degrading and sex scenes are so cheerful and cheerful, I can not even enjoy that movie aspect. <br /> <br /> Most of the time movies are exchanged for at least exchange, heartfelt, feeling in cheeks (the fight is better in that), but DEATHSTALKER seems to be seriously considered as a heroic fantasy. In no case! Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Rating: ******.
