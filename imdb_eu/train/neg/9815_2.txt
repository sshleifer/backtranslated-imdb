This movie presents somehow the original idea, but later it was a great frustration. What is the beginning of the movie, click on the rest of the movies to avoid a plot? The movie itself is incredible. Do I want to know if someone exactly goes to the clinic, gets a nurse outfit, kills a doctor, lets the Chevy pickup and leaves get out of the patient's bed? I think that nobody can answer this question; so the other scene jumped up by hiding these other details. The performances are bad. The evil is just another "mad madness", not a depth, a completely linear nature. After a 20-minute movie, most of the scenes are incredible, because they did not seem to be just for those 90 minutes. A doctor sees a woman with a strong medicine, does she refuse to study it, throwing it away from home and silent? The final scene exploded, Mickey Mouse could only do more with the reality. I've given 10 times to say 10-minute movie.
