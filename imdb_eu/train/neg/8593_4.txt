Well, I finally saw. I did not go out the first time, then I was afraid of the truth. It may be scary, or shameful. Although not as bad as mine, and better than Clones, it was not particularly memorable or satisfying. <br /> <br /> At 11 years old when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. Until the last credits from the openings, I will never forget the movie experience. He is a story of a bored farm boy, who wished to know more about saving the princess and Galaxy from the evil rescue while wise servants, while harsh pirates and comic reliefs - all in one space - operate setting. <br /> <br /> And that's not Lucas's punishment for using an old formula. It's an old function that works. And in his opinion, he gave a great deal of importance to the new rounds. <br /> <br /> Then the Empire came and the story was more than a fairy tale. Darkness came into the picture and we learned one of the greatest films of all time. Mr. Vader's father was a great wicked man. Wow, nobody saw coming. Of course, I'm sure Lucas did not see it until he appeared in the script. Go back and watch again Star Wars. Knowing what you know now, especially in the first three sections. See if he has this message. <br /> <br /> What I have about the problem. Revenge is a fun movie - a tremendous effect, a lot of action, good fighting scenes. But the film still lives or dies in its plot - it tells the story. Oh, no doubt, good performance can save a weak plot, but with a bad performance, with a bad performance - this is not a charge that can be overcome by a director, it's definitely not as bad as George Lucas is the one I realize (that man has Liam Neeson He managed to direct some of the worst performances by some of Natalie Portman and Samuel Jackson's best actors. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS AHEAD ******* * Plotter. Understand, in the first two films It's a huge burden, it's a huge burden, the rest is too much. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, we have specific background absurdities, we find Anakin's children, Tatooine's children, is the result of the Virgin's birth of the miracle " choose. "This detail is not remotely explained, because the closest description is that Yoda's watching is wrong. Well, well, our mistake. <br /> <br /> Now, this local friend is a C3PO creator. Hey, which is by chance it's tea And will he return to Tatoo and never know where he is? Wow! And about it. In which he was proving an unbelievable old suspension, not George? However, this young child, we have a humorous, curious, dreadful adult, somehow one of the greatest criminals in the history of film - the great tragedy of Darth Vador - a good man who is only a mere grace, who only ends up. amortization eventually <br /> <br /> How, pray, do you say that happens? Why do you dream that your wife will die in childbirth. Now, surely, we live in a civilization that lives inside the star just like what we treat gasoline, but it may happen that maybe the "dark creature" could affect the doctor, maybe this futuristic society could do something about this problem? Why, not, the only thing that can be done is to kill some children, because it is a bad boy in the roots of the evil they are looking for in the two movies, he says he has immortality. <br /> <br /> Well, of course. Sheesh <br /> <br /> Sheesh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How does Lucas expect such stupidity to be moved and moved? How can we expect someone to take care of? Hell, why would they want to save it first or save that exchange. I wanted to kill Kenobi, it was not bad, but because it was pathetically stupid. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, Amidala eventually dies. At birth Why? They do not know The doctor, who demonstrates a high technology of droid and society himself, offers only one "loss of life". Well, oh, well, of course. Perhaps, in the end, he was very kind to sleep. <br /> <br /> But here we are. All this is Kenobi's presence. Luke and Leia are born. She knows what her father knows and knows. He also knows the role of R2 and C3PO. However, for several years, Luke appears as man approaches and 3PO and R2 (curiously, it's deleted from 3PO but not R2 - why?), "I think these droids are yours," Kenobi. Who knows that the Droid protocol was "chosen" and built by the Emperor himself, and that only happened on the planet, says "strange, I do not remember any owner. droids." <br /> <br /> Oh, good pain. <br /> <br /> Lucas just did it as he moved forward. Once VAder Luke's father was involved, unfortunately, the story started under control twice, NOT DID. Chart of 1-3 chapters is incomprehensible. Nothing Palpatine made of rational senses. And that's not really the story linking Star Wars to the story. <br /> <br /> It's a thought and looks. <br /> <br /> I can not give this movie a high score. Triple X reminds me. An entertaining movie to watch, but totally ignored. Star Wars will be for me forever. Fortunately, that is, and the predecessors, they soon disappear.
