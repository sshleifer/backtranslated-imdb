- She has a miner spoiler - <br /> <br /> I've seen some indie horror films, such as The Hamiltons, The Boys Love Mandy Lane and Cabin Fever; Unfortunately, with five eyes with Across the Eye I do not fit into this category. From the beginning to the end of the movie from a generous script, the goddess understands why writers (writers) talked about why he thought "Do not go out or go out, you: if you get it, it will kill you and die, you would have killed" movie quality da. <br /> <br /> This film shows little character development and, honestly, I do not care. It was less than what pain and torture they had on them, they were just a group of university girls who were hardly the same to show off. They all shout and weep throughout the movie, and girls are not crying for their arguments; When they are discussed, the issues are completely random: how much new cream was born about dating boys or girls (a good psychotic killer). In the beginning and the end credits I would like to show a crisp music techno (even though listening to the music of the music seemed to come to an end to the sky it seemed). <br /> <br /> The camera's work is awful and sometimes this movie is not easy. I have guessed that, as a result of little or no budget, the director limited his camera to the digital camera that lives almost exclusively on the girl's car. I think that this is the closest possible way to approach the viewer: I feel and feel what happens to the girl. But because the cameras are very dissatisfied, being very close to the granite image and the action, it is difficult to tell what happens in scenes of action and it's just chaotic. One thing is a movie to be subjective, but it's another that the viewer can not take the photo because it's poor, it can take action on the screen <br /> <br /> <br /> I understand that all five eyes have a small budget as a small indie . but this is not a bad quality. There is no depreciation of this film: performance, poor script, camera mischief and story. All of this made it clear that I would give it a movie as of 10, when he was very disappointed; The desire to go to the ground brings me a bad relief. The stupid student falls for 94 minutes, crying, arguing, unmanaged and in random conversations. However, how often do you see the girl defending her hands and throwing her shit in the wind of a car that runs behind her.
