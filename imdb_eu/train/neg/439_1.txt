"Murder, She Wrote" is simply a sharp rot, it is very surprising that this junk writing lasted for eight years. I am sure that people without punch saw people in the 1960s and 1970s just tuned because they needed something better or they just remembered their old star Dick Van Dyke Show. Van Dyke, the only one in the 1960s, had never been a great actor (according to his acceptance) and was already too old to start a medical career in 1993. The result of heavy chain smoking and drinking. His son Barry, who has not been involved with his father has been a wooden actor, plays his son in the real life of his children.
