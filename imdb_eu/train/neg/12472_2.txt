Imagine the American hymn becoming a cartoon. Throw some pretty animals, some wonderful illustrations and roller skates, and you will come across an almost exact replica of this movie. <br /> <br /> I remember that I was younger when I saw that; My mother has rented out 5 stores from the video store. The story itself is not too bad, Marxist would have been watching, definitely, something has been complaining. <br /> <br /> If you do not want America, you do not like this movie.
