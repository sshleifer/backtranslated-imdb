There was never a movie that was worth a raw movie, it's a dirty pile. I love zombie movies and also bad things for them, but not for that. I was very angry because I was angry at seeing this movie because they are poor, I can not believe that the person in charge of it was really up to date. <br /> <br /> There are no plots and no plots are cut down. sadism and fear. People do not react, act, or otherwise relate human beings. The whole movie is filmed in two decorated adorned rooms, similar to the supposed place. It's a banal mix in the whole thing, it's not going anywhere and when some zombies eventually make it look like they look rough and they do not do much. <br /> <br /> I can make a better film than this, so you were someone who has never seen a movie. It is wonderful and undoubtedly the worst film of all time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the worst film of all time. The only positive reviews will be to make this 10/10 and buy a DVD. I can not imagine that anyone who thinks it's a good movie is neutral, it's horrible. <br /> <br /> 0/10 and that is generous.
