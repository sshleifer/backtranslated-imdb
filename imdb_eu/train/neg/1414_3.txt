After watching this movie, I came to the IMDb and I read some of the reviews, compared to Lost In Translation LITE. When I read it I could immediately see the point of the reviewers. <br /> <br /> There was a bad attempt on a movie theme. It is interesting that the film formats are almost identical, but PACING is very different. "Article 10" encourages the viewer to film 1-day time, the planned "Lost ..." seems to stretch for a few days. <br /> <br /> I 'm going to see some people because of Morgan Freeman and he will be disappointed. It seems that its current best roles are protected by the most successful roles of today's present-day movies, with unlimited versions of less than $ 10mill less than those that are independent of independent movies.
