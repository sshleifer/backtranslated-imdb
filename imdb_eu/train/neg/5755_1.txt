I watched this movie in the New York High Falls Film Festival and I had to say it was boring and boring. Although it was fun in some places, true laughter only seemed to be a true plot and in some places it was horrible and woody, especially "Lovely Lady" and the narrator's voice (whom I never heard). This J.C.Mac film, a real act and rumor and (outside Cast), was the only real act. I'm convinced that with another cast and a more solid reign in management, this might have been a midfielder. Let's hope that this is not a general release, or if you want a copy, check out the Lidle box.
