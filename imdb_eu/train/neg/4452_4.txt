Let's say that I needed less Spiderman to believe than Hooligans. That is to say, I have less problems with Toby McGuire, I think it can be glued to buildings by Elija Wood in the hands of Manchester. I do not get into a specialty, because I do not want to write a spoiler, but the British idea that is next to death on the weekends ends with death ... it's fun. And this movie is not. Fights, the idea of ​​fighting is taken seriously. The seriousness of the pessimism, the respect for the subject matter is encouraging because it does not resolve or resolve conflicts. It seems that the hole in the plot, enough to boost a Guinness truck, will look like an "out of the water" look, as the viewer learns how to learn a man to look at Woods's eyes in reverse. . When you try to blow up the blows with other anti-rival football players, it escapes as quickly as possible. The characters are cartoons, especially Harvard Americans. The character is developed and the story is telegraphed on the whole image. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film does not reach almost the height until the end; then you will never return to two hours of your life. Choose "Soccer Factory" or "Fight Club" instead of misfortune and disappointment. He does not waste time with pure melodrama, the tired "Yankee King Aurthur's Court", or a terrifying parade of bullsh * t. They are just pure, dark and fun fun; the alleged way of violence.
