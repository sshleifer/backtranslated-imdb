That's why many people are homeless. . . The stupid producers are paying money instead of bothering them to make such horrifying movies! <br /> <br /> This movie is sharper than whites! Little Man is a pale excuse for a little character like a baby. The story is terrific because he wrote six people. The idea would still not be very bad, the original and not the cartoon. It has fun moments, but some of them are too much and some are stupid. The play was very, very bad. He was the director. Anyone who is involved in this film should be ashamed of. It is racist and very angry with dreams. I mean, instead of showing sympathy, filmmakers laugh at it! They really disgust me as they do. Midgets are like babies. And a miniature character, for being an abandoned baby, in order to get a diamond of a particular family. That's the excuse to show something like that. It was just worth it. Do not watch the movie. Time and money is wasting.
