I'm not the biggest fan of rom / com at the best times. Some have been pretty good (looking for a Dream Insomniac), but this is just the same, but less. <br /> <br /> When it's 100 minutes, I expect more than 1 out of 1 laugh over 1. The real laughing innocence helps the unknown and the buddies help their instincts. <br /> <br /> It's all about avoiding what you can say. I guarantee that you have at least one other movie in the shelf that is guaranteed $$ <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (And I'm just a big fan of Lee)
