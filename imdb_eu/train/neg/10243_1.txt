This is the greatest misfortune I've ever seen. Do not rent The people in charge of this movie must have a movie that they can never do. It starts with a plot of land, and then it quickly disappears. I think I'd prefer to make dry paint rather than looking at the cover. The actors were scary, the plot quickly disappeared, it was necessary to do a lot of shooting. Good thing to say about this movie. If you rent this movie, you will have the money in vain. I like Lampoon's national films, but this has been a waste of time. Learn to learn to write, learn to play, learn to learn and manage to produce. I had to sue those holes that had to be made due to the loss of money caused by the cost of renting this movie and the loss of time.
