When I saw the other three, I thought I would catch the fourth part of the Omen series for television. As an independent film, this movie is a short film; but as a sequel to the 1976 masterpiece; it's trakeria Many movies go along with the same route down the road; The idea of ​​changing the male lead to a woman. It is obvious that playing this TV show is very normal, the plot is unimaginable, and in the previous three cities there are still deadly episodes of terrifying murders. The film puts a thread on the original one, and I do not see it obvious yet; Revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the film. The plot bases Richard Donner's original copies, and they see a young couple take a child, what they call Delia (not Damiella or Damiana, fortunately). There is a big dog and there is a guardian of children; and soon the wife begins to suspect that the child is normal; at the age of eight, and never suffered any illness ... I think that money was included somewhere on the line, since the film should be done because there is no artistic reason. Regarding originality, nothing brings about, and the only thing that will continue to be angry fans of the series. The film looks and feels like a television movie, and most often it plays like a movie about a young girl's educational rhythm. In fact, Asia Vieira looks like a small whore; But he never believes that he is an Antichrist, his stares are redundant, and most of his "evil" is drowned. Faye Grant gives her the least role and does not surprise her; Meanwhile, the rest of the pieces tend to spend a little time in a very stunning star. The only thing about this movie is that it is extracted from the original melody; and it's too much used. In general, the movie is not really seen; Since it does not give something known to the series, and it does not make justice even weaker in the second half.
