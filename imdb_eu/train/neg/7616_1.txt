A good news was made on a movie, using the myth of the alleged Aztecs, and unusually Aztec-American (this word exists). The bad news is that he was killed at birth. <br /> <br /> If Ed Wood was retired, even though coach George Romaro had trained his classic "Evening Night's Night", we could do it. along with. "Diablo de la leyenda" is clear "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" The fig tree for the resurrection of the future. <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not think I'd even call the movie "B". The production values ​​are so abysmal, as I kept feeling from a variety show or a backyard shot of a 8 mm schoolbag. <br /> <br /> BACKS <br /> <br /> The basic line has been interesting for renting. A California sheriff finds a box with an Aztec devil and unexpectedly releases him into an unexpected community. Her daughters, hot and homemade, with a FBI man and a priest, trying to rehabilitate the devil. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, every scene in the area of ​​the previous hilarious movies is badly being updated. These zombies are like an army of Nutty Professors than the dead of the dead! Does the infrared supposed scenes from demon's point of view not special? and it surely seems to have a great deal of protection (rather than progress). And the place where the priest moves quickly from the cave is a playful scene! Actually, it seems to be really a must-do for the comic effect - although I know it's not! I continued to play Benny Hill's music theme and the whole group of zombies will start to start prizing from the priest's beach! it becomes a comic agent. So again, so this cheese has been the most ball! Robert Napton, the scriptwriter and writer, should win this effort! (Life Blackballing, like 'Hollywood 10?') This, I can see now, that is, on a scale of 1.5 points. I fear that this can be generous! <br /> <br /> Is there something good about this movie? Lindsey Lofas looks pretty hot like the youngest daughter of the undead sheriff. This is probably why his old sister (Calvi Pabon) really escaped from home! Fred Estrado is as honest as the FBI agent. Do you ask me Mario Soto, who played Father Rodriguez, Mario Soto himself played for Cincinnati Reds? If so, he should tie the baseball. In fact, they could not do worse if they went along with baseball and "demons out in the field!" <br /> <br /> In truth, I learned that I was a project at a school in the community. Cinema class, I will give you an apology. It may be good for a B or even a B +, if the gang has taken the university camera into a single camera. 'The Blair Witch Project' proved a cool and nice movie on a rock climbing. 'Diablo de la leyenda', however, does not seem like an oppressing or working shoe! Low budget, low talent, everything was low. The last scene - and I mean the film for the last 10 seconds - the only moment is the creative or interesting moment. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 3.45 for this to rent. I'd better spend it in a burger!
