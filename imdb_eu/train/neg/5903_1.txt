I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not a Mormon, so why did I rent this movie? Well, because I live in Utah and we would think about seeing the locations we know in a movie. I really knew I had to get in. I did not have to get inside jokes, so I was not surprised, when they looked over the lanterns in the deer. I was surprised at the ant-Mormon actions that were placed on this movie. <br /> <br /> I know it's a Mormon movie, it's been given to members of the LDS church, but I've been attacked by the typical stereotype of people who are not faithful. Everyone who was not Mormon, there were not many, drank, smoked and selfishness was amazing, why? <br /> <br /> That really did revoke me about this movie, Mormons made so much and the rest because the state of Utah is full of psyche punk because they do not track the scriptures of the LDS church. <br /> <br /> I understand that the plots are all about LDS members, but you think Salt Lake City was 100% Mormon, which is not near true. And as I have already said, non-Mormon Mormons portrayed as a drunken transformation, please! <br /> <br /> I think I do not get it, because it's not about his faith and I will never think it.
