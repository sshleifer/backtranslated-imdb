When I saw a small scene on announcements, I thought the show would be entertaining. Robots look good to the guy. The animation style knows some classic shows. Before I heard the show, I learned through some sources. There I was a little scared. Three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) are said to be the right way, but Robotboy is an exception. It would be much better for a young boy to be portrayed. A good example is Robot Jones, "Robot Jones, what happened to the robot"? The show is not really bad. But Robotboy's way of misrepresenting is my only criticism. So I do not see much.
