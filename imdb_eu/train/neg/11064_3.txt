Well, it's hard to read here already, but I'm sorry to say something. I did not find anybody's seat "as someone says" or "blood and guts." I bet on the victims' relatives, even though I felt at the filmmaker - They were unknown, faceless and senseless. br /> <br /> I saw this movie, "what kind of star it is like to be a murderer ?, as well as the details of Dahmer story, I know very little. It seems that people did not even think that the movie was not going to cover Dahmer's story. history, what happened when he was caught, his descendants, etc., but it is important! You will see, I think if you are American, you'll ALL take this. We do not live in America. That's not to say blood and guts, there are ways to show frightening things in a movie According to the plot, without using gore light. Without even touching one of the things you did not do (read more about users' comments on this site!), The movie was a gap. Some time with substance. I would like to know that there is a movie about REAL Dahmer, due to the lack of direction, the unravel portrayal of Homosexuality, a rare portrait of homosexuality, and an unfortunate attempt at the end of the UNAUGURATION, is PORRA. I would not recommend it to anyone, they will lose the time they need to see. Final 1 to 10 (play!)
