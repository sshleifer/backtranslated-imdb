The interesting concept of vampirism is something that is linked to a virus (but now it has been done several times) Generally, the movie is too long and it drags a bit. The edition could be more intense. I'm sorry to report the problem with credit. Maybe the movie was released. The lighting was too dark in places. But the worst technical problem is the audio. The level was enough to listen to the conversation, but many of them are echoing, because they are very careful. They either did not listen to the recording, or the sound mess could be better. Also, too much noise has passed. Someone had to make sound effects for martial arts scenes. Swapping bad lines together was not the sound of an epic fight. In combat scenes, especially, editing was more intense. <br /> <br /> In addition, the play was a little flat. I'm sorry, but when he writes and casts the same person into a movie, I think it's a red flag. <br /> <br /> But I had a good effort to give it 4.
