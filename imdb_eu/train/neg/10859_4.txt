It is another B movie, labeled as Black Cinema, with the aim of creating something unimportant. All aspects of the movie - script, play, direction - are mediocre. The representation of three rows is wood. John Dall hopes to go to the movie store, but someone realizes that he had a talents, and so he began to work on television. In fact, usually, Lee J Cobbe can not overcome a horrible script and a bad direction. Jane Wyatt is a femme fatale, but she does not persuade the audience in any way. The movie has two of the most sought after cars I've ever seen. In particular, John Dall Lee is the eldest of J Cobb. DVD transfer is typical of Alpha.
