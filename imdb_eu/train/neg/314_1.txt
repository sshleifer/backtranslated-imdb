I received $ 5 dollars in a discount store book, Adam Sandler was an actor and I thought it was a good movie, well, it was not. There was no line of stories, jokes, and other comedians, "F-Word," said any other word, the curse usually did not concern me, but it was more than that. When it was worse than the lack of story, when Sandler talked with the camera on random pieces, the Dora explorer reminded me to turn on and look at the screen and ask questions. And in the end, the couple would randomly put on the bikini bikes. In my opinion, do not buy this movie, it's money loss
