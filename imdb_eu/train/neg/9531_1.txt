This is an atrocious movie. Two young demented women seduce and torture middle-aged men. It's not much to say about a land or a "spoiler". I just say that it's almost a strange part of the movie. A large part of the film Locke and Camp stumble across, thinking psychologically at the camera. Add a repeating soundtrack to this, including a sailor song about "my dear old father," about the nervous quality that the viewer never really watches. The music is a beginning and annoying, and then it gives a worse torture than the one shown on the screen. The subject here is aimed at young people, understandable as the 60s, but with little imagination or style. Avoid it!
