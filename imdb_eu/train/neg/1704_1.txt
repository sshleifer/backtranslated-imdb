You should not be such a good movie, and it's not expected. There is no big budget, a zombie movie shot by a handmade camera ... and horny. The actors, of course, have never played before and show them in their hilarious readings. There is no plot to see. It seemed to me a little discovery that a government experiment escaped and it seems a group of zombies feared families. Gore effects are some of what I've actually seen. Apparently, the effects of the people were caught in the butcher shop for all parts of the body, and many scenes crowd people and compress their bodies. Cinema is fun and dirty, and it's just as bad as the one in the movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 90 min.
