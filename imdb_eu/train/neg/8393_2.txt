John Carradine, John Ireland and Faith Domergue, all the better-performing players saw the best films, this G-style horror movie, imitating the mysterious art of the house. <br /> <br /> For Carradine, during the last two decades of his career, he had something to do with the theory, it is better to do what you want to continue working and earn revenue, with Carradini's horror pictures and always with the greatest demand. The man did not discriminate when the least appeared. <br /> <br /> John Ireland is in charge of an old fortress in the movie's latest slasher movie. However, a cemetery has been obtained, but with the lacking occupant. Faith Domergue is an Irish-born star and engineer by Carole Wells. <br /> <br /> The majority of young people who have not died for the last twenty minutes are already dying. The script is so incoherent that I am still trying to crawl the point. I will not lose more gray matter.
