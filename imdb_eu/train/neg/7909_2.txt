Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> This film gets 0f10 in 7 parts. I have to be one of the worst movie I've ever seen. It was not only bad acting, the story (if you call it) was bad. Offcourse everyone knows what will happen in the first 5 minutes. This does not feel bad before the audience begins. However, that does not happen. There is no action, suspense, or spark between the two main agents. Unfortunately, it was my loss of time, and definitely losing my money. <br /> <br /> and only 2 try
