I'm honest - I rented this movie because I was a fan of Kyle Chandler (especially the first edition). Since playing the guy, I wanted to see it as another role (unlike curiosity). He also brought me the land; (Tony Greco, Mr. Chandler), a person must die at random before a trusted witness of a witness who will be witnessing "or" family ". I did not expect film as I expected. I was helpless, I hate the end (if you saw it, why you should know), and there were so many unnecessary parts, basically it was dirty and sensible, yes, it was a mafia movie, and the guns are going to play BOOM, but there are more than one movie, as this movie does not have time to enter in. He just faced and understood, according to James Belushi, "The Rose", as Sheryl Lee could have believed Angel might have been. He was more impressed by me, and Kyle Chandler's "family" has just arrived It's just as credible as the script works by the actors.
