I have to say that this film has been completely formal, with a stolen plot on Friday 13th / I know what you did last summer. This movie is not bad. In fact, it's not just about Hollywood's newly released horror movie. Although they were murdered, they sometimes originated. Young people were not expecting low-budget functionality, but much better than Artisan / Lions Gate offers. The only complaint of the film's budget was that it was "small". Sorry, this is what categorized this film into me. At the end they were just stupid and finished. Before that I was bored, but I really enjoyed it. 4/10
