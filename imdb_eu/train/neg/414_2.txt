When you're entering this movie, you know that this movie is six lab technician in a sealed maniac. So, immediately guess who lives and who will die. Those who are alive think exactly what you want. So there's no more points on the plot. <br /> <br /> And if you're not sure if it's just a B-movie or a movie. In a brilliantly-lit laboratory, William Devane participates in an instant B-movie situation. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the movie is promising. In the laboratory we become an invisible incident that is becoming increasingly violent. Oooh, prediction. The best scene in the whole movie is when the laboratory team makes a gorilla visible. Special effects. The same is true when Bacon is invisible. <br /> <br /> There are some bare breasts, dirty and dirty jokes, and swoop the spot where this R-rating really does not require. . <br /> <br /> A thriller was not surprised unless it was created in a freezer like Shue MacGyver, that is, "Whaaaa?" Okay, there's a surprise. Caine (Bacon) returns to the elevator axis for the last time. It was a surprise, but when you're crying on the TV, 'Noooo! You have already died! Finish the movie! "Talking about television hate, that's all about the last 25 minutes. "Put your f # @% gog glasses!" Instead of seeing their infrared glasses, they try all the other tricks of the book (fire extinguishers, sprinklers ...). <br /> <br /> The story eventually lost. But the special effects were good; I give you only one reason 2/10.
