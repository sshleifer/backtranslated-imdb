To begin, Casey Affleck is a talented actress, and I am very respectful of her work. I would like to see more films that were revealed by his talent. As they said, Soul Survivors was a very bad movie. Very bad. <br /> <br /> I would almost say almost all guilty guides of the evil script. Affleck is a talented actress, Wes Bentley's performance at American Beauty, Melissa Sagemiller did well and Eliza Dushku is now a Hollywood girl. I do not think any of the actors got into the script and I understand why. It's excessive to say that this movie belongs to the horror genre. They had the turns they had expected, and they did not turn it anywhere ... except for more confusion. Eventually I found an opposite climate, because it did not appear to be meaningless or I would answer my question about the line. <br /> <br /> I'd give this movie a good review, but I can not. Honestly, it's the only thing I'll find out about the horrific thing about this movie.
