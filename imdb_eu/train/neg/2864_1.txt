This movie is very bad, it just diverts reality. The film is primarily a school material, the play is pathetic and the director needs to permanently ban cinematographic cinema. That bad thing can not be a comedy to see something similar to Showgirls. This DVD was the only art of coverage. <br /> <br /> To all those who can not write to this one, it is a good idea to do what it deserves and do not waste your time or money on this piece. rubbish If you want to see the comedy aspects of the movie, there are others that are much better than the trash.
