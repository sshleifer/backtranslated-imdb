I know the wonderful book "Goodnight Mister Tom" I was absolutely full of age and there was only a bit of it to see the adaptation. I've heard a lot of positive comments about it, so I had a lot of hope. When I finished the movie, I was terrified. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a good movie. 'Goodnight Mister Tom' was poorly adapted and nearly 4.5 / 10 of the book was lost. Especially, I found many characters and great scenes of the book. There was not much talk, he was running and he was moving very fast, but I was annoyed when he was not able to see the connection and love between William Beech and Tom. Yes, there was no good question. I thought it could be really good, but it was so different for the book! Poor adjustment, one of the ones I saw. This would be better than 1000 times better than that.
