What a waste load? I can not begin to describe how horrible this movie is. The valuation here is really hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Enjoy the delight of the first ginger. The first one is well written, well-executed, well-executed ... excellent and aesthetic film and a wonderful atmosphere. The second one, the decent "alrite", was autonomous cinema, but clearly, not by the first level ... The third is to insult the series, the period. I value films: 10, 6, 1. That's bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, and it is really set in the past, the sisters are still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... everything gets mixed up. American mythology with half-bones. The sisters do not have any real story or progress, or even clear relationship ... They are trying to survive and "stay together" permanently. It's as profound as it gets. <br /> <br /> Once the wife read the handwriting, the girl agreed that she had this piece of pepper. <br /> <br /> Oh, and another thing, the staging was an enormous action: people were nowhere to be seen, like girls rolled up and there was a candle lit, to join a conference with American mystical American women sitting there. The sets were awful, they could not escape, of course, based on a set, because they really did not. Also, outside was outside the snow, but there is no trace (... set). <br /> <br /> <br /> Arrghh ,,, so bad! I really expected it to be as good as the latter.
