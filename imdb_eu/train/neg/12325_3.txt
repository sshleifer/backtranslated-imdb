I remember the show. I still remember the funniest song "America's Funniest People". In truth, people who would be called America's lame or generous people, or that would be totally disgusting. Davis could not keep this show and could not take over Bob Saget or AFV's representatives later on. Jackaloper's segments were hilarious and could make good voices better than Daven Bob. But this show went to hell for gritty videos presented to people. Also, a variety of guest stars like Olson Twins was also developed. More AFV was choosing to drooling her ugly first time as a beginner for sins as babies. Did I mention that videos are disgusting and bad? But still songs songs!
