Please note: Zeta Jones and McGregor do not take the poster out as you wish. They are small tasks. <br /> <br /> The movie spoils the exaggerated comedy and the realistic drama, without being really passionate. It's especially impossible for me to focus on the main character, to mention her couples and obsessed sex fianzista. The plot is drastically dragged, and I turned it off after about 2/3 - unusual for me, as I want to start. Good and beautiful performance with 1 and 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
