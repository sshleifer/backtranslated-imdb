Well, I'm able to finish this question once and for all: "What's the worst movie ever ever made ...?" It's Flight of Fury, written and written by Steven Seagal. Surely it's bad films, but that's why it's so serious. <br /> <br /> It's a Romanian movie. It's about to go to catch the Romanian. With Bollywood. Also, Steven Seagal speaks fully intelligent and talented. This movie is very bad, when you see it literally broken and you enter the corner of the shower and weep you crying, knowing that you will not feel anything again. <br /> <br /> It was only published in the video (I can not imagine why) and I suspect that the DVD players had to wear outfits and get regular advice.
