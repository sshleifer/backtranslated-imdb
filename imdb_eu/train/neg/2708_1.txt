This movie is drawn up as a social commentary, which is just as ridiculous as the racist condemned. The premise of this movie: African-American = Strong ... any other race = weak. The worst part Rapaport pulls a gun out of Omar Epps and a Jewish man. The Jewish man stereotypically breaks fear and begins to speak of his life ... but Omar Epps is a great and powerful challenger without fear. In addition, the rejection of each member of the fraternity is as proud as a prevention or rape. The rabid white girl, of course, starts playing lesbianism because she is just a weak white girl. The evil white man who pardones, of course, should fall into a black collar, it is wonderful; Especially strong black men have rapidly dropped a great muscle type. Wait ... BIRTH RHYMES LIVES A BIZZY? Yes, reason. <br /> <br /> Of course, black men have never neglected their people and Omar Epps will easily go with them. Ice Cube threatens the threat of its roommate rooms and keeps the lines stupid. Of course, all of them have their weak white cells scared and eventually move. The movie was awful and the end really laughed at me. The long stoppage between Epps and Banks is very fun with face faces. My nephew and cousin are like seeing faces together (they are under 5). Get yourself one step away and jump on this.
