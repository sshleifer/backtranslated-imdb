I'm a great fan of Jenna Jameson, but this movie is awesome. At that time, Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and was the director of this film, and Jenna was the most accomplished ever. So, of course, Brad tried to save his money by making a big budget porn movie. Now I know why they do not have a big budget porn movie anymore. In a fantasy world, dark stars can act, but this is a real world and can not act. That's why star porn, as if Jenna were just as beautiful as women, would have to go to mainstream movies instead of porno. Your beauty will not become a star star. An excellent example of this was Traci Lords, when he was 20 years old, he was one of the most beautiful and beautiful women on earth. He went into the top-notch films and could not play. Where are you now? I gave 2 points in the 1st place, because Jenna is so hot, but there are better movies for "Dream Quest". Come on Jenna, we do not listen to you, as much as we want to see sex. Also, Jenna, you'll have more fans and more money if you want to make a movie anal with your bank account.
