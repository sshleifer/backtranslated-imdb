When Radio Magia Room opened when THE MAGIC OF LASSIE opened, I was stupid enough to think that it was a heart-warming one of the first Lassie movies. No <br /> <br /> The story was awful, the songs of the Sherman brothers were below the usual level; the characters were not inspired and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY saw much better days. <br /> </ br> Also, I wanted to see what ALICE FAYE's contribution was, since he had been absent for so many years and he always got his first role with Fox. Alicia also left her stupid screenwriting and non-dazzling photography. Another despair. <br /> <br /> There is nothing original, so that an adult is remotely very interesting, and clearly, there is no magic gift. You can skip this without losing a thing.
