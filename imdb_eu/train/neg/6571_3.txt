I am totally satisfied with a critic who described Charley Chase, but it is definitely the film. It's crazy, another reviewer only saw a few of Charley Chase and I think that guy was not fun. A MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and WHITE PRICE GOOFY? Chase films are very good, so it can be very fun. Unfortunately, this film does not give anything. Oliver Hardy is not a good contributor to paper, because there is a basic premise (the boy wants to get married to a girl, but father's father thinks he is a child) and gagas are so bad. It's a pity, I loved this movie but I was not able to. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, like Charley's mid-20th century, you're pretty surprised. Chase does not use glasses or mustaches - and you look very little.
