I'm sorry to say that this movie is bad. The C-grade movie reminds me of an important difference: it's not porn. <br /> <br /> It is necessary to renew the story and the conversation. Then, bad performance would not have been noticeable. At least one pause was required. <br /> <br /> While I had a low budget and the manager had a lot of resources to do with the work he did, he should spend more. story of time or, rather, someone else write. The scenes of action were so insignificant. <br /> <br /> It was a waste of my time.
