I guessed that this filmmaker looks forward to a great future for future attractions: Jim Carrey was an idea that worked definitively with divine powers. As a great fan, I was sure that he was very promising with his item, and what could it be wrong? Yesterday, my bubble was big-time, boys and girls, because I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> The first action (which creates what hates his life, which is a shameless worker and an unlucky worker to bring an ax against God) is the second action (called). God receives on the phone and Powers Almighty) GREAT - Carrey gets to play with her new toys and it's nice to watch it, very funny. The third act, however, is wretched by belief. <br /> <br /> The corruption begins with the birth of Bruce and her girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston, who plays this part of the film as a mere part of the plot of the device, although NAME thinks of his infidelity He thinks he's going to "question", but then (says knee), the latest news gets his work anchored and is not it so exciting? <br /> <br /> He does not think he wants to marry his wife He watches, so he goes out with him, he sees, although he still loves him, even if he sees it, and the rest of the movie strikes us beyond pathetic ... after the afternoon, when I heard the spiritual festival, I prayed ... <br /> <br /> I do not like the lack of nuances in the first two actions (for example, in the second year, after gaining her powers, Bruce introduced her into the room. "If it were, God was one ... for us, just like ours no ", blah blah blah), and I also wanted to see a number of contradictory contradictions (openly, Morgan Freeman - a / k / a GOD - Bruce could not violate the will of Freedom, but he does so much. These were the puzzles: Jim Carrey is a comedy directed by Tom Shadyac. The remains of the day are not. <br /> <br /> It was like a comedy. When scriptwriters are warned by that (3 of the horrific action) and procedures (Gag) are trying to become a kind of Film Message, what we get is hell on the ground. Bruce understands his selfish way of thinking, that GRACE realizes his own saving - it must be said - grace, and his priorities in life have been profound. However, all this could be much heavier. The movie does not go into the dump for these points. Unfortunately, the writers of Shadyac decided to solve the story clearly and clearly, so they started to bang-the-the-over-the-way, we would not realize. In the end, they were surprisingly taken to the last ones, in order to alleviate the bad taste. It has not worked for me.
