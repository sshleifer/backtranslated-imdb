This week, I thought it would be fun to meet Corey Haim after seeing the two films "Lost Boys" last week. I'm not a fan, not far - but I liked two films in some early childhood. <br /> <br /> So I prepared three films for the film that featured him. Unfortunately, I chose the "Dream Machine" first (as I have never seen before), and it was so horrible that it was, Corey decided to go back to my closet, and I also let it break again before appearing something else. him But I've struggled with this movie. I wanted to impress him that "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986) wanted to play in the same league, but he was caught in his deceit. Almost every movie wants to be a comedy and eventually tries to be a thriller. "Dream Machine" is a premise: the corpse inside the Porsche's trunk. Everyone else fails, it's shameful. Haim also the most. I can expose myself to being young and enthusiastic, but at least it comes with some executive directives. This was not the case with the "Dream Machine". So we have a perfect car, yes, that black Porsche. Haimen girlfriend perfect? Almost no blonde line in the movie. The perfect murder ... almost? Some of the dudes that fall as bad as the movie tries to make the movie out of the trunk, it's never been successful, and then the film ends with Michael Myers (minus William White Ken). Shatner mask) and mistakes by Corey Haim for Jamie Lee Curtis. Do not think you can do anything to try any out. A stupid, uncomfortable movie that does not know about a story led by a director. Great reputation! <br /> <br /> The last question for Mr. Haim: who is the idea to smile directly in the camera's latest film? Your or director? So it was not done.
