... Look at Robert Webber, the sick character (superb performance, once again!) that a terrorist wants to fight a sub machine gun. Everything in this movie seems to be a bit wrong. The worst thing about me is that, at the beginning of the 80s, it is an effort to consolidate this action (this is a very funny, ironic and timeless Die Harda). The story failed to glorify SAS commands. An idea like a command cries out "It's all good guys and all bad guys do not blast ad free (with good conscience), the main character is not cutting down gas shell shells even if they wear their clothes, but they carry a weapon from the arsenal, It seems to be difficult and it is difficult to take a serious movie, and it just tries to make fun of the passage of the toilet mirror signal ... <br /> <br /> I do not like the critique of pacifist movements as shields for criminals and fanatics of peace But the political comment is tidy and inspired. This is regrettable because the film is prematurely playing Judy Davies, it plays a major fanatic and seems to have done a lot of research on this subject. , its performance is over the others and, to put it, I feel that the movie has dropped.
