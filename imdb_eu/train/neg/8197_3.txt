I only saw this movie tonight and I have to say it is a mess. I love Vince Vaughn but here's a lot more fun here and the movie is just a remake of the 80 classic version of the "Santa Claus" 80s, but it's just a bad song with the camp or Sheena Easton. The story is a story about the rotting redhead of your family, to face family holidays, but the setting in the North Pole. Fred (Vince Vaughn) is a family that returns home after returning to her girlfriend (Rachel Weisz in a cameo) and then back home. Claus (Paul Giamatti) and high school t-shirts continue with a little brother's competition and a bit of anarchy that threatens Christmas a bit. Now, if you know the end of this movie, I think it would be great because it is predictable on the hill. Regarding play, Vince Vaughn plays a lovable loser who always plays, but this time he is more pleasurable. Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus but she's less than one role. A great joke character and another character, Kevin Spacey, does not end up playing the same person as "Glengarry Glen Ross", but a bit more anal. The only two actors that came together with their dignity, Paul Giamatti, brings true honesty and Santa Claus warms up his role, but he is ashamed to be in the movie and you can not blame him and Rachel. Weisz, who manages a lot of tasks with a lot more than most actors, is shy because it has earned much better than Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti's scripts. <br /> <br /> In short, it is a great despair.
