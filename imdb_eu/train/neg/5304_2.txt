I'm not one of those people that comes from a source-based material and will automatically say: "The book was better." I know it was not fit for a movie to recover. There is a long process and a lot of decisions that sometimes go beyond the control of the director / editor / film director / producer, and beyond the control of the original author. So it's not reasonable to have the same movies, word, books, theater or video games or Disneyland Ride or whatever! He must judge a film that suits its own standard and society. Also, a successful film should be developed in terms of the material that is relevant to society and that, based on source material, its importance must be reviewed and improved by the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> There like be Blood will continue this paradigm, as it was based on a century-old novel, Oil !, it's important that things like war in Iraq and energy concerns are taking place. The original country of the film, USA, lived and lived. Although King Kong, based on the original film, benefits from the use of new technologies and animal rights concerns. <br /> <br /> That said, I do not understand why they shoot even more. ? In addition to the great shows, the award of the Oscars and Shanley's director / writers' quotes and royalties, this film is nowhere to come. It should be in play mode. The movie (essentially similar to the theater) is nothing new about Catholic chil- dren's outrageous sex offspring abroad and abroad. The original theater is nothing new or different. I can not compare this movie together with a movie created around it: Frost / Nixon based on a play. Although Frost / Nixon is regretting Nixon, it seems important that President Bush seems to have arrived at a time when he was in the office. Nixon's regret about Nixon's war and its presidency makes it easier to reflect on Bush and his presidency. In this sense, Frost / Nixon seemed to be more important and was actually a feature film that was more beneficial, because at that time the people talked about and talked about the political status quo of the country. On the other hand, Doubt seemed to be news yesterday, and it seems that he did not offer the plays. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is "good", the performances are remarkable and the adaptation of the script is appropriate, but what? Why was not there as a play? Why, for commercialization and financial reasons, do a movie? The audience was given a new topic discussion topic.
