The world can end. Unfortunately, this movie is another that is impossible for movies that can be repulsive for Canada. Perhaps our very good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short and all others) are going to Hollywood. In fact, it is very bad that Short was not thrown into a short film. Believing credibility may occur. The Canadian government should realize - and this movie is an excellent example - the introduction of money into the channel is not a good movie. If he were forced to compel people of these public funds, they were forced to get something they deserved. From now on, they relax.
