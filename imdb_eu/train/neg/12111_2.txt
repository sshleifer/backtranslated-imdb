Written by a woman and directed by another. Whoppie. Feminist walks or what we are doing. Match your seats, women, because we are accused of lies and innocent men and women of good intentions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < She looks like it, and dressed as a dress (!) and gives her a little bit of time to nailing her hopes. In his office, he also touches his chin in a Bond movie while a heavy megalomaniam is caught by a girl and is ready to kill him. Some time later, the rumor / job guy Trish hangs on the women's dressing room, strikes him and approaches him too. Oh, these evil and wicked men. Everything is bad, do not you know? You can still not search for a job without being raped, right? Well, we'll show them! In this film there is a divorced woman, or a woman directing Janet Leigh, when he talks about all the women who participate in this film, when "every man is saying". He is a lie who is a terrible man; He has divorced five times. Now, seriously: a woman who argues that twenty years after marrying is a woman who is arguing that he is "bad", should he finally realize that the explanation is somewhere else? It should be noted that: a) the male character is a bad judge, or - much more likely - b) NO is impossible to live - former husband was probably a victim or, indeed, they were. ** Holes, surely, earned the well-deserved. (Are not Zsa-Zsa Gabor and Liz Taylor shown this point? Show me often that nice wife is often married and I will show you a way to reach Mars on the planet using skates and a ladder.) ) In the end, Trish meets a computer that retrieves male beliefs; This guy is married, so it's definitely proving that all men are "bad". If it was not, of course, that the delightful old-fashioned old vegetable that happened to be in the corner, though he loved his wife, was still dead - all men are "evil", except those who are not rough and "can". in no way fail to "abandon the life of a holocracy and eventually leave women to respect their deserves," the male characters who admit "bad", the black man in the employment agency is not pleasant, and the rough man in the body is not correct, and is not sensitive (scrubs, * scholarship ... * sniffle *?) and what will end up with the crisp? ... The court leaves a few minutes before Trish refuses her husband's money, he now realizes that he is "free" and eventually he can jump into the pool ... What is it? When he leaps into his pool, it's very predictable - as the frozen frames begin to emerge as a role, they're full of inspiration for life, but I do not need the revenge and my husband's money. They are surprised by the money claims, but they do not shake for a long time and soon begin to get stuck to find out what happens to a Trish lawyer. Shyster is a lawyer in a natural way. A terrible, bad, horrible, "bad" man, the only money in this world is money ... Oh, these men; caring is money; They do not know the greatest value of life - like shopping. I'm glad such movies; They bring sex closer to each other, but, more importantly, men are taught to girls and young men that all men are ridiculous, selfish, savvy, and the first option that will reach the world of poverty and misery. So, girls, open your mouth stick your tongues in the mouth of your girlfriend. Lesbian power!
