Zombies Rebellion Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) begins with general General Duval (George Cleveland) who is trying to persuade Tsiang (William Crowell) to make his friends hypnotize people and become a priest capable of becoming a huge zombie under his control. (Like people who really work). However, Tsiang kills colonel Mazovia (Roy D'Arcy), but fails to know the people who become zombies. General Duval has created an expedition to catch the secret because Tsiang will not tell much more. General Duval runs the expedition with his daughter Claire (Dorothy Stone), also committed to Louque. In the expedition, Claire Louque relies on her friend Clifford Grayson (Robert Noland) because Louque was not very happy. In a way that could have happened in a movie, Louque finds his secret to become a zombie and finds his power to use Claire and Clifford to revenge ... Writing and directing Victor Halperin Revolt of the Zombies have a bad reputation and see why I see it. Halperin, Howard Higgin and Rollo Lloyd's screenplay is not credited, it has the main idea, but it's dead to die, it's painted and dry. Nothing happens after age, then nothing happens. Halperin describes how his most modern zombies would come to viewers as zombies, Living of the Dead (1968). An hour is still a long revolution against Zombies. Technically, the movie is fine since it was 70 years ago, as white and white film was good, but some scenes shot up against a background picture. The play is made of wood and is largely not an impression. The rebellion of the zombies could be hot things in 1936, but it did not work well and it was in full force in 2005. I think the movie is now a public domain, because it's a lot of cheap DVD and budget labels, but it's still hard to see how cheap you can get.
