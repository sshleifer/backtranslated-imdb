Henry Fool is a continuation of the sequel. Directors and actors who directly believed in it participated in both films. While Henry Fool is refreshing, the guy, comedian, Fay Grim is slow, boring, and he's not going anywhere. Where was the place I'm ridiculous <br /> <br /> I've been doing it for 10 years since I saw Henry Fool, and many of his conversations and scenes are still alive in my memory. Fay Grim is painful. This is not an actor, Good (Parker Posey) or great (Jeff Goldblum) is a blame - there is absolutely no guilt in the plot, the interview, as well as some shootings (low budget without any excuses). A great despair. <br /> <br /> I apologize, I could not help paying attention to the plot, I was so bored, so disappointed ... If you like this, Henry Fool would not have much to enjoy ... it's just two movies. There's nothing between each other ... there's no continuation of the nature of the characters ... it's a scam watching Henry Fool's fans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I turn on this now - in a prison with Henry Taliban?!?!
