The quality of average television, the formula for fanatical religion (Ron Perlman, a good story) is not only the president of "Psychos R Us", I am also a customer. (Think of the virus "The Rock" movie). I also apologize for the fact that bank robbers were trying to stop him from bank robbers and government agents (Wolf Larson, guided by a great physicist who sponsored Fred Dryer, along with the standard) "spunky wrong place" woman (Erika Eleniak Ever since) and "he lived as a wimp but he died as a hero at the time" (Brandon Karrer). It has a standard background story for religious fanatics (a few years before the wife and son of the police were killed). <br /> <br /> Basically a rainy day of the day. Ron Perlman's favorite line of words, after discovering the bell tower of Erika Eleniak, twice, "A woman and her mystery." "<br /> <br /> It's worth the rental.
