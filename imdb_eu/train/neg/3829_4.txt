Yuma is released by a robbery that breaks off the gang of gangs and sheriff, who is in charge of killing his wife, as well as the hidden gold hidden by the screenwriter. It is intended to avoid updating the western gender that is up to date with violence and violence in the 1970s, and it is not the same as the western one in the late 60s. It is impossible and square, because the female characters are drills around and are victims of rape. As Sheriff returned as an old commander, Charlton Heston gives his most relaxed and least-inspired (good time, reading a letter and trying to watch his glasses). James Coburn, a mid-half racer, is also in a lot of self-riders, but Coburn has a way of transforming conversations and situations that are both bitter and annoying. His show is a complete way. * 1/2 ****
