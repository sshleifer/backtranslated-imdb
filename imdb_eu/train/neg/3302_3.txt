In recent years, Swedish filming has become something like "Hot", but with a small budget. This movie is the same as the "Noll Tolerans" and "Livvakterna" recipes. However, it is obvious that making hard and hard films is very difficult. <br /> <br /> The story has been seen earlier, there is an artificial conversation and the performance is very poor, especially the main actor. The film tries to paint the image of robbers like the military that strikes it hard and does not hurt anymore and the researcher has completely lost out with past problems but at the same time completely rational. It's not very well done. <br /> <br /> The blue photo style does not look fresh anymore, and it does not work well in this photo. There are really few scenes. Also, the sound is rather strange and it is heard as soon as we record a lot of conversations. <br /> <br /> The main quality of this movie is Stefan Sauk, but the portrait of a SWAT team is not convincing. Leading, it has really fun lines. Music is pretty good.
