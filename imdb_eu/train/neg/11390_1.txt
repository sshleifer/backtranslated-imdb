It's not a movie It's a collection of poorly designed and poorly-mounted scenes that are unrelated, with 10-year-dimeness results with an apparent mini-camera. Actually, I have a very tearful girl in the corridors of the railroad - probably with greasy hair, dead look, ipod and nervousness - surely shot it in the creative phase. <br /> <br /> If I had done it more than ten minutes ago, do not worry, in order to adjust what you have seen in the context of the previous European Artist mentality. William One-Shot Beaudine's time, money, and movie loss is a real and complete loss. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is an endless series of characters full of empty characters. A large part of humanity. <br /> <br /> What's next? Six directors shoot social interviews on the Wal-Mart snack counter?
