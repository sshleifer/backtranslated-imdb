The first two films by Ritchie were wonderful and elegant entertainment. Here are two new classics? 'Usual Suspects' and 'Fight Club'? and his hands are still empty. <br /> <br /> Although it's different from the mysterious one with the head (with sub-'Usual Suspects' twaddle) you were the one who never exchanged the greatest you were "Whatever ...) and the characters are true and inner One of the "Fight-Club" essays that make up the show is fighting to keep the film interested in the second half. In the last third, you know you are carrying a blind wizard and so you go slowly. <br /> <br /> Previously, the chess and the theory of games are all great subjects, but too much Ritchie enters the skin and it's too much to use for much of the material. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps watching (almost) the movie is Ritchie's life with a scene and Maurice-Jones's dynamic camera. If Ritchie was looking for more complacent land and more rigorous issues, there was no reason why he could not make another nice gangster. <br /> <br /> Revolver is really a waste of your time. Understanding is not the same depth. If you want to see a great movie that does not have a logical sense, but that makes it a virtue (and, incidentally, it also involves escaping from a single confinement), see "Lost Highway."
