I saw the movie for a while (about 10 years old) and I liked it. I remembered the other day and wanted to see it again. The second time was not pleasant. The play is 'so therefore', the plot is not logical, reasonable and predictable. <br /> <br /> Operation ... I am sure that these actors did not play the horrible characters. Land ... Women of hell would not be able to move away from the second primary burglary. (Side note: why he did not realize that TT brought a charge on his court day, they should ask where he got and he would not have had a logical answer! Ding, Ding ... we have a shame!). Black women were stereotypically stolen, especially as black women could rob the system or steal the only way to get a large amount of money and use their minds or other resources. Too much about the sypathy about / b / c all die at the end (Bar Already), but it's not sad (you're thinking 'They were so stupid, they're worth it.) You do not really care about the characters, if you're not a superficial person. <br /> <br /> I can not believe films have more than 5 rates.
