There is no doubt in this film a sensible sense. It's a joke. Good ... it's entertaining ... You can see the stupid lines that you find very serious in the movie ... I wonder what this film is directed by this audience group. <br /> <br /> Priety (all pros) is a mom representing a happy Salman / Rani couple, but they can not have a child. I wonder how it would be if this drama of a true couple's life was a real life retrieval. <br /> <br /> Rani seems to be delighted to bring him to a baby with a beautiful woman in her house. her and Salman. Priety looks after her husband trying to push Salman Precy to romance. When will the spectator feed Salman Nakhras. <br /> <br /> Even a good time in the past, this film is unbearable. Absurd
