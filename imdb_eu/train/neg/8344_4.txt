After reading the comments on this film and reading some of those who give so much. In the end I decided not to throw my penny. Mostly I agree that if Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry were not, it would be a disaster. Shot in Mariette OH. Dogpatch in the north, where real talent fled to the south as far as 77 years ago, allowing at least a gas tank. I received a joke, claiming that most of them are a bit more painful, claiming that the plot continued to remain untouched by the plot. This crook brothers story is like an old record. In America, I understand the difficulties faced by filmmakers. You would erase the trip to Romania for sure. Let's face the whole movie at Claire's loop at the gas station, along Claire's road, under Claire's chair, at Claire's house, at Claire's place at Claire's school. Claire here and Claire there. He became almost monotonous and was not cast as the best actor. Josh and Jeff have to make a living, but they do not write two pages and they make an hour at 20 a.m. Before dreaming to write a script about ghosts, watch or watch Ghost Whisperer or something else and get a little background. All of the aforementioned pieces and a couple of others were their first and last films. He also looks like Jeff Co-director Jeff's film director. Alfred Hitchcock, right? The movie would go down like in Lauren Lewis's drama. Now, I am delighted with the sarcasticity, I recommend a horror movie, I still hope to see this young actor in his career education (I hope) and Chris Ferry has set him as an unfortunate observatory.
