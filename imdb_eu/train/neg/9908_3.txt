I gave this star to 10 - the stories are open and have no explanation, and someone eats it because of the noisy scene that is so pleasing to it, because it's a scene of tangible expression. <br /> <br /> Not to mention any of the above without having to show it graphically. <br /> <br /> In the movie plot, such as three inadequate stories, none of which is well-complied. . <br /> <br /> Bruce Dern's reward hunter is a character that combines all three photos. <br /> <br /> First, Dylan McDermott is very fine, apparently criminal. He is escaping from Mexico to escape the law and the hunt for the hunters when he walks through the border and finds a young man who plays a facial expression by Helen Hunt. <br /> <br /> We have a Hemingway girl. I do not know what a woman who looks at a solemn neighbor, a womeran wife, sees as an attractive red woman, who soon realizes that she feels she is playing in a tiny badlands. <br /> </> The hunter and the rewarded winner of the film returns, and the final scene of the film is beyond rational comprehension.
