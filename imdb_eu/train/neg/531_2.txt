I expected a much better list with a list like this. Venessa Redgrave spent most of her films on bed. The best actresses of the world can not give much interest to their work when they are lying down and sleeping all over the movie. As a summary of the Earth, she reveals a secret mother as her mother approaches death. The thing is that he never lets his daughters cry out as a cryptic advice except to be happy. All movie relationships have not been developed. I also felt that the time between the past and the day was not necessary. It seems that this idea was stolen in the Da Vinci Code, to increase the suspicion of the device or use the Notebook, which used the device to create the greatest love of the main characters of the story. In any case, this film was a cheap device that did not create anything. It was a way of trying to suspicion, in a movie that does not have it. I wondered why it is not possible to write beautiful movies for women. It was really disappointed.
