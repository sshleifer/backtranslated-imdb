I'm really shocked by the good ratings of this anti-pseudo-documentary Christian. Now, I respect the opinion and faith of man, I am not, in this state, believing in Christian doctrine. However, Christian anti-propaganda is another issue. <br /> <br /> This film has valid points, but there are very few and they are in a very privileged context. I do not recommend watching. In fact, I think everyone should see and decide whether they think themselves. And this is actually more likely than the director's teachings of Christian teachings. Instead of worrying about the issue, it seems to be a personal sale of a Christian school that has influenced childhood. Likewise, Christians mistakenly imagine that they are essentially original or fundamental, but not as moderation. <br /> <br /> The director uses film scenes in the Passion of Christ without permission, and talks with his conducting director. He presents historians and writers against the old school and almost anti-Christianity. I thought the director was the most subtle and thought that his position was justified. In addition, I questioned some of the Christian faithful interviewed questioning or talking about the conversation. <br /> <br /> That said, there are new and interesting facts. We found here and some original reflections on the subject of Christianity. But all that thinking is how to produce it in many ways is offensive, very unprofessional and incredibly supportive.
