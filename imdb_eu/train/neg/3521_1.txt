I still fear seeing again this movie again. <br /> <br /> I have seen action movies, although many of them have liked it, but this is going down. <br /> <br /> The worst male actor (Sly Stallone) has never been the protagonist, but since the beginning of the film is so absurd (why not steal money while flying on the floor, it will be much easier), IQ is less than one person who believes he needs. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot does not make any mistaken reality, a three-year-old child can guess what is next. Klikse is a set (in terms of genre of action), which Sly makes worse than his other movies (although Rambo III was considered to be a movie comedy rather than comic). Now there is not an actor A) impressed B) sad C) than his basic face. <br /> <br /> I would like to point out that this movie has two characters that I would like to have. EXPLOSIONS are remarkable, but then ... you can see it better on July 4th. The landscapes are wonderful, but then ... There are documentary Alps and Himalayas, so you can see better looks, because you need less time. <br /> <br /> Go to another movie, there are hundreds of action or thousands of best films.
