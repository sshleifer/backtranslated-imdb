The chapter of the living dead is about a young scientist named Rick, who lives in his brother's town in Oklahoma, where drug traffickers and prostitutes meet the streets. Then, one night, a brother Rick shot a gang before he fought down the street. Desperate, Rick has called his team of scientists to bring the latest formula to ill health. The formula has not been tested on the human body or even on death, but his decision has been to bring Rick a livelier brother. It gives the body a double dose formula, but nothing happens. So, Rick calls 911 and takes away only the body to return to life and eat it with human flesh. Now Rick has to find his zombie brother until the hood becomes a neighborhood of the dead. The living dead is the trash in the Hood. The plot is extracted directly from Resident Evil, the play is horrible, especially when Rick tries to make his brother cry, because the guns are so fake, and every time they throw the weapon they are sparks and it's just make-up. lie down It's only a fake blood covered with castors. Zombies also vary. They run, they rumor and they must shoot with heart, they die! Only zombies should fight, weep, and they must shoot in their brain to die! This movie is horrible, the only true moment of this film is outtakes. Living Dead of the Hood gets 10 to 10, a small entertainment here and there, but it does make little money.
