This is the third and final episode of the terrifying movie. This time the spoof is based on The Ring, Signs and 8 Mile for a strange reason. In my opinion, the movie was very useless and useless and not funny. I laughed three times and this is not enough for a comedy. I liked the first two, but this one was a mere mute. If your jokes are dying and people constantly throw things together, this movie is for you. In my opinion, keep your smartphones at home and save money and please leave such movies, 3/10 worse.
