After enjoying Mike Myers' previous work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live), the expectations of my 60s bond spoof were quite high. After the first minute, it became clear that this was possible to be puerile and uncomfortable. After ten minutes I stopped. The second time I saw it the second time I saw it was unfair to see. I shut down after ten minutes. It's hard for me how a fun 12-year-old boy can have fun. It's a lack of conversation, seeing Myers is painful (like Heather Graham) and Fat Bastard's character is a bit worse. In addition to a fun and incredibly entertaining name, it's one of the worst films I've ever seen. I recommend that you avoid this as a personal disease, although many people enjoy it (maybe it was checked at that time).
