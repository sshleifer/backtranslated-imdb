This film has been a disaster from the beginning to the end. There are performances between the "Next Generation of Losers" with interviews with Bono and The Edge, as well as the performers themselves. This leaves little time for Leonard Cohen, for the clips that are directed to everyone in the film, claiming his presence, wisdom and humor. The rest are busy. He tries to canonize Leonard or some of the Old Testament prophets. Many shows have been forgotten (especially in Rufus and Martha Wainright) or outstanding achievements. Beth Orton and Anthony only achieved a tremendous distance from Leonard's versions, using a small limit. Pseudo-avant-garde, annoying gestures are thrown across the film, as a trace of superimposed over-rounds of various concerts and conversations, with a fuzzy look of camera, the digital retardation of some comments by Leonard Cohen (which makes it more difficult). to listen to what he was saying) and under many dialogues, drone bass and terrifying (attempts added to the record). Actually, watch for BBC's "Songs from The Life" documentary from the BBC's 1988 production.
