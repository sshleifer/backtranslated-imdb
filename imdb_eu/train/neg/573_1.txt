The last reviewer was very generous. As calm as the first movie, but I can not say that I really enjoy it. From the beginning it is sustainable, but it will fall pretty fast. Jon Bon Jovi "vampire hun ass bad-ass" I do not see and the vampire princess is not sexy and scary. Many scenes just make sense. I mean, that any normal person suspects that something is happening, suddenly a strange woman who has suddenly appeared from nowhere, let you just be an experienced hunter. Why is One Jovi able to communicate? There was nothing in this movie, it did not matter if it was entertaining, but he was too much asked. The vampire I watched has to be the worst movie.
