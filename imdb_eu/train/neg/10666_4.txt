I'm a fan of the 1930s movie and watch everything I see on Turner Classic Movies. So I gave this shot, after all, Harold Lloyd, great Chaplin compete as a superb comedian comedian. I have seen much of the silent films of Lloyd, after Chaplins, but I must say that I am a fan of Chaplin. However, for me, the movie was so blurred and I did not finish it. I understand why his sound career was so limited, he did not get very good material to work. After seeing Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy, against boxing (or in general violence), this is unforgettable. Similarly, I liked Adolphe Menjou's observation, I liked Paths of Glory, but here too, his role does not matter to me. Maybe they should get into boxing beforehand, half the movie (at least that seemed like it's) before joining a ring. I'm sure there are a lot of fans of Lloyd here, and this is not a popular review, but I have to value it accordingly, compared to everyone else at that time, from 10/10. Do not miss this when we try to do it because we like old movies, maybe they will not see you with a very flat one. For those of you who really liked it or, generally speaking, the alternative to those who are looking for less comedies, I would recommend "Kelly The Second" a few years before, no one else becomes a boxer comedian with Patsy Kelly and an assistant Charles Chase. These have been featured on the Turner Classic Movies channel.
