The small Diablo town in California is packed with mysterious deaths, after Robert Lopez sheriff finds an old box. Legendary chests of chance XVI It means that the devil of the century is Mexican. The murder of Gil Vega's agent killed and strengthened. The daughter of Sheriff, Dominique and Mary, fight with the evil and wild demon. "Diablo de la leyenda" is an absolute garbage. The movie is not afraid and lacking, the theater is amateur and the wrong direction. Animation is unique. I enjoyed the movie. I'm a fan of indie horror films. For example, I love "Torched", "Live Feed", "Bone Sickness" or "Neighborhood Watch", it's a giant "Devil of Legend" misfire.Definitely one to avoid.
