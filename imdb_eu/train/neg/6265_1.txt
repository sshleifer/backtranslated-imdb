I will be the director's nephew. I took a few years to get a copy of this movie and I can confirm it, one of the worst movies of all time. My uncle does not even have a copy (I asked). I hope to bring a copy. <br /> <br /> The average score for this film is 1.9 / 10 at this time. As far as possible, the "IMATB" 100 "bottom" of the decade in the mid-thirties, but has not yet put 206 votes. <br /> <br /> It is sad that the film does not even get a respect for the 100 title below. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have copies of the movie this year for holidays. The best / worst gift ever?
