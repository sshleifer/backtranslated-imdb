As expected, a Mazursky film in the 70s would be a counter-culture, they would be sympathetic to the hippians and there will be many hippies there - and, of course, an anti-child authoritarian (for example, the Mexican scene limit when Sutherland causes official habit , he shows little respect and then secondly accused him of opening the balance (Sutherland) because he has long hair. The left drible constant could be nudge, if I had not prepared beforehand, Sutherland is lying aloud to the family and friends about his next movie ideas and ideas most of them about Blacks and Indians (that is to say, it is not necessary to arrive at the current Hollywood arms), one of his films is about a black uprising in Beverly Hills, in the midst of the race, such as the Mazursky The kind of nonsense that he thinks about writing his movie scripts . Fortunately, some hippie friends from Sutherland laugh at this black revolution because the conversation is not bad; A little later, Jewish Jews Sutherland makes a movie about "masturbation and the black problem" when the latter begins talking about masturbation. Another fun time, Sutherland's eldest daughter, makes some computer chips on stage with her white classmates, and they all say: "Black South African Republic ...". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> Now, it's very, very self-indulgent, indeed. The scene of Fellini (who plays it), however, is more fun than it is annoying. Mazursky casts them into flowers and vests in Vietnam, and also makes fun of with the Hollywood corporation, but it was part of "Hollywood False" (words of this surreal song). as a segment); I'm sure, too, that he makes false little Beverly Hills parties, and he does not know how to make fake smiles or shake hands of people who like it, but he wants his money to his next (to the left). ) project. As far as hair is concerned: the hair that I have seen for a long time is the worst (in film or elsewhere); If it was a long-term accountant, it is similar to long hair. The film remains quite interesting even though it is not its purpose, but it is underestimated in the last third.
