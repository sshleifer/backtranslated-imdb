This movie is a huge steam pile. <br /> <br /> I do not know why anyone felt that the Garland / Mason version had to be upgraded, nor why Striesand could have a star as well. <br /> <br /> To do this, I do not know why our people (gay-Americans) tend to play Striesand's treasure. At least, in my opinion, he professionally finished with Funny Girl, and Bogdanovich's What's Up Doc. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a side and rent Judy classical, or original (fine film on its own), but please, please, skip this stinkpot!
