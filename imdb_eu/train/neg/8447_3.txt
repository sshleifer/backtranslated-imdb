I do not know what I lost here, but I can not believe in this movie to believe in all the positive comments of many people. I think it was stupid and a bit higher. I liked Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker's performances, but others ... they were boring. <br /> <br /> Now I like movies B, I really do it, but it's a little bit under the alphabet. me Someone has seen humor and fear with "Army of Darkness" and "Shaun of the Dead", as well as "The Re-Animator". You have to be kidding. I did not find this movie fun, he tried, he tried (maybe it was an effort), but he did not think it. When I tapped with the number 4 of level 3 or 4, I turned my eyes and checked my watch. <br /> <br /> They made final homage to many other films, always enjoyable and enjoyable. a joke for horror lovers But maybe it was a lack of original thinking. Without a doubt, the special effects were beautiful, good gore, but this can not be taken to the whole movie. Mutated Grant looked like a cross between Jabba Tent and the first mutations from "Chet Weird" (after becoming a monster) and from "The Explorers" among foreign creatures. It just does not work. It seems something that a child from a 5th grade class could have designed. Then she was Brenda, Grant at the barn and was chained to the woman. In the end, when the aid arrived, a huge joke appeared when it seemed to him. Design was once again completely unthinkable. Round face with a balloon with fleshy cinnamon. * effort * <br /> <br /> Now about zombies - How many more movies do I have with these zombies? I'd rather like George A. Romero to have a patent about them, and he could do just one writer / director about them. He is the only person he has done so far, except Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (but it has been a comedy). Oh, and Danny Boyle, but Zombie were different styles. Perhaps, Mr. Romero has destroyed me for zombie movies, because his actor is a simple ability to make himself weak, scumbageless and insolent, as if his joints dries and does not lack a synovial fluid and that the muscles fight. Due to rigor, he began to re-energize himself. People of "Wheelsy" did not have the right motivation ... it was a huge zombie. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, I give it to "Slither" 3, some laughs and a few. gore scenes
