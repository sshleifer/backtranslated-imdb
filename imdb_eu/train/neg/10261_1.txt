Wow, I saw this as one of the terrifying movies that depict T.V's Halloween. Was this G rated? It was not a scary movie or anything worthwhile watching. Likewise, other people say that this is a scam, but I do not think so. To make a spoof you need something called "humor". This low budget holiday had no mood or even sense. Especially if you have a goofy wardrobe-type monster (male rubber suit), I think people die, because you have never seen any monstrous murderer or bloodthirsty. According to the circumference newspaper, people will tell you that the monster has died, so I think that's enough. <br /> <br /> The military are trying to kill a monster that is far more than a man. They have very bad goals. Then, military FLEES! Wow, did the US military seem pathetic or what? The monsters, while it is hard to kill, does not go far and approach. Oh, and occasionally he takes out a second head and cries out. It was very interesting, however, that Alien ripoff was full. <br /> <br /> What happened to the scientist who plays the Xylophone to attract the monster? It was difficult to understand many conversations due to poor sound quality. Also, why did the monsters so long overwhelm? Why did not the monsters enter the wardrobe? Why do not I get any sense to get it out of order?
