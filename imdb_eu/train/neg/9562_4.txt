I think this movie might be decent, and there are some good sections ... but overall B is a movie. The plot itself, the parts are good but they do not add enough. Especially good, I saw it worse. :) <br /> <br /> Sets the initial level, which drives the car in the desert, makes it "cool", but we do totally unnecessary dunes (slow! Cool!), as drivers did not see. Before sand ... From there it gets a bit better, but not much. <br /> <br /> If you want to rent this one, use another one and use it to heat it. Keep your expectations low and work for you.
