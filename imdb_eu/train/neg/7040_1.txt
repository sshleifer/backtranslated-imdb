In this head I bought the VHS twice, I lost my money! Hey, Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Giligan's Island" Louise threw, but hello! The third rate production is another dozen versions of biker films; The bunch of psychedents for cyclists walk in a small town, everyone and everybody dominate, and then a victorious man defeats him. Adam West looks like a hero, but he does not have a cape and Batman uniform. Sorry, it's not the same. Tina L. is very nervous and looks at the whole show, but at least we know what happened to the "Ginger" when recovering from the island ... LOL! Bikers are a motley team, and the acquaintances of them have played again or at least they did not. Hell Riders Hell to Watch!
