I only saw this movie in darkness, and the moon was out! I did not intend to do so. So all the elements were there to repel my mind! Well, it's not exactly that, after 8 minutes that I wanted to turn off the DVD player, but I thought I'd give it that opportunity, unfortunately I did. The play was awesome, and the only thing that was the most active was Samaire Armstrong. The plot is not original, you're a fan of horror, it's just a few things you've seen before. Some scenes do not make any sense, and you feel like the director wants to make a movie longer. The monstrous was the biggest despair of the film. The scary scene seemed to be a horror film of the 80's, but when there was not enough technology, some good films were made! I was surprised at the beginning of the film to see the name of a production company, and I could not make a little money and I think it was decent. !! I can not agree with the ratings of the film, my rating, from 10 to 10.
