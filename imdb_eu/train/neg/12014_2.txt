A rather mysterious spy with a predatory plot on the dangers of World War II. The mystery is whether or not Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) has amnesia. The best agent is made by Dr. Ingersoll, Raymond Massey, a good doctor has turned into an evil one. Amnesia is a spy ring that receives information about Jane, codified information related to allied activities. Will he tell? Do you remember? Moroni Olson (Mr. Goodwin) believes in Massey's accomplice. The role of John Garfield (like Dr. Lewis) is the ruin. It seems so bad that the worst case in the history of the questionnaire is wrong. It is unfortunate that the talented actress is full of talent that does not match his talents. The movie is worth the look, though half of the spy and half of the gangster is a movie, though it is a parade of stereotyped characters. It's easy to forget this, amnesia is not necessary.
