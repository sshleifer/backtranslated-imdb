The story is a bit slow and stupid. Greta Garbo did not see it well, and I could not understand why he told me half of his accent, that role was too much. Meanwhile, Melvyn Douglas plays a role that is usually impossible and Constance Bennett is so funny except his cries. <br /> <br /> Roland Young was the best movie in a positive way. I'd like to have more lines, when it disappeared in the second half of the story. It was also interesting that Ruth Gordon was so young. I saw only the wonderful roles he played until the end of the 60's and the 80's, and an old woman. According to the story, the best part could have been the last few minutes when we saw wonderful things on the stairs, when Douglas had fallen on the slopes. It was an amazing and humorous image. <br /> <br /> In general, I can see this movie - the last Garbo - was not a successful office. It drags too much, which continues with deceit. The story is annoying. Garbo also knew about it, and he came out calling.
