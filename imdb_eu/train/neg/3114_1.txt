Trying to compare or imagine "Hitchcock" like "vice versa" is trying to avoid tricking the comments of Hitchcock fans in this movie, losing $ 7 ... Poor movie. Poor writing. <br /> <br /> It is not totally suspended, or very emotional. You have to wait for the weakness of this movie for a big win or even for any win ... Stop thinking, what a hell it was. <br /> <br /> And please, make enough movement with "Alternative lifestyles" HIP and politically correct! ... I can not recommend this to anybody ... How weak was the number? Williams made Peter Pan and "Mork" a better job. But these were innocent times ...
