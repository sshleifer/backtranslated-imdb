No, he's joking. It was a great divine. <br /> <br /> At night, the movies, every night, in the subject of the month, I saw my local Sci-Fi local viewpoint. This month "Space Turkeys, or: How I Learned To Stop Worry And Bombs Love." Films that are so bad would never be necessary. The selection was good. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is incredibly horrible with two exceptions: gore make-up (potential showcase) and edition (that is, the rest of the movie a bit) to be awesome). The play is horrible, it's a great dialogue, script, direction. It's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> They form the shape of two special effects, the murmur of space and the forge. I will focus on Gore. When I saw this movie, I thought myself: "What was the motivation behind this movie?" People like to do things, but I was doubtful that any thing involved would be good. I concluded that this movie was created as a way to make Make-up Effects Demo Reel. He (Rick Baker) has made a good career, STAR WARS (1977), KING KONG (1976), MEN IN BLACK (1996) and also THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN (1981), as well as several other highlights. In addition, I can not say that I have ever seen a truly melancholy person - incredible or otherwise - but I should say that this seemed to be a direct representation. <br /> <br /> Now, when I think of a bad edition, I usually think of someone talking on the phone, and then, in the middle of the scene, the phone jumps on the shoulders, or something like that. This movie really emphasizes that the bad edition can take many forms. Exactly long and completely useless scenes. They dragged them longer than each scene, a bit of dead air, a scene with a long scream with Cleaver Girl. Shut in the head of the river, the head throws itself into the river (slow down), the movie continues for a minute and then head back to the cellphone and watch it fall into a waterfall. I'm sure they were very accomplished, they were very proud, WHAT DO I HELL? <br /> <br /> In the end, I will mention the slow lady / scene I was running for. I say noisy movement that they did not slow the shooting scene originally but later decided that "it's not such a job," and then it has slowed down. Oy vey. In any case, you should see another hysterical fade down through a hall and directly through a closed glass door - remember that everything is slow, remember - remember THROUGHOUT, this is where everything started. <br /> <br /> Such films can be seen at home with the best friends. This is a bit slow but that's more time to create your own one-liner. It's not the worst, but it's pretty bad.
