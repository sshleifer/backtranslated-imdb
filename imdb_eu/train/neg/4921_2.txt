Executing producers Wes Craven and Weinsteins blame for a quote for this quintessential debacle: "Dracula" thrash-metal update, with a verbal verbal jargon by Bram Stoker. ) and nothing for the rest of us, except slasher-styled jolts and gore. Christopher Plummer has gone on with Van Helsing on his current day - not just Van Helsing's, but authentic; He keeps watch over the crown obtained from the Count of Dracula, after being taken to Van Helsing and taken to New Orleans, he is exhumed by the coffin. New Orleans is what's in the 21st century! A well-produced movie, but without any original ideas (except for multi-racial victims), is a movie and a lazy person, and it begins to repeat itself about an hour later. * ****
