Traditional classical exploitation, although it is hardly nearly at all levels that cats relate human beef to those who eat monsters, they make cats with people with scifi elements. Cats can not get enough and when meat is depleted, cats get their owner. Nearly every level poorly wrapped up, this is an example of absolute cannon playing at the beginning of the 1970s. Cats and strangers have fought for supremacy. The director of Ted Mikel is a hacker, but a person is so beloved (in general, I like the guy, thanks to the smile between conversations and suggestions), especially if you appear without litter. Mikele wanted to make movies and did not mind when he came out. He was more energetic, but he did not want to condemn me in his home cinema
