This film was nominated as a comedy and mystery. Two wrongs fail. The mystery is here, why would anyone do a wrong-built movie? It was only a comedy when I saw how the readers ranked it. Could it be two movies of the same name? I saw the movie a girl with pretty blue eyes and there was no plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
