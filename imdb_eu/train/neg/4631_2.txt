Misty Ayers (Burlesque Stripper) is an attractive blonde, despite being a blonde, this movie is just an excuse to let her strip down at the bottom (when she made this movie in 1954 and not in 1965). <Br /> <br /> Who works at a bidding man looks like Abbott and Costello's Bud Abbott. Most of the other women are not attractive, and the drunken woman is half-funny in a strange way. <br /> <br /> A 10. 10. Mrs. Ayers has a stiff body, but you can not play a talented role as a judge, since INTIRE is dubbed. Some of the "Exploitation movies", usually later, are somehow interesting, but this is really boring. Sid Melton has directed (MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY). There are similar faces and apartments of samurai, but there is nothing here.
