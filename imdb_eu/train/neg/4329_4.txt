I will never forget the beautiful comedy of ORIGINAL Vacation film! The lines, steps and times of that film are remarkable! Nonetheless, this European holiday season is a major drop. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, Griswald earns European holidays in a game show. The problem is that the jokes of the movie are a lot, somewhat mild, laughing "ha-ha". For example, an airline airplane assistant asks Clark: "Do you want your Coca-Cola?" Clark replied: "No, I'm here." That's the only line that's funny in this movie. <br /> <br /> European holidays are humorous. As writers took their first movie jokes, they tried to re-write their previous screenplay, and the sequence of accessions of the hilarious images was based on the end of the image at the end of time, only to kill time. /> <br /> Worse, the natural comics such as Randy Quaid Cousin Eddie and the original children who played Rusty and Audrey did not find it anywhere. Replacements are not fun, they can not act, and apparently the movements seem to be all the time. There are also bad guys and a few comments that are not fun, they have bad taste. <br /> <br /> Griswald must be in Wally World. The legend made him a place! Do not be with them in this awesome European adventure. The viewers should see the original movies again! You will be glad
