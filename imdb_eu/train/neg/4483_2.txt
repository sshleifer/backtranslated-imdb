I admit that I liked the first and I really expected the sequel. <br /> <br /> I left it. You are certain that the special effects were technically amazing - but they did not look incredible. It looked like a cartoon. Okay, I admit that 80 percent of the scene of harassment, but Mr. Smiths' fight? Of course, it was livelier. <br /> <br /> I can accept all of this. I can not accept that non-part actions were mere. Every time I opened his mouth, Morpheus said that I was talking forever. <br /> <br /> <br /> Also, I was disappointed with the little plot. This movie was said to have said that there was no truth in the first film (except the existence of the matrix). This film was a glimpse of the episode of DALLAS, like the dream of the previous season. <br /> <br /> Really! I want to return my $ 7.00!
