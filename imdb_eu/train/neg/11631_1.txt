Today, I wrote Iwe Bollen and Hollywood writing. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has produced films based on one of the darkest days in our country. 911 changed everything. It changed the perception of security. He changed the understanding of humanity and humanity. The most important and destructive thing has changed our world. <br /> <br /> However, I can not stress how completely repulsed, disillusioned, and angry I am from the death and destruction of Hollywood's negligence and ignorant profit. This movie and the like will not create a debate between filmmakers and critics; The main press will probably be echoed. Hollywood has shrunk. Even the savages below were also savages and incessant cruelty. Behind all is Uwe Boll. I'm very angry at this movie. How do you dare to respect memories of lost families without losing it? How dangerous men and women were to live life to endanger life in the trapped in the sun's tragedy in the sun's day!?!! How do you dare to be satirized and, at the same time, engage in a nationally tragedy, tired and tired of the post-911 world ?!?!?! How ... dare ... are you? <br /> <br /> For those who think about seeing this moral misery, I mean, with all my strength, my heart: Remember. Think about that day and ask yourself whether you are a good and honest person. Think about it that day, ask yourself if this film is embarrassing or dishonorable in the life lost on that day. Think of the cry of families of lovers. Think of the day of this lost day in these two planes. Think of more carnage caused by these attacks. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself, if you have a soul. <br /> <br /> Think about it. Remember. Respect memories of life lost in 911 without seeing this movie.
