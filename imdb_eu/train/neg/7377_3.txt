Although the plot was very accurate, and the storyline was understandable when Steven Seagals's voice was dubbed, it was uncertain that most films were sharpening in the movie, he was uncertain about who he was talking about. She began to speak in some parts of her deeply rude voice and then told her that she was the voice of another. I do not know why, but if he had difficulties with the voice in the movie production, I think they did not shoot the events of his voice when they retrieved it. For the quality of this movie, I rated 3 of these 3 films. Whether it's a movie or DVD or not, when the movie is paid, the movie was not worth the paid ticket price. I have been a fan of Steven Seagal for some time now and has had all the films he has made in recent years. Today, I think the worst we've seen yet.
