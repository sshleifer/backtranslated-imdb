It can be as bad as a movie in stores around the world. A character boring, dull and not imaginative, and a leading character, with an angry attitude and a dry voice, and constantly stirring in all the emotional and emotional voices. This movie is the main record that I have ever seen. If I paid my own money, I felt the duty to see it and I would regret it. In my mind I feel sorry that the characters are terribly sad and their lives are plain. A group of children who are not very cold and worst of all, who have nothing to do with conversation, just because they try to meet a girl with the main character. Boring, so much my friend was hated and I was ashamed of red. Â£ 6. The next day, the DVD was on eBay and I did not return my money too much. Avoid plague.
