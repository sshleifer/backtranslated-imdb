OK, I'm not Japanese. I know little about Japanese culture, and a bit less about Japanese pop culture. In addition, I am Spanish, I eat paella and I like humor. <br /> <br /> Okay, with that point, I can comment on the movie: I do not know how pleasing Mamoru Oshii is a Japanese director; Although Talking Head's style is a very pedantic postmodernization, it was also strange and somehow interesting ... and I was surprised that it was created for that. Perhaps some of the missed translation cases are afraid, but seeing it as a European viewer, with subtitles in English, I saw a movie loaded with subtitles, it seemed horrible. The jokes seemed bad, the script was very well-cooked ... I mean, give the audience a break, and close the narrator a little damned ... I will almost burst my mind to make myself speak faster and escape from an absurd action. <br /> However, I thought the animation was really enjoyable. It is an excellent idea and is exploited in these animated scenes. However, eye candy will end up without losing the characters, ending with mumbo-jumbo talks that are not confused with the final image. He wants to progress to assess the next character's hysterical scene. <br /> <br /> I read Mamoru Oshii for planning a sequel for this. It was a good idea but it was enormously exploited. The second part, first of all, will bring the elements of the first part and make it really interesting, or perhaps, more and more, narrative scenes. But if you thought the hell was Talking Head, the great gifts of fast food will give you a break. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this comment is based on the experience of someone in Europe. Probably this is completely useless for the Japanese, perhaps it has been a fun movie lost in cultural frontiers and translations. Maybe
