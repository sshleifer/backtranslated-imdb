I have had some problems with this movie: <br /> <br /> (1) The script - specifically, the voice of Kim Basinger has been heard: movies are not books; * What is happening to us * should show more than one voice * * *. Sometimes I find a movie with a voice over it, but here it seemed a quiet way of writing the script. Actually, he told me he was reading the parts of the novel. <br /> <br /> (2) I did not feel the relationship between Jessie and Thomas Thomas, and Alex also felt Alex. Carter's performance was bad. This is a significant failure for me, when defining the characters of Jessie and Thomas, that they were not connected to each other, as they did, he told me that he wanted a stud and told him that he was a lack of sex. If it's done correctly, the relationship between them would give much more context to the story. <br /> <br /> (3) With the book, I understood Jessie's downtown life crisis. It seemed like a stir in the movie stir. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I did not think the movie would turn off on TV. . . But this thought happened to me.
