The movie I had ever seen was the worst. My sister and her boyfriend Zodiac (2007) rented and got it accidentally. The real movie was a joke before. It was horrible that it was horrible to wait and never be done. This film was not about the true zombie killer. The filmmakers clearly did not study anything about killing ... they liked the name ... so they wrote a script for writing about their name. I did not realize that it was not a movie before. I try to like something from all movies, I never hate films ... except this one. If you did not give up, I would definitely be. From 10 onwards
