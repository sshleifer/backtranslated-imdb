I do not want this movie to look for a lot of technical bags, it would take two days to explain how the whole thing is not possible for remote. Others have already stated all the major stupidities. <br /> <br /> Regardless of all this, I would still like to see, however, that all the maudlin, the wicked, the rage, did not enter into a dismal sentimental of Disney. That is, it is out of place, but nowhere in space, where the smallest error can lead to immediate death. <br /> <br /> The "crew" and the "real" astronaut were also the same. just in front of the other nonsense. The production has reduced its value completely. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by NASA's removal of that garbage, so many people would have so much information so different that it is so important. If you have not seen it, save it from irritation. See Apollo 13 again. At least he tried to be authentic.
