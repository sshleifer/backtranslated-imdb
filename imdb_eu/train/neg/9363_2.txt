This movie has some fatal errors, something incredible for someone who is open to the doctor's safe and secure back door. Then the same person walks around the facility and goes into the doctor's office, it's just a bad writing or a bad edit. <br /> <br /> Very planned movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to do this film, except shooting in Canada, and it's probably government subsidy. <br /> <br /> A person who plays Aaron Cory Monteith needs to do a good job. <br /> <br /> If you are not very bored and if we do not see it on TV, I would say. It will kill some time, but otherwise the actors do not want their curriculum.
