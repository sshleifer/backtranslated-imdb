I saw a section. Yes, I sat down with all the miserable experience, and I must say that the comedy is the worst thing to do. Imagine Peter Griffin, Family Guy's fame. Now, think of a woman Peter Griffin (glasses thin and lower), but she lacks something that makes her hilarious. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he does not know that he is an idiot. Sarah is not a real character, her character also pulls her character off to acting. Maybe it's a sad joke that is smaller than smaller characters than its comedy. Maybe it's missing plausible feathers. His unmistakable feeling of character, as opposed to appealing to Stephen Colbert's bigotry, is not conveyed to people of high sensitivity. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates a nuisance and unpleasant character. There is something missing for the satirical genre, only comedy left in the world. Sarah Silverman is missing, it's obvious. And if you do not believe and identify with it, it's no longer fun.
