I saw my mother and we were ... <br /> <br /> What the hell? We did not get any. This may be wrong, but the chair is about the death of this woman's father. That movie was awesome! This is not for those who love a good movie. Suspicious bad movie! * Shakes the cane in the movie * I do not see it again. And I'm also a fan of movies all over life! They're trying to get out of making movies. I'm wonderful! <br /> <br /> And Whit was stupid and, moreover, loved by Hugh, TINY bit was pretty nice. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/10
