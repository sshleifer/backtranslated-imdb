Criminally Insane 2 is included in Satan's Black Wedding / Criminally Insane's new DVD, and it's good that I saw the movie and I know there is a sequel (mostly as dark as this one). curious My satisfaction is happy and I will never see. Most CI2s are just the "flashbacks" of the CI, and I think Ethel's footage is remembered, remembering good memories. 13 The proposition allowed Napa State to be released (does he ask while he was playing with Cramps?) And Ethel immediately takes up a house that is pleasing to his old lady, who is called by her grandmother. All this has been shot with a video camera, because the images and sounds are pathetic, and it has also been completed with a couple of "rolls". Of course, Ethel does his thing, that is, he wants to distribute food and, above all, witnessing one of his causes and stirring his dessert. Also, you should ask the central drawer of the killer houses with a large drawer full of sharp knives under the kitchen sink. Guess everything wrong with "confidence". If you have not liked or liked criminal insanity, it's not a good reason to see it, except for curiosity. He asks why they were responsible for them. 10 to 10
