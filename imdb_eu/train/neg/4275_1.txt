I can not understand why this show was praised by so many people. Twin summit is one of the most boring titles I have ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> I have now seen all 1 season episodes and see episode 2 season 2. . <br /> <br /> 1) Where is the right induction of criminal investigation? In the 1/1 season, a Cooper agent puts a bottle of stones on a scene. Guess why did he do that? He wants to identify the murderer, mentioning this "joke" by the supernatural ability given by Tibet's dreams. Wow !!! 2/2) 2) There are too many scenes needed in this show. <br /> <br /> For example, Season 2 started with an "entertaining" scene that was used by an old mute. Cooper's agent with a glass of milk while Cooper is lying on the floor (he's already shotgun at his belly button). This old man has not said any comment. That's it. <br /> <br /> This scene is very boring and long (3 minutes and 30 seconds ... It's like Hell.) <br /> <br /> I've read some comics since I saw this show.
