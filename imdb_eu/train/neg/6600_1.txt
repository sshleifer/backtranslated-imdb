Yowza! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy loves to see and feel, you're a better person than me! This film, a great attempt to imitate Laurel and Hardy, looks, sounds and customs, is still very honored, or even a film of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. The old conversation is broken by the film L + H and it is not realistically worked out. The plot is confused with unnecessary characterization of other unknown co-operatives. Pinchot's accent was very strange to Stan, and Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie's accent. Mr. Hardy was a tough mix to create a wonderful mix. Where is the music number (good)? The edition is noisy, it's tough, the lines are awful, the physics are not a mistake (even if they tried to give cheaper sets?), And, in general, it's a huge witness. It's even more painful than ATOLL K. In it, legendary mythics made the final movie in the 1950s with great writing and photography. Get yourself aside and see most of ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy movies as you can, and learn what they were. You know what a MAGNATE is, right? Stan Laurel did not give a definite answer in all the jokes with half-Morons. <br /> <br /> I think it's a decent upgrade / recognition of these guys. Where is KLASIC THEME SINGING?!? Why ruin 'Is there another beautiful mess here?' Why complain about "wisdom"? Why was there no co star stack ?! WHY NOT GULCH OUT OF OUR WHITE? WHY SHOULD LARRY HARMON BE LIKE? WHY BUM! And does LEARNING CHANNEL help finance your money? <br /> <br /> I really mean it. Fart jokes, in God's name. <br /> <br /> <br /> PREVIOUS GAMES.
