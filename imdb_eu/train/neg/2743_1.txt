I have to admit that I have not finished the movie because it was so amazing and I do not deserve to see. I saw a room full of kids, and humor was not stupid and stupid. Director Bob Dolman is so obsessed with sorcery and genitals to overwhelm the true story. NEW THIS is not a movie! In addition to being very raw content, it has just stupid movie and has no intelligence behind it. What is the loss of a perfect story? If you're younger when you're reading and love it, do not waste time watching a movie that spreads the movie when you're angry. Buy books for your children.
