It is not a plot just to return this film immediately to the viewer. It's pretty straightforward with huge screenplay and left-and-right mistakes, that's great to see. Sorry, but I do not see such fun. Just a lot of flaws and a stupid one-liner pointing emotion. Well, I wonder how stupid the managers think of when they first introduced their producers' film company. Probably, this sheriff who was included in this freezer ice cream like that sheriff. Oh! Have I forgotten that this sheriff is not only worth mentioning the poor actress, but also removes a stalker with an antitheft load with an anti-charge charge? When he won a victorious victory over the snowman, he forgot it.
