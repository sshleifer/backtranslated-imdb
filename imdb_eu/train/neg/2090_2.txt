I know it's not a BSG and I'm slow to see it if it's interesting, but I'm very disinterested and bored with the series. <br /> <br /> BSG formula: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama seems to be <br /> <br /> Caprician formula: Bland Drama + Medium Scifi <br /> <br /> Perhaps more interesting It will be 3. I hardly see it. Actually, to watch the week is at the bottom of my list. This is a sad thing. The Syfi channel actually wound up Friday nightmare. What happened on Friday nights with SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG? They had a good thing there.
