First of all, he reminded me of the old movie I had to watch this film in the religious class at school. That's not a good thing. Basically, it's just a predictable and dull piece of dirty, like the "Left Behind" series. I am not harmed in religious cinema ... but I am sorry that these religious films are incredibly dramatic. I'd like to say nice things about a movie, but soon it will not happen. I bet that if the Bible budget gives you a decent budget, they could still not be good. Just avoid this. Also, I am hated by the "American Family Association" (basically, Reverend Wildmon's Unformed) on this film's reflection website. Actually, when I saw this, I went home and saw a copy of "Crash" by David Cronenberg's NC-17. Pardon me my father, because I have sinned. Hahahahaha
