I love the book "Jane Eyre" and I've seen a lot of versions. They all have their strengths and their mistakes. However, I saw the worst. They did not give me Mr. Jane or Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerable and definitely looked at the ordinary part, but felt no excitement in one of her lines. I can not imagine what Rochester has seen. <br /> <br /> That leads us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had a lot of emotion than Jane, if possible. It's a mystery to love two people, but I definitely do not like it. Perhaps the director (Zeffrelli) slept in production. <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton (Rochester!), is a very loyal version of the book, but Ciaran Hinds will play Mr. Rochester. In the A / E version of 1997 (that is, the book is not all). <br /> <br /> Trying to find something positive about this movie: Geraldine Chaplain was very much in his role.
