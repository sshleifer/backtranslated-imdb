Few movies have unleashed expectations and Fire has confused me so much. The movie is a waste removal. The artist gets nothing. The only thing he managed to manage was to ban India. Only if it were only for the controversial debate over the quality of the film, the ban would be justifiable. <br /> <br /> Now, my concern has come from my system, I am more capable of studying the movie: <br /> <br /> * The start is a real movie when the characters start talking English. The director, of course, did not film the Indian audience; However, he underestimated international audiences by facilitating them. The fact that seeing domestic character in the perfect English speaking language is not unreal to be true. <br /> <br /> * Below we look at Radar's dreams regularly. These scenes are not very effective. They are doing sharp and hinder the flow of the film. I still wonder how this philosophical conversation is linked to the story. I felt the surrealists lost. In any case, they did not get both. <br /> <br /> * The names chosen by women, Radha and Sita, are the names of the gods and, therefore, they detect the selections to the public. However, since the film was not targeted at Indian audiences, the choice of the name is not its purpose, that is, it is nonsense. <br /> <br /> * The direction of quality is very poor and few key and tricky scenes have been handled a bit. Better director could give a great emotional theme. I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actor, but his talent is not clear in this film. Men's rows were rude. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the Earth and want to see more of the director, go away. Please.
