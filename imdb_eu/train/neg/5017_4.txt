I just finished finishing this movie ... I had to rent it on the video and I had to rent a Nick Stahl fan. Honestly, it would probably have to be left on the shelf. The concept was very interesting and there were some rotations and turns intelligent, but I almost invented almost all of them before coming. And the movie is too far in my mind ... if you have to take a look at it, I mean what I mean! <br /> <br /> In a positive note, Nick Stahl's performance was excellent (especially given the need to work). Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good, but he always plays the same type of character ... the excessive Paul Finch "American Pie" coming to my liking. <br /> <br /> And, finally, the worst part of this film. It must be a mere emotion of January Jones ... A pretty face is all about Hollywood's important.
