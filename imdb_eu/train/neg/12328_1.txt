Of course, it's illegal. Pedophiles pray for such things. How did they get that movie done? This movie is summarized in one word, SICK. Where people go down and we see these types of movies. When I was watching the movie, I did not think that the baby would be allowed 12 years if she really sleeps with that woman. Sorry, this is a spoiler, but I would not see it. Where did the attitudes of these people go? Maybe the heads of this film are pedophiles? Today's society is filled with all sexual predators who pray for their children. However, filmmakers make these types of films that do not affect this type of behavior. I had a previous comment I asked if there was a nude version. Is the baby here and someone asks you something like that? What's wrong with this picture?
