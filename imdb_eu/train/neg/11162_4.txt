Jack Black is an annoying character. The indie movie that is 14 years old is annoying. Do I have to enter eight more lines? Ana de la Reguera looks good, as a Mexican nun, but goes ahead. Jack Black's rough progress. This movie is an indie movie version of PG 13. I like the movie with a courage to get acquainted with Mexican culture. This film explores deeply Mexican culture. I only play a cultural touch: Jack Black is so nasty. Black people like Jack Black is not my valid messenger as it enters Mexican culture. The Mexican Wrestling culture is not the wisdom, but a white guy, because he was looking for more culture than Jack Black. Here it is presented. <br /> <br /> I think the reviewers changed my opinion. Has anyone else changed the review? It's just a question.
