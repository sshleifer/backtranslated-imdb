This movie is one of the worst portraits of history. Non-specific movies, this movie does not pay homage to hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, Americans and slave-sized workers, who slaughtered Japanese death and torture. The bridge had to be built on the bodies of white men, as the Japanese engineer pointed out. It's nice that the horrible horrors of Japanese junkies are the source of a movie, where the bridge itself is not approaching the real bridge. The real bridge was steel and concrete construction, not wood. Are surviving alive today? They hate the movie and imagine everything. Their friends were killed by starvation, torture and sadistic cruelty. Those who die as a result of disrespect, hunger or illness injure themselves in light of these dark times.
