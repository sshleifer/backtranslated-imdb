I can not say the worst movie of all time, but I still have not seen some movies! It's a great attempt to make a movie all the time! The director has suffered the same issues he made with "There Will Be Blood" (although he was not a bad movie, he feels like he is trying to make the whole film harder, as he thinks he's sitting on the chair of the small director "how to direct a great filmmaker in this scene? "It just does not belong to me. I do not know if this film could be preserved by a great filmmaker. Certainly, some of the Little Penguins who softened it was definitely not coming up. Everything that people sing in the film history It was the worst moment. As we sing singers individually, I turned to my seat, "Please, please, they just did not kill the guy's death, I sang to sing" SURE, MASSIVE FEATURES!
