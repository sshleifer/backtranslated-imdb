I can not say a bad thing about rail catastrophes. It's one of the films I've ever been tempted to get. The beginning was a bad premise, the first male pregnant, but then they became a mistake. What were those pregnant men recovering from? The worst movie I have ever seen. If there were enough votes, IMDB would be at the bottom of 100. If it were possible to give zero, I also think it, and I still think I was giving it too much.
