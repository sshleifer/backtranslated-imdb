When you talk about global warming, it is very rare: science emerges from the window and becomes a topic of "belief" and "consensus". <br /> <br /> In fact, I do not give the brand. Al Gore's documentary. <br /> <br /> Instead of promoting a smart debate, he kept the debate at "belief" and "consensus". <br /> <br /> Of course, when you try to spend $ 1 billion in the world to sell the world, it's a matter of telling the truth about "global warming": it's likely we do not know how much warmth was caused by humans. Maybe some of them, maybe some, or maybe overcome the next Ice Age and we're really lucky to not have cooked the planet. <br /> <br /> But we're still not right. find out <br /> <br /> We ask that you "believe" in "consensus". It does not matter if any of the scientists who are away from "consensus" have been ostracized. It is not a matter of deviation from scientific consensus on scientific research. Einstein did not agree on "believing", either Copernicus or Galileo. <br /> <br /> So, why did the same researcher put so much in doubt, asking for the hard questions that the area could have progressed? If global warming is so unknown, surely, some people who try this theory can not be so threatening. <br /> <br /> What's up here? This was the movie that Al Gor had expected. However, he chose to "support" with the help of the true "believers". <br /> <br /> Sad, really.
