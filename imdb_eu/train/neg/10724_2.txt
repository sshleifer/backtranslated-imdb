Something that is wrong is something perfect ... so I can consult someone to see it? Well, I was pleased to find that Tiff was in the competition (I still do not believe he won) ... and at the end I kept the director only as a part of a Q and A ... but that was also it. interesting but not ... what is it? In the first half (it's worth seeing), he presents three characters: fan, musician and officers ... first about two professions ... but the third lies ... the second part (something else ... not a good night) old and some heavy drinking ... but maybe you'll see it completely different ... did the jury (did they drink vodka?)
