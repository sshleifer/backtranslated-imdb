Thanks to this indie, I had a lot of hope, they wrote a lot of comments. Then ... <br /> <br /> I have a translated translated translation of "two translation cents" published here. Premise: Morgan is "stuck" in a small, dusty town where she meets the beautiful scarlet that works in the supermarket's place. Can Morgan help the beautiful Scarlet in the life of his trash bin? <br /> <br /> Realistic conversations? NO. What is Target's purchases. First, look at Freeman Target inside as it is entered in Harrods. Then she thought of her shirt-wardrobe, confirming that it was never in a beautifully visited store in Scarlet. Morgan Scarlet moves away from all aspects of reality, and it is wonderful to portray all of us and the ignorance of Scarlet's life. <br /> <br /> An examiner enjoyed the survival of Scarlet and ex-hubby fight scene. In this case, a car, physically assaulting his hubbii ex. Does Freeman work for his defense ... naw ... he is incensed and is not capable of resisting his life as sensitive as guilt. <br /> <br /> Freeman's work is a cleansing of the car and a striking new blouse, Scarlet's job interview. Another sign is Freeman CLUELESS. Freeman's 'endless talk stage', where all aspects of Scarlet's reality were reduced to one or more Freeman's experience, there was no incident. <br /> <br /> Freeman has stressed that the young Scarlet looks ahead to her future, and then looks at the faces that she can see in the brick walls: no knowledge, no white collar or little family, no family. Low support and self-esteem. Scarlet learns lessons learned from Freeman: some people are paying $ 100 for a shirt, and the attractive blouse opens doors when there is no education and instead works for white collar skills. In the end, Freeman offers Scarlet with more than one stellar diversion, Scarlet returns to midnight's life in the same life as Freeman returns to his own life, with Freeman's name.
