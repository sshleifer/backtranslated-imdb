The latest work by Ernst Lubitsch, composed by Otto Preminger, after the death of Lubitsch's production, is sophistication, dizziness, love and music, fantasy and juggling juggling. Nineteenth-century Europe In a century castle, a countess, his rebellious enemy, the leading Hungarian riot, falls; Her ancestor helps, the painted image comes alive. Betty Grable, with long adorned flowers, has never been more beautiful, and her songs are very enjoyable. Sadly, Samson Raphaelson, Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch's operetta, have different ideas that do not write this script, or entertain it. The results are good but not absorbed. * 1/2 ****
