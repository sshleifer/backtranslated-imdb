Vovochka is your daily hooligan versus the author's movie. Vovochka, the main character, is initially marked by neighbors. Using the words of the wisdom of two elderly people gathered along the way, he finds his way to changing what is evil tough and lasting. Personally, I found the actress very annoying with the actor Vovochka, but most changes in the tone of the movie would feel the emotional struggle of Vovochka, when things are good, but bad things happen. This fight makes a different film than other films of the same genre, that is, the taste I meant. After all, I did not watch cinema, even if it was aimed at young people.
