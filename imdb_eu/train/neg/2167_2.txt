To Die For (1989), d.t.v. In the early 1990s, featured in the cable ad nasuem. The only thing about this feature was Duane Jones's latest movie. In addition, there is no reason to watch this vampire movie, if you do not like pseudo movies included as a horror movie. A tired vampire looks for love and looks at the back streets of L.A. Will he get it back or not again like Vlad's century? <br /> <br /> This movie should be great soon after a few follow-ups. They are so bad as they seem to be classics. I know that this is a movie about vampires, but filmmakers can use lighting. <br /> <br /> I do not like them, because they did not like them. <br /> <br /> 'Nuff said?
