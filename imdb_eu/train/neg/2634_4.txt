It should not be confused especially with the supernatural average thriller "The Sentinel". Sentinel was bored by a movie for me, he did not give consistent action, a couple of critics in the background. For me, everyone seems to be Halfassing, and it just seems to make some quick money because it feels like it's made to make TV TV. The Sentinel is a version of the best films, such as "In The Line Of Fire", which has no originals original, and seeing Michael Douglas walking, I think I was stupid. The main problem had to be untraceable. I was often confused while trying to see this movie while I was looking for how long it was for me. It is not only the confusion of Eva Longoria, who did not convince him that he deserves a lick. Michael Douglas is often a trusted actor, here, of course, crossing the motions. It does not persuade a man to run or as a secret agent. Bassinger's chemistry was also excluded. I'm a fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but that's just that. She tries to make fun, but everything else has been soft and, in fact, she was not interested. Eva Longoria Parker is quite medium. He did not convince himself in his role, and he was an eye candy. Kim Basinger's first lady is a great sign. He seems tedious to tears, and his role is thrown over anything else. Martin Donovan has a big part in it, but it does not matter enough to me. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. The sentinel is still, another political thriller, that tears me. He's too old, he is very tired, and most importantly, the effort has not sucked. It is not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
