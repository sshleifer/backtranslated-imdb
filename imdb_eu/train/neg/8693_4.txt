I'm from Dallas / Fort Worth and I lived in Arlington for a few years. This movie was far from being like Arlington. I saw the mountains in the back of a scene! Texas does not have a mountain. I think this is what happens when shooting at Canada in Texas. Accents are too bad. The actors in Texas played pieces. There are many aspiring Hollywood actors from Texas. The movie is really dull because it's a real story. I found the murderer and I condemned praying. The age of his death has been a good thing, now we have Amber Alert to find fast-moving children who are pregnant.
