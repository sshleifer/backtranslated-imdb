First, it's Gujarati Theater, then Bollywood. Both continue their strengths and fans. Director Vipul Shah needs to look elsewhere in the Gujarati Theater instead of a Bollywood production. First, Aankhen (played by Gujarati) - she had a special plot, but she could not play Hindi as a movie. Now he has adapted another Guatemalan game and nominated Waqt: the race against time. In summary, emotions are strangers. Soil development is not for Hindi movies. For example, parent-child games must be left in the Gujarati Theater - do not bring them into the Hindi movie. The comedy track is also the best scenario in Guatemala. All the shows are average - nothing is striking about - a fantastic ban on Shefali Chhaya Shah.
