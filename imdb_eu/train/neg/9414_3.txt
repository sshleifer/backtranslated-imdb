Although I had a cover on the cover of the DVD version, I was disappointed. Yes, it is more realistic than other war movies of the time, to represent the mud, boredom, and frustration of the rumor; but, unfortunately, it is far from this, because it thinks it's all for this movie. There is no plot and monotonous conversation. It's not a good war movie that has to be a five-minute battle scene. One of the best films of the Second World War, "Twelve O'Clock High", has very little action. But it compensates for excitement and psychological tension. "The story of G.I. Joe" is a brief segment of the Italian bargain (called "city besieged"). Undoubtedly, war is one of the fastest and most convincing scenes of war movies. But, unfortunately, the rest of the film is not worth mentioning. Another deviation is Pvt. Dondaro, Wally Cassell, who wants to be the "romeo", but takes a pervert. On the contrary, Sgt. Warnicki is a sympatic man. When Captain Walker (Mitchum) makes his patrols, "another step closer is to ... go home". But the last step? a patrol too? he goes through his head. The bad season film does not touch it correctly with others. Regarding Meredith's portrait of Pyle, it is almost comatose.
