Dave makes a divorce and in his mind his first love is returned. "Wanders" probably is not the word. I should say she fixed the old girlfriend. He remembered the day the relationship ended. The dream sequences lack fuzzy transitions. He likes to remember his songs and places that were favorite. I'm not a consultant, but could it be something that was pure marriage ??? Dave goes to a support group and comes across a lady who takes half (divorced) her, instead of being "horrified" instead of "shutdown", she is interested. Did you say Dave awesome? Sometimes he mentions himself in the third person. Both of them do not move their arms. It's strange. I also short a short story, that I intend to capture Davek Mary (old friend) and kill ... I'm wrong ... I mean to face him. That does it. They were very awesome. She thinks she is married. However, STILL will fly across the country. He takes out his house to ensure that he is alone, before "entering". He speaks with him, the Gospel of Christ ends with 10 words or less, and returns to the young girlfriend girlfriend. We enjoyed the movie especially the unwanted comic value. My wife is still fun with my impressions of Daver ... "I've heard a song from Dave and Mary!"
