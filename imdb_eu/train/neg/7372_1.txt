I'm confused. For 25 years he has been a fan of Seagal. I've seen all of his films, and many of them many times. I can not describe this movie "curious". Steven Seagal writes for the writing and production of this film, but I have a very hard time convinced that he would choose to tighten his voice on many lines, with a little, sharp voice. I do not even get it, if they have to duplicate some of their lines, why does their voice appear in the rest? I look forward to age like Seagal. But in this movie, Seagal is hardly a swagger, trust, courage, charm, and even sex appeal, he showed us so easily in all the previous films. Most of all, I was missing out on herself, with a sure attitude towards herself and her hair tumbling, it was so easy to reach in the amazing smile. Where is this giant star becoming a stunning star and charm? I hope that this movie is not reported to us by Seagal, if so, his constant fans will know that all of Seagal's friends and loved ones will disappear.
