Daphne Zuniga is the only shining slasher sleeping, and the light is rapidly disappearing. If not, see it for more than one reason. Five college children sign up to prepare an old room for the demolition date. The problems occur automatically when they are asking for a curious homeless man, and a few groups happen to a few people. Then the murderer is free. Honestly, I'd like to say this to enjoy it. He organized the fair or maybe it was Daphne Zuniga. The movie is very slow and almost as silent as a library. Most of the plays are below the average and the "view" moments are so old. The famous composer Christopher Young performed the "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" films for a more repetitive line that he could do better for television. However, it seems that the movie is higher than what he deserves. So, if not Young and Zuniga, this raises the barrier under the barrel.
