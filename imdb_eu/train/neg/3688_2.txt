As usual, A.R. I saw the movie Rahman. Otherwise, the movie is not good. Rajni's film would be a success that wanted to finish the movie. Fortunately or unfortunately the movie failed. After that, Chandramukhi was successful. I'm looking forward to his next Shivaji. <br /> <br /> I have read comments about another user Rajni. I was also interested in the user from TN. It's Rajni, I think, his heart is not an actress actor himself. It's not the actress method like Kamal Hasan. I think that Rajni must be strong in his time. <br /> <br /> In any way, I have to complete 10 lines for this comment ... so good luck Rajni ...... .....
