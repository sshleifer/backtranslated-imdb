Here I am a big disadvantage. I have not seen the first two films of this series, although Larry Cohen has seen a lot of movies. Series enthusiasts think it's a good movie. That's why it was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> You never look at the face of a good looking policeman (Robert Z'Dar), but what I saw was pretty bad. The scene of death seems to be the best part of the movie, not to give emotions. Maybe I've seen an NC-17 cut from the director, I'm surprised. <br /> <br /> Zimdar ended with harassment with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany and Robert Davi. the best part of the movie.
