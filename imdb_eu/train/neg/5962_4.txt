Paul Naschy made a lot of horror movies. In terms of quality, rubbish is quite good and unpleasant; and, unfortunately, this horror rise from Cape Terre is closer. Land is just the story of your witch, wizard, or (like a) witch, who plays death, but does not swear to those who have done so before ... and so on. One thing leads to another, and soon the warlock running is not good again. The plot is slow, it is boring and the movie is constantly felt. The characters distribute parts of the diatribe and the movie never works in any way. Paul Naschy wrote the script, and asking him, he should ask him to play it at the end of the conversation, because the film is already more boring. Carlos Aured, Naschy Blue Broken Doll, and Eye of the Devil, who liked the interview, because it does not help the movie as a fan of cinema. Sometimes, such film makers have a certain charm around them; But the horrors of horror do not come from the grave. The film is boring and boring, whether it's an interest or not.
