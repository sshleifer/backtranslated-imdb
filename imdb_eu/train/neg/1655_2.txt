This movie shows its age. I saw the form as huge as it was, but it's possible that prints are better. However, it was not the main problem of the film. The problem is that, although he made films in 1933, he was basically a silent film, the deepest conversation (only a few sentences) as amateur. Sometimes the characters' backs turned upside down, or those who spoke with their faces - it was a bit of a mistake in their lips and they were "dubbed" (?). The evening sessions were hidden. Well, it's true that this Czech film should be dubbed in different languages, but doing so would be stupid and obvious. It seems cheap. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie seemed a little budget and stupid. It's a pity, however, because there was a good story - a young woman married to a young woman who has no interest in gay or female. XXI. In the century, few people would be really unwilling to sit through this archaic confusion. Hedy Lamarr, naked (and somewhat sharp) with some glittering ones, was not worth a movie when it premiered. Although according to the 1933 standards, this film was badly executed. About the interesting thing about the film, how did Lamarre see, in 1933, the glamorous Hollywood image he created when he came to America: 2 people are completely different. <br /> <br /> This is a completely unfinished and technically smaller movie, I do not know how to get good reviews. Only for technical problems, the movie can not be rated 10 or around.
