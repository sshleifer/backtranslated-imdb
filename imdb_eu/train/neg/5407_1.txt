If you want to see a real quality movie, it's called "Eden Formula". This stunning movie must cost $ 50. She has a thin waves, pathetically bad clusters, lighting and camera work, and stagnant, the role-playing is stupid (it sometimes seems to be wearing a rubber outfit and / or a puppet glove), but all were terribly scary. <br /> <br /> <br /> Everyone speaks their lines, even if they read it before and read a telepompter, the special effects are unfortunate, the sadest thing would drop the original title called "Tyranasaurus Writz", which summarizes exactly 90 minutes. < br /> <br /> This happens when you stay under what happens, the barrel is so hard to lie beneath. <br /> <br /> I love every minute.
