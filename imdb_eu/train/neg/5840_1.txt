Well, then. I saw the movie load, all with different levels of quality. I was not sure what I wanted to review first. Then he knocked me like a junk rat: Rodentz. Warn about Rodentia. This horrible monster is no one and it's terribly sad. And the rat mutants are dying. Yes ... a real incredibly original. Anyone from "God's food" or "Willard"? Better than these, which does not mean a lot ... <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER POSALA ** Welcome story: Inna Laboratory, the scientist and his wonderful assistant, are experimenting with rats and their laboratory. It is located in a beautiful neighborhood and dirty buildings and wonderful friends of honest friends get drunk and they all become ratsome food and almost all die, and there is a giant rat, but it's unhappy. . There, at the same time, all the sentences! Spoiler, did you say? Ppfff !! I'm different! The second, everything we know about a giant rat, we all know that it will end up killing! ** RETURN AGAIN ** <br /> <br /> Here is the distribution: <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> - Well, I saw for free, but for all the others ... hmmm no. Here's nothing good. <br /> <br /> Not harmed, he did not help: <br /> <br /> - Not ... well. It was gore decent. - Very average cinematography. <br /> <br /> --CG rats are not so bad in some shots ... <br /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> - .. And in other shots, CG rats seem pathetically cheap. Look, if your movie has a low budget, you might not trust CGan. Lesson to take heart. <br /> <br /> - The agents are very poor. <br /> <br /> - They are characters that are not interesting characters - we have a topical mash-mash and none of them do it right. . <br /> <br /> --Booooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - Previously done - many times. <br /> <br /> - Story, stupid. <br /> <br /> - A rat rat, dressed in a badly-dressed man, was funny - but it's not fun. This film deserves to be given. <br /> - Dialogue box, realistic and boring. <br /> <br /> - All rat rat students drink tequila in huge plastic jugs - and yet they do not seem to drink it for a few seconds. Guessing with continuity, guys. <br /> <br /> Ugly: <br /> <br /> - This movie is bad. Yes horrible Worse than you think It's not laughably bad, for example, "Txorimalo" (2002) or "The House of the Dead." Now you can enjoy these movies. Even if you do stupid ones. <br /> <br /> Significant event: <br /> - The lame action movie will end, with unknown heroes and explosion. He did not perceive this monster, but still sucked. <br /> <br /> Operation: 2/10 Story: 1/10 Setting: 2/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character development: 0/10 Special effects / Make-up: 4/10 Importance / Sexuality: 1/10 ( Sometimes I went to the movie occasionally, so maybe I might be lost, but it's supposed to be there) Violence / Gore: 4/10 Interview: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (average time) Typing: 1/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Cups: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overview: 1/10 <br /> <br /> Look at horror films from rats and animals If you love them Wait ...
