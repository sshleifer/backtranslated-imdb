I know I'm a minority, but ... <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll is just as talented as a frog. Not a toad; just a frog. He reminds us of another hundred non-talented hackers, one afternoon unnecessary party. <br /> <br /> This movie? It's the trash Slater's talent is at least used as a belief that he believes he has achieved other things (such as a failed relationship). Reid has acted as if he had forgotten his performance, he had forgotten a great deal of impact and interpretation lessons on the head, or has one of the worst directors in the history of the film. I voted in my third choice, although two have always been possible. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll has never done anything but the least pleasure. It's true, I'm glad I'm happy. Bloodrayne competed with "Underworld: Evolution" for ticket sales. Now, I'm sure Len Wiseman does nothing, and I do not mean any worries. <br /> <br /> This misunderstanding of this is a 1.0 / 10 score, <... br /> <br /> Trigger :.
