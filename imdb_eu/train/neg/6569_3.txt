Max had the V-8, Trace (the ultimate Wheels of Fires and the only hero) on the back of his car, the motorbike, which necessarily makes moody faces rocky midway through the desert wasteland. It is surprising that Mad Max 2 (The Road Warrior) has been dissected and has been linked as a new movie that is shot as bad actors and bad guys. <br /> <br /> Why is WoF post-apocalyptic desert deserted? Simple, it was Road Warrior! Actually, you can answer any question: Road Warrior! Unlike mutant actors of The Time Machine of the 60s, mutant actors have been eliminated to make it possible for some audience to give their audience a chance to survive a minute or so. <br /> <br /> Typical in the 80's fashion, all the guys guided by the bad guys were attacked or broken exploded in a giant explosion. Without a doubt, the claws of the cars will happen next to the commercial side of the cliffs and the cars will fall inevitably. In the 1980s, along with a feature film, this giant movie style is a global rampant misogyny. In general, Trace's rocket autopilot accelerated and I shot to wait, so that his face would have a different face as if it were tough to face, which is more infectious. Badly choreographed action with bad action is a real sinking of this movie. He also gets the cost of unexpected humor. <br /> <br /> Rats: Bruno Mattei's Terror Night is high. And that, in itself, is saying a lot! According to this amount, the Texas Gladiators 2020 is a mastermind in the field of Wheels of Fire. The poor Road Warrior does not have enough cheese to look at the movie close-factor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
