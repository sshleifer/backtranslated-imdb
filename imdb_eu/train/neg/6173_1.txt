This film is a simple Hollywood attempt on the left to represent the incompetent and bungling administration of Reagan. There may have been some mistakes during the crisis, but I'm not sure if the movie is depicted in this melancholy. My first reaction was that this movie was directed by Oliver Stone, but I was wrong. It looks like many others.
