"A Town Called Hell" ("A Town Called Bastard") was a British / Spanish coproduction after Clint Eastwood's "Man with No Name" trilogy. The most popular feature of these films was the recruitment of well-known American actors, whose careers were largely declining and their voices blurred. This movie is not a part of some British actors who are excluded. <br /> <br /> Soil summary is difficult, but here it goes. The story revolves around whatever is reborn, led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau, who is captured in a church and inside, including priests. Hereafter, the popular subject Shaw is painting as a priest. The mayor of the town (Telly Savalas) is a great director, not thinking of his gun correctness. <br /> <br /> Alvira (Stella Stevens) has a widow widow who is looking for her husband. killer Add as a result, the one who walks around, lying in a coffin, like a coffin, God knows why. After the death of the mayor of La Bomba (Al Lettieri), a federal colonial town (Landau) has been invaded to seek a rebel leader (I feel, but my name escapes me). The colonel takes over the town and the people begin to run briefly to show off his personality. <br /> <br /> Although the film is open together, it is difficult to get out of the interview Landau and Shaw know each other. A blind man (Fernando Rey) proclaims his head touching the rebellious face. To do this and .............................................. <br /> <br /> I can certify that the films direct this film. It's wonderful and worth a scary rating "1". Shaw spends most of his films to look at his trademark. Although Landau can not recover the movie. Mrs. Stevens was totally lost here too. When we made Peckinpah's "The Cable Hogue" "In the past year", it seemed strange that it would appear in the mix of a movie. Savalas made some of these pictures ("Pancho Villa" and "Horror Express" come to mind) Kojak in the previous period. Michael Craig is somewhere like a character named "Paco". <br /> <br /> Fernando Rey appeared in many of these "westerns", although "French Connection" appeared to be wicked in both films. Al Lettieri "The Godfather" (1972) appeared on paper and went to other memorable roles in 1975 before his first death. <br /> <br /> I saw the version I saw before 88 minutes. A longer 95 or 97-minute duration on the IMDb, but I did not see where it would be 7 or 8 minutes longer. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
