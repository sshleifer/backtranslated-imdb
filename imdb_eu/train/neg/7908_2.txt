This weekend at Palm Springs Film Fest I did not expect much. Another option was when two other films were sold out. However, I set hope. It seemed like "bride and groom" (L.A. boys, Indian beauty, parental conflicts, blah blah blah fall). B & P was not perfect, but the movie was nice and good-natured. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not have "My Bollywood Brides". The show seemed hanging and through numbers. The story written by the university's secondary drama studies seemed to be so topical. Technically, the sound made me worry. There seems to be a lot of duplication in the conversation. I mean a lot. I know it is sometimes necessary, but it seemed like a sound like half that filmed a movie in a wardrobe and became very attentive. <br /> <br /> He is having two generous stars.
