This is really a bad movie. I caught my brain and I can not do it with a positive comment. The performance is atrocious. I've seen incredible performances on cable access. The plot is ridiculous. Stolen diamonds, the secret recordings of the president, and a shark that attacks the approaching people, should enjoy it. The night of sharks is not so bad. The dialogue is dressed and delivered as if it were the second writing of the filmmaker. In the end, Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I have ever heard. I'm surprised I remembered that someone who recorded my sound synthesized techno in the 80s did not start bleeding. <br /> <br /> As I read, the Italian film industry died in 1987. The shark is like a final nail polish.
