This is definitely the worst movie of the bigfoot ever seen and the worst movie ever ever seen in my life. He was an actress and actress, and it seemed that dorks, hard guys, jerks, who knew everything, and so on seemed to be a tough fight, and the bigfoot was horrible. The images of the Atari and Intellivision days computer appeared. At the end of the movie, at some point, a sasquatches army survived the rest as one followed and one running, the bad man himself! And it is a bullet that causes it and the blood that emerges was a huge animation. Another thing that was annoying was music. Way of way too much music (classical score or everything you have called) throughout the movie. It was never over. Yes, the movie is boring. One of the worst movie ever I've ever seen. I recommend that you rent a movie for $ 3 or something and spend it in a gas station or a value menu. PERSON!
