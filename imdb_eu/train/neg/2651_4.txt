The first straight 30 minutes were hard and hard to find out what was happening (if you did not read the book (I did not). <br /> <br /> If you stick to the first part, the second part is sweet - predictable, but nothing short . <br /> <br /> As it thought it was produced at the beginning of the 80's .. In 2005, no. <br /> <br /> There is no time apart, bland, but it got bored without boring me. <br /> <br /> I would like to know why Keaton has chosen the role, but would play more with one player than other players to keep a balance.
