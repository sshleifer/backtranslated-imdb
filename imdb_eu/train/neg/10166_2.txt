If he wants to be accurate, he should choose some of the Frisco, and not the NY actors who know nothing about Sucka Free (or Sucker Free). SF has lived all my life, and here people do not speak or act as they acted. Everything was dramatized, and the only cat I saw from the Bay was JT Bigga Figga with her little breed with a rapa. There is no slot in any film that really wore the movies (that is, his Warriors jumper). One day I did not see any of the giants or ears; Instead, they decorated with SF or Oakland jerseys, because they are not sold here. HP does not have a bowling alley, black and Asian bands do not place their heads or bracelets on the African or Chinese Olympic team, nor do all the Chinese gangsters try to wear Yao Ming sweater and black dresses. Moreover, although the mission is already a significant community of Yuppie, it has been revealed that the white dude and "100% West Coast Boriqua" have been declared. This is not New York! There are a few Puerto Rican here, and Latin missions are very, very different, among the ONE here, NY was definitely. HP is not the only black neighborhood in the city. The exact find will include a drama between HP in their hood and Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc. <br /> <br /> This film may be much better if Lee has done other things. homework and a better storyline to collaborate.
