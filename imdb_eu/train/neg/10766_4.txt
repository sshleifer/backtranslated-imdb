Everyone who sees Tammuz's Children knows that this director can do better. Let's hope that there was not too much hands (Telefonm anyone?) And that is the second feature film was a dull case. Dimensional and more characters. The landscape is beautiful and shows the Pacific Northwest. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great. Almost completely shot in the outside, the images are crisp and beautiful. You can smell the wind that runs through the leaves. <br /> <br /> Technically this is the way the film comes - it's just a heart.
