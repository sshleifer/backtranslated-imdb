Yes, it is summarized. This movie was awesome. I wanted to take my eyes for two minutes. This has been praised as an "innovative LDS comedy", but much less for members of that church! I do not think that a human being has to be a victim of not being a victim of a low-quality movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, you can say that this film has not made any effort. It seems that the crazy, crazy, rumor, and horror of the lands were spoiled together by a crazy, at least semi-coherent, thought-out thought. Then, the performance is shared by everyone sharing it. Although the cameos do not encourage anything. <br /> <br /> And we must not forget that our protagonist believes that we can change the superficial surface that we can think of, but the road is full of bad and bad conversations. "Mordons", and many Mormons are joking, in their minds, LDS or not, that they make everyone stupid *. That must have been the worst movie I've ever seen!
