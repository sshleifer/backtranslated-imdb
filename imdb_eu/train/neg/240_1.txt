I never wanted to comment on a good movie, but in terms of a bad movie, I've been very hard. When talking about Vivah, this type of Sooraj Badjatya seems to have completely lost. After being successful in Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, money can be obtained with the likes of wedding videos. Vilah is so cursed that Badjatyas left Johars and Chopras. <br /> <br /> There was not a single moment in the movie where I can say "Oh!" At least this thing is good. " Aloknath plays the role of the girl's father, Shahid Capoor Grease and Shahrukhed, Amrita Rao is another disaster, looks ugly, bad clothes, dark stories, awesome boys, theater kakofo music. , cheap soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Now, as a spoiler, I warn you all the same as in all its films, an unfortunate incident movie ends after a happy note.
