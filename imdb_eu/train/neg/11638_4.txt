"Blood of the Damned of Blood" is the third part of the games of Gabriel Knight, adventure writers / paranormal adventurers Gabriel Knight. Gabriel and his friend, Grace, asked the prince James Albany to investigate the mysteries that call them "night-time visitors". When the son of James the Prince was kidnapped, Gabriel continues to visit Rennes at night, where the mystery of the Holy Grail begins to play together. <br /> <br /> Although it is marketed, this game is not about vampires. . Vampires play a similar role in the game, but they are never ordered on stage, like Voodoo Hounfor, in elderly "Sines of the Fathers" or "The Beast Within" elm. Gabriel and Grace do not try to investigate the vampires' true nature or vampires. In the game, although vampires kill three people, victims are randomly chosen and have no connection with the main plot. <br /> <br /> The first part of Knight Knight's charm. The division was in Gabriel's complicated relationship. Through these relationships, the player can not help the sympathy with the wicked, and so the criminals made man and monster less. However, in the "Blood of the Sacred", Gabriel's only interaction with a criminal is a bad conversation, a bad dialogue that does not make anyone fascinate him. <br /> <br /> They play Gabriel and Grace roles. In this mystery they are quite insignificant. Gabriel inspects the identities of members of a group of treasure hunts that he has kept in his hotel, but the scrubs are only red. Grace investigates the mystery of Rennes le Château, but all his research is unnecessary for a mysterious ally to know the mystery of this century. <br /> <br /> The actions of this stunning ally and its polar opponent --- vampire heads --- are not valuable. The Allies are releasing notes of the Rennes le Château throughout the day and hopes to find it by Grace (not the rest of the treasury team). However, the mystery of Grace may appear on the 1st day of the whole, for he was kidnapped for 48 hours instead of jeopardizing his children. And finally, it tells the whole mystery of Grace, however, anyway. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the vampire director has not achieved the goals he has made for centuries, because he decides to avoid the action in two days' time. child kidnapping The only reason that decides to delay actions is to try their victory. <br /> <br /> The game would be much better if it only centered on the Grail Sanctuary. Hijackers and vampires should be excluded, to find the mystery of Rennes le Château with an anti-Vatican race. Gabriel is depicted more than once as a Catholic religion, this conflict would have many opportunities for the character to develop. <br /> <br /> In the end, the game was a disappointing installment of the series, despite the improved interface and Tim Curry's return as Gabriel Knight's voice.
