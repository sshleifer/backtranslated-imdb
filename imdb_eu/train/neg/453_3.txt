Ok, first of all: Cher's screening and cinematography. Although I'm not a fan of Cher, it's a great performance and he has written his work well. Made cinematography and romance. <br /> <br /> The Rest: a thin line, the performance of Nicholas Cage, and pure and weak hopes to represent the Italian-American family from New York. First, Cage opened his mouth every time he opened his mouth. I do not know what kind of accent he wanted to use. Honestly, no, I have never heard that there was no New York or an Italian accent. It was quite surreal. And I did not bet on accuracy, my voice was tight in my ears. And I like Nicholas Cage in other shows. Secondly, this is anecdotal, but I have a lot of Italian relationships, many friends and acquaintances in New York, and, in fact, I have got more laughter and I felt the Italian ethnographic family much happier. And that would be a boring night at home. What to leave
