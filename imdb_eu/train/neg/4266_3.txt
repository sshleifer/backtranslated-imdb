No doubt, NOMAD will see some of the best scenes, spectacles and scenic scenes of the horses, but this film is not going to take off. It helps, but the story has to shine on these things. Nomad walks wandering. <br /> <br /> The story is sharp, it gives a sense to be together, to make a "cool" movie with a "great look". It is noteworthy that many of the main characters are not the story that occurs in the region (and it is obviously clear from the names of Lee and Hernandez). If filmmakers want to get into the culture like Jugars and Kazaks, it's better to act actors / actors. <br /> <br /> The love of the Earth battles, prophecy, brother and respect, and our "heroes" touches so much effect and screen time, as most spectators will abandon the next battle sequence, the next action scenes for horses or the unique beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> It is noteworthy that significant changes have taken place in the film, especially the director and the director. He replaced Ivan Passer (director) with Sergei Bodrov, and Ueli Steiger (director) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In one sense, it seems that Laustsen has had better eyes that the earth has seen the last cut we see here. It's definitely a good thing. However, perhaps Bodrov-like director has no chance to be the most sensible. Looking at what I see here, I look at battles and not people, what I feel is what comes from Bodroven's eyes and not the Passerena. Real traction <br /> <br /> The most embarrassing party is that it could be a really wonderful film, as it has nature and action. Unfortunately, senior staff decided that action was necessary and that it was a cheap (intellectually speaking) way. <br /> <br /> Although this film has not given a positive score, it is worth seeing. to make amazing filmography only. But that's all.
