This movie was not horrible, but it was not very good. I'm a great fan of Toni Collette. I think it's a very beautiful and talented actress. He gets a 14-year-old boy's book about Robin Williams. The book is great and can not believe it was written by a child. Toni Collette plays child care, you do not know if this boy is really there or not. I do not spoil the movie, but I will say that the movie is not terrifying. <br /> <br /> The play is pretty good and it has been excellent performances by Toni Collette, as well as Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> I'd like to wait for the DVD to come up with a great disappointment.
