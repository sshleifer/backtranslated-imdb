"Algie, Minador" is a silent comedy. The slapstick's time is off completely. Is this humor, with certain sequences, supposed to be fun or not? However, the true quality of the movie is irrelevant. This is a must see for filmmakers, especially because it is one of the first examples of gay cinema. Algie's main character is an evil man and in many early movies is similar to the typical "pansy" stereotyped. The film has a homophobic attitude at that time. "Algie, Minador" is horrible, but the historical view is wonderful. (3/10)
