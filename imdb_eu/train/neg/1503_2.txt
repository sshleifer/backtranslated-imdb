incredible Fidanik (also a spiritualist) was the cheapest director in the world. This movie stole the original title titled "Duck you sucker" by Leone. but tell the boredom story of a Pinkerton agent against the "Testa di Ferro" murderer (Gordon Mitchell, unexpectedly). They are all poor and crazy in this film shot in lovers of Lazio landscape. The story is bad and crazy at the same time. Fidanik was not capable and naive at the same time. The story went into some crazy illogical things (the talk at Sheriff's house and the look of Butch Cassidy's, !?!?!?! Yes, really, Butch Cassidy, depicted as stupid.) Terribles nuit americaine, a composition of absurdity, a bad performance and an illusion, given by one of the best prizes of the Italian TV series Renzo Arbore. Oh, of course: Klaus Kinski. Yes, it is very good and horrible, but I am convinced that money was only played with iron horses) 2 to 10 but ... IT IS NOT IT IT !!!
