Hollywood, hype, glamor and profits, is hardly a spiritual guide, so it is not surprising that the attempts to investigate spiritual life are very thin and often stupid (we will go much further) Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman's films to analyze the representations of spirituality. "Strange charge" is no exception. Adventure distributes the pure hybrid between the cinema, the love story and the religious parables, trying to communicate this. Image of Probation and Salvation Verne (Clark Gable in his most fashionable and self-respecting) and Julie (when Joan Crawford, in any other word, seems to be the Queen of Dames). we like it most. Does the Star System's guardian work in order to send more unforeseen servitudes in the ground of M-G-M in line with the war of war? BUT . . Here are good supporters, and visually arrested moments: baroque barracks barracks; a boat that escapes from the moon or a cloud of clouds; Julie walks across the shoreline while the winds rise; Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre) negotiate the freedom of Verne as they build the storm; Privileged gay prison between two inmates. . Especially for Paul Lukas's intelligent performance and disassembly, Hessler, the murderer who can appreciate Cambreau's virtues, however, turns his back on him. In the most amazing moment of the movie, Hessler left Cambra leaving the cabin. We hear the wind in the jungle, we see shadows on the face, fear and self-doubt. Then he went into the night. At this time, Hessler also does not achieve the ambiguity, depth, and existential strength that he achieves. Is secret cinema that its deepest sympathy is linked to Hessler?
