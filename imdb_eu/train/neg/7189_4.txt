What a disappointment! The 6.1 score on the IMDb generated slight expectations, but I was disappointed. First and foremost, these stereotypical and double school children are wrong. Yes, I know that teens can be children, but why they were always depicted as filthy writers? I thought that I thought it was a good character, but it did not stop (it is not revealed) before it ended. The other characters were badly executed and the alleged heroes / heroes did not even do for me. A good bet: The plot is pretty good, and the production gives a cut above the value. The plays were not very good, Rutger Hauer emphasizes in a small role. But it fails with warm and warm characters. After 10 minutes, you just have to stop paying attention. 4/10 (and it's generous).
