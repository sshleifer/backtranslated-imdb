I do not believe the praise of this film. The play and the movies were in Sleuth. Michael Cain wanted Olivier and wanted Reeves Cain. Caine also had a remake of Sleuth, played by Jude Law in the original part. Jude Law? Do you mean a "Alfie" version? <br /> <br /> When this film was taken during a period of Caine's career, it became clear that paying the game debts. He did nothing to get money. He won such awards, such as "Beyond Poseidon Adventure" movie star. It seems that the praise of this film is being conducted, the death of Reeves. It's better to remember than the movie. And Cain also. This movie can be found at Walmart's $ 5.97 bin. In addition to the precious stones like "The Island" and "Blame the Riojan."
