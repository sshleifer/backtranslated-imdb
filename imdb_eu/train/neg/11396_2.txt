Rolfe Kanefsky, an inexperienced erotic horror master, eventually makes a movie that does not end up with Playboy Channel. "The Hazing" takes everything from Evil Dead before "Nightmare" by Elm Street, but yet, it's just enough to watch it ... just hardly. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wood, the story is thin paper and the actors could not get out of a variety of food bags. Put all this together and you need a movie mulch ball film. Sometimes, when I get bored, I want to eat the paper. Watching this movie is very similar. Divide for 90 minutes and leave your mouth taste strangely and you have no nutritional value.
