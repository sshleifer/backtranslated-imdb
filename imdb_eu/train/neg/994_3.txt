This movie is daunting and simple. She's okay about a girl who has been raped, and another man to be revenged rape her. Since then he has been a converter, but he is the victim's fault. I mean both of them are happy and started to start kissing, but when trying to get sex with the rapist, he does not let his rapist rap. And the rape is very short for the little girl, and she does not show or show anything, but when rapist is forced to rape, rape is quite long. There's nothing in the story that's worth watching. 3.2 / 10
