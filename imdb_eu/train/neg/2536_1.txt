My wife and I have finished watching BÃ»su AKA The Booth. I was hanging out in some parts of the movie. I really want a recovery, but it's unfortunate that the voice of the main character is so subdued and penetrating that I could not sleep was impossible for me. When our protagonist speaks, Regis Philbin and William Shatner want to hear the karaoke. It also has no recovery features. I expected the movie could hit me by bus for five minutes. <br /> <br /> I'm not bad, I like horror movie in Asia, but Booth is very angry and full of scenes. It does not make any sense. If you want a good Asian movie, check out A Two Sisters or Into The Mirror story. Avoid the Pavilion like plague, especially if you suffer from migraines.
