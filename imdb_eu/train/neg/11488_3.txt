It's hard to find anyone who has the shortest movies in their short film, but I know humor is very subjective. I have seen all the shorts of sound (the most remote of the IMO), and I found one of their least efforts. <br /> <br /> This was done in the year (1930) Stan and Babe 15. shorts and a feature. They were very well-known and his leader Hal Roach took full advantage of his work continuously. In addition, it was time for writers and Stan's experimentation. It was really not an experiment I would say. As it is said by another, it does not strike its forces. Conversation and lots of plots. <br /> <br /> The best part of this is Improvised Sequence by Stan with Agnes Maid and Thelma Todd with the "little girls" things. If you really want boys to see Blotto or Brats the same year. <br /> <br /> They made so many short films in such a short time, I think there is less than enough to forgive. 108 films did something similar. Very few (except FOX) were mere flaws but there were some. County Hospital, Me And My Pal, The Ghost Ghost, The Fixer Uppers find us basically weak. Others, however, will find something wonderful in all his shorts. A record in my book. <br /> <br /> If you have seen and enjoyed other shorts, by the way, look at this, but I would be willing to remember that Stan was more memorable and Babe.
