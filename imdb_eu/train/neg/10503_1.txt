Yesterday I watched the movie. I rented the Blockbuster DVD. Indeed, I know one of the actors of the film. I will not say who ...! (This is kept under bare ..) But I must admit, I thought it was not so good ... Tom Savini? Congratulations to that guy ... But it's shameful that there was not a film in the long run. The idea, the script, the sound, etc. is missing the movie. The movie might look good ... but it was not. it's entertaining <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Well, I'm glad that my sister has paid Â£ 10 to rent a Block DVD DVD3. I chose this ... and I was disappointed. However, for me thumbs down ...! It's not my tea cup! From 0 to 10!
