Against another reviewer, I think that this is well-written, especially fictional because it requires more imagination; They worked well, because they did not have other characters, with whom to focus more than a dozen minutes, well-trained monologues. But I am not entertained by famous and divine memories. They all have a story to tell and more interesting than others. They all have problems and some are more intense than others. These are ten, non-atrophic stories and problems that are exemplified by anyone's life (or part of it). Again, I also think that TV show's reality is wrong. So this is your bag, this would like. They are things that would make the phone or internet hungry good; but rather than verbal action. And, if each speaker is a female, I will leave the genre.
