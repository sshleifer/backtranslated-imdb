A loud conversation, interesting characters and interviewing (at least) conversations have a television production, which is hardly an interesting one with a million dollar production budget. <br /> <br /> The characters are not credible, their motivations, actions or their professions. The plot has Dungeons and Dragons (TM) bad, but with plasma rifles and force fields. They have a serious continuity and the relationship between characters is empty and, nevertheless, this author wincing. <br /> <br /> Avoid pestilence. You will see sections of Dark Angel and a better performance, conversation and plot. Yuck
