I was expecting a documentary about the tobacco industry in North Carolina. Instead, I saw the duke's family say that a grandparent had lost the tobacco empire. And that's going on and forth. Had McElwee's family been over, McElwee would have trouble with the illness of tobacco-related illnesses. I grew up in the nearby village of McElwee's tobacco business; I expected more than McEwee's constant focus on his family. I learned very little about the history of agricultural tobacco and the branches of the state economy for tobacco regulation. There are many references to the "Bright Leaves" movie. So, Mr. Gary Cooper Would he make Grandpa's Grandpa's Grandpa? Does the viewer understand North Carolina's role as a tobacco maker in the movie of a fictional movie? I did not.
