Once you can sit through this movie, but I could question it the second time. Lindsay Lohan's physical presence is especially entertaining. Matt Dillon's fun (thought Something About Mary) and the rebuilding of a play by Micheal Keaton. This is not a fun love The Bug Bug was but watchable. One of my major rejection of the movie was Herbie R2D2, the most popular. I got bored before the enlightenment of the second period of those 30 seconds, and the magazines and curves that used the front protector caused me the same reaction. Go see this with your kids, that is, "single-digit" kids and do not expect much of that movie. <br /> <br /> _X
