It is reasonable for me that this film is coming from Hollywood, often because Hollywood is just competition. It makes sense to think that people who like to play a movie are not reacting to the content of the story unless you think they are reacting a lot. However, this movie is excessive. Eddie Murphy looks hilarious. In any case, Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles gave Oscar performances, so many were condemned before the film. I can not believe that what happened to the director named Condon Oscar, when he collected all his albums. Glitz does not represent anything. The bunch of songs does not film.
