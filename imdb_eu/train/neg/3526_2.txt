(Spoiler included, some would say) <br /> <br /> This movie is not possible to take it seriously. In some parts it's so stupid, I'm not laughing at everything. Try to tell me that the character of Stallon leaps 20 meters in full climb or 20 meters (and this is my favorite one) to a bad man stuck to a stalactite. Yes, how bad was it to meet these values? I do not know, but it surely gives the reality to make money.
