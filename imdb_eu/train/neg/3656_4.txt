I must admit that I am remembering that Samurai is a salesman for filmmaking. Although I saw it separate, "elitist" was like the work of the Seven Samurai or bloody bloody comic book such as Lone Wolf and Cub. I liked US / Japanese "Crossovers" like "Bushover Blade". And, of course, with Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada. And I've seen them almost twice as tender. But not Kabuto. <br /> <br /> I first saw Kabuto in 1993, that samurai movies can be boring. Initially, I wanted to get to Europe in Mayeda, and the conflicts that would come about, but when I arrived in Spain I did not care so much. <br /> <br /> It would not be fair to call the movie "bad". It is technically a net entry for the genre. But it's just never quite quiet. Sho Kosugi has limited abilities as a director and actor, and the aforementioned actor has only part of Japanese charisma. The son of Sho Kosugis, Kane, Sho Kosugi, appears as a son of Shos in all films: his parents have inherited from limited acting skills. Adding in the minus points was the absence of blood and until then it was the brand of all Samurai movies. These were for Americans / European youth audiences. <br /> <br /> Let us say that the average action-adventure adventure is a movie, but it is bored by samurai movie fans. "Samurai Encounters ??" - The genre, called Red Sun (1971), is to go with cowboy Charles Bronson, who must be a member of Samurai Toshiro Mifume, to recover the samurai of Alan Delon's sword. . It's just how to do it and how it went Kabuto. <br /> <br /> So, if the movie is just 100 minutes, it looks like a movie longer. <br /> <br /> <br /> I gave this reason for 4/10 points for this one instead of 3/10; I saw this movie for the first time in the German synchronized version. In this version you can really understand Kosovo. I must admit that "Engrish" is sometimes fun, but it's tiring after about 30 minutes.
