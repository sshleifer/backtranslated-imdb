The trailer for this movie was enough to rent a DVD. However, the resulting movies are completely dire! Actually, it's never been the worst movie or worst movie this year, but it's been shut down! <br /> <br /> The main theme is the movie that he does not know what he wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? The story is interesting because it deals with email orders, but the movie is wrong. "Comedy" begins as a commercial (the word that uses the word as much as possible), vice versa, and then the misogynistic throne becomes very obscure and unpleasant. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin is wasted! Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, just like those who can only earn money. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad at all times. It's not funny, it's almost so sexist that it's almost Benny Hill's all he could do, and the dramatic element is just a misfortune. A movie must be avoided, unless Kidman or Chaplin ever seen them in every movie!
