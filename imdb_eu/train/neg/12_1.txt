Everything I thought of seeing this movie was in B-grade. The filmmakers who have spoken about this dissolution represent a realist who represents the effects of drugs and individuals, and the current spiral continues with the situation of unfortunate events. In fact, the techniques used (as mentioned above) were excessive and, therefore, they had no doubt and were irrelevant in the film. <br /> <br /> In the field, there is little, it is not inconceivable, impossible. and confusing. You can read most of this film's reports and tell you what I want. <br /> <br /> There are several actors and actors that are attractive, but with such a boring action ... they can now look like a movie. The action is inadequate and intense: there are some punches here and there and a final shot at the end. Nothing was written at home. <br /> <br /> As others have said, 'BAD' films are very good to see 'bad' for the same reason. This movie, however, is a gap. It's nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you need a film education to repel people for drug use, I would highly recommend it to other topics for more. effectively "Requiem for a dream", "Trainspotting", "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" and "Candy" are just a few examples. Although others would have to watch short films, such as 'Go' (generally, seriously and funny) and 'Halfbaked'. <br /> <br /> In the last note, it is possible to recover the line. Vinnie Jones's movie, Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels, was stolen. That part of this great movie is "Loaded" to think we're infected. <br /> <br /> In general, I suggest saving money and saving your time without NOT watching this movie.
