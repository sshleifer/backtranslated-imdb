This movie is horrible. Give me a dentist anytime! Do you think Arabian television is one of the main television channels as a Christmas movie? I can only assume that people are hoping to entertain with Dudley Moore. The last activity I watched on the hot water bottle, more performances, more land, more drama and much more interesting celluloid waste. Do not even drink it!
