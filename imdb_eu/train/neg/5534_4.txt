I'm working on the 2000 Classics Movie Scrambling Pack and I'm REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES, one of the films in this series. I'm watching the daughter of the eight-year-old daughter, and that's why most of the movies laugh. <br /> <br /> I awaited ZOMBIA IZARRA after watching White Zombie, that is, really the main zombie movie has been a pioneer (thinks Clive Barker's snake and Rainbow and James Bond live and let funeral theater, NOT Night of the Living Dead). <br /> <br /> However, despite the title "zombie", it's only a triangle of love that Armand Louque's anthropologist hits with Claire Duval. Who is at the same time taking his friend Clifford Grayson. What did the party have, my daughter slept halfway down. <br /> <br /> I was real time to describe the people who worked for them: allies or axes; But, actually, that does not matter. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see the movie Bela Lugosi; but, of course, these were his eyes (White Zombie), a zombie intelligence control device.
