Oh, where did you start ... the movie was terrifying. It was a bad writing, the action was bad, the special effects were bad. I think that the only thing about this movie is to laugh at it. I had a horror movie, but I do not! I thought it was pretty decent, I'm not my mind. I've seen some horror movies. In fact, my goal is to see all the horror movies, no matter how dramatic they may be. At the moment of the film I made a comment on the "blood syrup" on the blood, and in special features it was marked Karo syrup (brand corn syrup ...) The movie had all the necessary things for a horror movie. (blood, nudity, crazy murderer, stupid movements) but there was nothing short of really good to do. The writer needs to take classes or just give up!
