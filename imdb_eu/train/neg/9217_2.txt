Yes, the only thing that is memorable in this movie, Tom Hanks was a young man, and a few more Hollywood stars. Here, however, there is no movie that will show much more, and the only thing that may be a bit entertaining about this movie is the scene that monsters see. Yes, this movie is about a group of people who are trying to make use of their imagination and create gambling scenarios. Basically, a special type of school is Dungeons and Dragons poorly retitled here after special Mazes and Monsters game. Apparently, the authors of this film believed that the nerds would not have a good time, like the low-end drinking, medication, unprotected sex, and other weaker children. No, when people were playing a game that was bad, there really was no brain, no sky! It is not, if they have a brain, they can think of themselves thinking about themselves and clearing themselves out of certain groups. Yes, I think this movie is a fool and a waste of time. We say that it might be a movie against addiction, but there are still fewer dying than Dungeons and Dragons, much less than dead, but more than a month's drunkenness.
