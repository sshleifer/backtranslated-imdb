Bo is Jane Parker, her long-lost anthropologist father (Richard Harris, the worst role of an incongruent career) who is learning something in Africa. It pulls away (how?) And tells the stories of the locals to hear the night voices in a jungle monster. It has become Ape Man himself (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the best conversation on the film) rescued from him, and falls in love with him, leaving him for two-hour disturbance. She looks ridiculous monkey and applause. Normally, I put different opinions on any movie, but it's just one exception. It's the worst movie ever. If you do not agree, you have not seen it. (Notes: Newsday calls the "offensive", which is the best summary that they can think, the Maltese Movie Guide warns that they should think less than the BOMB).
