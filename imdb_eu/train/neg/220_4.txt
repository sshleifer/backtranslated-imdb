"The Crush" is a pleasure for 40 friends, something romantic for two-thirds, that is, "Sex and the City". <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the character of the youngest troupe (think that we do not see much physical body and Kenny Doughty is to see more). <br /> <br /> Surely older men / women are much more versatile than in "Sabrina" versions (I do not like films) or Douglas / Zeta. -Jones or Dion / Svengali weddings. <br /> <br /> With performances by Andie MacDowell, otherwise British drama and comedian friends will be welcome, such as the Anna Chancellor tarts-tongued. <br /> <br /> The final line is deus ex machina. But I did not realize that it was really wrong when the credits came to an end. As with "Sex and the City", the writer / director is male, here I believe that John McKay is a first-class tempered man and I guess he wanted to make a script about three gay men, probably before their lovers. And at work (characters are the main schools, police and doctors), a better and more interesting film. The title of the film was "The Sad F * cker Club" and it would also be clear to the gay "Broken Hearts Club". <br /> <br /> (originally written 04/6/2006)
