Oh, how do we make a mistake here? so bad a movie, your mind will ask yourself at other things, and it will come to other things, if you lose the unproductive production values ​​of your brain. worst and racist stereotype D.W. Griffith mentioned the Chinese character of Broken Blossoms, named "yellow man"; That character is so funny and non-funny, it's hard to see, as well as a narrative, with slow, stupid and nonsensical rhythms, when we ask people who like this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> The rupture that John Huston plays in the movie is a confused and nonsensical one. Kathleen Turner and Jack Nicholson look at each other, and all others fill gaps with people who cry or cried with a mournful stereotype or cries with a typical character. Prizzi's Honor is a movie that includes neo-noir, comedy, love, action, gangster and a genre of crime in general? his agreement with his conductor and the cast has to be enough for a certain impulse of a story; a sort of good sequence scene; a script or something else, but not some kind of mind? What we get is not a dirty movie. <br /> <br /> I will give some examples to a terrifying show of a movie. First of all, the film thinks it's a love story and thinks about an hour's time: MY time. Charley Partanna (Nicholson) is a murderer, a murderer who dies in a family in New York, and yet his character resembles One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, an international hitman. Irene Walker (Turner) knows another murderer and falls in love and tears, but as the plot does not excuse, it seems that everything is not there. In the plot of this movie I read: "Successful professional and wife fall in love with their wife, only hired to kill one another." Well, yes, but the real revelation does not take place until twenty minutes! Nicholson plays Partanna with his 60th birthday. seemingly watching and talking about what he does; If he's drunk, he's inside and a bigger problem, he's a killer every time we do not feel it? the wrong shot of the initial assassination (actually on the screen) is not enough for the guy to be a hard body, the best international hitman. <br /> <br /> So, with the main character who is un-likable and un-realistic, we move the script. It's just the first hour and a half of the film site, it always suggests that the tragedy of life's destiny is only by bad convictions: Partanna surrounds the phone or asks people repeatedly: "I married her?" I love her? What is love? What do I do? "And it's so common, though it's not a bit of humor, which has always been reconciled to someone in the phone, a girl named Maerose Prizzi (Huston), the daughter of John's daughter, who was no one at all on earth and, It seems that the father and his daughter told how she had spent time with Parthia, and she loved her, she thought, was it fun? I laughed? The movie felt the mafia as an elegant picture of the beginning of a wedding scene (The Godfather), which resulted in scenes As black as touching the gangster, police and murderers entered the film. Something that we get is very different. <br /> <br /> It's about a second-hour kidnapping plot - right, love and romance - it might even start to film They felt very bad: more characters are talking slowly and quietly, we have a kidnapping scene, leaving their office a guy that's in it: this scene sums up the movie. Everything is planned for a while and then it is executed manually and in a mood that looks like a cheesy look. We will not see a dramatic music coming; surely to get to the lifts by security; Should civilians be careful when they are hiding in the places they choose and when they are pulled out of a random woman's elevator and when the gun is in place? The scene has not been edited correctly. Some suspicions, some drama: "I'm shooting or not?"; maybe slow motion to draw the character quickly before it's too late? how it was done. The pride's honor is monotonous and interesting, and continues to be overlooked by you, as it approaches its height. The movie is a camera that is reflected in the windows; The lights are reflected on the sides of cars and the "dead" drivers are blinking. Prizzi's Honor is a dirty and dirty movie that will allow all filmmakers to test their patients and not say it was a comedy, did not I laugh? It's another matter. The movie is repetitive, its color and colorless look and originality; here is no honor.
