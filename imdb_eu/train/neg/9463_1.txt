Continuing desire and a degressive attitude towards classical children's stories, not only the charm of his ancestor, but never has any talent. Mike Myers should not be ashamed of the enormous performance against Jim Carrey, but everyone needs to work together. So it's annoying if you want to jump over film, if you can jump directly to the movie. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor. This year I've seen a lot of bad movies, but this is not just a cake, but it's definitely a movie that's made worse.
