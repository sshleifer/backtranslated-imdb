This movie was interesting; I read the book a few years ago, and warned me that the feature line was pretty good. <br /> <br /> I began to look at it and could not wait until the beginning. Actually, I did not see the whole thing ... totally immersed in it - bad performances, bad performances, and the characters that did not like it at all - it was the point of the movie. <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie left my taste in my mouth and I went down to the rest of my weekend. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about this feature.
