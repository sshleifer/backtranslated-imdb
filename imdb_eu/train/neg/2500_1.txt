Van Dien had a great deal of apprehension about the memory full of malicious films, as well as all the people involved. Actually, I have to admit that I had seen from the beginning to the end. The production values ​​are among the series of "Crossroads" and "Prisoner Cell Block H" series. Most young five-year-olds would come up with a more realistic and likely plot. On plays, you can imagine the litter you've ever seen - something that will end with a 'story' everywhere, explaining how the old boiler boiler came up. He removes mustache with mustache - You will have the idea of ​​standard "Maiden Voyage". Even worse, you can not advance the sex scene because it is not there. An incredibly terrifying movie.
