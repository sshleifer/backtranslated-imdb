There are two reasons why I did not give a movie 1. There was a reason why some actors (such as Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) worked, they tried to play normally. However, in many scenes, some scripts were blocked incorrectly. <br /> <br /> Another reason that Cyborg's idea is fresh and looks is that it's different from what I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> It may be as bad as everything else in this movie. Scary scenes, unforeseeable and boring interviews, misguided guides. It seems to be the first movie ever of many cast members. The story could have been interesting, but they completely failed.
