Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong, and James Gleason's three groups play Coney Island carnations for Ginger Rogers, who sells water salty sleeves. When the First World War appeared, the three-party group is moving away. The first part of the RKO Pathe production is very difficult: three men are eating bad landscapes, shaking rapidly with overloaded overloads and "rapid" conversations. The second half is based on action sequences, because the US military is looking for a German merchant cruise and an U-boat. These sequences are intense and well shot, but in general a dramatic comedy is long and insoluble. Only for star lovers.
