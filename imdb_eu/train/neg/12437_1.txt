'Home Alone 3' is the first of the "Home Alone" movie to not feature Culkin protagonists and criminals alike. However, the plot is similar to "Home Alone". Two instead of comic nasty, we get three or four of them. This movie involves some trap, but it also has a long scene with a remote control car. Slapstick humor is also consistent, but guys and criminals have no effect on this film. This movie is not something new or different than the previous films, and there is no feeling or infrastructure during the holiday season with the other two films. It's a comedy, but it did not make me laugh, the characters really did not. I would not recommend the movie; It's boring. If you are looking for a good family movie holiday with comedy, watch the original 'Only' movie.
