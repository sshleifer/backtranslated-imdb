This movie does not encourage children to be really enjoyable and promote better attitudes, like a family movie, which should not be considered as a family, but it does not have children. It's not ABC Family's best movie. If there are less sexual issues in the movie, it would be better. Hollywood does nothing to add sex situations to a better movie. There's really no reason. It's at least a television movie. I would not rent the money to lose litter. If you want to see other films, follow them.
