Sorry I missed something? did I leave early? Unusual stories (and lie!) In the first ten minutes I thought "This will be a classic" but that's all down the hill! The play was excellent, because William H Macy is wonderful for what he deserves and I watch every movie better and better, but never seemed connected. I was waiting for all the stories to connect with each other and, suddenly, ... rain storm ?? The writer said "I have been deeply involved, how can I put the stories together clearly ... Oh, it will be just rain frogs." I like light movies, I like strange movies, but this was very curious and boring. 4/10
