This is literally the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Perhaps the worst film is possible. Some movies are very good; This film is a very bad thing, because it passes through a pleasant camp, and it simply turns into a terrible fright. It's anti-enantiodromy. We wanted to buy it to denounce him, and all my family gathered around to make fun afternoonings for fun; Instead we sat in a stunning silence, when Peter Sellers pityed him. <br /> <br /> The Lord of the Sun is worse than the animated one. Matrix is ​​worse than the succession. It's worse than Krull. Batman is worse than any movie. <br /> <br /> Do not let it, at any rate, let this movie come to ten feet of your television.
