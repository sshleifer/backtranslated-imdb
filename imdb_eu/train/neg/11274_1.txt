Cinematic enthusiasts decided to write another review to get a point about this movie. The last time I got some things ... <br /> <br /> First of all, the script. Secondly, acting. Thirdly, Jesus Christ, what did he think of doing such a piece of garbage and then enjoying it, from the beginning to the end, if there is no functionality that Joseph Fiennes had thrown at a great moment without a great taste? <br /> I can not believe that when I lost my money I gave it to a homeless person or a busker or a LIVE! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do you get the picture?
