This is a very well-defined group (which I'm not part of) a great resource. I watched the preview of this movie knowing what was expected. In the end, I failed. The history of a dysfunctional unusual (often "twisted") Hungarian family is not my tea cup. Such an epic saga would eventually give the viewers something more. In the end, such as the image is about human condition - this image hardly reveals any of the most significant aspects of the new.
