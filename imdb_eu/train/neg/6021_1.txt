I can not believe that they spent $ 17 million in this movie. You can play generous scripts and effects on your average computer, incredible plot contrivances ... Can an accomplished inexperienced stewardess get an important job from the UN? What Not only that, but the message of this movie is so insidious that you feel like trying to try yourself with a crucifixion. All this movie will preach before the choir and laugh at laughing at others laughing. The authors of this film really want Christianity to dominate people and want to believe they really want to make the money they would use to help the people they really needed. Now, some people might be listening to them.
