Here I will explain, the worst sequel to the classic movie I watched. In 1950, Disney nominated one of the biggest films of his time. Now Take away the great songs, add a bad plot, look like the lost TV series. "Put together and what do you get?" The biggest Crud load ever seen. After seeing this, I thought it was the end of Disney. Cinderella should finish "never lived happily". not this garbage. This film does not deserve such a succession. I thought that it was as "moderate as a season", but better than that. What's more, Anastasia likes? Iago changed the differences, but he did not help anyone.
