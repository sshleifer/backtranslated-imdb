This is the worst film ever. Fortunately, I like movies, but that's great. Where are the images in the box? I think I've spent more money on DVD box illustrations than the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Why should a company cover a DVD that is so misleading? I feel this box strictly rent a movie. I'd like to do a little research as I explore, and before visiting the video rental shop. I do not blame myself except. I want my money and time. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Although you are motivated by curiosity, stick cocktails in your eyes. It will be much more enjoyable. You have been warned!
