I rented this movie for an Academy Award after hearing about it, but after seeing it, it's easy to know why it was not. Although beautiful photography, the film moves very slowly, it has almost no plot. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a boy who wants to rescue his parents from his death. It has been an accident (this film is never clear), and grandma told her the fairy tales. Fairy tales are the only parts of the plot that are of interest, but they are very short and they do not really seem like it. <br /> <br /> In the first stories, especially the dying girlfriend is trying to save her boyfriend's magic flower, but the boy tastes before the flower, because the results are not poisonous. Later, when he spent a few seconds to save his girlfriend, his father said it was too much abuse, but that has not made any sense. The true metaphor of this movie really is. <br /> <br /> Skye's photos are beautiful, but this year's Stardust movie was a movie fairy filmed in Skye and is a very beautiful picture and much better than that.
