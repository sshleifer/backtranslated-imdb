Since birth I grew up in a "very Christian" house. I was saved when I saw this movie and the rest of the series and I had to see it in a group of my church. This movie was very disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally I had nightmares in those years. It was awake in bed and I heard the sounds of my mother's footsteps. If I do not hear his steps, I would go into it because they did not steal me. At night I prayed so hard for salvation, because Jesus forgot about it. This is definitely not something that I will show to my children until they are much older, though. They gave me years to shake my fear of this movie.
