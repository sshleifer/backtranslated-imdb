This film was the film that he painted as director, intellectual level, plot and theme. The slow moving movie is like a section of the Wonder Years, though it's a huge lack of depth. He also fails his message in a convincing manner. <br /> <br /> The approach to painting is a very elite, limited to "vanguard", limited and subjective terms. According to the makers of this film, "beauty" Bob-Ross style landscape can only live in kitsch. According to this film, good art can be achieved by applying basic color (primary education) and achieving a lot of feelings. Part of the movie is wrong, eg. it is explained in a moment (but it is celebrated on a table dance) that mentally ill is not capable of having emotions or drawing; By definition, his works are not valid, "lies" (quote). <br /> <br /> I do not understand how the movie got a high score, and again, so far, it has not been rated by many people, and they have only chosen very high or very low grades.
