This week I saw the movie and I'm remembering a lot. I remember a lot about it. It is a story about a group of criminals who flee from the criminal colony space. They fly to the moon for the storage space warehouse; when they shudder the stars of the men who work in the moon. <br /> <br /> It seems that low-budget science fiction cycles often involve desert scammers or criminals fleeing colonial films. . Why I have no idea But I can safely say that these films are always diabolical. This is no exception. It is reasonably beginning with a decent credit sequence and, on the other hand, with a straight dancing medium-sound medium. Science-fiction thriller became boring. So, in this movie, there has been little consequences that I am literally writing a helpful review, so if you're reading, I apologize, I'm not telling you about the nuances and nuances of the movie. For the rector, I remember a dreadful bundle of wicked, good-natured greetings, some nuclear heads and the hologram of a bare woman. On the other hand, I'm fighting. If you think you might be interested in lunar laundry activities, I would not hesitate to recommend this film. I would also recommend you to send your sleeping bags to your friends and those who want to steal their bags.
