That was just awful. I read this book for school, I did it as I did in all the tests, and that way! My teachers forced me another 20 people and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 Outer Space and Hudson Hawk. This movie was so great that it was enough to kill yourself. First, it was made in Hallmark. Second, the play was horrible. Thirdly, it was completely different to the book. Literally, I asked for forgiveness so bad. In essence, I would like to see the basic instinct 2 rather than seeing it. Take my advice, do not watch the movie. Nobody would want to see this. It was horrible. AMAZING!
