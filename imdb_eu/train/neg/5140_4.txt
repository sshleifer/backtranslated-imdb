Demer Daves is a brilliant director in the western world, and the "broken arrows" remain. Regarding the melodrama, it would be best to get acquainted with the wonderful Vincente Minelli, George Cukor or Douglas Sirk. The script is so easy to predict and you will not be surprised once you see a smooth grass. Natalia Wood's character was inspired by Fannie Hurst's "imitation of life" (see Stahl and Sirk), but he believed it was black. Men's Daughters anyway? Susan Kohner was more credible in "imitation of life", and Sinatra and Curtis are so stereotypical as they do not know anything about them: a poor and wealthy, beautiful and sergeant officer. Who loves Natalie? France is the land of tolerance, where interracial unions are welcomed. At that time (around 1944) it was doubtful, it is here and there is a narrow town where you can find it. .
