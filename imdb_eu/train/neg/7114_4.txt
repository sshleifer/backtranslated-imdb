With regard to cinematography, this film was quite good in the mid 50s. Sometimes the light was too hot, but the shots were generally in the frame and focus. The performance was average for the low budget, but the direction was horrible. Several scenes were too long in suspense attempts and there were no effects. The pimple's skull had to be removed from the last board that had to be attacked and the attempts to survive the skulls were revealed with sticks and ropes. Also, I could not help, but they did not give me a quote to supply the house, so they continued to make references to the movement and all the things that are going to be in store will come soon. Honestly ... it would be more entertaining if the movie was worse. It was not bad enough to be "good-bad", but it was not enough to be "good". Get the MST3K version ... it's fun.
