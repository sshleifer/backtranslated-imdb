So why shows this show? Unfortunately, that really is the only question, because there is no doubt. <br /> <br /> For those who are unknown to the premise of the show, Cavemen is punishable by a short-term series. Neanderthal and today's America are based on the fights of being and the characters that appear in the ads of Geico Seguros television. The concept is strong and you can think of all the good reasons to run correctly. <br /> <br /> I had to think it a bit, but then the sketch of ads: something "We We We Are" is not so different "showed me the kidney key. Caves / neanderthals are a different species than humanity, shows We are bored by the characters in this title that are the same as those we are bored. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's my background Game writer - California's most thought-about writer, but a previously written writer - but this show had so much potential, one of them It was not even realized. First of all, producers should focus on fun things that wild men might be different from us. <br /> <br /> What could be fun, for example, for eternal studies and furniture shops for writers, underground workers and cave park guides How would you draw things like prosaic games like squash, when puzzles pass? Whenever they could offer them the hunt for licensing to continue the spear game? He wants to write a show like this, and it requires bad writing to make it boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Another arduous aspect of this show is the effort of the portrait of the human army. The number of stereotypes related to human minorities. Yawn! This has been done so many times before, and that is more than ever drearily. And, as mentioned previously, Neanderthals are a distinct species, so the use of stereotypical rape as a metaphor is not converted and marked. <br /> <br /> Answers are good, including those who want to tell. why am I wrong? I would like to enjoy this show and I like to feel like I have not had it until now. <br /> <br /> Michael J. Varhola, Skirmisher Online Gaming Magazine
