Hee hee hee. This movie is so bad that it does not even try to hide a lot of time. I remember the first day I saw it at MST. Sun was shining like a good day. Then I saw Rick Sloane's product, that is, ruining the ground of the 80's. Kevin, the rocky man, wants to impress his girlfriend, he manages an assistant security guard, stabs him with gypsum and has done much more in this mischievous series of images. No earthquake or story is required. The play is not required as the film proves. A girl from the army and a stupid sexer will make you jump out of the precipice, and dorky friends with your phone will tell you: "It has short reds." Also, I really hate the old security guard and had an accident at his supermarket cart. When you're done, wait until the Club Scum scene. Ask for Road Rash. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie and feel a good month of recovery. And if you'd see Rick Sloane, take an effort to abusive Hobgoblins.
