I may not be a critic, but here I am thinking of the movie. Well, I watched the movie movie and, first of all, I have to say the story I want to add to a little snowman for small children. Secondly, it's pretty bad, but the movie's so low budget is probably used for ketchup, MY MY CRITICAL VOTE BOMB !!! He'll try to enjoy it and suck it twice.
