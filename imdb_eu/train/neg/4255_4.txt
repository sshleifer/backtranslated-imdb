The movie opens with a beautiful woman in stereotyped Eastern European style whitewashing. We know that something is continuing, because it continues to look behind her. and soon we will see that a mysterious man escapes in a black trench. then we realize that the man is actually a vampire hunter and is after him. But does it look like the store window mirror ??? It's not just her twin twin sister! but, unfortunately, after that incredible and entertaining splendor that returns back to the old film-makers of the 60's and 70's (twins are twin evil, of course, twins are listed). hammer's name for the last part of the Karnstein trilogy), it is dying a lot more. <br /> <br /> What plot is small in Drakular (which changes its appearance, when it revives, so the producer is not doing it). I must redirect to the same whirlwind - when I get to a morgue, I realize that medical students are strangers and thinking ... wow what an option, maybe all the films that drink vampire blood. and use the vampire blood to find a cure for our jerk friend's disease. Of course, this is a mistake and everyone becomes a vampire. <br /> <br /> A new concept, but it's wrong. The film continues to set wonderful moments and does not want to do anything with them. <br /> <br /> For example, the meditators dazzle the dragon in a bathtub full of blood in a far away country. palaces The house itself is quite terrifying to be the center of the movie, but are we not left? No, they decide to take them to a vampire abandoned pool. sigh. This movie has a "tribute" problem, as I mentioned in the first scene as a hammer, and this scene of the house would be ideal for a hammer-like movie, but it changes the movie quickly with fear of the gears and the doctor. . <br /> <br /> Another problem is that introducing so many characters is almost impossible to feel any of them. There are both med meds and the kind of teacher of the "wheelchair" of their wheelchair are all med students: arrogant, boring, hungry, and stupid. how did all the med school astonish me, unless the medical school joins its muscular hunk / big breast quota. and there is a vampire hunter who remains mysterious during the film. I can hey respect it, but it would be nice if it were not up to it as it would be about the movie itself. then you have a random priest, police and kind of science. Many people get into it quickly and quickly, until they need to save that person's day or get out of fear. <br /> <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a lazy movie. It's not a real fear, just jump off some predictions. Their design is so elaborate as the horny one. For example, a bathtub full of blood. It's so obvious that drac has come out of dark blood. And yet, we have to wait a long way to repel the inevitable jump. after that, a cancer student and a bigger cancer kills him. We all know that he will become a dead man. But what do others do? bury it in a deep grave near the house. sigh, you know who will jump to show police at home .......... <br /> <br /> Well. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this suggestion is impossible for a terrifying vampire to film and go to the atmosphere, and then we'll end it with all the good movies that are open to the scene. <br /> <br /> <br />
