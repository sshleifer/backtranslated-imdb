A stupid movie with a typical genre of the 80s: action comedy. The concept resembles the hour cycle, but the action, laughter and the main protagonists of this film are lacking. Find out how I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand-up and talk show host, but he can not play. It's shameful when he gets harder - he keeps his mark on his face, frightened on his face, by the way, it's not very funny. And running (even then) is not pleasant. Also, I feel that Pat Morita, according to current regulations, does not give the Japanese a politically correct impression. Do not even start the story. I give it 10 to 10
