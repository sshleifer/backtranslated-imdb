I'm sure in the depth of Jack Blacksen, Nacho Libre is a very funny character, but that's not it. It's a Mexican monk who can hear a whale of some time and can do it with fierce fighters, but this movie fails in all the episodes. <br /> <br /> I was sitting in most of the movies I wanted to be "Fun" and "Tenacious Deko Tip?" Actually, this film has no offer. ALL! The character is a fake script and really correct and acting. Sometimes you'll see if you think something fun would happen, but that's not it. I was bored about 10 minutes stupid but surely received. It was not. 90 minutes later I did not abandon aneurism and it was so painful. <br /> <br /> It seems that you wanted to see something with your actor a few years ago, although some of them were really celebrated before, and you would really be embarrassed that this actor was really worried. Yes, that's right. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of the first films like Jack Black's Shallow Hall and I really hope to see the Destiny Options but the man has come. If you do this again, I'll come Jack and break your legs or something else. At least you're going to talk hard. <br /> <br /> I know it's a topic, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen and that's why it's so much ....
