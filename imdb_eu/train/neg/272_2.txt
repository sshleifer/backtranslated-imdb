When I was younger I saw it bad on TV. We are guilty of some time, but this is a pretext for seeing things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th century" and "Silver Cucharas": I was young and naive; I do not know what a show is worth it. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, now I appreciate the good things. Stargate SG-1 is not good. For 12 years I'd like to know the local bit, all the sharp lines of dialogue, I love every necessary technobabble. Writing is whispering. So a bland and uninspired Star Trek lost: Voyager. If your shows want to make the Trek show the worst, you have trouble. <br /> <br /> Stargate is a wonderful culmination of culprits, given the good performance of James Spader and Kurt Russell. Wonderful architecture and culture of Egypt, wonderful music scores and cool sci-fi ideas. Except for a bit of original music, since the fun movie has not been revealed in this show. Richard Dean Anderson, even if MacGyver saw and had an interesting legend, seemed to sleep half the episode. <br /> <br /> The budget needs to be very low sometimes, some sometimes look like a basement. Cinematography is not much better, vanilla and dull as a handwriting. It seems amazing to me that it shows much more style (like Farscape) and substances (for example, with the renewed Battlestar Galactica) are smaller and less evil fan. It's just worth it.
