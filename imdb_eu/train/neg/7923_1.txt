I'm a Ted V Mikels and I'm the original "corpses of corpses", the main reason why, but I'm probably the worst movie ever I have ever seen. The excellent casting of the legendary "Liz Renay" ("Desperate Living") could not save litter litter. This movie should be a lesson to all filmmakers of the past, today and tomorrow, as it was as successful as the original "bodied flesh", you should stop lying dogs and try to make it definitely resuscitated. After twenty years (unless financial support is given before a second sequence with Herschel Gordon Lewis, "Blood Feast 2: All U can Eat") Even if you decide to do so, you should spend a little bit more than money for the Origin and God's sake more ... OPEN never for the movie ... why do all those who do the movies know that quality is going to be horrible ... I personally have a look at this movie from that fashion and it's worth a bit of a sequel that is better than your original movie. If you do not want to join, it sells the rights of the movie afterwards to someone who can ... and what did Ted V Mikels (or smoke) think about when he wrote this goddess wyl script? Do I mean from a different planet "dogs and cats" from abroad? The cardboard box looks like a destructive machine capable of crushing the human body ... bones and clothes and all? With Liz Renay, one of these actors has paid more than $ 5, he would pay more than excessive remuneration! Avoid the movie with this expense and watch it instead of the original.
