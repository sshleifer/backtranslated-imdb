I did not expect much from this movie after "After a terrible life miracle." It turns out that this film is ten times worse than "Life ...". The impression is that the director / writer is joking with the audience: "Let's see how much you can miss (viewers)." Conversations are empty ... it's a minimalist scenario. Sometimes photography is very enjoyable. Little sarcastic cartoons are half-fun, but it's hard to laugh at this "laugh". I laughed myself to see the movie to the finish line. If you can get up over the fiasco of this director, ... you will play a few short stories (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek), and a good interpretation of the Emir's Stribor Kusturica son. <br /> <br /> In short: bad for a great director! Emir Kusturica is still young and she has to do with the best films. Instead, he decides to make low-budget private low-budget theater, in line with world trends and its irresponsible old-fashioned fans.
