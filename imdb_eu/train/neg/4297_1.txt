Suddenly I wake up that I am aware that I am entering the plastic sofa cover, and I realize that on Saturday afternoon. Why did I sleep? Did i spit on my head? Or did you suddenly swallow all my muscle-relaxing mum's? Can it be an adult's narcolepsy? <br /> <br /> No, I stopped at low speeds in the surfing of the channels, and I drove it with great agony and dreadful talents. <br /> <br /> That's shaking your head, mouth agape, putting on my shoulders. I have to give it a dreadful and boring twin to the idea of ​​selling that idea. Maybe they had the same effect when they had the ESPN programming executives for me, and when they woke up, they would be able to get some excellent sections already and expect all audiences to sleep. It is now huge and can save $ 425,000 a year. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
