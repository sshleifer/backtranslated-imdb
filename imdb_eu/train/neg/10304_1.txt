Here, let me tip my hands over the keyboard, I'll tell you what a salad will order. repeatedly, it works like charm: it's a genius, how does it work? If my scrutiny of my bullshit detectors goes through this vision, if I scan the channels, I have to be careful (these days it is often useful, so I do not have to break that crap idiot ... be careful!). Is it supposed to be fascist propaganda to believe in the invisible people in uberman control and domination? or what? why does it exist? <br /> <br /> This is the harsh show, totally incredible and invented, and I can not understand why it's still in the air. So geeks can give so much time (Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but give you an absurd drivel pass. Shows like Firefly (if they exist) will fall after a season, but things like that without a sensory logic. yeccch.
