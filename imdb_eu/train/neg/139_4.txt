This movie has been rented by a friend. It's a good choice usually. I read the cover first and I expected a good movie. <br /> <br /> It was a horror movie. I do not prefer But it was not horrible to see the movie. The sad movie <br /> <br /> was not so fun. The onset of Denise Richards <br /> <br /> again was the pleasure of the eye. But that is it. We (4) of us <br /> <br /> are a little disappointed. But see this book and <br /> <br /> judge yourself.
