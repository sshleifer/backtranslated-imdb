characters with a smaller depth. I have seen all the characters in other films, I promise. The script tries to be sharp and disgusting but fails to fail. In some relief, Superd comports, but jokes are completely out of the left field, and they are almost completely confiscated after cracking. Hot chick is old and has no personality, in the early thirties, she has some blonde puppies, with a few wise underwear, dressed as fairies. The attraction between Molly (Chick Hot) and Kirk (love interest dorky) is hardly communicated. Finding a totally platonic relationship is not attractive, until there is an incorrect and predictable bad safety. So they have a very close relationship and they are incredibly dramatic. The main goal of this film is not a relationship, but the mere essay with a half-attractive plot with an unnatural super-bad film. I could compare myself to the hangover, with his character obligatory. I do not get into that. I can continue, but it's just amazing. do not pay to watch the movie.
