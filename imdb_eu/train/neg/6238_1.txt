Oh, man, it's amazing that someone can opt for global warming for science, I think that this elitist nonsense is replacing the science of eugenics! Al Gore tries to make this problem an intricate sound, although it must be foolish that all this is a great deception made by a man who has a cycling agenda! <br /> <br /> How did scientists calculate historical temperatures? this planet Taking into account the sun's witness activity. Has anyone ever questioned this method if it was accurate? No, not even Gore! So, how would it not be accurate to predict future temperatures with solar activity if it's been accurate? According to solar activity, today the temperature will be fully aligned. How does the temperature of the universe rise (quite) equal to the ground? Does our SUV raise the temperature of Jupiter? <br /> <br /> Use it meaning! You do not need to know that you need to be a rocket scientist that can not be another than a HOAX. Please, investigate yourself. What has gotten the likes of Al Gor and his elitists Rothschild (the bank family organized land live events)? Well, the new global bank will be based on carbon credits, that is, a tax on all CO2 issues, and it is easier to flee with these taxes that people only think about saving the world, only money, centralized control and elitist bank power. Al Gore also has a company that sells carbon credits! Is not the nobility voluntarily paying carbon credits to save the world, especially if it enters its company? <br /> <br /> I do not think I want to believe in the blind, please do your research and use the meaning and I'm sure you will get a direct result!
