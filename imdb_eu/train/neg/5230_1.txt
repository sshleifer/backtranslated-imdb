Robert "Knox" Although Benferre's fans are not one, I'm not one of them. His films are asinine and amateur, and it's just not very funny, unless you have developed the humor of under 14 years of underdevelopment. <br /> <br /> It's certainly not very famous, because you're supposed to believe it by fans, by pursuing Wikipedia's people or voting on IMDb voting. Certainly, it is not profiled for any mainstream media, according to what he speaks of the "reputation" of his creation. <br /> <br /> Benfer has limited skills in limited animation, but he needs to escape from the youngsters. Abertzale learns and learns a fun learning topic as a true animator. At this time, however, it's just a child with a camera and shows it.
