She lacks any. Yes, I saw the train's disaster, but I would not ask later that Cleese came in the final part. (No, he did not.) <br /> <br /> This may be historically interesting for you young people, in those thirty years, the British "humor" including "black jokes". <br /> <br /> Further, I am surprised by the comments made by other reviewers, which is not acceptable, but then turn around and give high votes. If most of the comedies you see are much worse than this, then, I definitely have mercy on your tortured existence. <br /> <br /> The humor of this show is aimed at small children, but there is no issue. So who is this? Repeated and extracted double, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting only a short trip back 77), and other "low" humor. Three Stooges is still fun and they were a child for me. They made great efforts to make jokes. However, this is locked. I think it's the end of civilization if this thing really is worth it. Below, I will tell you that TV television is very popular. :(
