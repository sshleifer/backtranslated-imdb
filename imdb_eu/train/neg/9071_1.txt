Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) have gone through the university. While discovering the secret of Ethan's amazing (Jason Schwartzman), Angela (James King) loves to get out of the way. <br /> <br /> A foolish and incomprehensible "comedy"; - More indubitable than laughter. The film tries to attract its audiences with its awkward gag - but they do not work. In addition, he is full of vain and unknown characters and Schwartzman's character is so evil. The film also tries to try sex with the 50s and 60s of Mamie Van Doren in the toughest movie scene. YUCK !!! <br /> <br /> Especially for veteran veteran comic actor Joe Flaherty and waste (again). So, is it worth it to accept that every nonsense that accomplishes and does something? <br /> <br /> In the end, the only thing that I liked was James (Jaime) King who was very attractive and was better deserved. <br /> <br /> This is not more than a dozen of me.
