This is a terribly bad and awesome for Canadians. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the best in the world. The National Ballet is among the five companies in the world. THANKS TO SUPPORT AWFUL MOVIES! This is not particularly bad. Especially typical and usually bad, with a curious shot at two curious hotels and public parks, a high school theater and "gee whiz ... let's see what the camera button looks like" photography Even if Michael Moriarity was a fan of Jack Nicholson, could he not at least catch Jack Nicholson's GAP? And if the film was filmed in Vancouver, one of the most beautiful land in the world and the building itself ("part of the plot"), why, in God's name, we let go of endemic complexity of Canadian endemic. Seattle ??? I'm mad about that movie, I'm shameless and a little embarrassing. Australians get some great things. We produce unprofessional piffle. God !!!!!
