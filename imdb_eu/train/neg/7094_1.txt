B strives to mask masks as an addiction to sexuality, but it is a very bad excuse for the film for sexual exploitation. This story is about Sammy Horn (subtle name), played by Michael Des Barres. He is the owner of the Sammy restaurant, with his hate wife Grace (Rosanna Arquette) and a young child. It has sexual dependency and, for five minutes, it has to have senseless sex with any woman in her field of vision, and she will agree (and, of course, all women in the planet will not even know how much social security they can collect). . <br /> <br /> The story is based on an interview with his therapist (Nastassja Kinski), where he describes his sexual exploits through flashback. This is just the starting point for a series of sexual actions, which consumes at least 75% of the screen time. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to start criticizing a movie when it's bad. The production values ​​are abysmal. The movie is filmed on video with at least one amateur television movie (at least) and someone in the garage. Joseph Brutsman's great director is the illumination, the plague and the director of the actor. The script is annoying and the conversation is plain and ordinary. <br /> <br /> Women are usually represented as sexually obsessed nymphomaniac, while waiting for addiction such as Sammy and rattling them, their unwanted insolence feeds with impersonal intercourse. . For example, Grace's sister Sammy annoys her to inform her that she has slept and has to tell her wife. His response has been cast against the wall and ravaged him. She has an epiphany about three seconds and immediately becomes a sex student asks him to give him more. When Grace goes to sleep, he says to her: "Oh, if you want to see it beautiful, Timmy needs to pick up and run Sammy's indiscretions. The loyalty of the loyalty is unhappy. There's no spoiler here, because the film's character is obvious They could predict those who have seen this first fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Sexual representations are very bad, mechanical, and so badly simulated, they are more comedic than erotic, most of them are dressed in. Michael Des's performance is wretched. Barres presents all the depths of a rain well, it seems that the momentum and impulse of sexual parts seems to be worsening, but it is really worn by Arquette and Kinski. Rosanna Arquette is similar to what happens with an actor in this movie, a simple performance giving birth and really hurting, in the end, that his perfect husband is aware of a wild animal. Nastassja Kinski is very compassionate as a therapist Well, at least something similar happens here. The rest cast is just a double-fold collection of body-held bodies, "when they give me more thought-provoking lines, is that the best?" and "Oh, God? YES". <br /> <br /> This movie is the worst thing I've ever seen, and it's a bad separation that I've seen thousands of movies. It's very rare for the 1/10. It is not seen in a meal for three hours.
