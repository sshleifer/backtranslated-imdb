Excellent film by Costa-Gavras. The great presentation of this situation is its involvement in Latin America and the United States in Latin America. The facts may be accurate or not, but the United States was part of the coup and the Latin American dictatorship. <br /> <br /> However, the spirit of the film continues on the left / typical communist. Cold War propaganda. Costa-Gavras is a popular communist and his films tend to always. For example, he presents brutal and inhuman action in the United States while the extreme activities of Tupamarus are positive as representatives. <br /> <br /> The United States was blessed for the rest of the United States and Latin America. they took part. It is filled with evil European prostitutes in eastern Europe. The poor girls of Uruguay or Chile, who have been prostituted in most Eastern European countries, have never heard. The US fought a dirty war and God blessed us who defeated the monster of Soviet Communism. It is unfortunate that the United States has to do what Latin America has done (and elsewhere), but sometimes you have to do it dirty. This is not an idealistic world as Costa-Gavras and Matamoros want to believe. If Matamoros were in power in Uruguay, we would have another Ukraine in Latin America. <br /> <br /> However, in this movie, the left-wing ideology of the past continues to be corrupt and ruin and it tries to pass on an idealist and morally. right.
