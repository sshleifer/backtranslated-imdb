Just spreads I'm a fan of Cusacks. I saw this film as the only reason, but the only reason I can see them was the repetitions of a lesser quality, the specific roles of Grosse Point Blanc. Additionally, the fact that the political satire of the film is a huge gap fails, although they can be unimaginable to meet those goals. And it would only be a bill of satire as a satire for Chinese people. Imitation is, apparently, as the highest ornament, but as we see, they are in the same league in Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league (as regards the political satire in the spectrum) in the political satira. This is in the darkness that deserves to be.
