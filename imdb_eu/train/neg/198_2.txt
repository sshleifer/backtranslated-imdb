Burt Kennedy was a good director, but you would never know about that heavy mess. This movie seems to be cheap, cheap - most of the fighting scenes rise from 1955 to "Last Order" from high-level uprisings, and 32-year-old shots are much higher than this picture. The action scenes that were filmed for this movie are rarely organized, confused and disabled, they seem as empty as other images. Student's bad film looks and feels (and the budget does not seem much more). He moves like Molas, most of which is like a ham or a top food - Raul Julia gets better than most of the rest of the pieces - and bad history is annoying. On top of that, HADS is long. If you want to make a boring movie, do it for about an hour or so and do not extend it for more than three hours, as it does. If you want to watch a good movie on Alamo, see John Wayne's 1960 version, or even a 1955 movie. No doubt they needed six producers to make this movie. Jump.
