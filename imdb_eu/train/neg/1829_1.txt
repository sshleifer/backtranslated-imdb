Stupid Stupid Stupid I can not stay Ben anymore. In my opinion, this man's still shooting is not for me. I can not understand how it works when I work on a movie, I would draw it out and I'm the owner of the company ... I should turn myself on. God! This movie was just a plain, lively and pizzing stack of POO, which you should be scattered. I have to say something else in a comment in a comment that is about 10 text lines a guide. What's wrong with saying some things about a movie? I will never understand why they will write short articles that write a short comment to us.
