The film opens with the work of the workers in the workshops. Yes, what we can think of is the planet. We look forward to seeing other things like this. <br /> <br /> That is very strange. When you do not see a dramatic shot of the narrator at the talking speaker, you will set the camera to take pictures in different places. It would be nice to choose areas that were more appropriate to the subject, but not. So you will hear some of the following stories, view photos and configure the camera. Why not use the shooting camera to show more landscapes? It really stays in pain and painless nonsense. <br /> <br /> I was able to read somebody how to fix his camera, to make progress in the whole movie and lose less time.
