I like Chris Rock, but I think it's wasting this movie. The idea of ​​rehearsing Heaven Can Wait is fine, but the filmmakers still followed the drawing of this turkey. When Eddie Murphy renewed with Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he did so completely, so that Murphy became a film and a vehicle, not just its re-creation. That's why they were successful. If Chris did the same thing, it could be a lot better. When a few laughs come true, they can make a concert movie. In fact, it would be much more fun if a white man with a dwelling was a truck driver or a mountaineer. So why is Hollywood still like that litter? Because people see it because they like Chris Rock. So, give Chris a good script and give us a better movie! Do not take the movies first and foremost!
