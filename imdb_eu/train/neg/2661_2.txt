JÃ¶rg Buttgereit does not know why, and I do not have one of them! I only saw the Buttgereit movie as it was from Necromant and I hated each minute, but - surprisingly - this movie is worse! Der Todesking is nonsense like Necromant, but the movie is worse because it is boring in a few movies, not very far from The Blair Witch Project, seriously. Some say that this movie is "sick" and "moving", but it's not really. The director may make a point about death, but he knows what it is. Who can see how to watch this movie and something that does not get bored with me is completely out of the way. The film focuses on suicide, and follows the death of seven-week friends. Yes, this means that Monday is a period of unnecessary and boring, a trivial and boring period on Tuesdays Tuesday, a story of avant-garde and boring on Wednesday night. This movie gets more boring on my average week! <br /> <br /> Dir Todesking seems to be an "art" movie, although it seems that "art" does not seem to be a reference to the film related to the similarity. Each film segment intends to tell a story that needs to separate, but not! We only get a quick cartoon about suicide and only ask what it is. The film feels like it has to be deep, but there is a huge gap in the mind and there is nothing to do with it. Buttgereit uses some suggestive images; But I do not remember one more than a week or so, this film is not memorable. There is a shot that decomposes a body that often enters the body, but it quickly grows old and the rest is a movie, that is, it is unfortunate. If things were to fight things good, I think all this; Title sounds cool. As I said, Nekromantik is the only other film I have ever seen in this amateur director; I have two copies of Schramm and Necromant, and now I'm not in a hurry. Der Todesking is a dull film that undoubtedly makes anyone who calls "art". Ask.
