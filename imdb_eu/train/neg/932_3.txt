I watched this movie and I expected to get something better all the time. What is it about an emotionless guy? * effort * <br /> <br /> You will never see Alex show emotions to anybody other than his son. Yes, I know that is why it's the only thing I can do to lose my son (if you can call me), I have. <br /> <br /> Characters are undeveloped, relationships have not been given enough time to understand. In a scene, Sarah said she did not fall in love, and when we saw her next, she said how she caused her death, because they were so close? In this film there are many logical synapses. <br /> <br /> Someone likes to watch Boogie Nights and wrote this paper by Bill Little's imitation. Although the scene of "losing temper" is the same as when Bill Little's wife fired her facial expressions (or their lack). Yes, William H. Macy portrays a man without emotion: he's been there, do it - Magnolia said? <br /> <br /> This movie is not an empty emotion, no substance, it's a good script. , develop characters, and a plot. And, definitely, my recommendation is missing. :) <br /> <br /> ~ A ~
