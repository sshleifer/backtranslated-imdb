A group of models seeks an apartment that wants to live and is shown by a real estate agent. Although the model and unknown agent is in the "athlete of hell", the devil calls "Dethman" to kill all those on his way. Sam Bishop is the story of a suspect journalist murder. <br /> <br /> Although it's a small budget champion, although I am a microbus and independent film, I can not praise this movie. The creators boast a 24-hour shooting schedule and have at least one actress DVD player, but I can not get head-to-head on it. Why do you make a movie in 24 hours, if one or two more editions change? And why do you boast the poor, the nonsense and the bad hand? <br /> <br /> Through a large part of the movie, the models show parts of an apartment between the real estate. agent The interview clearly warns a scriptwriter can not say empty. The agent also clearly does not know anything about the home ... no one could focus on the aspects of the house, the heat source misunderstood (he did not see radiation) and say that the problem will be resolved when they call "terminate". Please enter the script - some deviations are OK, but this mess has been. <br /> <br /> And why were the girls in the models? Their careers in the plot did not have any problems, and this seems like a poor situation. At one point, the actor breaks the nature and says something "dude will be angry" with something that is "more natural than any line, even if it's a bad conversation outside other places. /> <br /> The devil does not make sense I tried to explain how he jumps in the random places of the Earth (including "chimneys of apartments"), but why did not he show himself from the demon? In his back, love falls on another man. How does the devil do it? In addition, why do we need flashbacks that talk about Victorian conversation and unexpected space? It was overdone.) <br /> <br /> The dramatic step between the lines was horrible. Sam Bishop was the worst character, not too far from the interviewer. Everyone asks for a pause, a funny face and a response ... pause, funny face and an answer? I was so frustrated. For me, it was only one time It was a matter of dragging ... but I would rather take it for thirty minutes for an enormous delivery hour (and then it will take longer to enter the same credit twice). /> <br /> What was the character of Sam Bishop anyway? Apparently, all this was "seen" and the girls were accused of killing him, but in no case was there any part of the story with the girls. So how did he see it? And if not, how did Dethman know how to kill him? And if he had not seen Dethman, how does he know that he is the spirit of the Dethman Apostles? I was lost ... when something was written there was a plot of a plot? <br /> <br /> I found this nice movie in this movie: one of the bathroom models was a scene. It was not really important or nothing, but it was the only thing that bored me. Felix Diaz asks me what he thought. His music is very good (watch DVD back scenes without his playing), but I wonder about the skills of my films. Although it's the best part of the DVD, it was the trailer for the movie "Superhero Excelsior" (only trailer trailer was better than that time). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I must be so hard. . I'd like to think that this movie was just about a 24-hour trial or perhaps a fun experiment and that the idea is never a quality film. But if the "superhero Excelsior" is indicated, Diaz can make quality ... so why did he choose to avoid here? Maybe the world will never meet.
