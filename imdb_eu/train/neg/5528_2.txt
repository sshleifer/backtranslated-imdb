This movie was only 61 minutes and it was not good on TV, but I decided to put the Zombies riot on the DVD so it could take time. When he came to realize the time he was very disappointed. It started with the most inaudible quality of the inaugural score (what-without-music?) And then gentle sloping openings. Gosh, it seemed to me to be a zombie movie, even though it was horror of the 1930s (White Zombie, with Bela Lugosi, definitely) but that did not. Zero It was almost non-dramatic (except for moments that burned over the top of the film, to indicate that someone was mesmerized). As Zombies of King equally dull, this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own, but nothing more.
