Yes, I know the cheap shot, but this film is a critical collection of "deep-seated" indicators (political turmoil, love / lust), for example if you want to get good reviews (see 'American beauty'). Kaufman's films include interviews with free sex scenes, frequent sequels with painful conversations (in a scene influenced by three 'European generic' actors) and state visuals may run out, but it fails to fit into consistent meditation. It is offered to the Condal. and frankly manages, almost three hours since, the love triangle in the center of the plot, the fourth missing piece, which sacrifices the main mechanism of the spectrum of emotions of the novel. the power relations that they get in affection. It also fails to use the screen token for Tom's son, used in the novel, to explain some political points of the novel. Combined with a terrific soundtrack, these faults make three hours of this great movie of great titaness and clear content.
