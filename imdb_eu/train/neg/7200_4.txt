I really liked the movie: most of the sites were shot in Pittsburgh and the trailer had a wonderful picture. But, for cartoon shots, it was a really bad movie. The continuity and the route were enormous. The best part of the movie is under the end credits. Therefore, (almost) it is worth detaining (although it is oddly bit, it gets a little bit in the last half hour or more). <br /> <br /> The best performance in an Andy Dick movie you know should be a problem ...
