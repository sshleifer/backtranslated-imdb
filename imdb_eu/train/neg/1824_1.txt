I do not invade Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black to do this. In a nutshell, it's boring. What may be foreseeable, a lover who exploits Ben Stiller or the scene is not funny, the movie forgets something. Although Christopher Walken looks like a pathetic way. I was very disappointed. I love Ben Stiller's performance. I loved most of her films, I saw this one, I saw Duplex Drew Barrymore and it was not so bad. About Jack Black ... Well, with High Fidelity I have never seen anything good. What is Rock School? Ooops, terrifying.
