I've read comments about being the best Chinese movie I've ever seen. Perhaps the only Chinese movies you've watched have no conversations, remote staring and silence, and editing changes are not good. <br /> <br /> Complicated story lines? Barely Try youngsters and amateurs. Amazing moods and awesome memories? Barely Try it boring and dull. <br /> <br /> This was terrifying. I could not wait to finish it. Especially the best lines of the movie "How are you? I'm fine. Are you sure?" Wow! Which character has a depth? I always think that cigar smoking is supposed to speak. <br /> <br /> I was totally disappointed with the likes of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean movie enthusiasts. Even though Zhang's "Road Home" sappy feeling was better than that.
