Within this film everywhere a half-hour episode tries to make The Twilight Zone. Cube's sharp, well-crafted, claustrophobic and intelligent-minded, I'm afraid that Cypher's misunderstood themes are boring and boring, and they add just that much, especially if you've seen any other before the science-fiction movie half . <br /> <br /> Cypher drags a pretty short 95 minutes to get it out of reach. No one character affects each other, and the 2002 technology film is really cheesy. It is difficult to connect this film and inspirational film with the director Kubo. It's not a bad movie, but it's definitely not good. <br /> <br /> Growing and painting herbs when dry and your stick insects get bored, watch this film. but other activities are surely blown up.
