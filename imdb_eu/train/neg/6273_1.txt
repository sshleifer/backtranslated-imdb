A nice movie to the end was over. The end and the woman to be considered was just an effort to try to give power. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used a passive / aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the man who gave her power and relationship to her will. It is not by chance that he sat behind the wheel of the driver as he walked out of the car, asking if he would ask for it again and again. This is a victory for all women to think of this film as responsible for all those men and women who are in charge of controlling them. That's why the movie was unknown.
