This movie has an interesting plot, but the play is pretty bad and the script is bad. I was very disappointed. The moral problem in front of the main character is very interesting, but the bad writing and the question that can be rewarded due to the questionnaire is plunged into it. Four other four people in the theater stayed about 45 minutes and the other two laughed when the movie was bad. I have finished at the end, but I have to admit that I played Blackjack on my mobile phone for the last 30 minutes to be sustainable.
