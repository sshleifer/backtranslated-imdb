This reminds me that I was a believer again that I was a minister. I never thought that I would be a minister or even graduate in high school, that it would be very positive if I could attack heaven. That's the fact that Christianity was a bit rude. Now I am the atheist, and this proves that Christians say that "doctors always save themselves" do not have a real elven. If it is true, why did I leave again after many years of birthdate believers? Yes, I really saved it. I became a wicked sinner with this whole prayer with my whole heart. <br /> <br /> If Christians could read their Bible, gods think of rapes, genocide, thoughts such as abortion and many other anker. They might be surprised when the word "rapture" was not mentioned.
