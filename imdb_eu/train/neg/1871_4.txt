Although production numbers and wonderful outfits, it's about watching this movie. The plot of mystery plot is just a vehicle for mounting musical numbers, but often the amazing process involves staging, as well as not being very involved. Although he has spent a lot of money, the numbers are poorly staged and poorly shot. Undoubtedly, the pre-code is a movie where girls often wear small outfits and there is a song, they sing marijuana with praise! The performances are a single note, although it's nice to watch Carl Brisson's music, but with Victor McLaglen, as the Lieutenant of Police, to get rid of the tenth times of hunting, you should throw a towel or throw it. at least fast forward to the next number. No doubt the mercy of the sponsors were caught in the cinema!
