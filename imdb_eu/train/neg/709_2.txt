This movie was so hand-written, directed, and acted as to be grateful for the belief. A new script, director and casting service must be upgraded. It's the worst problem. With Jennifer Beals, you have a gentle, professional, and compelling hand, and Ri'chard, that is, is a mess and confusing in this particular piece. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are excellent at the pair's slaves (and they keep them), although both work. Actors (and directors) would not try to make an accent, inconsistent and incredible. Ideally, he was in charge of making good work in English. It's playful casting. Why children from "African" merchants (thus, the desire for society less desirable to society) were pale actors. When Marcel, who believes that society was desirable, has featured African features that tend to blur "blond"? Casting directors can not work to read the screenplay script and choose the right actors in a variety of talented and physically different colors. It's so strange! This can be a great movie and it has to be re-created, but with those who choose material and friendly people and good actors. There are a lot of good actors there, and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben should see how to cast a good cast, good script and decent direction.
