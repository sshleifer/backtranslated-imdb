"Beowulf & Grendel" after seeing Canada / Iceland / British in 2004, I thought it was amazing, I came up with the first 3 new Beowulf films this year. As soon as I heard the "Viking", and when I saw the helmets, I cried. During the migration they were Swedes and Danses, not Vikings (later came). And the Vikings did not even wear horns in the hollows (the horn makes it easy for your enemy to remove your helmet and then make the brain). Then it looks like the Hrolfren Palace, a Greek or a Roman movie. Swords and armies are the props that remain in the old films of ancient film. Krusaders saw the weapons used by "Heaven of Kingdom" and found the movie "Beowulf & Grendel" by the Windlass Steelcrafts movie to sword. Beyond the basic line of the epic poem of the original, it was a shameful writing and the act was completely unmistakable and unconvincing. Yuk was one of the biggest weapons weapon in a secret ball, full of vision and explosion of full projectiles, bought from the rebel Iraq to buy something. Special effects were that monsters and their mothers were so steroids, Beowulf never had to break his head like a poem. Thank God the Bossook heads! I could keep it, but I do not want it.
