I've written 1000 words about this movie, but one word would be enough: curious. Zuberria and I have not laughed so much in this horror movie. We continued to look at each other "What is ...?" expressions There is no way to describe this film properly. Assassinated tomatoes were fun, but that's just sick. What kind of intelligence does it create to add such images and movies to others? What kind of reflection does the innocent children wear in this weird and curious film, and then pack it for children? Even if your parents believe that your child is in Santa, do not let the movie be seen. They can see previews - probably "What is ...?" expressions with faces If you decide to play this movie, you can create funny birds. <br /> <br /> The worst film ever made.
