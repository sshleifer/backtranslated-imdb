That was the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot did not make sense and the play was awful. I'm a fan of Amber Benson. In fact, I think it's a great actress, I can not imagine why he decided to make this movie. Her character, Piper, is drinking in almost every movie, except the original scene. On the positive side, there were several points in the movie because the performance was so bad and I really laughed. However, I do not recommend this film to anyone. It's 80 minutes long, but 80 minutes of all your life will be completely useless.
