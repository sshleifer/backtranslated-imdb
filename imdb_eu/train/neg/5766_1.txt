This was thought to be the main work of the open source community, that it would be screaming and shouting from the media around the world, because we were not involved in the market trap to choose beautiful works by open source tools. After downloading the basic version (here's a hard-hitting hobby fan here) I finally got my first penalty. Media Player, Mplayer Classic and Winamp failed to open in my xp box after Totem, xine & kaffeine failed to open on my suse server. Mplayer worked perfectly. It will be hard to spread this out, if normal users can not open it ... <br /> <br /> Movies. Beautiful soundtrack, great lighting, a masterpiece of camera and a perfect texture. Everything was real. And then the two main characters moved ... and they talked ... And the movie died for me. The sync of lip and the real animation of the two main characters (excluding Proog dance scene) was light and alive. The two main characters encouraged so badly, I sometimes wondered that the game on the market contains scenes that are less realistic than this. <br /> <br /> Any frame of the film is fantastic ... as a frame, and it's great if the actors are not moving. I'm glad I did not recommend anyone. I would ruin my reputation. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the latest fantasy plot tracking and more invented. <br /> <br /> This film would get 10 stars if it were not the tragedy on the screen.
