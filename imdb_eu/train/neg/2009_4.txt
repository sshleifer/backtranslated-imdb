This is not a totally bad movie. The plot (the newly built houses seem haunted) is not a bad thing, the mood is awful enough, and acting is fine. The worst problem I know of Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other shows) would not go beyond what she looks like with her lips. I kept looking. They only look on your face! Its appearance is completely different (and not better). <br /> <br /> <br /> Mark-Paul Gosselaar, an actress who charms Kim, carries out an actress who drafts and sheds at home. And Lara (like Col) is pretty good (but her lips!) She is the owner of the home. Walker (Colin Ferguson) is a husband of wood. Some of the characters that live in the house have also benefited. Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Stephen Amell), liked the first people who came into the house. The attempts to involve the general district fail, unfortunately, because the other neighbors do not like it. Other films (such as Amityville Horror, for example, Hell Legend) have such an incredible feeling, but it does not happen here. He paints the image of the nearest Col house. <br /> <br /> Another thing that has not worked for me is the plot that happens with the architect Kim. At first, he seems to be a domestic victim, like the others (he has absorbed dry inspiration), but later he seems to have joined forces in evil. <br /> <br /> In general, it's not bad. A movie for fans of horror can take your eyes out of the lips!
