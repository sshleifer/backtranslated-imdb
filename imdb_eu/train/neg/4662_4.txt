Probably writers did not have experience in the army, and they probably never looked at a storybook, but I still give some credit to this cheap war film, to look at the role of the second black war soldiers. <br /> Activities are mixed and unbelievable - Combat any section! It has better production values, but it's an interesting cast. I paid the money I wanted to see New York Giant Rosie Greer. The direction of art is the fifth rate: men use Korean War uniforms, and it was bad weather when the US military arrived in Germany when it arrived in Germany in 1944, not as sunny, and I do not think it's in northern California. . The scripts never know why black assistant soldiers are used as combat soldiers. Second-line troops showed some men wearing Springfield rifles that were probably picked up by troops. <br /> <br /> This basic idea (the southern racial agent that directs the black troops)), then you should extend to high-budget production and now it is not too late to try. I have to take this, and I admire the creators of this film to make an effort. <br /> <br /> I remember a while ago I saw this and I thought it was Italian, that is, it would have done. it was more sensible for black troops fighting in 1944.
