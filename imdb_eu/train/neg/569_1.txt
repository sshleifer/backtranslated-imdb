Thank you for this franchise franchise, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This movie is pathetic at various levels. The first VAMPIRES was fun, but I'm drawing this low budget resume. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi (the poor Kevin Bacon) drives Mexico to a vampire with a compartment that hides Antonio. The flags guitar case in DESPERADO. On the way he brings together some huntsman "hunters" (including an infuriated feminine girl who does not turn into vampires), and they want to stop some vampires because they do not give them back, and that's why we can take care of them. less on his search (sunlight to sting the Black Cross and make a ritual). If you've seen the first VAMPIRES, you have already seen this, and you've done much better. <br /> <br /> In the end, John Carpenter directs many movies. Actually, I think its the first time and not able to make a classic horror. THE LIVESTOCK OF THE LIVE (1987) is the only VAMPIRES movie. Everything else is bad, it's a cheap and delayed look at MARS so cheap ... and now this celluloid waste. Where are more gems like ASSAULT PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), YORK-E KAUTXOA and a new thing? <br /> <br /> Paper rails Wallace proves that he can not get his paper bag out of his paper with his paper - it's packed with four gems of original handmade and recycled gag. I hate all the characters of the Festival? The whole movie was not the only memorable character. How is that happening? This movie does not recommend. DVD presentation is also not good; the menu looks great. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, JASON X: "FRIDAY IN SPANISH 13th" was a masterpiece. So, you're making a break-up and (again) boosting franchises, women and germs, and creating an exciting DVD menu.
