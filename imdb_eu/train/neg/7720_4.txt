There are no gay issues in the movies, and there is not enough 'go out' movies. Each one is welcome to the genre. Although Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks good in a pair of jeans, Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks good in a pair of jeans - this is a piece of an era: gay life with an oppressive regime (Eastern Berlin, 1989), 40 years behind the west We see a certain way in our history, which could be similar to gay in the 40s and 50s (it reminded me in May `Last Exit to Brooklyn: not a book), but it is depressingly and slowly, SLOW is sending an old SCTV old fashion It was created by Ingmar Bergman, so I ask sloppily by the director just by hacking randomly, yes, a miracle was filmed and released before Wall Wall fell, and he lived hard behind the "Gortina" for gay guys. One can show all of this without being surprised by the audience. A good director could have this one because it was one of the best films to get out of the movie, and I would not have one of them.
