warning: it has ruin. If a movie starts with a sex scene, then it's a bad movie. (see 300 for example). The previous motto is confirmed. The second scene is the center of rotation of all actions. The final movie we know is boring. Moreover, other plots are revealed as the story goes through. And that was frustrated. In order to compensate for the lack of recovery, we learn more and more unbalanced people. And yes, they have to show. Andy (P. Hoffman), for example, is drug addiction, is it more? He is deceiving his wife, is he more likely to steal his father, more? Does his wife cheat his brother? What's more, is the complication of motherhood no longer? Is it a serial killer? etc etc, it's not enough place to write here ... I'd like to ask how best to work. And why did not he leave the wife before? On the other hand, I enjoy the performances of the actor Hoffman. <br /> <br /> However, PSH saves $ 7 for that nonsense. Why is nonsense? Since it is not sensible, why should I be responsible for the scornful characters? Another broken slogan is that a movie has to be a nice character (at least pleasant). <br /> <br /> In addition, it is a great sensitivity; For example, we assume that we are undergoing a widow's father without knowing anything about the life of the parents before the crime.
