It's a horrible thing. Ben Affleck's character is centered and strictly sadistic: a sadist punished you. And the HERO is romantic! His cartoon character does not change from the beginning to the end, but ultimately, his money allows him to buy happiness. <br /> <br /> If it were a socialist, I would use superstition, but I'm not a socialist. br /> <br /> Every day we occasionally like the capitalists who love Christmas magic. This is not magic. I do not know what it is. It's wonderful. And talent is a huge waste. O'Hara I'm laughing stilically at the end of the 70's. Gandolfini. Applegate. These people were few. If Ben were in the equation, these people thought something excellent.
