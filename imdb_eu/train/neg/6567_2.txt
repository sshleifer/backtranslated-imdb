I got the best in this film. I like general war music. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did a good job with their work; However, writers gave a boring conversation. Both love interests were not real; Suddenly it was there. I did not think much about music; With Spike Jones the best part was heard with "Der Fuhrer's Face". Spike Jones had a great number of wonderful musical comedies; little things, even with a monkey. Bert Lahr's comedy portraits were ongoing. <br /> <br /> Luckily played the part: Lucille Ball looked great and there was a good selection of players that deserved more time.
