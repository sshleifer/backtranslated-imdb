Badly structured, poorly written, clich√©s, and flat dialogue. A single scene does not shine. The actors fight with a sad situation to avoid all the surprises, language conflicts or conflicts. You know it from ten minutes past. <br /> <br /> For a movie made in NY, there is hardly any sense of the city. There are a dozen other independent films, it seems magical in front of a small budget. This seems to have been shot in Toronto. <br /> <br /> If you spend Natasha Henstridge noise, why wear her sweatshirts pants? Why is Vartan boring and curious? Where is the attraction It was asexual and moralized that I was watching a movie for a weekend movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br/>
