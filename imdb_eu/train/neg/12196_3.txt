The actors did a great job in their roles, especially the mother. However, as the film progresses, I found that I was seeing more for the play, and I did not care at all for the people. At times, I was approaching my parents, not mindful and generous, I appeared again and again. Her daughter is a 17-year-old skin, and the main ambition of life is to become famous men and dance nyphette ("shaking a lot of boots"). A child is a man with low self esteem, although he seems to be disappointed with friends and friends - later on, he throws a drug party that throws the movies. Husbands and wives are bored, but instead of putting them into disreputable energy, new partners should be searched (despite the fact that their wives are wrongly selected, "he spits out" the man seems to be gay ... OOPS!). I felt that all the characters grew and that they were very hard to make agonizing. I believe that the essay of the author is to prove that there is a vacuum and a vacuum of capitalism. However, these characters, due to the characteristics of the NO family of the western family, seem to be very little.
