<br /> <br /> The attack of Killer Tomatoes is a parody of the "evil monsters" film, which is still worse than the movies that make the movie. The story is very small, it tells the tomatoes that rebel against those who treat them badly. Basically, they rotate and bend (yes, they cheer) and you know what the ketchup is. The actors are never names with movies, so it would not make sense. A guy hired by the government tries to stop the threat of tomato. Black costume and a girl and a black boy who is plunging. In any case, there is another woman who spies the way with the government. If you do not do it much, you understand it. This movie would never be very good, first of all, but there is no need to laugh at some stupid assault on some scenes. The film is so sweet and, if all this is very important, it could really hurt (it makes sense) a fun movie. At one moment, a giant waxed wax with the "slides" on the wooden board with wheels! Maybe I would recommend the movie if it has a nice campaign, but that's not it in this awesome movie. 2/10
