When I heard her about the play, I saw when I met the cable. I do not know how "elivates" women and their "struggles" focus on this issue. If you are interested in women's private sections and how their stories affect you, this is for you. Otherwise, it's pretty dull and boring. In any case, it seemed to me very degraded. <br /> <br /> I asked him about a woman friend who asked me, and he thought it was horrible too. So it's not a guy's "not getting it."
