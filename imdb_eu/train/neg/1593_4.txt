Many characters in the 1969 "Hailokiri" film by Hideo Gosha were the true historical figures ("western"): Ryoma Sakamoto, Hampeita Takechi, Shimbei Tanaka, Izo Okada, ____ Anenokoji. The historical term "Hitokiri", in the mid-1800s of the shogunate Tokugawa, is a group of four super-espadanes killed by the key figures of the Shogunate Takechi. (that is, nationalist, emperor) division of the Tosa clan. What happened to this fight? Sad to say, you do not know about this movie. "The original lesson", indeed! <br /> <br /> No, Gosha is much more interesting to show the usual fragmentary and bloody episodes that I-Okada's pain gives you. to show true history. Sakamoto, for example, was someone of historical importance, the father of the Empire of the Japanese Army. The closest Gosha wants to offer a lesson in history, Takechi takes the scenes that Takechi's supposedly traitors to ideologically dominate Takechi's home. He begins to speak of an international political situation to defend Japan against military ships and Japanese military. Want to know more? I'm sorry. Goshak has this brilliant half-sentence (!) Cut out. To report about a Japanese turning point about so much history. <br /> <br /> The movie left me confused about the goals of both sides of this fight. During the past two and a half centuries, Shogunat was one of the main institutions of Japan for the prevention of social change in order to preserve the feudal relations of society. Foreign pollution was horrific, ideological and technological. In accordance with this spirit, it was banned from firearms, the "leveling" tools in Europe and America, which could face the samurai farmers. Throughout the whole period, the emperor was not just a spiritual attitude. <br /> <br /> But in feudal feudal cities in neutral zones, a new class of merchants, landlords, and craftsmen was developed. - French class known in Europe, bourgeois. Undoubtedly, when he gained this new class with great vigor, he departed from various frontiers of feudal society. As in Europe, the king (emperor) became the leading figure in the struggle against the feudal aristocracy to obtain the power of the bourgeoisie. But a political leadership does not always serve the interests of classes. When the outer world came with a sharp one in 1853, when Perry was the "Admiral of the United States" in the United States, the elite government of Japan entered into a crisis. The military did not match those foreigners. Also, the Britons and French heard the ruin that the imperialists were causing in China. What should Japan do to save itself from the weakness of its weak neighbor? Surprisingly, some of the shogunate isolation isolators usually tend to open trade with foreign trade to obtain an advanced technology. It is a vision depicted in the film Sakamoto (few). On the other hand, the loyal ultra-nationalist emperor, taken by Takechi, believed that foreigners would be able to keep them by force, if they had prevented the sale of "country selling" from another faction. (Does it seem to be known?). That's why the murder of the Shogunate key is sorted. We start out <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Takechi's motivations, for me, were the main puzzle of the movie. Gosha suggests, above all, that he is fighting for his personal struggle rather than loyalist reasons. Can not we take it to replace tenor of loyalists? (Do you like it?) <br /> <br /> Several reviewers compared Gosh with the good proof of "Goyokin" in that year. But the "Goyokin" adventure rumor, suspicious, with a hero that deserves sympathy, "Hitokiri" is not so credible and there is not much heroin. Sakamoto could be the hero of this film, but we do not allow him to know him or what he means. It is enough to achieve this to achieve this. <br /> <br /> In previous Kurosawa movies, the scores of Masaru Sato were very disappointing, as something that was excluded from the "Bonanza" episode. <br /> <br /> Barry Freed
