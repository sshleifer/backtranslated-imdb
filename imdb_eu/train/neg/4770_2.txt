I wanted to like this movie, either SAW, blah blah blah ripah, but I like these movies. If it was done, it had all the ingredients of good and not good film ... unfortunately, these components disappeared! The play was awful, and first of all I saw captives as one with the captive (out of the way), comments and lyrics are awful, I know, writing bad ... but this is more. more than that, it was a bad writing with a bad performance. Both captive people had a relationship with each other and they did not accept the film yet ... <br /> <br /> Sorry, I still wonder why I remember to review it. movies <br /> <br /> I will finish LINKS, LANDSCAPES AND TERRITORIALS MORE! Despair!
