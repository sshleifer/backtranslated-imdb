This movie is a quintessential comedy, though it's a serious one. His subject is Imperialism (with a chapter): how, in Britain, the stupid one, humiliating himself, tries to persuade himself that he is still a great power after World War II. In the house, the pleasant touches of the Empire, Tori onekok, to distinguish close close relatives; Government offices were long forgotten archives (about the paranoid orwelliar?), The indolent rat lived, and the previous rooms, the gossip in the living room, reading popular novels. <br /> <br /> Above the old pomp enters Britain; but the nonsense is looked out of the context, especially when they get into twin tops. Carlton-Browne is an image of decadence that does not suppress corruption in the gem of the anti-imperialist gem. <br /> <br /> The film is about the Cold War, which is well-known that it is a dangerous farce, whose participants deserve and deserve contempt, not fear and respect. Colonialism distinguishes itself more than the attention of tyranny, which destroys colonies, steals comfort, power and, above all, self-esteem, leaving behind dangerous Cowboys machining. <br /> <br /> It's the seriousness that's dying. That's not the point that big commercials can not say to the comedy: Morgan's Creek Miracle, Dr. Strangelove and Brian Life have all proved this. In fact, serious issues can only be dealt with through comedy. It makes a clearer perspective. , so it becomes weight and imbalance. In the three films mentioned above, a great part of the comedy arises from the reaction of nature to extreme situations and not extreme situations. Here, the script is a very bad thing to fill comic riches characterizations, and some of the greatest talents comedies ever - Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, Raymond Huntley, and John Le Mesurier - are wasting badly. <br /> <br /> Terry -Thomas, so sublime, shows that he can not handle lead parts, and he needs ruddy, endless arrogance, and no-brainer games. It's about to take a large part of the comedy music, but his heavy irony puts his attention on the screen due to lack of darkness. (To be honest, short films, composition, and composition produced as a majority of British comedies at that time) attempts only make Huntley laugh. the character that can sleep <br /> <br /> Boultings's farroetas are not well-informed; They never think enough. Although Carlton-Brown's madness falls into the empire, it seems anti-democratic and militaristic. I am sure that this is not there, but these errors will happen if you allow the well-deserved intelligence to be prioritized before the comic intelligence and film form.
