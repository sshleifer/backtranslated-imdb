This movie seemed like an interesting study of causes and effects, but less than that. The basic plot continues the life of a handsome person and their actions (intentionally or otherwise) affect the lives of others. The film's premise is very promising, but I do not believe that he does not fulfill his promise. It takes too long to tell the audience about chaos theory and show little time. As a result, I never get real feelings about the characters and have never made emotional connections with them. At the end of the movie, I had a "so much" attitude to all of them. It would be a stronger direction for the character to build this movie, but it seems so
