I saw the movie and I was surprised! Robert Carlyle Hitler is not a man trying to be Hitler. It's a movie, it does not reflect the truth. Scene Hitler knocked her gun. Hitler never hit anyone; He did not hit the fists, but with the fists of the soldiers. Understand ?? It's another thing: it's too obvious that Hitler is a nasty, more demanding than it was in this movie. Germany would not be admitted as head, because they see it evil. Thus, the real Hitler did not show the people wrong in their favor. <br /> <br /> Did you see any of Yankee's "Der Untergang" or "The Dawnfall"? The movie is superb with amazing actors. And his movie is German. This issue of Nazi Germany does not have to be understood as a movie by people who do not know German. People! Watch "Der Untergang": <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> <br /> His time is a great movie for humans about a very sad moment. throughout the world.
