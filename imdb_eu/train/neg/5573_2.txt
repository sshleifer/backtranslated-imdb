I do not know why Godzilla fans think it's excellent, never the best Godzilla movies. This movie is awful and I see again in Goji's few films (the other is G. vs. Megalon). <br /> <br /> The plot is very compact in the Heisei series, to be a series. Godzilla's old franchise franchise turned out to be a real movie, which revolved around ideas that seemed more space than in 1991 than in 1974. It's ridiculous, especially with those issues, such as the WW2 scene, with Japanese soldiers. Godzillasaurus, who dies, by praising his grave and serious tone, take away the exquisite commander, the abundant capitalist and his death; In serious seriousness, a movie strikes some of its fans as if it were laughing, like one of those guilty of unhappy fun. I have seen one of the non-flameless films I have ever seen, but I think it was possible that the talents lacked talent and this was a bad live facial movie. Worse it was that the special effects are comparable from jet to Android, everything to the sound effects, it is impossible to take something seriously and still expect the movie. No camera is pushed. <br /> <br /> Like almost all the Godzilla virtually all films, it's not romanticism, and this is no exception, although this can be said, above all, because it is unwise. There is literally no reason to present it for romance, it just happened and there are 360 ​​commitments that live there. Apart from this, there are other terrifying aspects of this movie: Japanese and English are horrible, horrible, and perhaps inspired by Battlefield Earth. <br /> <br /> Tristar DVD fixes problems and looks everything. blurry, dark and ugly, just the same thing happened. I saw the 2nd Japanese version 2 and the differences are overnight and dark, with bright colors and original textures. A remarkable score, the fight scene is particularly visible. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Heisei series is disappointing, with Godzilla 1984 (Japanese version) exceptionally, there is little praise here, and Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah is the case. It is not well celebrated and fans are approaching. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10
