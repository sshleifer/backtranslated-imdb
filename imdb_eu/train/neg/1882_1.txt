What a waste it is! Who are those who like all of us? Yes, it's "art" And yes, it's "foreign", but ... that's not enough. The land is boring and disconnected, like a reality show, but it's not so light. <br /> <br /> People are self-interested; But as a character, they do not have enough depth to feel empathy. If it is based on real people, I feel very sorry for them. <br /> <br /> Violence (and some of them very violent) seems quite attractive and free. The producer has a vision of Quenton Tarantino. I do not think much about that either. <br /> <br /> And yes, if I were neighbors like this, I moved!
