View 1, May 7, 2007 - 10 to 3 (Dir-Steve Purcell): Mary Kate and Ashley Mary's typical prices give more kisses. It seems to me that girls get tired of that look, and it will be interesting to know what will happen if they ever divide and decide their own paths. In this section of their adventures, the people of Rome are scholars for a "fashion" designer, who enters the mailbox, to learn all the hard work (I think ...). In addition to the typical flirtation with boys, there is nothing more than the Rome scene, until they enter the movie, they eventually reveal why they are shot and then recruited, then thrown back and then recruited. People who do not understand the corporate world show this and their interpretation. Perhaps the real world will be its next adventure (if any). My children also seem to think they do not think it's "boring" boring. Let's see if they only have a couple of years until their adult legal status. Then we will see what will happen.
