"Matrix" was a spectacular and wonderful summer, but also the unusual thoughts of "Twilight Zone"-ish. The general rule applies here and this sequel does not match the previous one. Even worse than that, it does not compare with that. > <br /> `` Reloaded '' explodes in a non-professional way. In the first seconds, the initial impression is good, because Trinity is shooting in a dream, then the movie enters the nose.The first 45 minutes after a catastrophe, it gradually gains Matrix and Smith The agent struggles, but loses his speed at full speed after a 14-minute drive, and at the end of the day he gets worse on a wreck, the worst thing is "The Rave" of Zion, not just about the plot, but also porn and the pathetic excuse of depression dance music. <br /> <br /> "Matrix" has been a good part of the bullet-time, but it's a good thing, but in the "Reloaded" They make too much rage to seem like boring. The first were plots of interest, but it is very linear to be remotely interesting. The movie is basically a mere fun, trying to realize that it is really empty. The better the better the wrong principle works. It seems that "The Matrix" franchises have fallen into special effects that have been "Star Wars" like other franchise franchises. <br /> <br /> Standard rule is generally inadequate. Obviously, the best character is "Agent Smith" by Hugo Weaving, which is a bit of an interesting one. " Keanu Reeves is definitely a neo, but in every special effect, there is not much to do. Nominated for an Oscar nominee, Laurence Fishburne will become a monotonous tutor with bad conversations. Shared action by Carrie Ann Moss could make it much better for other actors. <br /> <br /> The poor movie "Matrix Reloaded" and a disappointing boot. First of all, those who did not like it will not be so disturbed. This is only hardcore fans. In terms of the sub-genre of the special effects bonanzas film (Minority Report, The Matrix etc.), it's still poor. My Rating: 4.5 / 10.
