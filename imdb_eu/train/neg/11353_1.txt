Today, I watched Athenean Cinema with two children (6 to 8 years old) and paid 3 x 12 euros (about $ 45), without mentioning gas, popcorn and soda. The theater and the movie "3d" were forced to look like a masterpiece, but it proved that "the cold war of the 20th" was a sick disease, as it has not seen in the last 20 years ... AND IT'S DURING. CHILDREN'S FESTIVAL ... NAME OF HEAZ! <br /> <br /> PS 1: average Greek work is 850 euros a month (approximately US $ 1050) <br /> <br /> PS 2 My kids liked it ... but once again babies are> only Greeks: moros, writers> like the script, and those that happened to be "3d shame". <br /> <br /> PS 3 3D animation is wonderful, but who gives it ...!
