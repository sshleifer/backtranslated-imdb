I just finished finishing. I have to say that all copies of this film are sent and watched in Iraq. I also tried to see a blind woman and turned it off in about 20 minutes. Adam Sandler could not find a better project? In spite of the fact, if you want to call that, the people in charge of this movie should be forced to see it permanently! I think I've read somewhere that the budget of that movie was $ 10,000 and for that. Is Wallmart coping well? There is a huge jump in every store. The only thing you can do about this movie is to use DVD as a coaster or you can trade with a friend, but they may not be your friend anymore!
