(Avast, before lightweight spoilers) I received this tape in the local library, which is a copy for obvious reasons. <br /> <br /> Once in a while, I went to a small museum in Matewan (West Virginia). I saw the schedule of May 1954 in the town theater citra. The movies would change every day in the theater. In those places, there were not television in other decades, it was the majority of entertainment in the town. "The Raid" seems to have been made for towns like Matewan in the 1950s. Although it was not for that month, they surely showed me on Monday or Tuesday night that there was probably no view to the audience. It seems that a historic, courageous and successful attack has not been well-researched, so the film is full of Hollywood decorations, including a loose gun by Lee Marvin. Marvin uses Liberty Valance to move on. And it seems St. Albans were more Yankee soldiers and all over the country Washington D.C. than they were. <br /> <br /> The aggressors that made me really rumor changed their confederate uniforms. Only the Rebel uniforms in paintings of the Civil War have a very elegant look. Anne Bancroft's son Van Heflin caught his uniformity, before the attack, I thought he was a boy. <br /> <br /> <br /> And then Anne Bancroft is the same. While I was watching the movie, I looked at the IMDb for a second to see Anne Bancroft. The studio's studio at the time does not like apparent late films and does not even have the presence of "The Miracle Worker" in "Agnes of God" and called "The Graduate." br /> only to be seen 1). You live in San Albans and 2). You will die for two hours in a fictional movie that tells the story of your home town.
