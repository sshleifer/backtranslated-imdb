It's not surprising that this film has not seen the daylight. The time of liberation was awful. Gong Show has already "jumped off the line", so who would pay the money to see some of the original censored video shows? And it's just a sign of 90-minute pathetic gesture in Chuck Barris about the hardness of life's presentation. Did he really expect that we would feel sorry for him and his wealthy people? Did you really think we wanted to know about his life? (Clearly, later he wrote a strange autobiography as an operative CIA about his career). Is there any reason to believe that it is renewing everyone's hearing for 90 minutes? Or when the network manager turns every once in a while? It's possible to work on a plot of a 30-minute sitcom episode, but not as a feature film. However, it was nice to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene and Unknown Comic (even though the "spicy" movie only included their most common habits). As it has been stated by someone else, Phil Hartman's first movie is significant (only one minute). Note that its name is written by HARTMANN with the name given in credits. You can not lose his voice and facial expressions, even if it's much thinner and younger than the SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small part; After leaving his first place in the world of soap.
