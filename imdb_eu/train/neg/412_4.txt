In the field of Science Fiction, they were interested in two specific topics, which were initially studied in film literature, and since then they have regularly reviewed filmmakers and writers at different levels of success. The first theme, on a journey time, has been fascinating for film lovers, as well as the written word, recently, H.G. With another version of the classic Wells, "The Time Machine." The second subject, which also includes audiences, is invisibility, which awakens imagination, with apparently infinite and many possibilities. And this subject has once again become the basis of another film by the classic HG Wells "The Invisible Man", directed by Paul Verhoeven, "Homo Man", and Kevin Bacon and the protagonists. Elisabeth Shue. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Caine (Bacon) and his colleagues have long been experimenting with the US Government, analyzing the possibilities of invisibility and practicality. In the end, they have reached this number in a number. Among the primates who tested their method. In fact, as the invisibility progresses, they have progressed; Their only problem is to translate the issue into the original "visual" state. It's a problem, though, Cain thinks he has solved a lot of effort and hours in the laboratory. When the theory of live subject matter is successful, the decision will be presented to some directors to try to keep the necessary funding for the project follow-up. <br /> <br /> At the last minute, Caine attacks him, fearing that the control of the project will not be able to move on to the next generation, an analysis of a human subject. And he will start this affair, assuring the support of his research group, saying the commission gave them permission to do so. But something goes wrong, and Cain is trapped under the shadow of invisibility; and while he and his team will find it difficult to find the solution to the dilemma, everything starts from Cain. And suddenly, the fear of losing funding and control becomes unimportant, because it is confronted with the danger of losing much more than this. Now it is a real opportunity to lose everything. Included same <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the beginning, it has been an exciting and thought-provoking film; It sets a good rhythm and F / X is in the hands to achieve its effect, although it has a striking visual for character development. Anyone who knows "Invisible Man", or anyone who knows who is logically progressing the story, Cain will not be happier. However, Verhoeven's style of storytelling definitely attracts attention and encourages viewers. But it seems that it drives it towards the climate, and as it discovers all the nuances that have made its movie great, it has decided to incorporate a new bloody, that is, it is just a dirty blood and blood. The fair was the betrayal of its audience and everything that worked in the film before. Instead of searching for intelligent resolution of Caine's suffering, and using invention and imagination as an inevitable movie, Verhoeven takes the road down, and despite the success of the line, it can be any meaning derived from the story. With the wind it breaks like so many ashes, and that would make this film a memorable one. Sorry, because Verhoeven has a much higher level than in the genre, it allows you to fall into a much smaller one. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon does a good job creating an incredible character, only on the surface, which serves Verhoeven's purpose properly. There is little in-depth portrait of Bakon, but he has more to do with his director's agenda than his acting skills. Verhoeven simply does not have time to develop Caine all the time; The main character Verhoeven is a ship that can build his story and work for it. The film would be better served, however, when Verhoeven and Bacon collaborated with Cain and they developed a link with the viewers in the audience that sparked some emotional implications, something that would have drawn them a bit. instead of leaving the door, such as the curiosities of F / X as a mere observer. <br /> <br /> Elisabeth Shue in Linda McKay, Cain's role in kidding well works well. It's a wonderful experiment, but it is basically a little bit of a challenge, especially for Shue's actor. The same thing can be said about Kim Dickens ("Things Behind the Sun" in the 2001 film). Sarah Kennedy does much more than her character's actions and with F / X. Both actors can do a lot more, and they are better off than they do here. <br /> <br /> Assisting are Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grunberg (Carter) and Joey Slotnick (Frank). ), Mary Randle (Janice) and William Devane (Dr. Kramer). Thanks to one point (even at low level) to make it a success, "Hollow Man" is one of those films. Every year, like fireworks display mode, it will give you emotions for a moment, but after a little while you will start to mix with everything you see, without discriminating. It's a very bad thing, considering the talent and skills of those involved, could be much more. I value this 4/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
