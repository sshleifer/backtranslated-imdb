It's enough ... to rely on a concept that leaves some feature films out. The first Tremors movie was great. The second one was ridiculous. The third one was nausea. The TV series was terribly terrifying. And this movie pushes the game deeper. <br /> <br /> Basically, it is another excuse for computer effects and puppets, now we have a series in the West, in the year 1800, and graboids fight. Like the first version, they must beat again. I think it's entertaining. Otherwise, this video release directly, like Tremors 2 and 3, is too far away. Or do I still wonder what's happening to the record of these events ... Have you forgotten me to record this unprecedented event? I believe it would be a mission of history, so our friends of our first film would not be prepared. <br /> <br /> Movies like this are just mad people. Avoid this garbage.
