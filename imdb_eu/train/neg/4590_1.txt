Everyone who has studied cognitive physics or science will be bored by 40 minutes, just like my wife and I. The arguments that had been hand-written by mass-makers of these ignorant and absurd "consequences" (without the intent of a logical reason) could come from real science. I am opposed to this nonsense presented by the "science" appearance. I can only conclude that writers have received a book of quantum physics, I did not understand a word, and then Matrix saw it a thousand times and began to write this film. <br /> <br /> For example, the Washington DC crime trial was conducted by The Transcendental Meditation Program. A short search will show the science of their methods. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/dissenter.htm) <br /> <br /> Save your money.
