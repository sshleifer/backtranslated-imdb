I'm a fan of Charlton Heston. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of all time, but what he thought of when he made this movie. Usually when he made a bad movie, I could guess the scriptwriter or the director, but in this case he is the same. The rough thing about this movie is its fault. Heston does not even prove that Shakespeare's story is interesting. I missed 2 minutes and a half in this conversation in my life and I will never return this time. That's right, I've never seen a movie Heston anymore. If you're a fan of Shakespeare, maybe you'll find this entertaining movie, but if you do not lose your time, you'll regret it in the long run.
