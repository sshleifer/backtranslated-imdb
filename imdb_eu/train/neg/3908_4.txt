There is enough star power to create another Galaxy HOUSE OF SPIRITS, but the final product is quite controversial. The movie and its messages are very noble, and I think maybe they agree with them. (Good Liberal Democracy, a bad fascist violent regime, good openness, bad racism, etc.). Unfortunately, we face them badly and use as clear as I described. <br /> <br /> In the end, people will be left to see us very noble, with no bad creatures that are not evil kretinos. Combat wrestling with "pro" matches with all missions orchestrated. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays a patron, a man with a lot of contradictions. Meryl Streep as his elegant bride and Glenn Close, his sister. When the camera is left with people, the movie moves and it's pretty nice. Unfortunately, the FUTURE HOUSE is just too subtle, and the characters are drawn from an image as the target of the shooting. We do not know them, that's why we do not care. The result is boredom. <br /> <br /> Bille August, the director and scriptwriter (from Isabel Allende's book), or after splitting a series of characters, the film can work completely. As it stands, try it nice, nice message and a finger. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended.
