Seeing whether you want to spend almost 2 hours of your life depends on the way horror movies are. If you like it, the gods are terribly hysterical, see it. Jigsaw is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (and 'Long Time Dead'), which is a fan of the low-budget horror / gore genre. I'm not considering playing this movie too bad, so the good thing is that it's so great that I've been one of the funniest things I've ever seen in years. If you want to rent cheap, it is worth it to see it permanently, if it is involved, you will be embarrassed. : o) The IMDb has to present a classification of 0/10 for this film, especially worthy of it.
