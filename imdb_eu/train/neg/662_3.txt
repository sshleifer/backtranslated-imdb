AND RENT A rent of a horror movie. As the writer never saw the horror movie before, he did not realize that the only thing he wrote was that he had parodyed in "encounters" and "overwhelmed". "Scream" and "Scary Movie". <br /> <br /> Scary bit is the biggest BANAL and BORING conversation ever written. Stupid "prom go" garbage. I wanted to get out of my ears. Strongly, "The Hills" has a better conversation. <br /> <br /> There was really no need to do this movie. The female leader is not interested and "Is her really? Guy is always obsessed? Really?" <br /> <br /> All the characters play stupidly, including police. (Cover up with a group of 2! Front and back! There is not a single police station sitting in the car, the window was sitting down round the window.) <br /> <br /> Serial killer around the cycle It's killing everything you want without the least problems. Victim (or doors) no resistance. No one is in a state of refuge or a fight back (or the security key is flipped into the door of the hotel room). These people are like sheep with mental disabilities. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of noise, you will be disappointed. All murder is kept on the screen and - it is made - ahem. (So ​​boo hoo for you!) <br /> <br /> No murder is also not very interesting. It's time we know most. <br /> <br /> There was only one cat that always appears in click mode. "Oh kitty! You were scared! I thought you were a killer - AEEEEEE!" <br /> <br /> Then it's time to kill the killer - yes, let's say the easiest and clearest option. Witchcraft <br /> <br /> The spectators whispered and went back to the screen. He thought it was too dumb and it was not really scary. Do not promote lazy movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> So keep your money and rent some original Twists to "Carrie" or "Friday 13" or "Halloween" or "Scream" or "Scary Movie" (any of them).
