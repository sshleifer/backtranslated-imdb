Love Come Softly I've read all the books. Knowingly well that movies can not use all the aspects of the book, but they are generally the main point of the book. I was very disappointed in this movie. Only in this book movie visit Missy's father (although this book has come from both parents). That's all. The storyline is so twisted and far away, and, sadly, from the book, I just enjoyed it. Although it was not read the book was too dreadful. I know Pioneer's life was rough, but the movie was much smaller. Rating is the same family orientation as the big movie.
