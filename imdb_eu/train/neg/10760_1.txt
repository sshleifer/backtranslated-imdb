"Films" is all that is wrong with modern movies. unnecessary slow movement, unnecessary rotation / jumping / tits, unnecessary characters, unnecessary conversations ... basically unnecessary. (is it a word? Well, I just guessed it, Robot.) <br /> <br /> What happened to practicality? (that is, the garage of the car, the skin), the only tool that combines futuristic and realistic functions is the backdrop of the coffee shop. <br /> <br /> What has happened to women respecting women? (that is, the medical character of the smith is degraded by the best part of the film, and still still "wants". Where is the TENT? I will tell you where it looks good and not admiration or earth. <br> <br> What A detective who has been detected? Smithe did not sit down and feel himself, complained to other people, and when something sparked up, when he awakened, this is a bit like getting the story out of the bcd ... not several times in a row. (A row that spoke several times, what was "I'm screaming and you're not listening to jokes? In one single scene?) and not just the instrument to promote rescue scenes?" Shia LaBeouf (baby) is a TWO SCENES movie, we know that women are degrading and B-Smithe knows ....... THE COURSE will look after him or not whether or not it is going to happen, <br /> <br /> What happened to the Hero? We must forget everywhere, e That both children and children are attacked by robots and only save themselves. My point of view I know, and why he should do it briskly in the air, revealed, the doctor got the same distance in some way in seconds. <br /> <br /> I'm not bad, I'm all for the show. I am also breaking the realism and meaning. <br /> <br /> I have never laughed. so hard on the film in a long time. so thank Alex. <br /> <br /> I'm praying for the translation of social pendulum to make it easier for easier translation, easier stories and all-in-one movies ... but especially easier techniques. <br /> <br /> Big Budget Action Film: "so you must die"
