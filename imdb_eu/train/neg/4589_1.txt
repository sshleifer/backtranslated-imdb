Remember that it was burning chains for a few years in 60 minutes? This is. Many people checked this movie without checking the true fides of filmmakers. Producers have fake promotional "oral" promotions without knowing the financial and philosophical pieces of this commercialization profession. If you believe in piping, reincarnation, dreck of the new age and baloney of the day, this movie is for you. If you want a debate about quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this film is to not convince Ramtha, so you'll get a bunch of money. If you try to score through the Ramtha website, without understanding the credibility, you might have missed the bad credit you've missed. <Http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
