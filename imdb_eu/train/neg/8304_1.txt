"Christmas Story" is one of the films that loves most of the times. ACS had very little movies that could lead the viewer to a place and place. Being strange enjoyed and enjoyed. <br /> <br /> So I waited for (and waited) for, "It runs the family." The movie was released a couple of times, to be released at the last minute. When it finally came out (IRITF) (and I suppose) it failed. <br /> <br /> The sets and cinematography were very good, but the management completely lost its mark. The casting of films was a mere cash-flow deactivated, lazy writing and performance. <br /> <br /> Jean Shepard was a great storyteller, American humorist and storyteller. He used a false repetition of hot spirit in ACS. He had an excessive emotion and why he never knew that. Somehow, the parody of himself came to be annoying and annoying. <br /> <br /> Writing and doing in IRITF is not genuine and obligatory. The actors have seen ACS, but the nuances and subtleties of ACS would not be recorded at all. The play was shamelessly slapstick and she was without Shepard's sense of humor. <br /> <br /> ACS will always be a real treasure, but the IRITF is an insult to all fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
