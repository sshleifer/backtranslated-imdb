I know jokes pretty well, they are just good. The show is horrible. I understand, and that's why it's awful. EVER was the only excellent figure in the show, but I saw another section including that section, and the show is awesome. It's not fun, NOT fun! I do not say that people "only get intelligent people," are they so intelligent why they judge people do not know and they do not know enough to understand intelligence or intellectuals? It's like saying "The sky is red", but never looking at the outside. But, nevertheless, this is the worst show I have ever seen in my life, the jokes are awful, I mean, you can understand it, it's horrible, the talk is very lame, its jokes and other jokes of body. Fluids are very silent and usually have bad shares. I do not know what these "smart" people see on this show, but even though others do not judge them, nobody knows that there is nothing intelligent.
