Antonionian movies are not very well-lived. He has always amazed me about them: not only is doubtful plastic beauty, but there is also a dull and didactic "psychology" of character and state. Remember, for example, interviews between Mastroianni and "bad capitalism", or "La aventura", who want to sing in the song "La notte", or laugh at the Ferzetti ink cartoon. at the end of the movie itself. <br /> <br /> I reviewed the "Zabriskie Point" yesterday. In this movie, the planes of the office of Rod Taylor, on the streets and highways, advertising advertisements, desert, etc. There is the excitement of the author to show on the American trip. Wim Wenders a few years later. Unfortunately, there are many top-notch hippies that can ruin the movie: - The boy leaves the meeting, steals an airplane and flies in the desert to find himself "different". - Gray suites, directors talk about speculation all the time. - The girl looks at the "women's objects" in the pool because she wants to be like her. - The middle-class couch pairs talk about nature's beauty, build a hotel and earn a lot of money. - In the end, but not least, many couples make love in the desert. What is a hippie platitude! <br /> <br /> Sorry, today, after half and a half of "La Aventura"'s "revolution", we can see that the king is naked and his films (except "Le Amiche" and maybe "Il grido ") are only aesthetic and ordinary places.
