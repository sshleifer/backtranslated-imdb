I noticed that the US Navy in 1971 was demoralized, but this movie was incredible. Sven Hassell's novel, SS was not believed to be a training ground at the battalion. The writer must be a real Navy hate. People who had been prosecuted were psychologists in a prison cell and had to be released by the unknown sergeant. These men went abroad, as the question-unit would surely question all the damaged recruits that would be asked by the recipient units and would continue with an investigation. The scene that was blown up was electrocution. Farrell, an alleged cell lawyer, would have had a teacher to issue illegal order (Torture POWs against the Geneva Convention), an enlisted man's attack, sexual assault and an official unsekoming behavior. Intead walks away. Then the discipline house is completely slowed down and the movie is not at all easy. I do not know how it ended, I went to bed.
