I would not normally rent such a movie, knowing that it will be bad when looking at the box. At the same time, I have rented seven films, including Nightmare Elm Street 5, 6 and Wes Craven New Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I got home, the camcorder gave me the wrong tape. In Wes Craven's New Nightmare I found a flexible movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is very boring, the performance is bad and the plot does not make sense. It's hard to write a good review because I do not know what the movie really is. At the end of the movie, the more questions your answers have. <br /> <br /> I value this 'Max-scale scale from Max 1 to 1': 1 <br /> <br /> PS I would like to correct the Korintian review (under mine). Robert Englund says that he's wasting lingerie, riding on horseback, and so on. The thing that made these things was Mahmoud, interpreted by Juliano Merek, not Robert Englund.
