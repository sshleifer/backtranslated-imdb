A boring movie about the boring popular 50s. How can we imagine that this is classical? The producer ended his career with his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, in a number of films that were above the actor's ability. I think that this film would see how poorly future films by Peter Bogdonovitch would be. Cybil Shepard's career was immersed in several films produced by Peter Bogdonovich. "The light of the moon" did not return its course. I thought that the performance of the "Graduate" theater was inadequate. I've seen that this movie has not been shown to the US. I only saw the place in Overseas in Europe later at night.
