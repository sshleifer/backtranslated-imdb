Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her family to her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and his son's son on the island of Savage, on his island, for a couple of days with his family. The couple hopes to solve their problem every weekend on the remote island. While waiting for the ship, Julia and Steven meet two strange men in the harbor, and when his brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains a family family from the island's islands. Peter burns a dangerous night to drive the truck and turns the lens off; However, he accidentally surpasses the young son of the Savage family, but thinks he has an animal in the dark. Later, the wild family Alex lost his lost son. The young family does not accept trade, and they start a deadly war between families. "Savage Island" is a low-budget movie, stupid script, amateurs cinematography but a stunning performance. The wrong story is completely absurd and there are many unbelievable situations. For example, how can only two men leave only two women on the road on the road tonight, a family with a terrible threat? The logical procedure would immediately go to the continent and command the police to save Peter. Then the young family disappears. Julia and Steven have left the car on the continent and at home and with friends, and no one is walking behind? Peter calls Alex's sister Julia when she arrives at the ship. There are so many errors in this Flick when I've gone through many lines of writing about this topic. I think this film shot a home video camera with images so huge. Good work was worth a better job. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ("The Isle of Blood")
