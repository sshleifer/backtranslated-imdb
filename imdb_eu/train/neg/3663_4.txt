The Spanish horror icon of Paul Naschy is one of his most vulnerable men ... but for a moment. Most people know their most popular TV titles, THE FURY OF THE WOLF MAN, and many have had a lot of video in their home over the years. If you want to make a successful one, the most useful edition I've seen is THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS, and it's a European version that is recovering some worrying scenes. FURY prints the original drawings that are missing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br his knowledge of his wife's close relationship. He cares for himself and his lover in animals, but becomes a guinea pig for a female doctor and her assistant to look for a sexy woman. Apparently, the doctor tries to "tamper" with the wolf, and there is a curiously masochistic love scene between himself and Daninsky, a hairy and protected, who is under his trance, at least in the original version. In the end, we get two widowed men according to what Daninsky is fighting against a wolf. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film is that the director (under the claims of Naschy) frequently drank and the results are incoherent. WOLF MAN When you're ever seeing SLEEPS, it's not hard to know what happens, though spots of editing are awful. The worst part is that Naschy's male wolf does not directly match one of the previous films (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, "FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR"), which blends in with no sensible reasons! The costumes of the wolf change from white to black shirt and back again, as their attitude; For a moment, the wolf roars slowly in FURY's hypothesis. The next is scary moving in BLOODY TERROR. Really curious
