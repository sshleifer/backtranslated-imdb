argh! This film paints my head. and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> It's just a hate for the action genre, but even when my kids had swallowed me like Navy Seals, I still do not consider this movie. I now scorn it completely. <br /> <br /> Quickly take a high-speed story. Save the title and throw the rest. Instead of using half-assesd future gladiator storyline that's so much a plot of dirt that is endangered by all the things (why not a rebel base arena, and cameras? Why really happened to be what happened in a room in Bakersfeild?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The entire film shouts for fifty years, with shining outfits that start from scary punctuation. ugh. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie. I know some people liked it, but some people leap and I do not even understand them.
