I finished it in a few films, but I could not finish the litter. This was the biggest burden of racism that passed through the "Birth of a nation". The characters were slightly more than cardboard profits. I do not know how the actor wants his title with this movie. Lee has to have better things to throw away such garbage. I know what things we do better with the brain and how we see dry paint ... I would like to make a movie about interracial relationships that someone has worked on as realistic. The cover of a bitter director like Lee is much deeper in this regard.
