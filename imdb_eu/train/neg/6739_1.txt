You know why they've seen that they would already try to confirm the plot of successful movies. The "Wedding Date" is one of the best examples to try not to try again, just like something new in the story. If this project goes ahead with the approval of the second studio, go with large stars and with a wasted production value, so people will come to the stars. <br /> <br /> Oh, that's not what the comedy is in these wrong attempts. The problem seems that the writers on the screen have transplanted to London, basically seems like a typical American state, although they can not fix the setting. Then the star problem is. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have so much chemistry as oil and vinegar! <br /> <br /> Since Kat and Nick have no conflict, the viewer is not included in the film as the creators believed. It is obvious that Kat will fall, and vice versa, in this predicted story. Amy Adams, being the best asset of "Junebug", is a lying girl who does not want to lie to herself, and does not love the man who loves to be cleansed and marrying her. <br /> </ p> <p> For those interested, they will have a 7 minute duration at the end of the movie!
