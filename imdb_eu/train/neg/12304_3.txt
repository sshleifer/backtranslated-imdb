This week I watched the movie and I had the biggest laugh I've had for a long time. The film's drawing is quite mixed and poorly crafted. Only Corey Savier's abs are the only ones that can be added anywhere in the movie. Alexandra Paul (I think this is the name), the preaching wife, as a depression story. Ted McKenzie is gross and over all his character. And if you think that having sex with your child is enough, it's just enough to have all the saxophones out there! The extreme ending and ending of this film is quite deep and, moreover, it's wild. I would like to say who wants to be the son of your child who was looking for a son who thought he was your son and was very interested in your relationship!
