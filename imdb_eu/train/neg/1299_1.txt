This production has no story. The play is shy. The Dutch star of the famous star Sophie Hilbrand should not add this movie to her curriculum. His performance is wonderful and, personally, I believe that professional dignity has exceeded the limit; as regards the way in which this film appears. This film has an unnecessary nudity, plain sex scene and a harsh language. Likewise, it shows the wrong Dutch picture (like most movies). Do not worry about seeing this movie: losing time, losing money and Hilbrand's record is shameful, that is, it's getting closer to the screen.
