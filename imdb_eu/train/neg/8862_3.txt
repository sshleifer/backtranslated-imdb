Christopher Lee puts a pair of sunglasses in the punk and tries to enter a punk rock club, knowing that you have a handkerchief! This film had a potential. Underneath all slums, there are traces of work done in a decent movie, if not interesting. The final product is a real blend. Aside from nudity and very attractive women, Howling II is a great excuse for horror film. Christopher Lee gives him a bundle of credibility, but he can not rise above the level. <br /> <br /> If no other film in this series ever has ever seen, this critic will have to accept his face. In the first part, evaluate the real success of the events. We begin in a funeral for one of the characters of the original, and in the first ten minutes we will find Transylvania, with a small group of heroes to fight rough men. The movie is pretty good, and there are not too many dead places. There is an action; it's not shooting well. A bright spot is the music of a punk band called Babel. Even though the songs are often played, it's quite anxious. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with this movie. First of all, the play is worse than pitiful. Christopher Lee is enough, but it ends there. Both director Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe are missing all the things they want. Writing is wicked, the edition is redundant, and a frightening direction. Some special effects are a couple, but weighs the farther away. Sybil Danning looks nice, but the performance is not enough. Judd Omen sees the part that plays, but his voice and performance are not believable. Much of the conversation is in a comprehensible language that is not a Latin or not. <br /> <br /> I liked the general idea of ​​the story. I always enjoy the stories of true believers to defeat the invisible forces of evil. A small group of men are thrilled by a scene that makes a hike through a dark forest and a spit of men. Like it. Perhaps a bigger budget or better director would be the rest of the film more believable. 10 stars of 10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Side note: from this writing, YouTube.com censors have not yet Sybil Danning Finish credits terminated. several times while playing the song Babel! Catch it while you can!
