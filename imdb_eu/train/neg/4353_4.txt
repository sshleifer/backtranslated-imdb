Class is a comedy series depicting a set of 27-year-old classmates. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​the show. That's why I'm not feeling that the class is not fun, though it has a clear potential. It's not enough cork, dorky. (Haha.) This is a slow and really punching time that is a ridiculous line. Some actors also have difficulties with time. <br /> <br /> The characters written up are the twin Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh), but they are less likely to be a square-like show. On the other hand, the most interesting characters are the main characters of Ethan and Duncan and Nicole. That series that criticizes me is that Aaron is the only Latino character. It is receiving its accent (although it is not a respectable character, but still).
