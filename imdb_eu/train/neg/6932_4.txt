I have waited a long time to see and see DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON, I was really disappointed with that. I did not expect this Baroque film. Something Weird on a DVD I saw the trailer is much better than the whole movie. There is hardly any scene to stand out, and the look and feel is interesting, but it does not come close to external Baroque films, either from Fellini or from Jodorowsky. The character is sad and there is nothing dramatic, even rape, crucifixion, insanity, etc. <br /> <br /> DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON's main problem was the debate. - More than one other thing. It was almost like watching a book. The film wanted me to have silence, mood or something, instead of the main characters we can see or hear things without joking conversations. <br /> <br /> The missed opportunity.
