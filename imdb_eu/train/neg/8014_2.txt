"I know the wild tigers." Surely, it will be shown in big cities. One of these films is art, it never makes sense, except the director! I hate them! And all these alternative / artistic people try EXPERIENCE to find "metaphors" as a horseman. <br /> <br /> There were no plots, no stories, no morals, no chronological or anything fun. or touch it. For me, they collected some scenes that were unrelated to each other and showed how "show" could be shown to be "art" and "spectacular". FASHION was still a movie made in adolescence, but at every level he lost the mark of humanity. Then roll the credits! I waited for SENSE! Good part was waiting for. I had 60 independent DVDs from my DVD collection, many of which might be called "art house" movies. This is not among them. You will be very angry if you pay for paying for that movie, much less on the DVD.
