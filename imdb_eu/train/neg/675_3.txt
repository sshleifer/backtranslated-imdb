Meg Tilly's girlfriend calls her grandmother's calls and, undoubtedly, returns to her family's career paths, confronted with a mysterious one: why do all the residents live in a curious and disturbing way? Radiation thrill, giving an ecology, is a joke of a small town, that is, (laughably) that brings together two women who look at each other in a public place and Tim Matheson has received an attention from a banker's office. The picture is stupid because it tosses Tilly's sadness and quietness into the trash, but he can not wait for him in the corner. Some of Thomas Del Ruth's cinematographies are good (especially a sequence of fires in a garage), even if scrappy allows editing - and quite a fixed bath. The simplistic script is not surprising, nor is it too original. * 1/2 ****
