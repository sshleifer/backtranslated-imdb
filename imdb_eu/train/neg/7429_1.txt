Who am I? No, I'm not joking. This is actually what the video says. <br /> <br /> Plot; short version: pretty woman is around smiling. That's why every man kills each other. <br /> <br /> "Find Ariel ... Where is Ariel ... Can not find Ariel ..." It's behind you, my dad ... <br /> <br /> Most of what can be said about Space Opera is little said about that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < They are then extracted in the same way. Each scene is broadcast in advance fifteen minutes. Perhaps a drawing of straw was that the actors had more time to watch screen and pay check. The alien virus / hologram / VR witch / joke seems physically impossible and does nothing. Why can not one computer "split" rather than routine one-on-one? (In fact, it would be more interesting if it were a vampire, or something more than just looking at people, that's what it's doing all the time. That's enough for every man to kill each other ... Go to the picture ...) <br /> < br /> This is not a movie space. There are many more plans for western western routes, the Easy Rider of 1950s, the Noir nightclub nightclubs, and the fantastic beachfront, no matter what the depths or the senses. The scene of the night club is black and white, of course. He worked with "The Wizard of Oz". It does not work well, here. This is probably a good thing because there are few shots that make the space's exhibitions. It is possible to cry at these moments, especially when it sees an exciting "space ship" when it's three inches long. <br /> <br /> A character does not feel anything, if they are not condemned or because they do not have their personality, but if they need serious lessons to act, except Billy Dee Williams, it seems really depressed and likely to be in this job ... . <br /> <br /> This is one of them. A movie with friends may cause some "loud" silence, especially when nerds try to make their comic unlinked liners (including a line that kisses a meteorite in French ...?) Maybe ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < that's the point. Haha. <br /> <br /> Something funny is that the scene that captivates the video is a scene that is looking for skull-horror-alien (on which green filter has been added to give more ...) look ... green), that is, it really is after the death of Android and, ultimately, it did not do anything else to do. <br /> <br /> I noticed something strange. When there is an explosion (at least my cheap DVD copy) , everything is pixelated. I do not know a LITTLE pixel, I mean the size of the screen is 1/16 big blocks. Wow.
