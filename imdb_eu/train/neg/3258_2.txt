DOC SAVAGE: BRONZE HUMA (outer 5 stars) <br /> <br /> A horrible and horrible movie ... Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... about a superhero ... The hero of adventure in the 30s and his five companions, all experts in the field of efforts to combat evil. It was a beautiful set ... but when I was a teenager it was fun to read. When they made a movie version in the 70's, they featured Ron (Tarzan) Ely ... but I have never seen it. I never lived in theaters and never showed on TV. Now, finally, I see the movie why I understand. Plots and characters are never treated seriously ... in any kind of tongue cheeks and outsiders ... similar to the old Batman TV series ... without having the advantage of being alone ... or having visuals. flair Interview with Corny, special curse effects, mute stereotypes, crummy action scenes and bad, bad acting. Actually, I think it's fascinating in the disease ... what might it be? Arnold Schwarzenegger was rumored in the current remake, but I did not imagine that it would be much better.
