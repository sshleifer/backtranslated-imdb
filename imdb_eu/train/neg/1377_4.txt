The volleyball genre was not surprising at most screenwriters. Fortunately, the famous director Nelson McCormick has brought us one of the best volleyball films of all time (lower than and better than Side Out, umm). However, do not let the film cover the skin. Kill Shot has a new star and Sherlock Holmes resembles the current Koji star. With the use of high-tech devices used as a computer more powerful than my Gameboy, Koji may help the FBI agent to track a man who has no obvious commitment to crime. There are also other actors in the movie, Denise Richards, short cameo, gay girls, and young and annoying girls, Koji makes his own film. The filmmaker of The Matrix or Hacker definitely loves Kill Shot.
