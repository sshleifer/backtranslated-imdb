The only recalcitrant quality of this film is the real story ... Otherwise, this film was horrible. The play was incredibly bad, and the design was tender and very rough. The story was decent, but it was hard to see because of all the great performances. I would not recommend seeing this ... The only annoying quality of this movie was that the actors were quite attractive ... especially Ryan Bauer, the man who plays the soap opera. Some of the releases have been successful, but there are continuing errors in the whole place ... I begin to see the evil and evil movies ... Can we get it soon?
