A word like a Ueda Gangsta really boiled. The story is not worse than some gangster movies, but I'm never confused with The Godfather I or II or Goodfellas. There is no league in the same. <br /> <br /> But watching the movies regularly is that all those Italian Americans drop gangster bad lines in a worse false accent. Pacino would be great if he could double it. I was looking forward to see Abraham and Loggia, but their bright accents ruined the fun. <br /> <br /> Well, the script is not too hot. Don Corleon was about to disappear five minutes later, after encountering him with a little smile and back.
