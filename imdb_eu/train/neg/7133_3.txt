I felt Fast and Furious again, but different actors and plot. I'm telling the movie cars are so cool. So if you want cars fast, this movie will surely be entertaining. Nadia Bjorlin also liked me because they saw it in the days of our lives. He's really a good singer, but he's been singing a lot of songs to sing this movie. I mean songs about automobiles; Not exactly what you want here on the radio. As a Hollywood movie, you have to give this story a little way, but in real life I do not think any average would be a beautiful girl like Nadia Bjorlin, who drives a race car and can repair a car. Be a motor and singer. It's very stupid. <br /> <br /> Other side notes, if they want a car for 25 million bets in the race, it's walnut. But eventually, when Natash left before the end of the line and when Michael Strogoff passed, he was pleasant. Without price. <br /> <br /> LAST MINUTE: This movie is for the boys of cars. So if you want fast cars, I would recommend this.
