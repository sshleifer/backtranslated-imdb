Serious I saw Demonicus the first time and I failed words. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see the name of a Charles Band film and I would run my heart. There was never Wes Craven or John Carpenter. He was the bastion of hope for the little man. Instead of replacing the multiplex video camcorders, the men got to the point, but, moreover, they were more vague than the funky junk that was going on we had to endure. <br /> <br /> And now ... <br /> <br /> The California footpath is clearly dubbed "Alps" and is an abandoned tunnel of the train being an "ancient cave". I mean, they did not try wearing mufflers or trying to suggest that the movie was just an old train tunnel. Ugh! Instead of a terrific demon gladiator, like the one on the surface, we wear the latest Wal-Mart Halloween clothing costumes. The look is beautiful, it accelerates from time to time to set and move your hands, but it does not last for about five minutes. Why could not he be evil? Instead, we have brothers Joe Boys with a plastic sword. Ouch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Charles Band ... you should be ashamed that your name will be tied to tripa. I love movies that are so bad, they are good. Hell, from time to time I like that flick thats so bad, its bad. This, however, is not enough. An excellent example of a buck, rather than a quality movie.
