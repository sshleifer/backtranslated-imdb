Cinema is really awesome. <br /> <br /> I'm writing this to get people to hang them somewhere. If a person stops a film of coveted pricing for his life, I will be happy to die. <br /> <br /> It's really boring, but I thought Al Pacino was very interesting at the time when I thought it was something interesting. it will happen. Then they cast credits, and I realized they were completely deceived when I saw you being innocent. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this film has earned the 5 highest score in the IMDb (it has been seen in a final vote of more than 5 stars. Do you ironically throw it out? <br /> <br /> Please, please do not watch the movie!
