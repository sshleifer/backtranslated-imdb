I went to see this movie with little hope, but I wanted to enjoy watching my house in the town's movie. Unfortunately, I got all this. The story covers familiar territories (secondary school meetings), but it is confused in the plot and added to supernatural elements in this matter. Although the quality of the play was very good, the content of the film was enormous. The sexism of the film was clear: if women were apparently not married, there were no births or both (although this was a feminist option). Even worse was racism: a penetrating Jewish mother, a black man who lives in the house, and a free cruelty (punishing the class geek). We should be embarrassed if we think that these characters represent Kalamazoo city residents and that writers should be concerned about the wide and cruel stereotypic ones on the screen.
