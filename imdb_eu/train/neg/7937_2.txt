After 30 seconds, you realize that there were no longer any real romantic budgets. The story comes from "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Hills have Eyes". I like this movie, even if it's dubbed (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But seeing "Side Sho" is difficult: actors are very bad, conversation is cheesy and stupid music and they are completely lost. You do not care what happens to the characters. Bad guys are also not interested, but stereotyped. So blood and gore? There seems to be some, though cheap, and very bad action. 2 points, only for blood and blood, but I also understand that it is worth a look, as well as gore-dogs.
