This movie was essentially Velvet Goldmine if they had five team-writers and would turn it into one. movie The film Velvet Goldmine did not have a good performance, writing, and above all everything else. I had some of the worst writing I've seen from Wild Wild West. It must be interesting. I know vh 1 has become a background name for music shows. All of this would play better than everything that should be behind the music section, but it will not feel the face.
