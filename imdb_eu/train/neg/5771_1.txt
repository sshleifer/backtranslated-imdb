I will give everywhere filmmakers pardon to use "filmmaker", "movie" or "movie", but it seems to be a "criminal" and "crime against humanity". <br /> Writing: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Management: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Performance: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: he will not even know the words. <br /> <br /> Technical skills used to assemble this attachment: INGURU GARAI. <br /> <br /> This waste can not be called in cinema. Most of the family's home movies are getting closer to Revenge Quest. No, that is, it's just 10 cars captured by video clips. <br /> <br /> In this review we will jump on the plot, because there are too many holes to cover at the same time. Let's say it's worse than the rest of this movie. The call to act in a single way would be to give credit. There is little at the beginning, and worse video and editing is aggravated. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this immense structure, apart from the plot, should have consequences. ... or, in other words, a disturbing lack of it. Guns are not empty, there are no flashes, and what sound effects there were "pistols" that existed, or they were in the mouth (yes, you read right). The filmmaker had the courage to record the sound "shh" for the elevator doors; I think that he let others hear more futuristic. After all, that is, it will be implemented in 2031. However, this does not explain the sounds generated in the mouth. <br /> <br /> If the quality of the sound is not so great (it only used the microphone that was mounted) The video camera, which shows that the use of pistols sounds worse, there were no sounds. Sound effects include the rest of the makers, soundtracks like drunk drunks in yards, and they are evil. This image: a bad man will enter an office building looking for his prey. A lady starts afraid. Lifting his gun (uzi) and shaking it. We hear a clear voice. The woman escapes from the camera and suddenly a single blood pack (only 1) explodes on her back (it seems she was attacked by a paintball) and falls on her face. <br /> <br /> Take note that my description makes much justice with the non-perception of the actual sequence. <br /> <br /> In another sequence, almost no, but it's not quite fun to watch the movie, it's done on a stairs. . The evil man protects the good man and the girl in the stairs, shaking the use of her plastic. You want to be duck; There are bad sound effects that fly across the place. <br /> <br /> I think Alan DeHerrera can not block the tragedy of the train, but has continued to edit and publish it. . If there is any doubt, there will be karma with that name. <br /> <br /> If you decide to see industrial waste, I would advise against it. The entire scenes were blurred almost by Bladerunner and the AM radio dubbed as a walk-talkie. Try not to focus too much on the plot; it will injure you if you do more. <br /> <br /> 10 stars 10 and that being generous.
