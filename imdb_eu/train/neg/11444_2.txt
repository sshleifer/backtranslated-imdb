SNL is quite fun, but people who say this is like watching SNL on Short skit. No one like SNL is just an empty piece. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder, but fails. Jon Heder is very funny in Napoleon Dynamite, but Andy is trying hardest and people think it's fun. <br /> <br /> The funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was fun with Andy was in the pool. <br /> <br /> The "quiet spot" could have been a lot better if the falling scene does not take 3 minutes. > <br /> The section that says the name of his H has been delayed. They try to go long and Andy laughs in the middle of the time she is laughing ... she is a great actor and it is not worth the wait. <br /> <br /> This is a joke and a 10-year-old comedy degree for people with a brain-minded brain. It's half the United States.
