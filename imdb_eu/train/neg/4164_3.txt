<br /> <br /> The planet that remains in the Earth is confronted with little and hungry inhabitants. Bugs and insects or, however, they should eat, after a poison war, or something, it has erased all human civilizations. In these dark times, as it is able to live comfortably in a few inhabitants of the Earth, we will call all Boss Big Boss to avoid secret efforts to release them in the air. It seems that Big Knoss Big Boss is also the last person on the Earth who knows what these areas also exist. Spores are far from lively souls, and defensive systems are backed by deadly layers. <br /> <br /> Big Know Big Boss will be in secret secret containers of secret spores. Thus, a plan to send a group of actions is carried out to eliminate the protection system and the spores of secret sites. Sending people to secret spots is not a secret anymore. People are able to disable all protection systems by allowing them to release spores easily in the air. What is sleeping with dogs lying down? <br /> <br /> The nice feature of ENCRYPT Vivian Wu is bright and elegant. While the massive members of the Macho action team leave mechanically their planned time off, Vivian Wu turns his appealing charm on the plot he wants so much for his old elders. It is an object of love, it is an object of desire. A very credible concept! <br /> <br /> Vivian Wu's enthusiasts can see a great B-movie a few years back called RUSH. SILVER RUSH is highly recommended. ENCRYPT is not.
