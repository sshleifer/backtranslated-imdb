This is the worst film ever I've ever seen. No other scary thing or another is explained in the plot. This movie is a bit slick and I was bored for almost 98 minutes. While the play is unfocused, the main problem is the script, which is poorly written, slow and ploding. Occasionally a horrible mood breaks through unknown lines or events. I am not amazed that the cast was all diseased and thrown between the planes, they ultimately tried and tried the horrible script. Being a fan of a horror movie, I am always angry at something bad. Save yourself 98 minutes you will never be refunded.
