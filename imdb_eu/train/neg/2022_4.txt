Men, we get good reviews in this reviewing book. Actually, I felt very uneasy and uneasy at the beginning. I continued to get some ground, but that did not happen. This movie is very unknown. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare, King James in English, has never appealed to me, however, maybe I am. In the latter part, in the second part of this film, Ronald Colman shows Othello's role. <br /> <br /> The good points of the film are included: thanks to a restored form - some of them are Cinematic and Shelly Winters young, thin and attractive. <br /> <br /> In general, this is boring, too many repetitions in some scenes again. In addition, we all know that most of the actors are sugar cases, but they have been happy in Hollywood in this story.
