It is a relaxing original clock with truly memorable animated sequences. Unfortunately, the battle is not missing the worst part of the DTV sequel. <br /> <br /> It's missing a story. As the magic world of Belle, the characters are shown through cartoons. The Magical World, on the other hand, is better, but still gets a mixture of the story. Among the videos, we see the mice work, and I personally think that the plays of Jaq and Gus are the merits of the rescue of this movie. <br /> <br /> The first is the best scenery, the princess of Cinderella's habits. This is the best, since the mice were the most entertaining ones here. Bad visits, when Jaq becomes human, it's sometimes nice, but it's lacking in imagination. The last landscape, when Anastasia is in love, was very nice. There was a problem, I could not imagine that Anastasia was pleasing to crabs, as I used to do away with vegetables. This was a hilarious quiz from Lucifer who was in love with PomPom. <br /> <br /> Listening to music was very enjoyable to hear; However, the songs hated me, they were really inspired and nothing like that. Tchaikovsky's beautiful original inspiration. <br /> <br /> The characters have the greatest development here. While Cinderella guarded it, he lost his honesty and a lot of outfits belonged to the original, although he wore very beautiful outfits. The Duke was a few moments really fun, but they were not enough to save the film, Prudence and the king. As I said, the mice were the savior of the movie wills, only accompanied by the drunkenness of the movie. I must say that the animation is colorful and above the average, and the voice has been incredible. <br /> <br /> Along with everything, even if it was a wonderful episode, it was not forgotten. a story 4/10 mice, voices, animation and pretty dresses.
