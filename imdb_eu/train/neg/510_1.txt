This is probably the worst movie released and released by a major Hollywood studio. The land is just stupid. It's written in topical conversations; You can complete many sentences in these sentences. The play is a ridiculous thing, especially Rod Cameron. "Choreography" is stupid and completely unerotic. The reviewer who watched 23-year-old Yvonne's sex dance can only be pardoned; Choreography is just too bad. At the beginning of the ballet movie is a wonderful scene. If you go into bad movies and make fun of yourself with some Hollywood turkeys, that's it for you. I bought a color version in VHS to make the movie worse. Yvonne's heavy makeup, when colored, always looks like clown. And this is the best part of this film. In what ways to launch a route.
