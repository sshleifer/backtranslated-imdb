You need to watch this show once, to see all of them, that is, the same formula in each section. Jim does something like he does well, but it strikes his wife. Eventually, he reveals that he really did, he cursed his cheek and gave it a smile without a glance. In fact, the lines are so lame and formulaic, they can now fall. <br /> <br /> Episode 'Valentines Pay' <br /> <br /> The wife of Jims realizes that Jims has gone bankrupt every week and then explains that he has lost his casino. He screams and leaves the house. Then, on Valentine's Day, the tickets to Loi Ball are made (explaining the missing wages). His "mistake" and the usual "Oh Jim, you're so beautiful" he realized. .. Finally <br /> <br /> Another very clear element is Jims' character based on Homer Simpson, which allows him to escape as a cartoon as a belligerent and ignorant person, when he manages to do this. It does not work and Jim takes himself as an arrogant rhythm. <br /> <br /> This is the only reason why this is successful, because there are so many people in television as regards humans. These days you could do a show about a man isolating the walls and get a viewer. <br /> <br /> 'Two and a half men' are fantasy and ridiculous.
