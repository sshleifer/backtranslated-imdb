I know I have already added a comment but I wanted to clarify something ... <br /> <br /> I'm not an old-fashioned baby image. In Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason, etc. <br /> <br /> I was born at the age of 20, but I met Phil Silver's BBC2 courtesy. I wonder if he did not listen or hear me with Phil Martin's Silvers. I do not know, I might. <br /> <br /> Some of the other reviewers who think of this movie "10" deserve to see that there were no originals. I only ask you to see a little about 21 minutes of your life. If you saw the original Ernie, Colonel Hall, Ritzig and Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshaw, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin and others, you still think that Steve Martin is something more than "2". looks ...
