Doppelganger has moments, but very few. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this is a pop-psych thriller, a ghost story and a horror B grade mix. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who has been killed by past demons (most of her family died and was at least one suspect in one case) or a bad case of multiple identity. mix? George Newbern is a new friend of his room, and most of it places him on the floor. <br /> <br /> <br /> Newbern's character is very sympathetic, and he and Barrymore work decent (albeit not very well). A helm of the most horrifying script and worst director does not seem to forget the rest of the plays. Leslie Hope's memorable character, but, therefore, the annoyance that you would like to forget. <br /> <br /> The plot eventually leads to an imbalance (a story is psychological realism, the other is supernatural fear). so badly accomplished, dramatized and could effectively face the photographs with the previous film. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is the feeling that might have been the result of M. Knight Shamalyan. graduate film class. The performance and script of both directors is good enough to take care of them a bit. The films will be completely diverted. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - send your doppelganger, but avoid the first encounter.
