"Best Best Friend" is another entry in the sub-genre of "another woman's life"; The best "Single White Female" and "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" are; worse, almost all of them can be caught in the afternoon in Lifetime Channel. For some reason, this type of identity theft is only for women. <br /> <br /> There are two basic ways to play this type of story. At first, you can make the woman wrong and let the spectator see the shows and act as she implements her evil scheme. Or you use misdirection to show a good person, because it seems to be an apparently unpredictable set of events, it is evident that it is evil in the climatic scene. Unfortunately, the "New Best Friend" could not decide how they wanted to play and crashed and smoked early. First of all, Alicia (Mia Kirshner) is a fraudulent school scholarship company. We now know that he is going to see all his activities after the suspicion that he is a bad person. The director and editor, of course, forgot that this revelation had been made and that they were going through the next 50 minutes to correct misunderstanding that Alicia was a good person. This introduces only one suspense element, whether it is evil or not, but when the director and editor are sensible and loses time when he directs our mission. <br /> <br /> "The best friend" suffers most from the curse of an old play they want to portray a play for young people. There are really two major parts: Hadley (Meredith Monroe) and Alicia (Kirshner). At the time of production 31 and 26 were respectively. She has been running for Kirshn for almost 26 years, with Alicia's wicked version, but it will become an awesome version of Alicia. Monro's quiz is just a joke, as an attempt to spend Nicholette Sheridan as a "lizzie McGwire" fellow. The mid-life crisis looks much closer than a paper. <br /> <br /> This age problem, due to the many producers that owed them, is due to the fact that it extends to most of the auxiliary characters. Taye Diggs, a town that sheriffs, is younger than most students. <br /> <br /> The basic configuration is played by Hadley and the other two wealthy parties (Dominque Swain is 21 years old and Rachel True-35). university class room rooms. They share as a student's home (Real World-New Orleans house) a more elegant and elegant home (that is, the credibility of student football players). Alice goes into the house and takes Hadley's life. At least, this way, Swain will get a generation-class roommate, they can have two lesbian scenes. Swain's "New Best Friend" is a show of his support and Kirshner's love scene is fantastic, so fresh and art that is not in accordance with other segments, perhaps subcontracted to the good director. Photographer. <br /> <br /> The story is ridiculously ridiculous, which presents short flashbacks of different aspects of different sex parties. Each one made the usual Alicia shot in the hospital bed. The half-time of the Kirshner screen is not lying around in the mouth with a tube. Good career is not Mia. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
