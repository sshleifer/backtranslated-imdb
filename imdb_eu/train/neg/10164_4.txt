I saw at the Venice Film Festival and I can not decide on that. He never gave us permission to approach enough characters to keep up with them. Perhaps that was ours, all of us in a "bubble" of ours, but these people did not feel worried about them or were amazed at their fate. Approximately one hour, the characters were not very well developed. They spent a lot of time on the equipment of the factory (forklifts, carriers, shovels); And with surprisingly cute dolls with babys looking like a baby, most of the people who lived, were more interesting than people of life. An interesting experiment, but to some extent I never met.
