I saw the Omega code with a group of 15 other Christians. We all expected a good cinematic Christian. We got into a movie that was painful, dull and pretty boring. It has good production values, but at the same time it has a bad performance, a shameless script, a grueling conversation and a senseless direction. For the first 15 minutes, we know it would be a long night. We all hate it, and some of our team put it as a movie to look for a younger than "Anaconda". No one believed the movie lasted less than 2 hours. Bright effects and crisp appearance cinematography can not save bad and bad film. I'll give 10 out of 10, and the rating is very high, this night I watched this film "Werewolf" (1996) earnest.
