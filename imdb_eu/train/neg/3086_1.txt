I once thought that the movie "The Stoned Age" was the worst ... I was wrong. Everyone who could imagine "Hobgoblins" passed and I could not have them. I hate the characters "The Stoned Age". The actors in "Hobgoblins" hated me ... and all others who created this cruelty. I will not premiere for this movie, I'm not so cruel. I would not be such a pain that could fall under innocent people like you. In fact, any debate on the plot of this movie is absurd and shameful. The words that I would use to describe this film are: insipid, asigned and simple. <br /> <br /> In the end, do not see this movie. I swear, from cinema lovers to one another ... no, from one man to another, please. For your sake and your mind, DO NOT TAKE YOU. Destroy any copy found.
