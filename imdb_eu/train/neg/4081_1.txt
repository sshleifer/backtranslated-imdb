The movie I've seen with Peter Greenaway is the worst, but it's close. This imbalance goes a bit worse on the Pillow Book. The 3 films of this director have seen I'm miserable. Cook The Like ..., the positively positive cinematography that shows anything, its revelation of its material and its general presentation completely fails.
