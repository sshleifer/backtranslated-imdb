I love the first two films, but this film is just a waste of time and money (for me and for the studio). I'm still wondering why this film has been horrible. They are ridiculous things that happen with the plastic gun and the toy car. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were so funny in the first two films, but their terrorists are so stupid and not fun. Believed me if this movie was too little time.
