The "Confidential" section was aimed at making the appeal of the fascinating magazine of the same name popular as it was related to the day-to-day Congress research. However, despite the A-grade B-movie cast and some screenwriting ideas, the movie plods with 73 minutes a few. Production is cheap mice. The director of Sidney Salkow is the inspirational director for the incorrect values ​​of production costs. Some daytime locations, for example, would be lessening the harsh bass of the studio. An exquisite rider like Anthony Mann can do something with bitter ears, but Salkow is considered another paid exercise. I'm sorry that Brian Keit's little typical style does not work here, just like wood and lethargy, at the same time, Elisha Cook Jr. The worship character is at the top like drinking wild eyes. It is clear that Salkow is not the director of actors. But Beverly Garland has to deliver this amazing little number that treats her role and dedication. Bad, he was not responsible. My advice - jump away, if you're not ridiculous just for bar girls, like 50 typical of the typical T-shirt with whiskey backing.
