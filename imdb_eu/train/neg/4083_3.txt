When I released this movie I saw it, and I have been with myself for years. <br /> <br /> Here's why: <br /> <br /> Greenaway's goal is to take literary temperatures in the temple and be literal. A character would say that "my heart makes a flight," we would really show the human heart, with the wings of the pigeon, on the screen indirectly. <br /> <br /> This process creates some lush text, but eventually it's a simple exercise. It's boring. <br /> <br /> I do not see the pleasure of other people who see this movie, but it is worth knowing that not everyone was shocked by the audience.
