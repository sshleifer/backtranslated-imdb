Of course, this is not really a superproduction and does not focus on that attitude. "Dieter" is the name of a renowned German musician, who loves or hates his performance, and this is the film. "Dieter Bohlen," based on the autobiography he wrote a few years ago, but does not need to be precise about it. The content of sexually-flammable movie (at least in American standard) is fun (it's not the other "actors" of course) or the mute, it depends on being your humor or "Bohlen". -Self or not. Technically, there's no criticism. When you talk about me, this movie seems like an OK movie.
