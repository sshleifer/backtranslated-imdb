I only rent (yes! I paid for the money to see!) This movie. LADY LOVE. The worst movie I've ever seen. As another reviewer, Mrs. Colagrande, you would swear in the movies, please! Please do not ever make it or appear in another movie! The woman has a kennel charisma. No, it's not the same for the kantaloupe, probably because of that. He does not know how to act; It affects everything that is disturbed by time (it always reminded me of the always-tired young European enemies). He is not charming; It's not nice. There is no real story. And the edition! There was no one to see, I saw! It is very bad when you are watching a movie and just by means of which you press "forward" on the remote and nothing happens yet! I mean! ... I kept screaming "Cut! Cut!" What did they think? Well, of course, they thought they would make a movie and they would be PAID to love on the screen! RESTAURANT quite well; raw agreement for a pure audience! Now I think I'll throw it ...
