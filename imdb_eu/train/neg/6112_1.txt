I was thirteen when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of action. Escape from New York was named 16 in Germany. I went back into the movie. It was so boring. Then I noticed that there was nothing else to show her husband to his wife. Today I'm doing it online and I'm paying instant access. It's been more than 20 years ago, but I'm still angry that I am with this movie. It's a smooth video for students. Bo Derek undo and color it - nice. But they were later nominated for Undressing Bo and they had to be painted.
