All the X-Men movies were superb. And to all of them, including the long-hated X-Men, there were 3 strong characters (Magneto and Xavier were the best, I think), and a good story arc. <br /> <br /> I was there. When I heard all my enthusiasm for the production and my expectations were so big that I watched the movie. I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best movie is Source, although you have not heard about this movie when he talks about the actor), and his performance is not. cinema that has sparked <br /> <br /> The whole movie fills a lot of absurd characters on the plot (Blob or Gambit, for example), because fans thought they thought they were believed to be filmmakers. read original comics <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of XMen. I have often read, respect one of their stories and one of those films. None. Even more, it is not a continuation. No Weapon X project or Wolverine and Sabretooth or Emma Frost respect the relationship. Wolverine's motivations are stupid and they are seen in millions of movies: The revenge of a loved one's death. <br /> <br /> Oh. When I was expecting a full movie of happiness, Wolverine was like the moment of Berseker at X2, when Stryker enters the men and only breaks the enemy's forces, but this one, Fox, is a family movie and Marvel, a violent and overwhelming violent hero. <br /> <br /> In addition, I've always felt that I've left with this movie, because we have already explained what Wolverine's Origins X2 has already shown, we already know how he made his adamantium skeleton, so it is not sensible to make a film for something we already know. . <br /> <br /> I personally think that this wolverine is not one of those characters that needs a strong back-story. Mystery is the character of the character. Do we really want to see how Joker had scars?
