A friend once told me that art when an independent home film came on in a film, when the movie was closed - the viewers so tightened their eyes at the cinema seats. My imagination, of course, has tried to create the content of that work. Well, now my imagination can be rested. <br /> <br /> I am an enthusiastic Andrei Tarkovky and the enthusiastic admirer of his work. I found many people who thought that Tarkovsky's films were slow and inert. Regardless of the opinions, I do not endorse the fine work of the late director with meaning, with beautiful compositions and complex philosophical questions. After calling Aleksandr Sokurov the successor of Tarkovsky, I was excited to live his films. <br /> <br /> Except in the open air of the field (Stalker), this film has nothing to do with anything like Tarkovsky. do it It does not seem to have the slightest sense, even in a totally mindless level. Evidently, "immensely solid" cinematography is beyond any artisan composition. There is no balance, no proportionality, and the meter seems to have little battery in the frozen snow. The main character is so unpleasant and decisive. Do you ask if your dad could stay alive as soon as possible? <br /> <br /> I do not even advance the story lines or the story lines. in multiple online fashion But there's not even a story here. Certainly, this movie must be included in the screening, instead of getting nothing and nothing to lose, hairstyles would only be the only response to the rhythm of Tarkosky's sculpture of the time. Bruckheimer shot short Charlie Chaplin. <br /> <br /> I do not say that Sokurov's (Tarkovsky's Solaris) is a whirlwind, but concluded that Tarkovsky's successor is this film. - It would be Paris's successor to Paris Hilton. Tell the guys, do not be afraid to say so. There is no big moving word to re-live this celluloid. I do not know the Russian culture fully understood and I do not value Russian, but immediately I received the magic of Tarkovsky's work as a treasure and a gift for audiences. <br /> <br /> If that was not the name of Sokurov and it was broadcast on Saturday Night Live, I'm sure no one would read all the great "read" exams in the wet noodles of these movies.
