I have never seen something as horrifying as this movie. The movie was boring, long and horrible plot. Special effects suck in hell - It's like watching a movie in 1999. I'm wasting a moment and a half. Matthew Settle's performance was very bad. I saw Brothers of Band, playing Lits.Speirs, it was not that bad. Actually, it's not bad. But in this film, his performance was not compelling enough, it was very bad and there was no other chemistry among the crew. Besides, the eye seems empty because it does not feel like it. He really shocked me, because he was in the band of Brothers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, do not worry about watching this movie. Time wasting is great. If you were to kill one or two hours, make another movie to watch it. Believe, you will regret it!
