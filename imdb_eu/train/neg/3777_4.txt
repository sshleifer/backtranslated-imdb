Flat movies and animations encourage less dramatic fancy films in this film. It's not surprising, even when you reach the time when Bryan Adams's voice comes. <br /> <br /> The main character, Spirit the horse, is annoyed. the voice that reports what's going on. However, narration is not necessary because everything is obvious. You can also say what the horses say, although it seemed like everyone else did. That would be fine, but all the horses make the same sounds - a warning, a pain, a laugh, etc. There is no change between horses. <br /> <br /> Young children, maybe, this movie. It is enough to meet and see the family, and there is no danger of fear. If you want to do something else and want to watch a movie with your children, this is not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, this is not recommended.
