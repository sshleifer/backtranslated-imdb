Unfortunately, more than a drop. The land was quite decent. I mean, it's not ordinary, but it's a story, unlike other horror movies. Another good thing was cast. I did not say it was a good act, because it was not, but every actor / actor was hot and attractive. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the movie is thrilling in the first 40 years. about a minute. The rest was pretty boring. Other downturns (or you can think of it if you like) is excessive nudity. All 4 girls were topless in a few minutes, and all the boys showed their ends for a long time. I am not against nudity, but it was a horror movie, not "The Dreamers." <br /> <br /> A man who was very disappointed to see that he was hiding a bathing suit and hiding naked. Just a few minutes, or watch a girl with a nude for no reason, or Debbie Rochon's enthusiast and it's hard for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay there.
