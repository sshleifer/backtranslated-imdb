It's worse than the given rating. SciFi is a typical movie today: bad performance, bad writing and correcting. DeMille's series is finally burying the scene from the beginning, this movie is horrible. In the early stages this movie is watched by Moises (in Charlton Heston DeMille), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor) looking for a boy to bury a sandbox. The characters depicted by the three icons mentioned were horrible and they seemed like people who were supposed to be. This far-fetched civilization is wonderful and an ambulance is shouting. The scriptwriter, of course, is no ambulance in the middle of the desert. I was very disappointed. Morena Baccarin decided to make a low quality film.
