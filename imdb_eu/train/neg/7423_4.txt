There's a lot to say about Las Vegas Lady. It's harmless, but it's a dull movie of the 70s. The movie is not as clear and sexy as trying. The casino that killed the earth is a restart of the old robbery story. With the exception of Mrs. Las Vegas, thief is 3 years old. Does the plan involve three women? in an unnecessary and common way to scale the exterior of the Circus Cicus building, as a server to cover the first option as a server and hanging from each other. That's pretty. The problem, right? In addition to Stella Stevens and the breasts mentioned above, the rest of the women involved in the plot are not particularly memorable. Las Vegas is the star of Lady Stuart Whitman. When Stevens does not pause, his involvement in the film focuses on a fierce fight that has shot more than ever in the movies. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie. In the 1970s I feel that I always enjoy and some beautiful Las Vegas shots around 1975. But is the movie too dull to be higher than 4/10? and this surely surpasses. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a waste of dissolution.
