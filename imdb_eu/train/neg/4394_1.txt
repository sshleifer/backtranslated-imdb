The John Goodman program was really awesome, but this thing is pure. The only thing that made me smile was the familiarity of Patrick Starfish Frosty's voice. This story is constant, someone who has mixed up memories of the childhood rebellion, but has never won from an adult perspective. Paranoia follows the dark world that lives these characters. Everyone is unpleasant and without reason. The land is predictable, but the show goes through an incomprehensible and unrelated scene, as it is timely, it's not fun to watch. The worst thing is not to be in any production group to see snow!
