* spoliers * do not read more if you have not seen this movie <br /> <br /> Collecting "Depressing Phantasm II" after finishing; The Tall Man quits Mike, while Reggie and Tim are trying to recover the rest of the kid's new movie, and is not considered a slave in Tall Man's "Red Planet". This is a stupid thing: the trio of robbery with thin pink robbers there was only comical relief, and black karate (it can not remember his name) was so angry. I would not wait to see this tall man. his character This almost seems to be the character of Tim, who arrives late and eventually is a hero, but ... this does not work quite well. At the end of this story Liz kills midgets is cut, Mike has a silver sphere set into her skull, spheres get Reggie and the dwarves get Tim, and no one is left to stop The Tall Man. The guy wins a bad thing - now how is it that eventually wonders a tour? <br /> <br /> This was shot in 1993 and was unpublished until '95, and the end of it was at the time, and although it was disappointing and anti-semitic, it was also an appropriate and proper end to this strange series. Fourth, however, changes this end and it changes the ending of jokes, but bad, bad, and even worse and more absurd ... <br /> * ****.
