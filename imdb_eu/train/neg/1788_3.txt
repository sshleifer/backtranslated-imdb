Given this credit, they deserve a mention of technicolor, costumes and ensembles. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the smallest point in the long parley trip of Bing Crosby. You can think of writing, and Bing does not have the same period, either William Bendix or Sir Cedric Hardwick can not fix one thing. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks stupid on the boy on the page. The poor Rhonda Fleming has a heroine, and she needs to be vigilant at Bing and does not want to become a ballet inspired anywhere else, with a voice that will surely double. <br /> <br /> Very strange! Mark Twain's spirit is not visible in the script. Only slow Krisby fans could accept this blend of non-directional film. Also, extras do not even know what they are doing. <br /> <br /> In short: it's as disastrous as sloppiness. It is not recommended, even for children.
