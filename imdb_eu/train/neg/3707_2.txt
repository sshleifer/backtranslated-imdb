This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen (worse than any movie with Dungeons and Dragons and Kevin Costner). <br /> <br /> <br /> Chris Rock was very uncomfortable with the whole movie and his assistant actors. He did not even pretend to play it. Chris Rock is a wonderful stand-up comedy, but it can not transfer his talent to this movie, it probably has two incredible laughs. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, do not hurt it as it does. Make something builder and more interesting to see the weather channel or see dry paint on a brick wall. <br /> <br /> I give Chris's efforts to 2/10! <br /> <br />
