urgh! 3 things that need a movie: good script, good plot and good casting. I expected that this movie was terribly terrifying and, sadly, I was disappointed, when it was horrible. I missed the way to live halfway. The only thing that prevented me from getting my eyes fixed was by Rose Byrne (the reason I first saw it). He did a good job as Rastus, and his appearance did not change at a time when he was 13, he was a great first in a movie. the dog was also very good. Both made a great job with incredible material. Sandra Bernhard, I think, was the biggest mistake in the movie. It was totally evil, and I do not think that nature has ever been achieved. <br /> <br /> I gave the movie from 10 to 10 - and that's only Rose.
