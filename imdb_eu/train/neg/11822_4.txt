Harvey Keitel Sex Pistols I thought John Lydon was fresh, and then the bonus was Ennio Morricone's music. I expected a promising and hopeful American police thriller. However, I never had any sense and the movie left me: WTF !!! There are no unanswered questions, and there is not enough action. The result: a classic worshiper cleared the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work together well; so perhaps Quentin Tarantino can collect men with a better script. Oh, and Morricone scores: OK, but not memorable. <br /> <br /> In general, it's not a waste of time, but it's not "seen" if you're a hardcore Keitel enthusiast.
