I watched the movie as a fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I'd give them their sister, Rain Phoenix. I'm sorry She was sharpened, and she just wants to call her a strange plot. Sissy was curious and she sits in a community of Jellybean, both of whom are sleeping with this old man in the mountain, what happens? I have never been so happy in my life. It was a total rubbish bin. I can not believe the actors agreed to make a film, money, time and space so wasteful. Being sissy is 'beautiful' not to me. I thought it was all. These bags were stupid and why are we careful to pray? WHAT IS POINT? From 0 to 10, the shame poll has not been 0, it's not worth 1. 1. Fortunately, Rain is better in other films, I forgive this performance, I do not do much better with this film.
