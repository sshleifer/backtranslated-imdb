Carrie Fisher has repeatedly pointed out that this movie was cocaine during her life, and that's why she does not remember it. That's why he would make this movie, but he does not explain why they made another character or another crew; I can not believe everyone is a coke problem. It should be one of the worst films to be made, and that's something he's saying. The blame can not be put on the "director" by Tim Kincaid or Buddy Giovinazzo "writer", because this picture has not been directed or corrected by anyone. Apparently, it was collected in a special way, with consistency, consistency, design, plot, meaning, intelligence or something else. It's really amazing that there were some real professionals. Robert Joy has been well known for his work, and Jimmie Haskell, composer and filmmaker, Arthur Marks, are veterans of the industry, Marks has been director and not a bad one. They understand why they were involved in these rebuilding piles. Tim Kincaid, who is supposedly the "director", has done a few science fiction and horror movies and after seeing most of them, I can say that one of them is not good. This, however, is far from the worst thing he has ever done, and that's his great achievement. What's about this movie, absolutely NOT, is the 12th rate - at best. Cinematography is horrible, the play is crazy, it seems that the "special effects" space "9 plan" is like "Spider-Man". The story is trite, derivative and stupid. Do not waste your time, even if you look at the cover of the video box, and much less rent it. Totally, completely, annoying, total.
