Peter Bogdonavitch is said to be a personal movie. It's based on his life, but things have changed to fit the detective characters. These detectives have beautiful models and do not get any problems. It seems like a playboy filmmaker who looks like a detective, right? Peter wrote the whole movie, and shows how it really was with real people. You know what we know about writing, and that's what it's done. And it gets bored and confused to the viewer, and jealous. Dorothy Stratten is a commission for those who want to kill him after filming. But Patti Hanson, who, in real life, had to marry Keith Richards, is also a model such as Stratten, but it is much better and a bit wider. Actually, Stratten's part was forced; added It's a story that's unrelated to the story. After all, all the characters in this movie are somebody who relates to a few people, unless you're making a call with a supermodel of just one million people from Manhattan. The rest is a smiling guest. That's where you're going. You will entertain some of your friends through jokes and be bored by all the others.
