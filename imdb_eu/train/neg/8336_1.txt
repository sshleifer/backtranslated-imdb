How happy did that ?! Introducing yourself as a comedic comedian, incorrects of "$" are basically two hours moving parts of phrases. Usually seriously Warren Beatty looks beautiful, and usually plays like horny Goldie Hawn depression. In regards to Gert Frobe, his most famous rol - Goldfinger - was his admirable character here. This unnecessary letania is also stored in a LSD bottle with champagne. <br /> <br /> I compare this movie with "Plan 9 Outer Space"? I would not have done such things, even if someone paid me. "P9FOS" was idiotic but ridiculous; This was done idiomatically and it causes you to ease yourself. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn were the protagonists of "Shampoo", but they were the protagonists of "Town & Country". They may not collaborate on movies. In the end, I would prefer to see the skin again. Wonderful. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should redo with Jackie Chan. Then I should see it.
