The lid is a drawing, like the old B movie, the quality of this film is required. However, it is not a B movie. It's a D-movie! <br /> <br /> No famous actress, and the animals - WOW - is the worst data animation in the last two decades. <br /> <br /> You have never seen the front SCAAARY sabretoOD visible. People scream, emit blood and die, and sometimes you see your teeth or a tiger scarf. That is so amateur! Maybe it's worth seeing, because it's so bad. Give a friend and say: "This is the best movie I have ever seen and wait for its reaction." He, he. <br /> <br /> The movie is weak to give a Spoiler Alert! This is SPOILER.
