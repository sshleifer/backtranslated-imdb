Everything you really need to know about this movie comes after the original scene, where a guy falls into the lake and eats it. Then the credits of the title start shooting: "Slugs!" You see. in large print, then called "The Movie". Whew! I was worried about "Slugs: The Musical" or "Slugs: The Game Show". In any case, from then on it becomes a movie to kill. Because a man has cut his hand because he has gardeners gloves, two people are attacked by sex offspring, and when a girl falls on her back in an underground passage, kills killers. The film is quite stupid, it falls into the category "so bad it is good". Also, it was filmed in so badly filmed that I was excited in 1988 when I was so excited (my intention was in 1974). I am very surprised to find here a high score, because most people do not love any kind of film. But if you want a movie that is trying to be terrifying, but being overwhelmed, this is one of your main candidates.
