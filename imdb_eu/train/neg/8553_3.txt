This is really a bad movie. Ideology is not as in films later by Collins. However, the main question of the film is impossible and it is boring for a long time. The whole concept of a SAS man with no special risk for a particular reason is not very compelling, and you can not ask why a group of terrorists (which will later become quite clear) will be completely organized. The film starts with a powerful scene but it will take a long time to get the best finish. In general, Who Dares is the 45-minute episode of The Professionals who can win the win, but the story is not a feature film. Although successful, Collins was the result of the disappearance of Collins's career, in the 1980's, soldier or dubious film or army movies disappeared. Mercy, really a versatile actor, but Martin Shaw has carefully chosen his roles on the last day and still has a successful career.
