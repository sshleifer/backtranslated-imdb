This bad rude rag is at the same time racist, sexist and homophobic, pretending to be very chic and sophisticated. Funky plays, a cliche script and a boring direction, this movie has become clear. Two scenes were particularly aggressive: after Schaechek had kissed another man (it could be really gross), and the scene that sketches Russian-style friend Schaech. He left the room and said "a foreign king." Do you have a teacher who so much lives in Paris! <br /> <br /> Jonathon Schaech can be a nice actress on the screen and it's amazing. More than a shame did not work before Gregg Araki, a gay director, and tried to recover this film by entering gay stereotypes and homophobic chains.
