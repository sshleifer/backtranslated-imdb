I do not usually like to make comments about movies I like, but in such a case, I have to say something. This movie is horrible, illogical and stupid. There are several mistakes in the story, although I do not have to worry about it, since it is time to start from this experience. It is an annoying point, however, that there is no doubt in the film that the motivation of Bacon's madness is due to a forceful current or a physiological reaction to its state. <br /> <br /> It provides special effects that are spectacular, and in the past Paul Verhoeven has done some good things (the director is very good at Robocop's DVD). However, the movie is stupid and, in general, it is not able to explain the topic or technical aspect, instead of delivering the planned action without enjoyment. <br /> <br /> In short, I would like to mention other reviews here (I'd like to read it before ...) - Leave this movie!
