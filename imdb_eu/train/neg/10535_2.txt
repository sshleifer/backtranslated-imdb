Ford Pony Car has not yet been invented, but old music is playing. The synthesizer was a mid-70s model. On the other hand, Pony Car is very fond of the 60's. <br /> <br /> 20 year old college children? Josh Brolin watched 32 birthdays when he produced this television movie. The plot is so predictable for the viewers to think of all the faults that appear on their spare time on television.
