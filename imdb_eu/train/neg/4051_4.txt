Lindsay Anderson was the European film maker, but David Lean, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker are spectacular films that make spectacular plays. so that the audience can play a fun role for the whole movie <br /> <br /> If you think about it, British filmmakers think about it. I think that cinemas must be a medium universe (I believe that the best British film is what I try to emulate in Hollywood), if you want to send a message, try finding pony express and a dated movie of the 1960s. In 1968, it was the year of love and the rebellion in France. Think of the worship of this movie that you can imagine especially the French side. French filmmakers newly admire abstract surrealists, but an international international will not like it, and would like it to be very much in vain.
