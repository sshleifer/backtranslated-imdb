LOW PETER USERS <br /> <br /> This movie is the first Russian horror movie. Unfortunately, "The Witch" (its Russian title) will take a place of imbalance in the huge movie gallery of Russia. Nikolai Gogol's story "Viy" is a classic in Russia. It is the "based" key, since the story is not required. Instead, if you know less Gogol, the better. <br /> <br /> It is a unique production that takes on the production of directors, adapting their stories to other cultures and adapting them to their culture. This is a great example of foreign film remakes in America, but once again Sturgess has turned the Super Seven of the Kurosawa into the Magnificent Seven to get excellent results. Kurosawa Shakespeare's Macbeth entered Japan to make the Blood Blood throne very powerful. Hit me one. However, with "The Witch", Russians transplant Russian classical story into American ground. The film was shot in English with Estonian, with the intention of doubling it in English with American actors and with the synchronization of lip synchronization. <br /> <br /> As a result, the lost story is a colorful background in the story. However, the American horror small town appears, apparently, rising from a handbook of horror books. Ghoma Khoma Brutus is a boozy seminarist, a boozy journalist who wants to win the Pullitzer Prize and also writes about X-Files as well as Miss Boobs contests frequently. (I never thought that the prize was awarded to this writer for the draft, which I am now in charge of.) In Russia's curious head, journalist Ivan Berkhoff has been nominated. John Smith should name him, it's impossible to get a movie, a wound up, and a more generic movie than this one. <br /> <br /> Berkhoff goes to the town of Castleville, landed on the dirt road, he finds his house quiet and it's not an old welcome. All this, with the help of radio announcements with the power of evil, and the fact that people are closing houses and avoiding water. Do you have to mention it is very hard? After a series of horror scenes that make me laugh at laughing, he finds our story as a priest dressed up as a priest, and the local sheriff told her that she killed her new priests because of her new prayer. three nights At this time, the action is supposed to begin. Those who kill it are welcome. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with this movie? Everything starts from the dialog box and goes down to the department. The conversation I heard in Russian was clearly written in English, and it only came together with topical and complexity from American films. The agents were fighting English clearly, because the time of their talk was tired, and Russian duplication continued. The play is very late, and not only because the actor speaks hard but does not approach a range of facial expressions. Mostly, they are empty or you like. The only exception was Lembit Ulfsak, ​​an Estonian actor, and Arnis Lizitis played in a wheelchair in Castleville. Oh, and, of course, a cock with a totally natural camera! I know the actors complain about being a dog and a cats for a statue, but when Nikolaev's cock has driven, it's a sad testimony to the general quality of the film's acting. <br /> <br /> There was no horrible moment. The whole movie, and there was no movie, was not the original moment. Note that this comment comes with someone with no horror experience. The film covers the standard movements used in the horror movie from the beginning of the genre. At a critical point, the camera continues lovingly in a kerosene lamp. The lamp comes out immediately. He has also seen some horror movies. Another idiocy example has come in a different moment; A character jumps from a bathtub and goes behind the camera. Something looks like the outfits! It does not get stupid for this! <br /> <br /> They are just like the mystical thriller that likes the likes of the Russians. I was not exciting too. From the beginning to the end it was a mill. I particularly liked the fact that the inhabitants of the entire small town liked playing in a horror movie, but they did not know whether they were zombies or not. For this reason, some of them play just like zombies. <br /> <br /> The authors of the film say that it is to find faith. Stupid actions, innocent moments and, in fact, clichés, beautiful collections similar do not deserve to find faith. The film is so thin and fake that it deserves merely the exhibition in a wax figure museum.
