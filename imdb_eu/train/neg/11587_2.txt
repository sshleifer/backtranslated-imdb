This is like the sixth movie. The movie is very bad. In the death section nothing is offered. Online arrows are bad and they are something that NOES needs to be in a movie. Freddy is happy in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is one of the only things she deserves. The characters are very small. However, it is better than a sixth, but the worst film in the series. My rating 2/10
