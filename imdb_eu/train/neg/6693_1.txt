Escape from this movie. B-movie standards are also horrible. The matter is very bad. The main issue is that people who deny society and who are not respectful of anything is cool and deserving of it. Respectfully treated by others are losers. Guncrazy is a movie that speaks much better than this movie. See it <br /> <br /> The normal child who does not have Trent. State Troopers do not work like these. When you watch this movie you realize why writers use a clue of gold. Mija is a fan of a totally disgusted man, she has had a terrible life. However, it is a great person who can not identify the audience. <br /> <br /> Usually one thing is recommended for the movie, in this case there is not. The film is so ridiculous that the insulting person who tries to identify with the main characters. According to the B-movie rules, performance and direction are not new or interesting.
