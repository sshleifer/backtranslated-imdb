I keep religion out of non-governmental film. When I want a sermon, I'll go to the church, but I do not want any movie. I do not care about supernatural issues, (after all, religion is supernatural!), But I was really angry at how much this film had preached. The witch reminded me of the witches he had seen in other films. The evil man looked like horns too. <br /> <br /> And what an end was absurd: the hero went to the meeting and all those old men cried out to him, which broke the spell. Life was only easy. When the movies are stupid, I think they should be distributed with a warning: LORRA! USING A CONTENT!
