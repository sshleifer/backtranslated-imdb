That was horrible when it was in the plot, but the rest was bad. I mean, the puppet came and then tried to become a digital movie and become even worse! Normally I would like a low-budget movie, but it was just a waste of time and I wanted to return almost. I have ten small budget films with 6-8 similar films and a worse film for all of them. In the same way, the writing is turned off and they use false plastic foams, although they do not seem authentic; The ones used may also look less than authentic, so save your time and money and do not watch the scary movie.
