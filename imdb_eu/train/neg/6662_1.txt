* Run before spoilers and extreme bashing * <br /> <br /> This show started for the first time, I found it to be sustainable and fun. Oddparents was a cartoonist who loved children and adults. Spongebob also had great ratings. But Butch Hartman and his team were dropped as a result of the show. <br /> <br /> First of all, common humor is not very fun. You can easily laugh with a little Kiddie with a burp, but this is quite rare, such as the only laughing template joke. Next there are kiddie jokes. We can see people Lol in their clothes, and we can cross people. LOLOLOL !!! I just can not stop it! Someone helped me! But of course, this show would not be bad unless stereotypical. Did you see how the Australian was portrayed? They only saw simple bumblebees and boomerangs that inhabit a hot desert. But now ... Why does the hunts of hatred most shocked show their ... More JOKES! !!! The show continues to make jokes (most of them do not know the majority), thinking it's just like what happened! Cosmo is primarily a fault. I hated how they mentioned "Super Toilet" (also mixing Kiddi humor) and Cosmo awful. And who could have forgotten that joke of the drums, would all Dimmsdale's parents use it in that electronic mail? Do you know that every single parent (who tells the other parents' minds) would say the same phrase before entering the children's room? Yes, some people may be a first class humor, but it's just for the others. <br /> <br /> If I'm not mistaken, Butch Hartman has said something to conclude. Thanksgiving to God! All people around me say that Nickelodeon is a fun show. Can not I agree with that? Every day I think it's just another stack of horses that we get in our cartoon stations.
