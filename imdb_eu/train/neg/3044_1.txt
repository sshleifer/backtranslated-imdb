It's a strange movie, Santa Claus lives in a cloud space and battles Satan and his soldiers ... but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> It really has laughter ... However, it is necessarily controversial. This movie is not good, but I can say that I really like to see it. <br /> <br /> "Santa Claus conquered the Martyrs", "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "Santa clause" with Tim Allen.
