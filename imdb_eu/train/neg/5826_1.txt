Slow and pleasant images changed with 75% of the first movie, sometimes with 75% of the first movie, when you know Bjork. If you do not have enough sleep, it's a good time. <br /> <br /> But the last 20% of the film's director renews the idea of ​​reconsigning or deciding otherwise through S & M images: "spiritual lovers" are cutting each other with knives. It was very distressing for me and it really changed the general mix of abstract art and the modern Japanese mystery imagery. <br /> <br /> The operator and the director are very good, but it's strange. <br /> <br /> I did not like it.
