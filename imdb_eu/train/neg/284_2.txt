Only today, I gathered it today at the 99 cents store, and I still think I've stolen it. "Dream to Believe" gymnastics drama is quite boring and realistic and $ 1 is very expensive for this. This movie only stands out in 2 things: 1. Keanu Reeves is young. And 2. Directed by Paul Lynch, Promo Night also made the man. Now to the movie. <br /> <br /> It's about a girl named Robin (played by Olivia D'Abo), injured by a high-cost accident at her father's house. Therefore, the accident prevents competition from gym tournaments. He often selects in schools and eventually encounters a savage boy named Tommy (he plays Keanu). Miss, in a laundry property for her unborn child. He will finally compete. <br /> <br /> In general, Keanu alone and the 80's are melodies that are not so attractive to me as this star prevents me and it's never been one of the worst films, but it's still not good. The DVD does not get any medals, because it looks like an old VHS and, finally, the sound is not synchronized and the end credits are almost complete, the black disappears, although the sound may still be. listen Therefore, this is probably going to be a bootleg mode. The DVD art does not make sense because Keanu and Olivia's latest pictures seem to be, and the back does not have anything to do with the movies, even in the movie. In any case, avoid costs at all costs, except Keanu fanatic. Surely I will not hang it anymore. I'll probably give it to The Cinema Snob, an excellent critic for YT. Hey, if you want any movie that you do not like if you want it, give it to your show for free.
