Here's a review of people like this. This movie is sucked from the beginning to the end. I dropped popcorn on the screen and I made myself entertain MSF2000. The land has great opportunities and it is stupid enough. Did the straight fall into the cone and could not injure him ????? And is it rich? Is the psychologist famous? Come on, people. Will he go to the best time to talk about everyone who has gathered to talk about his agreement? This was so staggering, even though the movie would be faced with the evil half viewers. Rain would have insulted the man. Also, I am scorned by Mamet, some of them who eat meat, with passion for beginners and leather. My hatred is so difficult that logic defies. But I'll give it a shot. It's not real to suppose. I do not care They all speak that. Mamet can not create characters; Everything you can do is make a different voice through different actors. It's not surprising that his actors are wooden. They get confused because everyone has the same character. (However, their latest films are improved)
