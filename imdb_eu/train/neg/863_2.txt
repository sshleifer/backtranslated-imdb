I realized I was afraid of Euro, especially the director of Jess Franco worship director, who does not expect any kind of plot. However, Franco has overcome this film; Despite being a surrealist atmosphere, and the reputation of being one of the best film directors, Succubus is unfortunately a huge film. I must admit that I saw an American cut in the form of about 76 minutes; But if it's just logic cut out, I'm sure that Europe's long version is more boring. The plot takes place with a woman who is around; Practicing and speaking S & M is very boring. There is no gore and sex is sad, and in most times the conversation is boring and this is a short film; I made it very difficult until the end. It is worth pointing out that the locations look good and that Franco has worked well in his surreal atmosphere; But the positive elements end there. Jess Franco is a talented director who directs some of the most remarkable classical films, but seems to have made some money, and I generally jump in and see some of the most interesting director's works.
