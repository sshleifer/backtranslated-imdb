This movie was a good premise: 9 people were afraid of earning a million dollars. Unfortunately, it's not a good movie. The scene is too long and it's like a dance scene. Some scenes are just an excuse for pointing the camera to the body parts of women. Playing is bad, but some lines are fun with their horrible terrific. It's really strange that the movie turns into a 5-minute western mode and eventually their rumors did not make sense with the rest of the movie. Apparently, the director seemed to add beautiful things, it seemed to be a good look, while the movie's language was adapted to this point. It was sensible. The only great thing was the people who were dancing down the hall, but this did not go wrong to make up for the rest of it.
