Why have I lost 1.5 hours of watching this life? Why was this film created? Why do I comment on this movie? <br /> <br /> A reviewer said that this film was patient and it was not for everyone. I do not know who this movie is. Maybe after dropping an acid blow, YOURSELVES, ANYTHING can be seen and meaningful. It's incoherent, it's not experimental, it's plain and simple. The movie does not follow any line, when you think about it, yes ... you do not. <br /> <br /> I think that the end of the movie (which is not a coincidence) is what the viewer can do to see what happens. I do not think I would put a spoiler here, it would not matter. This movie is missing in the movie world.
