The symbol of a classic movie is as old as fine red wine. This movie is not Cabarnet and definitely Casablanca. I agree with the other reviewers that the children of the filmmakers have extreme mutations in the seats we sit down in the night and that they are the anger and predication of conversation. But let's look at the old movie theme. <br /> <br /> Sixty years after the passage comes wisdom. Watch on the Rhin, Lillian Hellman, the author of the book "Pentimento", has appeared as a plagiarist Bidenesque. Since it is one of the most abominable voices in the West of the West, it is evident that in the movie theater and film, it was a stalemate for American action to stalen the bloody dictator of Stalin and the nation's fascist communism. Spain's military superiority. <br/> <br /> As a reporter said well, this is not a pro-American theater and movie, as Lillian went to his grave as a communist American hatred. This movie tells the familiarity of the intellectual elites that left the American left, such as The Daily Kos and Michael Moore's entire moon on the left, buying back the conspiracy theories and giving them comfort and comfort to the people. destroy america
