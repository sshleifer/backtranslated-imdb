This documentary is based on the complete reflections on this evidence, where Brian Flemming, perhaps even more accurately, has not mentioned important anti-evidence. Perhaps his most important mistake is one of the first: Paul rejects the key claims about Jesus' testimonial illness, such as the existence of beliefs written in Paul's letters. According to these ideas, the main claims of Jesus were probably formulated in faithful statements within the years of God's death and the resurrection. ** The testimonies of the early Christians can not be cast as empty fantasy. Many people said that this was the Messiah at the time, but only one of them remained: Jesus. Why? It would be as divine that someone believed in the message of Christ, and he would die for these beliefs, because he knew they did not revive. ** Although the gospels are more freely of origin, we still talk about Jesus' accounts, that is, written in the life of some other visionary eye in these gospels. And it seems that the gospels have been written much earlier. <br /> <br /> What I want to say is that Flemming's documentary is a very Christian and self-serving, which has tried different arguments and proofs of Christianity. Do not be fooled by poor research.
