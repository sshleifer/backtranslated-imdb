Yes, I'm sure it might be a nation. . . Four of them were in four corners of the world and the other two were cloned millions. Men, I'm glad I did not rent this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting it. I'm a fan of George Romero's films and I'm very sure if he was watching this movie, he would surely throw it away while he laughed. I mean, what were raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like Charlie's Devils? Actually, the composer also helped the composer choose a music-based show, when the zombies came to their murderer, especially in the warehouse store / station / apartment / flat or in any room that was included in the warehouse. In the back with gong, and direct woman arguing that the furniture store was closing. I could not even tell him about the murderer of nicotine, and he pointed out that his accent had not helped many nations. Well, what can I expect from a repository in a movie without a random battle scene, apparently ships send air boxes around the world. So, for all those who worship Mystery Science Theater 3000 or the worst movies C (C Craptastic for reaming), this is a movie for you. . . or not
