William Gove, writer and director, will give my credit to finance this "thriller". Good reason to keep money from subscribing to HBO, and even less buying skin-based DVDs and blurbs. Dennis Hopper, pedestrian and Richard Grieco, have nothing to do with the game, although the direction of art is not bad. The conversation will astonish you with pride; This is his worst tournament. No tension, no suspense, no fear, no fear, no enmity, no catharsis, nothing. They are bored by some attractive and often naked women, but this is definitely the movie that looks like a trailer. I feel the guy that heated this thing. Good night, only to see zoned-out. You have been warned
