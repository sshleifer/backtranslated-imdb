the worst film I've seen so far. It does not help to even play a scene of pheasmic action and really bad. The most important thing is that Gary busey's fragments, but that's not raising a lot of movies. B reaches the film's ranking and exceeds the test colors. My loss of money, despite the fact that it's a funny start to getting angry after some watches. I do not recommend this film for free or a gift. (You can request a gift and pay a full refund). <br /> <br /> Really put. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
