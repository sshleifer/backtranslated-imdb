I never knew the movie until I found an old copy of VHS, hidden in my remote horror closet. The headline of the box said "Insects" and the backlight illustrated that it was a horrible horror movie of the 80's. Certainly, it can be fun, of course, if you do not expect an intelligent scenario and you're not angry at all, if you see a large amount of cheesy cheeks. All the great looks that are worth the horror movie are described here in "Blue Monkey"! The plot is ridiculous and very strange, watching plays is painful and there is no suspicion. Following the increasingly popular trend of "Big-bug", the new "Blue Monkey" is the new species of insects that eliminate doctors and patients from a remote hospital. Manufacturers could not be harder to avoid the origin of this star-sized size! We all know that it was not in space and initially came out of a tropical plant. In addition, there is no explanation of the origin of this new type of insect that suddenly comes! As I said, do not expect a smart script. The first part of the movie is quite fun, with a beautiful gorge and two great characters (80 year old blind and alcoholic lady!) But the second part (when the whole hospital is quarantined) is terribly boring. In the end, "Blue Monkey" begins to rip older (and better) movies. Approaching the victory, the budget was apparently depleted, because the lighting was very poor and the monster costume was not well camouflaged. "Blue Monkey" is worth the look when you get bored or watch the horror movie you've ever seen in the 80's. B-movie fans can admit John Vernon ("Killer Klowns Space Outer", "Curtains") to Roger's clinic responsible for the small and meaningless role of Roger.
