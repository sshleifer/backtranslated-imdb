The performance was not bad, but production was so bad, I felt that it was sometimes necessary to stop, but I was unhappy, and I was able to finish the whole movie that was ashamed of me. It's ok o.k. He has a shameful plot of land and he does not care about seeing a murderous Whitman movie. If you want a fictional short story.
