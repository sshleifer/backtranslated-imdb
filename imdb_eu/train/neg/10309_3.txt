"CIA Codename: Alexa" Luc Besson's "La Femme Nikita" (1990) is a great challenge for classic film. Basically, it is about a woman who has taken and trained the CIA and is forced to make a secret mission for them. (Quite a bit of the story of La Femme Nikita's story) Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. theater combination Simpson is perhaps the worst in film history. "Lamas" "Steven Segalen" is a bad day. Orenthal's show in this movie is a great experience. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting is so poor in this film, it's an amazing moment. The "conventions" of the film are so ridiculous as the movie: explosion of strange cars, glass windows, terrorists, horse-hair, etc. Flying ones. The musical scores resemble David Michael Frank's "Hard to Kill" (1990), which promotes the subject of Steven Segal. There is a lot of martial arts films and it's pretty good for low-budget American production. Striking action and high-class theater never fails, and I must admit that I was gentle. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lamas in the early 90's looked like a star of action but it was definitely not a star. For this reason, it does the telenopeges and not the burglaries of acts. My recommendation is to skip "CIA Codename: Alexa" and look at "La Femme Nikita".
