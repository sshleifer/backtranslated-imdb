The Tower of the Babel, part of the small series, describes the narrator as the tower builders "descendants of Moses". <br /> <br /> That's what George Washington had said he had spent a lot of time before Alexander the Great. <br /> Or the bulb was invented before the wheel. <br /> <br /> Or that the missile was guided that it was a pivotal arch and arrow. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have to say more? <br /> <br /> Biblical Great Heroes writers should pay less attention to Bible chronologies of people and events.
