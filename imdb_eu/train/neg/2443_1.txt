This is not a bad film, it's never the worst movie. It's so bad that it's so nice. the play, oh my god, the script, you have to be a little bit '. How can you imagine a child who makes fireworks in the future a fireman who makes fireworks, when someone attacks him, flies a hundred meters and explodes. -A girl who is trapped by a wizard is trying to open the killer door. It gets a drill bit, but it's not enough wire. He first makes the extention cord fearing, and then, when he finishes, he crosses the door and crosses the head of the murderer. WOW - and there are many examples of them. yes, and what happened to George Kennedy, it was great (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool hand Luke)
