Prior to the risk of showing sexual relations before the 80s, Personal Best could have sex-related relationships with Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as an experimental phase in Cahill's life. <br /> The creators of this movie have attracted the same sex relationships to attract attractive viewers to two women. Also, keep in mind that more than 90 women will be able to show some reliefs that jump over a high-flying pole. This random scene was very important to the film, and it appeared that the interest of these thriller films was only kept in the audience. I think producers are trying to face a boring plot and a more boring scene of the movie (1980's Oregon Track and Field Competition). <br /> <br /> The review seems tough, but it's true. Muriel Hemingway's exploitation of the body and sexual intercourse destroyed the credits that I gave to this film. <br /> <br /> Pepper Thompson
