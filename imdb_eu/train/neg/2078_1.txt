I saw the movie yesterday and, despite the fact that I did not have much hope for this movie, I was still disappointed! Actually, I do not think I saw this movie that I spent 96 minutes of my life ... it was a bad !!! The story was embarrassing and the performance was awful (although it had great names, such as Uma Thurman). This film was based on its special effects ... but they did not have any effect personally. Honestly, I wanted to see the id, and I warned everyone not to watch this movie. Money is totally ruined and you will be disappointed. My advice is to save money, make purchases, treat yourself, just do not go see this movie ... Lol!
