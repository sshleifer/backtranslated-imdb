I always thought people were cynical about the old movies Andy Hardy. Some of them were not bad. Modern film critics are not usually those who prefer to be more pleasing; so that two very popular movie shades rarely increase <br /> <br /> However, I can not even defend the movie. You may still have a dated conversation, but still laughed and wept across the story. When you see that, you just want to shake your head: "how stupid can you?" This is a sharper than the corner, you know what you mean. It's so rugged that I do not have too many people seated in the middle of half an hour. <br /> <br /> The story is "Andy" basically (Mickey Rooney), because it is trying to get out of the marmelade. He completes a story involving New York original novel, as if it were the latter. People were a conscious social age. You would hear the term "Social Climber", it was a wealthy or beautiful person who knew how to get acquainted with it for life. It is a nonsense, of course, and nowadays it looks even bigger. <br /> <br /> However, the innocent and the story and the series are cleansed (some dozen of them were made by Andy Hardy). Also, if you want to hear Judy Garland, this is your card, it sings a couple of songs and goes into the heart of Andy. Oh, man, I almost dump it too!
