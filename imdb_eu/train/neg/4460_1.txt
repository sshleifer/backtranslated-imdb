Horrendous! Avoid plague. This would be the worst film ever. Special effects, performance, mood, sound, etc. It seems like a wait by the children of the day ... wait, I've seen the programs better than this. It opens like a naked female wizard that does a scene, from then on it's going bad. Naked scenes, but that's it. Sound and light problems lasted throughout the film. Sometimes I would swear they hear the roar of camera engines. Yikes! I would like to see another movie about this story, but many people have done it. This cast and crew series requires lessons and movies for lessons. Vote from 1 to 10.
