There have been some fun movies about Hollywood's spirits to get out. Cary Grant was the "Angel of the Bishop's Wife" (1947). Of course, the best ones were the late 30s and the 40s Topper films. And recently, Warren Beatty's "Heaven Can Wait" (1978), was a new version of "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" in 1941. These comedies were well-written, entertaining and entertaining, like supernatural creatures such as ghosts and angels. <br /> <br /> Now comes the story that Jeff Lowell does not make his debut film debut director. Eve Longoria Parker, after the death of her younger brother, has returned to the dreaded spiritualist Ashley (Lake Bell), who is falling into the fairy tale of Henry (Paul Rudd). At first, one thing is clear: Longoria Parker is not Constance Bennett (Marion Kerby's first "Topper"). It is the norm that measures women's ghosts. <br /> <br /> There is a line at the beginning when Henry, sister of Chloe (Lindsay Sloane), says to Henry, "You do not smile." This film has described my situation very well. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the movie is not a very funny script. The presence of Longoria Parker got worse, but every time she appeared on the screen she stepped on the wrong path. Just starting up, completing his comic talents is full of pancake makeup, who knows what he really looks like? Kate dies while her wedding is setting on frozen statues. That is so reasonable that the angel that explains why he is for all his life goes to him (well, he actually disappears), so that Kat returns to earth without knowing what his mission is as a ghost. <br /> <br /> Chloek wants Katie to naturally take off the operation he's been doing after Kate's death (regardless of what I've seen with Kate, she should feel a terrific relief), she's actually presented to Ashley. I do not know what he does as a spiritualist (he is also a provider) to find out whether or not to contact Henryk Kate. There are many masses that follow. <br /> <br /> The film's gap Ashley's assistant is "B" story about Dan (Jason Biggs). This is near the end, but it's how Ashley handles it as it's a boob like Cats. It is well worth the money that Dan finds is attracted to these seemingly defective women. <br /> <br /> In the end, Kat will appear to Ashley and the fun begins. It's no more, and it's more pain, because in other hands this can be a bit fun. In fact, Norman Z. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray and Co. They must go back to the grave, knowing the brightness of the first films in "Topper".
