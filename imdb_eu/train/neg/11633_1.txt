I would give it a zero star for this, but unfortunately I have to give it one ... <br /> <br /> It's not a single scene that could create ... but the game did not make me laugh either. So, if you are overdue, go to the local cinema, watch the movie and give it 10 stars, as here are some. <br /> <br /> but for me ... in a movie, children are shot dead to get humor ... it's a good taste that goes beyond limit ... it was the third time that I missed my time watching a Boll movie and it was my last! <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... I am ashamed in the same country as Uwe Boll! <br /> <br /> Please, please, keep up the ongoing movies !!!!!
