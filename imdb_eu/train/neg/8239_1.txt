This is a great movie I've actually seen. Simply, nobody knows how to release it as this boldly. <br /> <br /> Norms of production atrocious. Cinematography does not happen. Camera work, writing, acting and sound is unbelievable. I think there is a plot, but it could be seen in 10 minutes. In the midst of this piece, the neurotic na√Øve hystericals have no credibility. <br /> <br /> I'd like to avoid spending any time and money on this title. It's very late. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14, 2008
