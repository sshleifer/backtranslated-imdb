I am a fan of horror films for the 80s. This is not the worst, but it's still not spectacular. The land line is decent, but it's too long. Even if you go through half the movie before watching a zombie action. The killings are not very creative and the zonists are not very heavy. I really think that this movie would be better if it was left out of the zombie and it was introduced to the mafia movie. It may seem, but I think that this movie was stolen at least one hour of my life. I'm going to give the film credits for being an original. If you enter B horror movies, it's worth seeing, but if you're not there, do not worry. But you do not need to take my word.
