We all asked: "Why do not slasher movies repeat properly, instead of recovering them, so they can be better?" well with Prom Night, Jamie Lee Curtis's 80s have been a fun but trashy movie and even worried. The numbers are a Slasher movie, which is clearly trying to attract young teens (so violence is not etc), slasher is a blunt knockout in this movie. The director tries so much time trying to make it look attractive enough to be quite shocking. Britney Snow (The Greatest Hairspray) is taken out of the window from any other job, but the material does nothing, but it looks like a terrifying look. Badly how to handle death scenes. They will hear attacks but they will not see it). The only one who works in the film knife seems to have been in the editing room, because the movie has been killed (it was overwhelmingly finishing inventing something that was frightening reminders to cut off children). The Americans have thrown money in this box! Slasher movies are very fun, but I wanted to download the original case for Prom Nights. OC I saw OC and Dawsons Creek sections
