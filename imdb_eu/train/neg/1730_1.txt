First of all, I'd like to emphasize that I only know the show because they always see my younger sister. I think the television program is annoying. There is nothing fun about a "joke", and preserving recipes are overwhelming. The show would work much better if shot in front of a live audience. In this way, laughter would show how uncomfortable the exhibition is. However, it is due to the active talents of young performers. However, I feel bad that in the future the show will look back and see the first TV series bad. Shows great shows with CBBC's most general voices and general style presenters. Today's youngsters would have to cry so much for me. That's all.
