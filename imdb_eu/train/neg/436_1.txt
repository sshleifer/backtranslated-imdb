If a Christian has ever crushed you on the crust, "Jesus is the answer. What is the question?", Then maybe you should thank God if you did not know Lacanian. Slavoj Zizek, Lacanian's evangelizer, should surely share the word "Jesus" in the "Lacan / Hegel" statement. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < So it seems that everyone seems - anyone comes and says: "Hold on, tell the movie about ourselves." <br /> <br /> The ideas described in this film by Zizek are "true". . For example, Zizek explains three Marx Broses ego, superconstruction and id (God knows what happened to Zeppo, or Gummo? Perhaps they are indications ... or the movies themselves?). That's just what they are. In Zizek's departure, culture is not an investigation, but only as an example of its ideology. People can definitely say something about objections - but how differently is Christians giving everything to God's will? <br /> <br /> What happens, for example, on film or anywhere, to clarify the theory? Well, nothing. As you believe, maybe it's as proof. However, simply, these propaganda and examples can not be isolated in their context. Without context, you can say what you want and prove it. For worms, Lacan is the answer? That's why it's going and that's an example. Everything, but everything that seems to be the teaching of the master and culture, is to serve this ideology. For example, Zizek's Voyeur fantasy position model comes out of a Vertigo scene, when he spies Jimmy Stewart in a flower shop with Kim Novak. But in the context of the film, this is not the fantasy of the voyeur. Stevak himself directs Novak. Presentation of the extracts from the context Zizue continues with a two and a half hour sermon. <br /> <br /> If you look at Blue Velvet's "Wanted baby" scene, it's very difficult. In light of what he thinks about the "truth of the feminine jouissance", Zizek says that Isabella Rossilini's nature is not only her degradation, but she is consciously responsible for the situation. This is his "birth" example. Well ... maybe. But - Excuse me to be prosaic - where is his proof? In the film, he is gradually being humiliated because Hopper kidnaps his son. Zizek may say that Kyle MacLachalan also enjoys rough sex. But that may be a lot of things. Is not it a feminine "delight"? According to Lacan, feminine, unlike jouissance falcon, can not be articulated, it is beyond phallic capture and language castration. If that is the case, there is no such thing. The whole concept is not meaningful and mystical. Only dogmatists like you can say: "You have a feminine party why, why is this feminine festival? I mean that." <br /> <br /> What can you get from these films? Only Psychology. Why is it that he continues to enter into his favorite films, when he enters the Botega Bay aboard, wants to be with Rod Steiger? Is not it the desire of someone who criticizes the movie? As it is said, Freud would have a day-to-day guided tour of Pervert film, but Ziz himself, no one. <br /> <br /> The movies show us that the way we want is straightforward. For these, these films can not be examples of psychoanalytical laws. This film shows how we want Zizek, and it's just too vague, it's almost useless, the rest of us want it. Indeed, as one psychoanalyst knows, we can not fully differentiate the desired way and desire - and it can not be easily universalized in any way. Zizek loves to make an example of Lacan's Response: how do we want it? I do that. The problem is that Zizek's desire and everything else is rationalized. But Zizen is a Leninist and definitely likes "not talking about" the subject of self-talk. <br /> <br /> Pervert film guide Zizek is a dogmatic love and is very philosophical, although it remains a very polite policy (what is not a dogma?). Zez has never questioned the reasons that could be triggered by its analysis, what he wants to know, his exploration conditions and, therefore, his ethics, are never questioned. <br /> <br /> Zizek is very fruitful, but all her books and this movie say the same thing. Henry Ford's theory of culture is that mass production and all colors are black. It is perfect for today's consumer society: it is believed to be critical for people over time over the local c-ap and is something different. This is very popular because people prefer to respond to their problems to a large extent, which always gives capitalism, without much research. What is the brain dead? In my opinion, Zizek's third Matrix pill is a suicide capsule. <br /> <br /> PS: I loved the solemn opinion of Zizek - presented as a revelation on film and humanity - the music of the film can have a lot of sympathy for the public. Were it happening after seeing it with Jaws?
