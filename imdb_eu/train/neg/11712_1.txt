I remember this movie because it is the only reason (and still) the time and money spent is the most unnecessary. I was 17 years old and my friends were 18 years old. Action movies we had the best to enjoy (maximum second). I went out so that we felt that we were insulted, we wanted to get back the money, but the time had never been recovered. <br /> <br /> This edition is a dead movie. While the truck is attacking more and more attacking truck shooters attacking more cars, the movie is totally insulting the audience's intelligence with the 4x4 VW Bugs to shoot at the truck that charges rockets. Please, do the rockets have a plutonium in a truck? Worse it is that the VW got the 15-18 shots of the 4/8 trigger. You would see VW 4 rockets fire with 2 of them with the truck, attached to the end, return a second later with two rockets, another shot and then go to the truck and now it will return. four sets of fireworks <br /> <br /> We wait for a great finish to happen. They seem to be in the money and they seem to stop. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous.
