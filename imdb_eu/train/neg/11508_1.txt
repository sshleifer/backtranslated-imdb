Guy Ritchie was rebuilt by Wertmuller's films. <br /> <br /> This new movie is wrong. I saw another person who watched the audience and left it for about an hour. (He asked for a return of hope). The only reason I had finished was that I had never walked in a movie. <br /> <br /> But that thin junk was sitting up to me that was totally disturbed by Madonna. and Ritchie could think he made a good movie. The dialogue is dark, the play is very late and this movie is a beautiful thing in the landscape. Ritchiek Lina took the movie and transformed it into another "Blue Lagoon". <br /> <br /> This is a movie, even if you had a movie tonight at night in Cinemax. It's a very coveted time to waste that kind of ruin.
