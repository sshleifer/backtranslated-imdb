I saw Paris I saw Je t'Aime, because I wanted to see a friend really, I went with her. In the network, I was indifferent about the movie, but I left the theater for 2 hours of my life sitting through that hot production. "Stories" have almost completely been forgotten, except most of them are horrible. What does Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara have with Paris? The endless parade of American actors definitely gave this French film a non-French feeling. Parisian topicals were endless. Yes, most of them played with Parisian topicals, but they spent so much time with the French newsmakers, they directly and unfortunately re-promoted them. Yes, Paris is the city of love. We get it <br /> <br /> The worst parts are: directed by Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); With Nick Nolte; a mime (worst?); hair product; With Juliette Binoche (Willem Dafoe as a cowboy in Paris?); A vampire (I think Elias in Paris when I think). With Natalie Portman, that is, he looked like a trade in Mentos and he was stupid (when the blind young man knew that Portman had only one task). He went on and on. It was not endless. <br /> <br /> I did not like one of Coen Bros. She plays with Parisian topicals, but I did not find fun. Annoying Gus Van Sant was a very interesting one, but it was very small (and pale it was clear) that he barely registered. <br /> <br /> There were only two "successful segments" and immigrant immigration. The baby leaves a baby to look after a baby in a rich woman. There's a lovely irony there. And the segment that divides Africans. It is the best segment of the whole movie, but this segment is not related to Paris. The story could have happened in any city around the world. <br /> <br /> The last segment was also interesting with the middle-aged woman, but the underlying tone was bad. They wanted to celebrate the French character, but the segment was rigorous. <br /> <br /> The whole project was forced and inspired. The French government almost protected this film as a promoter of tourism. In short, only 10 or 15 minutes of interest, the "Paris Je T'Aime" cinema experience was awesome.
