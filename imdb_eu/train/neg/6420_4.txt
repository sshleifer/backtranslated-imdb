I'll be OK, it's very nice and good, but then it's down, I can not believe that Sarah Michelle Gellar finished the movie for about 5 minutes, but there was only one reason left. I wanted to see the movie, I wanted to turn it around in Ned, and to my surprise, yes, if people can not tell me, the end leaves you confused, then your credit card. hell This is not worth the race of theatrical, I'm sorry, but I did not say it was horrible, because I gave the only reaso because I had some jumpers ... that's it! You can see it, you do not say no, well, maybe you like it or love it even more! But if you hate it, do not say you did not warn!
