The 1920's jazz, 1920's, Charleston, and ultra-swanky yachts (for example, for me, for every single sale) for anyone who would like this movie. But that is a huge matter. The plots are plain and obvious, the most commonly played scene or the face of the going-on party, and when the whole thing is left there is nothing but the impression of mirrors and smoke. This is a bad movie.
