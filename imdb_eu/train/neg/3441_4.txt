What was that hell? Someone seems to be Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester. Horror is mixed with the existential. Sometimes it was a time-consuming moment, but each one canceled huge music, CGI or plays. <br /> <br /> That strange story is like a problem that is lazy. David Lynch's works are also similar, and his shows and movies are too long. Unfortunately, it's only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> Cast was attractive, and that's the limit. I think that the feeling of adolescents and the fears of loneliness all over us, but we just do not care that the characters are fond of their fate ... whatever. The last scene, the whole thing is ambiguous.
