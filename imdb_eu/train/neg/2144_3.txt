I always thought that Cinderella II was the worst movie I've ever seen (afterwards, Peter Pan 2 and The Lion King 2 and other Hunchbacks of Notre Dame 2). All these films are made with the same idea; The film does not make any plot, they fix it by joking. I do not say jokes are bad, but they make up the biggest movie. When I first watched the movie I would give it for the first time 1/10. But now I think, most children do not care about what the original movie is, the movie is entertaining. It is alleged that the movie is still a sequel, but that does not mean that it is horrible. I think it's worth 3/10 now.
