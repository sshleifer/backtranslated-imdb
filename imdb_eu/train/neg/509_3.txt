This movie is about British prisoners of war fleeing from German war camps. <br /> <br /> "Wooden horse" is boring. The subject could be exciting, suspicious and adrenaline, but "Wooden Horse" is very common. It is a collection of common and ill-considered events without suspensions and emotions. The first part clearly indicates how prisoners of war are thrown into a tunnel, but the incidents are very common, it is not enough to put an end to the event and turn it back. The second half of the film is even worse, they move from one place to another, without any cats or mice. And the characters may have a bit less talk and more action in a movie! I was disappointed with "The Wooden Horse", losing a potential for a big movie.
