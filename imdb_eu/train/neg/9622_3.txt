When I saw the movie show on TV, I really expected that. As I grew up in the 80's and like all those who grew up in that period, we saw all the youth and outdoor films in the 80's. So I could not wait to see the movie that totally ruins the genre. What a despair! The movies were just a bunch of jokes and jokes. There was no plot or substance. And filmmakers tried to make moody mistakes completely - some jokes were undeniably. The good things about this film were wardrobe, music and theater. It was a pleasure to travel nostalgia and see all the summer clothes of the 80s, and the same thing happened with music. And the performance was high: they were almost all of Hollywood's best comedies. Bad is not a better material to work on.
