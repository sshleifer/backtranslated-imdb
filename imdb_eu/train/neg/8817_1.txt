No, I have never seen the "Santa Slasher" series, that is, "Silent Silence, Deadly Night", the original "Black Christmas" or "Christmas Evil." I've heard all about their glory, or MADS (Santas Derrobat against Moms.) I would like to rent this as I've heard as a reference to the "Fat Guys at the Movies" segment. </ B> <br /> <br /> My mother should be the opposite, but not Santa ooooohhhh for "killer", but this movie was a mere one. Boring, long Just 92 minutes, crap. <br /> <br /> The little boy sees a Santa that goes through the fireplace in 1947, delivers gifts, eats some bread and, above all, raises the fireplace. The boy goes to bed, but he returns to the living room as a mother and a Santa (such as a witness). Apparently, he took away the guys for a lifetime, although the scene was as penetrating as the father of Ralphie's "Christmas story". He was very upset, he went to the attic and cut his hand well. <br /> <br /> A fast pace! Now, it's 1980, and the evil boy works in a toy factory. She gets a little cheek and looks after her children and parents. Who is naughty, who is nice, blah blah. Does he take two-thirds of the film to finally arrest him? as if it were not planned from one frame. YOU DO NOT USE TO TAKE LONG. <br /> <br /> I confess that this film had a strain on the construction, but only because it expected to do something for everything. In the end, well, punish "who is naughty", as a "Garbage Pail Kid" card. And I did not mention the end of the WTF. I think it's a metaphor, but in reality the movie is as rare as the rest. (Take a brother who has disturbed his brother, and he is about to kill him). Do not open this mess either Gabon or evil. Again, I did not see other "Santa-Slashers", but this one was badly sucked. He created a great revival for the character of the film and never gave a good presentation.
