Romantic and completely false view of unemployment from a middle-class "artist" to a comfortable education ... It is clear that the writer's director does not suffer from direct unemployment and certainly has no personal experience. If you need to believe in a totally ridiculous story, unemployed people of all ages act like teenagers, they do not start, no fear, no frustration, and so on. Everyone lives in jest for a day, full of jokes. They never look for work, they rarely feel hardship or anguish, and so on. Living in a dump is a summer school holiday almost like it ... horny. Especially with contemporary theater masterpieces such as Ken Loach.
