I think that it is one of the most popular holiday movies ever seen, such as Christmas WIFE and JACK FROST. All three films are about death. If you like to be deeply depressed, by the way, see this path or any other. In this movie, acting is good and the beautiful landscape (when people are dying apart) is beautiful. But, it is worried that a clinically affected person can accidentally watch the movie and do it on their own! In the end, however, "fortunately", the most important part of this film is the successor of one. And, for a crazy reason, I do not DESIMINATE when I see a Christmas movie (I know this people seems crazy - after all, my eyes are sad and unhappy feelings are still the holidays?). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To get a more comfortable viewer experience, try unforgettable HOME AT HOME WITHOUT ATTENDANCE, instead of George C. Scott's Christmas CAROL or a Christmas HISTORY.
