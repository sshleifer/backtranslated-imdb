Since seeing a fragment from 1 to 3, I can honestly say that they never have to take part 4. All of that from the trash, and a nonsensical score, I mean it is very dramatic and I dare to see all this and not bored. minds <br /> <br /> I mean that parts 1 to 3 have kept the plot in Damion, but without it it's not the same. I'm sure at the end of 3rd, I was a bit exhausted with the story of the constant line, but it was a good shutdown at the end of the third. There were no parts left again for 4 reasons. Although he could do much better than I should have been sitting, lol. I'll never see you again for half an hour.
