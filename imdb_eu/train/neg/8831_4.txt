I thought I had heard a lot about this movie. As well as being very slow, I do not like the wait, but it's not like that. Many say that there are so many inconsistencies, so it's just a big part of this movie. The reaction of four men comes out of a blow, it is fearful of the body becoming indifferent to fish. Certainly, if they were a kind of man who would continue fishing happily, they would report their body and say they had only found themselves after a fishing trip ... why did they tie the body together with a tree, go fishing and then find it to the body two days before? It's so hard to see a movie that the behavior of the main characters is so inadequate. With regards to the rest of the population, you think that at least one of them can show curiosity about a woman's death! The body itself, except naked, except the ends ... what on stage does it take? If he raped, then why still knickers? If you are raped with a dress, why do you remove the slugs? If it had not been raped, why would you wear your clothes with cotton ... do you try to get rid of it? I really can not believe that any realistic staging would kill someone to steal their clothes rather than kill them, so you can fill out your jumble for sale stalls! It's just seen right away, but it's just, and only inadequate, it's a powerful performance.
