This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was like a movie theater's "homework". The sign completely fails in the "trying to emit" message. Characters are exaggerated, like poor performances and plots ... it's totally ridiculous. The cover film was a good thing to me, a beautiful actress and that. The moral of this film: ACCORDING TO FESTIVALS IN FESTIVALS! Save your time, money and energy and make your own home movie and much better than me. It was difficult to see and, clearly, I was surprised that someone would spend money on doing it and distributing it!
