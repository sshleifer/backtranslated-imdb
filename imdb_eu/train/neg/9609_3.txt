I started to watch this movie I was expecting by this horrible movie Hammer horror movie ... and I was not far away. There was a large amount of gore seen, and many nudities were thrown out, but in the second half of the film they presented ironic ironies. Sacred cow, they actually put a little thought into the story, and things that were anticipated from the beginning did not fall completely. And I would venture to say that some of the "free" nuances were not so free, in short, with the story and the setting. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to be wrong, in general, it's still a bad movie, but when they go bad, it's as intelligent as a real portrait of Lost Women and Robot Monster.
