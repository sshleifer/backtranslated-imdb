Frosty returns and I liked it. Both films are absurd, characters written and bad voices. The voices could be made, but Frosty was a bit worse than this, thanks to the snowman. Frosty's wintry land was very good and, therefore, the original drama was dramatic. Frosty Snowman was just about a good thing about this movie, it was similar to the classic of the 60s, and it was like a fun line, talking about non-real things and then whisking the Frosty window, whisking everything he did, but it was all the rest . poorly written and badly animated, and hardly ever got the plot. About 2 or 3 years ago I saw the cover of the DVD book in the library and the art was bad, so I did not get it until this year, since the images on the back seemed a little bit touched, but I played this movie. Bad art was a horrible character similar to the DVD and it was a great news about what happened. I found out at night and I slept all that I had slept (I always waited for something to see while I was watching something) But this movie was generally boring <br /> <br /> Overall score: Grade C < br /> <br /> This is like a new holiday, when it's frozen back and this one. This is a very bad 4-seventh part of the home, but it was good that the movie was good, but it was only 3 in the home. But it's just like hate like 3 to 4 people at home. My sister did not see much, when she walked into my room for 2 minutes and a half, I walked away "I hate animation!" I accept it as a frosty 3 return. Shame!
