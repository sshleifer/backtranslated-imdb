Yuck! And I say again ... YUCK! The original version of this movie was already a dead story and a story of a man driven through purgatory. The original film said a lot and it was not said. And, a motorcycle was naked. <br /> <br /> This version is something that left me buying and diverting producers. A group of people consciously decided to adapt to the nineties and decided that ethnicities and genres were nice. The movie is not about a challenge he wants to commit suicide. The hospital is about a man who wants to see his wife. <br /> <br /> There was no reason to annoy this movie ...
