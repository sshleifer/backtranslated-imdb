The movie and the performance are not bad and Jay Hernandez plays a good job by Calito Brigante, but the film forgets that it will be a prequel to a hit movie. The head of this prequel clearly did not see the original Carlito Way or at least not follow-up on them. This movie is a prelude to the original film that has given us a story and it will come to an end to the beginning of the movie when it originates or at least. There is not one of the closest original native Carlito friends in this movie, nor does he mention it. Luis Guzman, originally from Pachanga, is a movie, but it is completely different. The original is made in 1975, and the press is made in 1969-1970. Given that this movie is less than 5 years old, you would not think that Carlito's long-standing friends will appear? The original, after Carlito's imprisonment, has passed from prison 5 years. That is the beginning of the end of the end and the beginning of the beginning *** Semi Spoiler *** From the beginning of the original, Carlito has been in prison for 5 years, so the precedent gives us an incredible ending of Hollywood to insult the original fans' intelligence. What's wrong with Gaili? This movie is missing a follow-up on a live video release.
