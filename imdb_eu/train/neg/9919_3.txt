In the beginning of the book "Malta Story", A. Guiness had a resemblance to Noel Coward, whose first words were entirely awaited. "Some of the most remarkable women, as well as the world," or "such as the world," is not a prose, and the master would also bring trouble to life. Indeed, Mr. Guinness walks through the image if he is looking for focus and does not find one. J. Hawkins also leaves early and "Jack Hawkins" performs without individual horror. It could be a series of twelve British war films. their generosity with the sole purpose. Luftwaffe did not attack Maltas, as London did not bring to his knees. The courage of the ill-fated people was accepted by the King and he was awarded the George CrossA island. You can think of one movie, but "Malta Story" is not the term "merit" in its most protective sense. It is imperative that it looks like it is made to be crushed and perhaps the will to live before the actors lose.
