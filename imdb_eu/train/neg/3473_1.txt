This is probably the worst Christmas movie. As the plot does not exist, the performance (especially Affleck) is inadequate. Ben Affleck fans will probably defend this film, but they must be deeply in agreement. As Ben Affleck collected, the millionaire, the seller, shrinks the list of things he wants to go to a place that reminds him of childhood and forget about his childhood. When doing so, he now pays his family to his family to become a Christmas family ... and that's it. The film continues and eventually gets along with her family daughter .... blah blah blah.
