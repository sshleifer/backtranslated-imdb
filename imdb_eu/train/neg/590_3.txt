I regretted this film unfortunately, because they felt fake and that the characters were not powerful enough to make horror attempts. The basic idea of ​​the film was very interesting, but unfortunately I could not get excited, really scared or shocked me - the whole movie was a rumor that I thought was not free. I liked the final character at the end of the movie, when it seemed softened and realistic in the end, the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not necessary for this movie and I think the director / writer. He was taken away with a variety of characters that had not been dissipated, if he had left the basic characters of the solo effort that Kate would have taken part in, he might have worked - Jeremy's picture was the least woody and I felt uncomfortable. Disappointed or missing from the chemistry of the screen. A pity Despair
