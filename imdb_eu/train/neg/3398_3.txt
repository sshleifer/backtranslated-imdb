The intentions of the film seem to be the aggressive (apparent) character of Russians, or at least to Russians capable of traveling abroad. It's very easy to steal a bank in England; and the British police are not so effective when they can not find that bank robbed, even when they leave the airport. In addition, Nicole Kidman and alleged Russian colleagues have never seen a language, possibly Aliens speaks of the Ural Mountains, but they are very Russian. So, if you want to speak Russian, go to Moscow or St. Petersburg, and use Russian pronunciation and grammar pronunciation.
