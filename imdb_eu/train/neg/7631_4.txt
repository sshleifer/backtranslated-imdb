I do not combine the wrong petrologovinis defects of TLPS. Instead, I will look at the positive aspects of a celluloid film. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanoviche made a movie that could stand in full. In fact, the film raises between up and down the sharpest filmography. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovich has shown how genuinely generous can be friendship with Cybill Shepherd (her gal), sharing her wonderful body and her breasts with her male audience, and not just in two occasions. Brava! Film festival's highlight of this film. <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS has almost no stereotyped scenes without doodling background music. (If Peter tried to make clear the film that was in the Deep South of America, it was not clear), so after this point ...) How can this advantage be asked? Well, when the movie ends and the monotonous music of the country eventually ceases to eject your ears, it starts with a strange habit: "Finally, the movie is over!" It's just joy. <br /> <br /> <br /> 4. The film gives the movie to all women that looks like Cloris Leachman. They also hope that one day a boy's boy is much younger and perhaps looks good. <br /> <br /> <br /> 5. The biography of Cloris Leachman (this is not technically a part of the TLPS I realize), all women who look like this, hopefully today, perhaps, Miss Chicago beauty to win the competition (If you have enough money for the jury) <br /> <br /> (I think Cloris has won a beauty contest that I'm making fun of? Well, look at both of us and then we'll see how it laughed ...) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film was shot in black and white, Cloris Leachman's face faced his original non-glory.
