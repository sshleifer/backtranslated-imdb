Not enough here. There are some fun places, but it's not really enough. I was very disappointed, I loved stupid movies. This was a hidden treasure I expected. It is not. It was a turd that was hidden. <br /> <br /> While that was watching me "Geez, I made it better than I was and I'm pretty." Do not think of some good reviews. I absorbed them. I did not laugh at all. Perhaps this was a very funny or avant-garde in 1987, but the man today fell. He promised this movie, but he did not give it up. Maybe they write again. The actors I do not blame. They were not the best, but they did not do much work. This movie failed due to failed typing. Well disappointed.
