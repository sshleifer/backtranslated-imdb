This film is essayed in Sex in the City and Four Weddings and the success of the funeral funeral. Indeed, if they called a funeral called Sex, they could do better at the box office. <br /> <br /> But the movie falls between the two seats and can not get up. The characters have a bright and bright conversation, but they have never played a human being remotely. An arbitrary and absurd action continues to move forward on another plot, and the falsity of the entire company will soon begin. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell gets her little point to play her little heart, but she's doing good looks. Imelda Staunton steals you, like a police detective (is not that height necessary?). Mrs. Staunton can not make a false move. He could say the same thing as the writer and the director. <br /> <br /> If you are angry with Notting Hill, follow this. Phonus bolognus in the middle.
