I must admit that they do not have much of the New Age mumbo jumbo. When people "exchange energy" I always ask how KJ is exchanged and how it can help solve the global warming problem. When energy is "enforced" I always wonder how they got rid of the laws of entropy and Nobel prizes. When people feel how to navigate the complexity of life in a perfect way, I wonder how easy it is to find a train station. <br /> <br /> But again, this is not the first movie. The holes in the soil and the majority seem to me acceptable and entertaining. If that happened with "The Celestine Prophecy," I would not burn this movie, but unfortunately it's not. It seems that every actor is bored and can not understand what he is doing in that place. This creates many "Ah-s" and "Oh-s", as I do when I talk about quantum physics and what I want to understand. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Something else might be expected in front of the "dreams that would come", but I thought that the work was well paid and he accepted the attitude of a taxi driver in New York: "It's your money, friend ..." JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, a bad-looking man, the only thing that pleases him. Not only a new work, but also one of the best actors in this movie. New Age chatter may be perpetual boring. <br /> <br /> It's like one of the movies. The days of those dinners, due to unforgettable dates that are really promising, can not be shut. Sometimes the words seem to make the balls of ping pong turn into your head until they are constantly rolling. <br /> <br /> If you want to be a good time and sticking safety pins on the eyelid if you need to choose between this movie, take this tip: choose second.
