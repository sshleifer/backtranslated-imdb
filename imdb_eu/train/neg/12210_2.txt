This movie is a joke and Stallone has to be one of the worst movies ever made. This is a typical movie in the 80s, where a man destroys the whole army. "First Blood Pt. 2" is similar to Schwarzenegger's "Commando", but there, Arnold dies the terrorists, here are some bad nations like you. This movie is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. It is true, this was the peak of the Cold War, but I'm being an enemy of the Communists or the Nazis. There are plenty of American-themed films. Why can not the movie shown as an enemy by the Americans? Who thinks that the only soldier will destroy the whole army? Do you really think that something like that would happen? In appearance, the average American visionary cleaner would be average.
