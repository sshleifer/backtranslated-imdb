Spoilers <br /> <br /> Wow, WORLDWIDE NEWS, cinematic experience is terribly scarce. <br /> <br /> Here is the story: a scientist gets messages from a space (a la INDEPENDENCIA DAY). The message says things happen like massive disasters, and then the scientist later hears a large earthquake in a radio that happened in China. The message begins with thinking that it is something related to disasters around the world, so it tries to represent messages (and who sends messages in space). He and his wife eventually represent the messages from a convent. They visit Everything looks normal, including the priest who borrows Christopher Lee. But the scientist is incessant and truly believes that messages come from this convent. So his wife returns secretly to the convent, dressed as aliens, priests, and monks. They oppose their will and force a foreign scientist who plays Leek to get something they need to return to their planet. When Aliens get a special item, foreigners start moving to a platform that can be used to transport their homes to a certain extent. Lee, as the last remaining foreigner, says that the land will be destroyed as a result of foreigners' decision. Lee got into the carrier and disappeared. Couples decide whether to keep track of the footage of natural catastrophes from around the world, and continue with the aliens. Because the earth is doomed, the pair does not see a way of staying behind to go on the shuttles and disappear. The last film in the film explodes on the paper planet Earth. End <br /> <br /> That's it. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a bad movie. I have ever lived in a movie. The scientist and wife are two of the worst heroes or heroes on the screen. They do not care about anything. They inspect the earth's disasters and decide "what hell, who needs land anyway?" He does not even try to stop things or try to improve something. If this type of story were to work, if the loss of the movie was horrible, the action and atmosphere did not exist. The actors behind the compact rhythm step through their steps, so you can almost feel it when they've dug their cards when they started and returned. I did not expect much from this movie, because it was a production of Charles Band, but I did not expect it to be bad. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee was asked what was his worst film ever and he said STARSHIP INVASIONS. Well, sorry Chris, but STARSHIP INVASIONS really goofy fun. STARSHIP INVASIONS is awesome, but it's really fun. WORLD BID: A PREVIOUS, NOTHING, Much worse: it is not beyond the inertia and dullness.
