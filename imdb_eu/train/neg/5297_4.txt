I think that when someone finds a movie, I think the slasher is the worst movie. Still far from the worst, it's still not a good movie, but it's not the worst. See Joan Mort Nurse or something like Blood Lake and then come back to me and tell Night Night Brings that Charlie is the worst. The movie has a great camera editing, which is what I'm saying much like a very slasher movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is not on the screen deaths, but death. You see that he saw his pruning fall into his neck, but the other deaths are not very interesting. But the lack of graphic violence on the screen does not mean that this is not a movie slasher, but a bad one. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is not so serious. The film was introduced at the end of the second slasher cycle, so it was definitely a reflection on the traditional elements of the Slasher, made in a massive way. For example, after his death, Charlie will go to the welcome 'welcome' and the population drops. It can only get laughter <br /> <br /> If you're part of Slasher movies, give yourself this movie watch. What you choose for two killers, but not much different. The movie comedy is quite enjoyable for people to relax and not put on a serious movie. You can forget about the movie, you can remember it. I will remember because I love the name.
