Who will consider himself as stupid as this movie? <br /> <br /> Dying an unexpected security guard ... Two dimensions of two-dimensional two-dimensional characters ... and better ... <br /> <br /> A red instrument for the death instrument? Please ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To be in hell ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stylishly, the comedy of teen films changes between the thriller. , voyeurism and ... woman ... (uhm) Rambo? <br /> <br /> It is an incredible and insulting creature. Do not observe, it's far more immune than you imagine ... <br /> <br /> And on top of that, everything is trying to force you to be a very graphic violence ... <br /> <br> Mrs. Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and fun, this is pathetic and horrible. Good luck next. :-(
