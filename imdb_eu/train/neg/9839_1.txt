The beginning of this movie was good. When he told people he wanted to kill himself, he became dumb. I think that I had come from a small town like this after seeing this movie I would be hurt. Many of these people became stupid and crazy. How can these people make so little they can continue throughout the day? In some cases, people told him how to kill them, as they should do. How many people have little respect in others? I think it's a better ending for this movie. There were also good parts for this movie. Some would like me, but I would not recommend it to anyone.
