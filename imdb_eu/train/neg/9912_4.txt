I totally agree that here "For the Birds" won the "Best Short Animated Animated" 2002 with another reviewer for the Oscars. This illness is not, of course, appealing to the best case and to anyone. belief in heaven or hell. <br /> <br /> Animation was good, but also animated short films. And, by the way, I like humor, but from the beginning it's not like it. <br /> <br /> Regarding the story: it is surrounded by a man who walks alone and is surrounded by gray (symbolism here). A television (which appears a few hundred meters away) is in heaven, hell or purgatory. Always put a gun on his head and after listening to the news, he shoots himself. I think that would be funny in three three cases.
