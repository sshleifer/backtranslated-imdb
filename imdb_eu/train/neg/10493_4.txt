A difficult movie to classify. I was never given a 110% concentration and, as a result, it was as simple as I was on the plot, I could not figure out exactly what the FBI's American characters did and what their role was. I would not even have to take Irwins seriously as a character of the film, whose lines and scenes are one of his spectacles, played. <br /> <br /> This is just an episode of Glorified Discovery TV. Show, to emphasize, it was largely insignificant, which seemed to be the only way. In any case, the Irwin show is always worth the clock, but this film also seems worthy of note, but not at Christmas. For these words, you can have better things than just being here. <br /> <br /> High 4/10
