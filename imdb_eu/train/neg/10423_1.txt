So ... it's really sexist and classy, ​​and I thought it might not be in the early stages of the movie, such as Steller would like Steven to change himself and talk in a proper way and tells him not to change. Well, he definitely changed his tune, and it seemed to me that they followed me with other reviewers. At first it seems that a love story is really a social position and a woman's sacrifice. The end of the movie is not a hero, the whole thing is sad. And it's sad that people think he's a hero. maybe this is the comment of the movie to be taken by people. The positive reception reflects the currents of the patriarchal social consciousness. yuck
