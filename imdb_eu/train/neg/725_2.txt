The movie was awesome! Not to give the matter, but to deliver it. At that time I went to the girlfriend (when the movie was released), I wanted to see the movie about the triumph of the human spirit. We saw the 2-hour police brutal oppression, there was no increase at the end. Predictions and ads are not a mention of that! Also, what has been played by Whoopi Goldberg, I remember being arrested and killed for the first 20 minutes! Once again, the previews are not saying about it! (not expect this, but it's just a problem). I know if it's a depressive one, I would never see it. Or at least I would be ready for that. Because this was a change ad campaign and I will never see this movie again!
