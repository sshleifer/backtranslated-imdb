Now, what's wrong with the actors that came out of my mind? Michael Dorn should stick to Star Treck merchandise. John Diehl, does anyone remember in Miami Vice? She liked it ... Well, whatever, what can we expect from a movie about a lawnmaster? Nothing and that's it. No character is nice, special effects are fun (but not fun). The story (very bad) is a joke. There is no such thing as something logical. The director of cinema thought I thought they were doing the "attack of tomato killer". Especially all of the important people discussed the national security in a seat in a kind of cabinet ... <br /> <br /> If you watch TV, change the channel - your television will always be grateful.
