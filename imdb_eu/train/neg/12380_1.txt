The creativity of this film has been lost since the beginning of the story by the writers and the directors, when they left a good story, to replace the special emotions. This movie focused on fun children, but could not get that. Many small low-budget films have the potential to have great movies, but this movie is not nearly as close. Fortunately, another movie will be easily and easily forgotten. This movie allowed the actors to win a bit of money in a good movie until they achieved their role. Those with little respect for the movie should avoid watching the movie.
