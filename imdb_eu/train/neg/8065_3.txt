Steve Carpenter can not make horror movies. First, the questionnaire was very wrong for this film. The hot hairy girl from Buffy's Vampire Slayer was honest. This movie is not gore (usually the key component of a horror movie), it is not an action, it's not a play, and it's not a suspense (even a key component). Wes Bentley is a good actor, but it is so dry and light that it is sad. There were some sections that had to be fun (a horror comedy movie) and no one laughed at the audience. I thought it was a R movie, and I did not pay attention and I realized that it changed to the PG-13. In any case, see if you liked this movie Last Year What I did. That's the only type of person that would be remotely horrifying about this movie. And seriously, this is Steve Carpenter, stop horror films. This movie is like Scream Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
