Yes, you just tell him about it, so do not read it if you want a surprise. I got this Christmas Evil title. Another great horror for Christmas was Silent Night, a DVD on Bloody Night. Silent Night, Bloody Night (Silent Night, not having to mess with Deadly Night) had a great potential and was very good, this was not so good. It was quite interesting to see the villain (if you could call it) to see children in the neighborhood and to write books that are evil and agreeable, but after a while, you are looking for an action and this film will not be delivered. You need to develop the character, but you'll go overboard and you're still not sure why it makes nonsense. For about an hour, three of the four friends kill all the crowd while they look frightened, and the dying boys are not just their goals, they just make fun. This is one of the many unsuccessful attempts that the killer did not hit. He then starts to kill this other guy and tries to get into his house by entering the fireplace. He stays instantly and hardly gets out. He goes into the basement and then tries to kill the guy in his bedroom to drown. It seems that he can not kill that guy, he strikes a star from the tree and strikes the boys. What a hell was it that a tree started in the bedroom? Yes, the murderer began to die before the murderer and he also made fun. Well, that is where people around the world continue, and not the piece that is unresolved with their brother and that tune to play. What is that? He continued to speak something that was not really explained. As you ask, I'll tell you that I've broken well. On the road he escapes into his vans and goes ahead, tell him that he was sharp !!!!!!!!!!!!
