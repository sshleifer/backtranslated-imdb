You see in the drugstore, the scene appears and the word begins, as Stephen King plays. "Do not leave the work of the day" is a thing to say, but it is not correct. King is sensible: he is not cast worse than any other member and they are better than most. On the other hand, the story is just a garbage. Please give the day's work. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many awesome performances - one of them's main actors (LEAD ACTOR'S!) is probably the worst thing - in a movie. Everyone plays hammily, but not in a fun way; somehow manage to overcome, without spending energy or appearing. I'm guilty of Tom Holland's scriptwriter / conductor. It is not possible for all actors to be really bad. What are they against? Without a doubt, I've never heard of them anymore, but I still do not think I'm going to join the talent agency and I tried to get a lot of bad guys, when I try: ONE actor, despite my efforts, I would turn it over. to be talented. So what is it likely that Tom Holland had thrown him a dozen snakeshots after him or did he not direct the writing script? That would explain why the actors are bad in the script's role. An actor got more directions, he got worse. ("I want to bend like a hunchback, talk in the back of the throat, show your teeth, and I'll get bored at the same time? Okay ...") <br /> <br /> This theory has definitely confirmed Holland's writing a thin screen ago. Here, many writers have commented that Billy Halleck is not a nice character, but that is a way of deceiving. It does not have a certain character. Everything that we know before supernatural is said to be fat, and all that he thinks is food. ("I eat everything I can think of," he tells us, helpful). And finally ... <br /> <br /> I suppose I need to include a warning spoiler here (Sigh) here ... <br /> <br /> In the end it becomes nasty. Why? I can not just get up. Maybe there's some kind of charm. Yes, that's probably it. "The evil" may mean "incomprehensible" - it is not so much evil as the social interruption of the ending of the ending of a psychological end. However, in the end his actions do not make any sense, his actions are much more sensible, and despite the fact that the characters do little, they explain their motivation to the audience. <br /> <br /> By the way, here is my nominee line / delivery nominee: "I do not think I'd like it, because ..." [dramatic breakdown] "... I do not think I would like it."
