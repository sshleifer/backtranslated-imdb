F.W. The director Murnau had a silent support for filmography to cover the life of the original island of the southern seas. Documentary style works well in the first half of the film. The landscapes are beautiful and the daily activities of the islands are of interest. The film loses momentum when it tells the story of two lovers. The story never gets interesting, although Murnau is well-managed. He won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, although he was probably the winner of the award for best landscapes. You can not get DP actually filming in a beautiful location.
