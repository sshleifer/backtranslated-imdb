Warning Spoiler. . . I have to agree with you, it was almost there. It was such a bad movie, such as a real, interesting story. She promised, but she was the most horny in practice. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Others come out of the theme park. When I laughed I saw, for example, when I saw serious scenes. I really liked the movie, but I could not. The best part was the struggle between friends with the death of "the king". I liked Queen's punishment. And last, he made a beautiful picture. There are so many great movies to watch. I do not recommend it.
