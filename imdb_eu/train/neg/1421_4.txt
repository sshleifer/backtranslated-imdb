I rented it in a duplicate English version of Lensman, because it would have some substances coming from well-known novels. Despite the harsh touches of the film, it was mostly not rising beyond the cartoonist's level of cartoonism. Perhaps the adaptation of the book was bad either in a double version or in a double version. Or perhaps the new sources were lightweight. But, for whatever reason, there is not much there. <br /> <br /> I have seen a lot of details, derived, wrong, badly dramatized or otherwise. Some examples: opening scenes in 2001 to look at the "star door" scene and the image of the Star Wars hyperspace. The July Robot looked like an anthropomorphized "R2-D2". <br /> <br /> Star Wars tries to borrow his comic relief style, but mercy (humor does not work) gives up something. It's about comedy and serious. In that sense, the top Star Wars franchise began with a sense of humor, and eventually it began to hate Jar-Jar's annoyances. <br /> <br /> An agricultural detail was drawn by someone who never had. see a farm She drove her through the middle of an unleashing field of grass, which poured out seedless crops, instead of working side by side, and dumping the silos into a rush or a truck. Corn (corn) was pouring grain, but farmhouses drank like wheat field. <br /> <br /> When Kimen father had to face his destiny, there was no weight. scene That might be partly the blame for the English voice actor, but the drawings were not too heavy. Kim's reactions to that scene were not similar. <br /> <br /> Also, when a character named Henderson died, Chris showed very little reaction, although they were apparently close. (The death of Henderson is not in vain, his name is not reflected until the scene of death.) He will soon forget it. Someone's sympathetic expression shows a greater feeling. I think the voicemailers deserve to be guilty in this case; There's at least one feeling in Chris's drawings. <br /> <br /> Several times the wicked fail to fulfill their orders. A bad leader often punishes the misfortunes of death. I can not say whether Star Wars rises or whether it's coming from a previous source - maybe Lensman books. <br /> <br /> <br /> A scene is crashing by a spacecraft. While entering the ground, the pieces are drawn from the ship. But so many pieces fall down, at the time of the soil there is nothing to stop. <br /> <br /> In most cases, Chris seems to be the most competent and harsh hero of the space, it's like a scene. an incompetent girl in danger. Henderson's death so fast that someone should be tough, at least, could cite, "help me and I can not get the weapon!" Instead of shouting. <br /> <br /> The character with the most character (sometimes too much) is D.J. Bill. Wolfman Jack, D.J. American Graffiti-n. I wonder what is said in the original language. <br /> <br /> The two movie planets exploded. Explosions were not impressive and inspirational shock to Star Wars. However, the reason for the explosion was very similar to Death Star's main weapon. The dialog box has a good explanation about reason. Other explosions of the film were good, not the explosion of the planet. <br /> <br /> Some sound effects are very strange, as if they were borrowed from video games from the late 1970s. Some images may seem primitive video games, and Tron's impact can also be seen. On the other hand, the sound effects are often quite decent, though this emphasizes the cheesy-sounding parts. Art is also good, especially when computer graphics are apparently far away. <br /> <br /> In the end, the story is there. If the movie tells a good story, it lacks a lot of production deficiencies. But the plot was pretty light. A boy who is na√Øve prevents someone on a space ship and does not understand the power he has. He and his very virtuous friends team fight against powerful and non-fashionable enemies. He is a friend, he learns his special power and becomes a young man. If he is persistent and virtuous, he can defeat the evil enemy. On the way, the details allow us to raise the story above a simple story, but it's not much more than this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's just a kiddie cartoon. But then, first of all, the public seems to be older children, it may not be more than that.
