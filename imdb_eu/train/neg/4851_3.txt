You can see a group of Iraqi bombs before you go to Iraq. <br /> <br /> That's boring. There was little photography when they told us each time we were told that this film did not cause any trace. Quick and all your time to go home. <br /> <br /> I'm missing something. I'm a fan of a war movie if I'm doing well. This had a "jarhead" syndrome. Sometimes they filmed the movie beautifully, but cinematography is not entirely dull and amazing. <br /> <br /> And overcome the "pistol-drawn cartridges" shot. He could save money and get footage in any other movie's gun. <br /> <br /> I did not have any empathy for the sensible boss, I always dared to expect that he had his courage. He caused him to die. In fact, if the movie had a lot better. <br /> <br /> I read some opinions, and it seemed that they liked having lived in the armed forces and liked others. I have never had strength and I am with them. It's a malicious appetite. They are for 3 cinematographic stars.
