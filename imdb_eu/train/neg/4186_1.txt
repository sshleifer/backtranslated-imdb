My comment has nothing to do with the political feelings found in the film. In fact, they fit me. What it gets me, it's stupid in regards to a movie, and the story, reason, or dialogue is like it. Perhaps someone should say that Neal should say that replacing the lyrics of songs that do not inspire songs that do not come out of the outside does not mean creating characters motivated to talk about the writer or the director's event. Although Neal Youngen's iconic heritage remains a stupid narrative. The scene of the children is the most demon that goes into a bar, reflects a tone to an unpredictable hero, and then enters the dancing floor to hear the word Gaztetxea to the hero who does not know. it happened Somehow, do you dream these two schemes to get to the west coast and ????? I'm sorry, Neal, let's get upset with music and leave with Steven Stills.
