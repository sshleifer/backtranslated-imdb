Now it's a movie that can be a comedy here in Australia. Sadly and annoyingly, here, wet and cheesy and Lala's lying on the ground. How did the rector get so wrong? Well, above all, that we are serious about making a surprisingly surprising work that nobody should consider seriously. Yes, of course, they were a lonely and lonely atmosphere (but somehow nice) ... Or is it clicking on the clich√©? Does it not work on the story of Gus Van Santen in the prequel episode GERRY ... and how does THE FLUFFER lead the lead? Well, the author must be wonderful that Burt and BOOGIE have not had to do it himself. In addition to the "non-charged love" of the "love quota" quote from Streisand's uncle, later we remain the storyline of the beefcake and television series. The fourth action of this deceptive drama is not really necessary, since the film moves as soon as Gerries goes into the desert and stuck in it. Oz In the 90's, at the end of the 90s, a similar, but really funny, movie called MONEYSHOT was made. Originally with Orson, THE VENUS FACTORY was also more terrifying than Orson, because he shot him half again, he cut 72 minutes off the TV editor and hey-presto..comedy tonight! A lesson when bad films are wrong. I guess I can understand why FLUFFER releases and does not see why.
