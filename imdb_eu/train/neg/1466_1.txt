<br /> <br /> As usual, I would like a new TV / movie with the theme I want to do with you - a nice change to History Channel's familiar Kursk or Stalingrad documents. br /> <br /> I looked forward to Pearl Harbor and Enemy in Gates - but the fallacy was falling on the ground in the wicked and malignant power of Hollywood - and the ability to spend its absolute riches. tripe <br /> <br /> So again, I got excited about "The Rise of Evil", especially since I heard Ian Kershaw participate, as I enjoyed his book. I can see why he left it. <br /> <br /> Some leaders in the trash are saying: "Kershaw is an academic book," he said. "<br /> <br /> It was very dry. We needed more events". <br /> <br /> Events? Are they absolutely nuts? Hitler's life can not be said without "incident": yes. Kershaw's two volumes of Hitler were long and accurate, but they were supposed to be supposed. <br /> <br /> The thesis seems to be 'behind the burden of evil': <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad man. It was not a bad man, he hated Jews, and if you lose it, we must point out every scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> There was no effort to try time-out thinking and why Hitler took the strategies. There is no need to say, in general, except for the "Nazi - History Warning", this movie has forgotten that almost all the leaders in communist rise to Munich are Jews, and this might be the opinion of this subject. - And its axiomatic Jew with boladvism - an essential part of understanding a great part of the Nazi era. <br /> <br /> But there was not much understanding - the filmmakers would not go. So we've got all the things we know about. Certainly, we do not get a wonderful event that Kershaw refers to, that is, Hitler is temporarily socialist / communist after WW1. This, of course, would be very complicated to handle the "very bad" mantra that constantly stops the movies, and perhaps stops constantly stopping. <br /> <br /> We know he was a bad man. However, we know that such a fascinating image has been in both public and private speakers. It could have been polite and even sympathetic, and, of course, many tutorial readers could agree on vegetarianism, alcohol abuse and smoking. He was also a great fan of animals; That's why this scene of rotten dogs was completely upset. <br /> <br /> I also saw it from all accounts, it was a brave WW1 soldier. While we saw it with the Iron Cross, we never saw how it was won (there was no obvious courage). We do not even know why war experiences were so strong, while Sassoon, Owen, Brook, Remarque and many others found such a shameless experiment. And again, as the point of connection between Jews / Volcanic, this is essential for anyone to understand the subject. Why did he love so much war? Why did he always think he was a good idea, despite the reverse evidence? Why did not he kill his colleagues? Or maybe he did - but he still did wrong conclusions. <br /> <br /> This movie definitely does not mean any interest whatsoever. <br /> <br /> Often like all of them. The day is a classic example of today's history in the film, and it allows you to invent things or leave bad events to adapt the 'present', often to get the lowest common denominator. You do not trust your audience with an inch, so you just need to break the ram into your throat, knowing (unfortunately) you always run away because you are so stupid in the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> History is really important to the past and seeing how it is our color, better and worse. This garbage has been a great opportunity, it has been lost again. Millions of money were spent, and locations and scenes were great, but we did not know anything, and we did not know the understanding of this dark season in human history. <br /> <br /> WT
