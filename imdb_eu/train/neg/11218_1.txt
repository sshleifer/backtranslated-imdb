This movie was not filmed for the movie. The conversation is flat, it uses too many lines and is delivered by amateur actors that read the script written for the first time. The noisy cinema style is a cheap imitation of "Ring" visual effects. The characters will not even play like a normal person. For example, the character who seeks his twin sister at home pushes the path to the door, scares him and weeps through the house and never recognizes his sister's name as home. What Do you think she just buried her sister in search of him? His childhood flashbacks too. Unneeded flashbacks are too much a typical signal manager amateur. It's really fun to see a lot of shots on the car that women carry down the street, along the path, around this corner, here, there, a side view, now the front view. It's enough You would watch TV ad for Solaris! Awesome movie From 0 to 100 Actually, I guess those who watch this movie or make money.
