Chan Wook Park has no imagination. CYBORG IS YOUR OWN ANYONE, he agrees with small, entertaining and entertaining techniques. In addition to a step-by-step attempt, such as Marc Caro and Jeunet, the youngsters of the Park (DELICATESSEN) begin a fantastic and noisy story that is moving away from traditional conventional sales. Almost ambitious or overwhelming vision, it is really unexpected that the Park's effort is hardly seen. <br /> <br /> I WANTED CYBORG, A MATCH seems to be surprisingly untimely, since the end result is a fragment of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, the copious and offbeat mood of the gag is plentiful, but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with viewers. The characters are light and curious and the actors are very pleased, but I tried to bring them no care. <br /> <br /> LADY VENGEANCE'S COMMITMENT was incorrect, perhaps perhaps by saying that, Park offered himself a bit, but still managed to show some of the director's own flurries and, after a spectacular film, he was pardoned. THE SECURITY REGISTERED OR THE SYMPTOMS OF A SAFE SECURITY IS NO SECURE. VENGEANCE here is evident. CYBORG YOU WANTED, OK, OK, so completely inadequate, I occasionally sent myself instinctively quickly (regularly as the movie progresses). I gave a LADY to 5/10, and with that measure, it surely is worthless before 3rd. Please be generous: 4/10
