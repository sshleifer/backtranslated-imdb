When this movie was released, he created a review of the capsules for a great deal of time: Sphinx Stinks. It does this, but in a strange way. Is it a nonsense casting like Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud Egyptians? It's not enough for makeup for Kairo, at least for this movie. But it's pretty funny to try to watch them. The shows act like the mummy (sorry, obvious) on the top, with a few stops. The character Lesley-Anne Down seems to have found in Egypt no map, much less about her archaeological treasures. This is at least one of those very bad writers who will visit all the viewers of this movie. In my opinion, those who draw on the basis of a curse or essay theme, such as Egyptology, are meaningless and written conversations. It does not disappoint, and convergence is double. The plot has the main source of dramatic tension: could this be more believable? The answer is usually YES. The location plans are beautiful, and the layout design is very good in general, which means that low-budget production was not reminiscent. That and so many familiar faces that necessarily make for these services. Cheap, no; cheesy, yes.
