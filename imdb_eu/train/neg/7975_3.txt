When I was sitting in front of the TV, I thought I saw this movie: "Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock, or even Brian DePalma, could do with it!" Options too. He started to intrigue. The British main park, which lives in Los Angeles (Collin Firth), will marry a fascinating and fascinating woman recently (Lisa Zane) recently. Then one day he will disappear. The police can not find the documentation found, and Firth searches for it. So far, so good. As he wants to refuse, Billy Zane goes to his best friend and begins his life in LA underground, nightclubs and filmmaking underground, and then in the history of his instability. . At that moment, Firth's life is in danger, and the movie collapses. Lisa Zane's past character is not far from interesting. The movie moves slowly and there is very little action. There is a sub-point about the lack of money for drugs, but not just. There is no access, there is no slow sequence, and there is no suspense. Simply dull some beatings and lots of chat by boring characters. What is worth mentioning is that Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brothers and sisters, but never appear together. At the end of the movie, you are thinking of what you are thinking about and what you could have tried.
