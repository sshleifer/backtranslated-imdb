Films like "Plan 9" are so charming as they are identical to the same car accident as "Waterworld", and I love you to accept some "desperate life." Cowgirls have no exceptions. The assembled work has enough talents to make almost any plot visible, and, according to the book, the book is nice. <br /> <br /> How could this film be so intolerable? To begin, it seems that the director does not have names for 20 days. Then tell them their best to make the imitation of Kevin Costner. Open the randomly book and start shooting on the page, with broad American expansions in any way interesting. In the end, give your co-brother's work for editing, just because he has just set up a meat packing workshop. Thirty years old to cut off experience. <br /> <br /> This movie now defines it for the basement. It's so bad, not bad.
