This movie is phoniness, straight 11/10 on phoniness scale. Accent fakeness, as well as tightness in cardigan spandex pants is just amazing. Yanks, though Scotland may be really colorful, if you ever go there, do not expect much choice to discuss "dancing" with locals. Also, do not try local opinion tapdancing using fine art art. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of scenes of contagious songs and dancing, but the plot is very cursive and straightforward, and the conversation is often weak. Also, I question whether someone would like to be included in a Scottish nation of 18th century, rather than gay in New York. Perhaps it was not such a sacrifice to leave that priest to leave Brigadoon, he was trying to get out of that die. <br /> <br /> Look at what alternative alternative you have. Christopher Streed Day Parade in Scotland would be LSD. That is why I would only recommend all Hollywood musicians.
