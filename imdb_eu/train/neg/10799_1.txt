This movie is so horrible that the angel loses the wings. Shaq wanted to try another crossover effort, like Shaq-Fu's works, NES's and its overwhelming rap albums, and then the horrific movie of Steel. There's no good thing about this movie. I saw very young people, but I thought it was a stupid movie because it gives me a nice movie and violates it. Mock is fun. I watched it on Disney Channel for a while and I spent a few minutes for that. Even though the mocking thrill is taking place, you still feel overwhelmed with your incredible flow. <br /> <br /> If you watch on TV, try this: take it as a movie observation, remove all of it. Shaq uses his original magical powers. When doing so, he will become a movie about a pedophile who looks for a child and will seduce him. That's funny and disturbing. <br /> <br /> An amazing example of cinema. Do not, unless you look at the mock, watch this movie.
