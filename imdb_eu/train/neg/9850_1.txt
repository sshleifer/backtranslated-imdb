I felt a dead brain, I'll tell you. This is the worst film I've ever bought. (I thought of my ignorance that Peter Jackson was a movie of the same name). The performances are awful. Special effects do not seem like a test of time. The script promotes this television movie, looking at the middle distance of the rhythm. If the actors have taken lessons from Joey Tribbiani, they each look and stick to each other. Besides, I never ever confused it until I was sitting on a movie. A dream or plot was not so frustrating in a few minutes. Avoid plague.
