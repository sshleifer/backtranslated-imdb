Norman Maclean's story is a masterpiece; Redforden's film is mediocrity. The empty scenes of the Maclean brothers fall into a seedy bar that has not been described by some of them in the story.

A woman is not impressed in the film, that is, wonderful, because Maclean loves her story and clearly poems.
