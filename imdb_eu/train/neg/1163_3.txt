Stunning charmer, but an incredibly overwhelming character, the study of different characters from two classmates: talented but not disciplined basketball stars, and smoking, women's attire. We never know why these friends are young. They can share confusion about the world and their places, but they do not seem to know anything else. Jack Nicholson's first premiere, along with Jeremy Larner, wrote the script and is based on Larner's book. He does not present his characters clearly, and does not adapt the scene to help them identify with others. on screen There are several good performances here (especially with the protagonist William Tepper), but most of the images do not have any form (maybe deliberate), skins or nuts. Bruce Dern is a tough basketball coach, Karen Black's older, a married lady with a strong relationship with Tepper, and Michael Margotta Tepper's amazing friend (off-putting, at a top performance). Nicholson does not know how to set the sequences, I prefer (I suppose) that in the interactive character the movie tone predominates; His script is no help, and as a result we do not know who sympathizes with us. They play small and random moments (the battle between the Tepper and Black supermarket, which Dern Tepper introduces in his room, which places all the scenes in court). However, the third action of the image is a terrible mess. In order to place a very important b-ball game with a sexual assault, Nicholson does not show style by his own craftsman (nor does he even earn enough points, since the staging of these events is squashy and ugly). When the director puts his actor on the path to humiliating, his reasons must be questioned. Perhaps when "Drive, He Said" finally made an agreement, the public would apologize to the filmmakers for their trial and tastes. Sadly, the closer movie is as stupid as the whole movie. * 1/2 ****
