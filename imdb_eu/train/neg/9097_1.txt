Those who really created this card have the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, such as time and money loss. I hate the D-Lister actors to create low budgets and a similar one with the first story. <br /> <br /> I found that movie was sitting next to Wild Things 2 and Death To. What I thought was stupid for Supermodels for $ 2.99 was that I could see it as a favorite when I first saw the story and script being eroded by stereotypes. <br /> <br /> This was a fairly straightforward movie, crackd or something in the video production, because people who have seen this movie think CRAP YOUR KARGA !!!!
