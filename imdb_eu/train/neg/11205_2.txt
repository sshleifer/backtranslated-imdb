Yes, of course, on Saturday night, I can see this weird movie that is saturated on Saturday night. Apparently, I do not have the main protagonist to steal my two-hour life. Here's the nature of the anti-hero: "There's no regret." This jerk, so confusing, so weighty, we have so much the same, correct and tiring, it was very hard to overcome the attractiveness of the employer's son, Jaim, if only this: physical attraction. In other words, it's love. But after seeing this, Charles Manson is the one who loves you because you are shaving. (Well, it's not so bad, but it is not yet a truly reprehensible feature.) I could never have passed Jaemin's endless stalks with Sumin. It has never been shown, just say, Jaimen loved Sumin. Maybe it's a culture that has flown over my head: crazy / jumping = crazy love in Seoul. It must be because one of the more than half of the movie is still the other and the last one is going back and forth until I thought it was becoming a comedy. He looked like a tiger called "Baby". Well, so, Sumin makes two jobs going to school, someone who tries to improve himself so much. But after his first taste of Stalker's attraction, he leaves his work as a prostitute ring. What Okay, as we said before, obsessions do not stop if you change the job / profession and if you throw away other annoying characters, you will create a dirty, unexpected event. Basic movie, 100% terrible, but you can do it better with foreign gay themes.
