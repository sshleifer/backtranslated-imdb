All things in this movie are wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Myers, for example. Over the past ten years, Shtick realizes that his SNL day has not changed. It makes the current of consciousness and the same voices. Cat is painful It tries hard. It's a weird, comical kind, it's not a cat. It's as bad as the rest of the movie. The sets are terribly ugly and there are millions of dollars. (The cardboard cutout for the background construction would be more rational than building the main neighborhood and street.) Alec Balwin tries to make a great impression of Santini Great Santini, but it seems apparently and incoherent. There is also a moment of cheese that is similar to the famous Paris Hilton celebrity, because Dr. It's the story of Seuss. Avoid the movie at all costs, people. The trauma of the train is not as interesting. (I hope that Horton Hearts will be with Who Robin Williams, and will be the star of Seuss's short film, comedy comedy trilogy).
