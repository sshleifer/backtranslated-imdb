I watched this movie in a temporary Tolkien topic in the second year of college. Unfortunately I was sitting near the screen and chose my teacher from the boy's back, the others laughed but they did not look at each other. <br /> <br /> Let's get out. Peter Bakshi, the film's "Rings of the Rings", is due to Peter Jackson. In Jackson's version of The Fellowship of the Ring, for example, Black Riders is a complete copy of the movie that takes place in the film Bakshi, which attacks mere vacant beds. You can call this pest or tribute according to your calendar. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the similarities do not stop there. I do not investigate what they are going to do, which means they have a trick to respect this movie. Surely others have pointed out similarities - look around. <br /> <br /> The movie is destroying all the meanings of this metaphor, and many people were killed in the accident. I remember what I remember, in chronological order or less. If I have left everything that I have detained, because I am overwhelmed, I have to face the wealth of the bankrupt (and at the highest points, mediocrity). Because of the great use of rheoscopy, Gandalf is no longer a wise and intelligent wizard, but a profane prophet who goes to hell (a film that changes one or two colors over the film) is a great pleasure. ). <br /> <br /> * Saruman the White is sometimes called 'Aruman' in the film, without explanation. She wears purple and red for some mysterious reasons. <br /> <br /> * Sam is terrifying. The portraiture of friendship with Frodo is amazing when it comes to baby and satisfying. Yes, small hobbits are like children, but they are not children. <br /> <br /> * Merry and Pippin never entered; They only appear in a scene change with a single phrase. This movie is full of bad editing like this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> * Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry are happily singing while crossing the road. One of the Hobbits, however, gets a lute that is as big as a lighter than the rear end (not first visible), and starts with the typical fantasy bard, from "la-la-la-s". AWFUL. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems American American with a highly stereotyped fantasy shirt (no pants). Without a doubt, it is the worst part of the whole movie, it often gets shaken before it knocks the ass. <br /> <br /> * The black knight appears like a leper rather than the evil tools. Everywhere they go slowly and slowly. That is worrying, but it's not scary. <br /> <br /> * The scene in front of the riders tries to cross Bruinen Ford (where they look at Frodo, riding on the other side). It goes on forever, and after that, the Knights put their horses in a threatening manner and ... they do nothing. The scene was intended to clarify the decline of the hallucination of Frodo, who was suffering from the wound. It's more than anything else. <br /> <br /> * Gimli the Dwarf is as tall as Legolas Elfo. It's a DWARF. There is no excuse for this. David Gnome seems too bastard. It is a detailed but precise explanation. <br /> <br /> * Boromir seems to have caught Elmer Fudd's gold Viking armor from that episode of the Bugs Bunny opera. It seems ridiculous. Despite the similarity of JRR Tolkien's illustration, Balrog is one of the best ways of understanding and minimizing film. The bedroom looks like a pink sneaker and it is almost as tall as Gandalf. "Purists" may prefer this one, but I will take the Jackson version every day. <br /> <br /> * The battle scenes are bad and shameful. Almost no character is revealed with its ability. I do not ask for a scene full of Jackson's movies, but they're fighting. <br /> <br /> * The priest makes a very short appearance, and I wanted to show him how I felt. all. Check the movie, I mean what you mean. <br /> <br /> Okay, the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> * Some vocal plays are quite good. It's not a bad Aragorn SOUNDS, just like Jolly Green Giant. <br /> <br /> * This portrait of Galadriel is very interesting; Like Tom Bombadil, it seems like immunity to the temptation of the ring, and the voice actress is not horrible. <br /> <br /> * Boromiren's death is not as a moving heart as Jackson's portrait of the same scene. But it's still a dramatic one (and it's more death on the book, though I do not think Jackson made a mistake as he did). <br /> <br /> * As the teachers say (whispered threats), the orcs (especially Helm Deep, if they are correct) seem to be the bodies of the soldiers who are destroying the war, if you try to make a political expression that works well enough. <br /> <br /> * This is not a positive point on the film, but it is not possible to blame Bakshi for most of the mistakes in this movie, or as I said - the project was in a tight budget and a very late one. production lost controller for senior people (I'm sure I'm not reading the books) <br /> <br /> I'm clear: I respect Bakshi for even less trying to get that size. It's hard to believe that the final product was happy. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not recommend laughing at the maladaptation of the classic Tolkien trilogy, if you have not read books and you can see characters, places, and events. I'm sure someone, somewhere, chooses a copy of it; If necessary, keep an open mind and get out of your way.
