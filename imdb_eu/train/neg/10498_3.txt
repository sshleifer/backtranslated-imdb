I had a test performance. I can say everything: What ... hell? This movie is just as simple as reading Mickey Mouse's script "Scarface". The strangest thing is to make it more astonishing; And if you leave the brain in an automobile, the movie is so strange, but it's not fun. <br /> <br /> Steve Irwin brings a crocodile hunter trying to "save" his crocodile. A CIA probe. The CIA comes out of Irwin to get his probe, Irwin makes mistakes and "stops." <br /> <br /> That's the story; The rest of the Australian culture ("Didja dat dat" and "Crikey!") is a language that is excessive and with strange action sequential choreography. At times, Irwin fights high-speed RVs and knives with a CIA agent. Yes, that's it: Steve Irwin fights a knife on a guy. Leave your guide for this hilarious movie.
