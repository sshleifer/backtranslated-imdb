Sugar and Bobby Lee have been kidnapped by threatening young men who are shopping for a day at a single island and have been told they had been treated for ten years since they were ten years old. All of this is pretty much a book, as well as the first visit by the girls to the island's island and their subsequent cannibalists. <br /> <br /> This is a great deal. I pointed out that I began to feel bad about the poor Hank Word, which really deserved much better. As much as I did not like "Barracuda" (on the same DVD), I must admit that this film looks like a Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: a tits (they have) could be Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> My Rating: F <br /> <br /> Sky Dark Dark DVDs: Vintage -waves for disk-food; and "Bonnie's Kids" (nudity), "Centerfold Girls", "Part-time Wife" ("nudity"), "Psychic Killer" and "Eaten Alive" Trailers. The DVD comes with the 1978 Barracuda.
