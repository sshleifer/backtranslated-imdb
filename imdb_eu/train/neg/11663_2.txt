WHITE WHITE, why not dressed in black attire, would not look different. Could not Wayans give me a movie where they did not wear ladies? Do not Be A Menace was not counted, Jack White and Michael Costanza were ghostwriter (other Norton Trio members acted as conductors). <br /> <br /> White Chicks never jokes. Only 2 hours are played like girls. There is no setup, no punishment, and it does not laugh. There is "I will play some time Crisis 3". At least for me (5 times more accurate). <br /> <br /> Someone has to tell Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the only talent) to stop Kim, Rakeesha and George W., and Osama Bin Wayans. It only provides the O-Zone layer. <br /> <br /> <br /> AHALA 1/2 * ****
