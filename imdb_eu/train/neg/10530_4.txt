A wonderful version of Margaret Landon's "Anna and Siam King", released in 1946 with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, was a widow teacher at Deborah Ker, who traveled to England in 1828 and Siam. Many of the King's children - and maybe even teach in the King a thing or two in the process! The sharp image starts well, but it loses energy and focus. Yul Brynner, as his reign repeats his victory, has a great deal of appearance, but the invented story is used as a jester. Ker maintains dignity and better rates, despite Marni Nixon's voice being lipstick. Perhaps if this part of death has already been played, Brynner has nothing left except the screen rebuttal. In the second half, moppets that make up an Anna and "Uncle Tom's Cabin" music version are pretty ridiculous, and Rodgers and Hammerstein are mostly songs. Brynner won the Oscar for Best Actor, but Kerr is a wonderful one who keeps the water over. Long term, heavy and "old" in the worst sense of the term. ** ****
