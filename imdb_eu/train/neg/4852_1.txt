I saw this movie once and I felt well. Then my friends say "See again, it's better." So I did it. And to my surprise, it happened the second time! There is a word limit, so I'll throw the ball here. <br /> <br /> -The scenario of the boards were so stupid. Why would anyone expect the launch of the explosion ??? There is no remote character here. It is not the first time nor the second. <br /> <br /> -Oh, and I tested it the last time, a car did not burst through a single gun or a fire could not throw away. little fire extinguisher ... did the previous 3/10 viewers really watch the movie ??? -The room is so heavy, I hardly know what's wrong. The scene that opened with the robot was removed in my stomach, the rest of the film was not much better. <br /> <br /> -Caladity scene. McManus Brothers ("The Boondock Saints") rolled their eyes so stupid. First of all, why did the guy make a pistol when he shot a person? Also, why would it take a long time to clear, reload, aim and use bullets, so much chaos around? -SAR type RUNNING to stay and fight back instead ?????? Huh ????? Soldiers ... gay ... ??? I did not want to hear a homophobic, but to be honest, this scene was so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> -It expects its own for its own benefit, but too much material. Bigelow seems to think more and better. It seems to be wrong - it covers a lot of scenes of action to alert the lack of a central sense of the movie. I know Watchmen is longer than 163 minutes, but at least the movie did not drag. On the other hand, this movie feels like a longer one. <br /> <br /> The only thing Renner was, was welcome. But do yourself one side, jump and do not want to give it up.
