In the same-lying Yonfan's fairly colorful Color Blossoms, Spider Lillies drives the cutting edge home, you can make cutting-edge movies or cut out ways. It is a contemporary and Taiwanese film, that is to say, today's age is a worrying pace, but we can find this agility more than anything else. <br /> <br /> You must know that Spider Lillies is apparently a lesbian story, but it's just a plastic effort to seduce and joke in every aspect. There are several ways to repeat the members of the new version of the Eternal Summer in Taiwan. Then homosexual men got a short deal, we now have the same thing with women. Zero Chou is a stranger to your construction, a story that can be written up to fifteen years. They managed some of the art house positions, but eventually, without effort, they simply did not plan. <br /> <br /> <br /> The angle in Hong Kong is in the form of Isabella Leung (Bug Me Not, Isabel, Egunkaria), here is her still stubborn appearance. Although very pleasing to the previous works, Isabella Spider Lillies is free and most of it is missing. Or his heart was not there or all the lesbian drama had no sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Taipei is a tattoo artist, a shy, politely and intelligent young brother. It's directed by John Shen, and he's been happily involved in his movie. Isabelle's character, named Tak's, is believed to come out of Hong Kong, will soon play young people with Jade's disagreement (which Rainie Yang Meteor Garden recalled). The latter lives with her grandmother and has a full list of her parents and, in general, their lives. Of course, the ingredients of the grandmother are really good and moving, but as a protagonist, Jade is as mobile as Takea. <br /> <br /> Two women have a past and a poorly-covered skin, as a webcam girl with Jade, Tak's father's legacy remains alive, with a special arm tattoo with an armature shield coat. Jade also wants to get the same design, that is, Takeko discusses inner feelings of the problem, using flashbacks and minimal discourse with Jade Spunky. <br /> <br /> Well, there is little discourse about the home page, at least it's a memorable conversation? In a nutshell They kiss and simulate to the end they are making mistakes, but as long ago as the summer reminded us that there has been a clear genre for a long time since they want to see sexual content and buy income purchasers from sexual content. > <br /> This coyote of hopeful hope keeps Spider Lillies's fate stamp. With a weak story, theater and theater relics, you can take the theater with you, and Color Blossoms looks good. At least Teresa Cheung's mammals were received. No, there is no masterpiece of the Spider Lillies AV and it should go through the list of the daily and shameful festival of the GLB Festival. <br /> <br /> Strangely, for the sasi-indie version, even if the soundtracks and the cinematography create fewer moments. inspirational source This is also because Spider Lillies makes it easier to get through. Believe us, avoid it, and you will not be missing anything. <br /> <br /> Rating: * *
