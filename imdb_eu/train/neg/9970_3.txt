Problem Child (1990) needs people to really like them. Who would take another boy to see the wicked and who says it is fun? The movie is not fun, never in a way, from the end. She wants to be a living cartoon, but writers do not realize that this slapstick is not fun when people attack the bear or go on baseball bats. Cartoon can be fun, but not in the movie. <br /> <br /> The young hero of the movie is Junior (Michael Oliver). Since he was a baby, he has settled in the main doorway of his parents. for adoption. Families refuse, because Junior has a difficult time. <br /> <br /> Then he throws an orphan, where he scumbags and writes the writer's letter to the condemned Bow-Tie Killer. Michael Richards). Soon, Ben and Flo Healy (late John Ritter and his wife, Amy Yasbeck) have admitted that they die for being a child, like all other parents of the neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Junior Healy becomes a member of the household, and "Little" Ben is interested because of her, as well as destroying a campaign, introducing herself into a fake beast, or throwing a cat into a "Big" Ben (Jack Warden) mustache politician. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, we believe that we need to take care of Junior when it comes to revenge. Flo, mother, whore, her grandfather is completely selfish, and a little girl (despised children despised) is so fond of it. <br /> <br /> But the latter, Junior's laughter, is not fun ... - That means cruel and sometimes dangerous. <br /> <br /> And what is the message of the film? Should the kids solve problems with violence and vandalism? Should friendship find the condemned murderers by writing? Certainly not what you want it to be bad. Junior is not one, sad and a bit. There was a time when the children handed their hands to each other. Now everybody laughs at Junior to listen to a baseball boy. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that this film has been released as a "family comedy". Wrong with Problem Child PG. What did MPAA think about when they saw this? Here, there are a lot of jokes that are ugly and joking, it can question the splits between PG PG-13 and PG-13. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < And for more people, the problem of children will be a "culpable pleasure" classical; someone who loves shamelessly, although the main opinion of the main audience is that the movie is.
