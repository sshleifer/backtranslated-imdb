This was shown in the women's channel for television in 2003, naturally. As a man, why do I try to see that? I do not know, but I should look at the head. And the director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed of giving men an injustice. He removes all the strengths and beliefs that a man has for her boring woman. The first number is Joyce Hyser's wife. I could not wait to drop him. His revenge was stupid and stupid and very confusing in most films. Another femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz, the coldest person you want to meet. His gaze did not guarantee that our head was shaking our heads, and his activity was so evident that he could only lose a stupid one. Certainly a loser. Tembi Lock was pretty good, but he was slowed down by the slut who captivated his husband, David DeLuise played as a loser. Losing Distribution Anthony Denison has little to face our hero. Stephen Jenkins, our hero, or the victim, was not good. At first I thought it was a bad actress, but I later believe it. He never had the part on the floor and was repetitive. As a man, I was angry with both of these women, but I was angry. Men, be careful of this channel of men, and women escape from murder. It's an LMN channel. Be careful Note: After seeing this error second time, I think my initial thoughts. Simon Gornick, writer / director especially. I still think that the male species is ashamed and that it must be a mad horse. In this film, saving grace is only Tembi Locke, but it does not have the chance to show up with talented Jenkins, Hyser, Hiltz and DeLuise. Plus the stupid plots only make it worse. Down with Gornick's movie and her stellar stars. Please, LMN does not show this again.
