I was disappointed. The movie was predictable and there was no fashion box that was covered in the box. That said, the characters were well developed, the windego myth was used in a special premise and the house was terribly frightening but it failed for me. I was awaiting the HCJV or the Big Boo! But he never came. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film shot a bit of special effects. So it shows a bad thing and it is not the atmosphere and the imagination of the audience to create horror and suspense. Try movies if you're looking for a low budget but well-conceived horror movie like Session 9 or Cube.
