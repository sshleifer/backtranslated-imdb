That is, it is better than 50 films to make it one of those films. I saw the first trailer of 1991, it seemed to me very great. Then I always wanted to see it but I've never found it ... until today, yes, 14 years later. <br /> <br /> I said I was so inappropriately unreal, I knew that it was not an Oscar winner, but it was still a hope that it would be fun in a brain-free film that was a bloody line. Unfortunately it was not all Pooh American rock and roll music and the performance was so bad. <br /> <br /> Wrestling scenes were litter bins and looked fake. <br /> <br /> This DVD cost only £ 5 and I'm supposed to be £ 7 charged. <br /> <br /> Now I'm sad, then I'll never get it then and I'll get back halfway.
