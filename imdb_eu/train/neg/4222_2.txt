As we live in those weeks we're filming around the town and the valley - no shortage of road closures and "shooting" days. As a souvenir of here, including Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin. etc. Bank BC was a firefighter; Chase scenes are: Moon Drive Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd and Hwy 1. production. <br /> <br /> Production: Jeffrey Jones was closer, Matt Broderick was above all - even then. As the movie goes by - a joke of a script and a laugh about theater and acting, but who cares about this level. A good time for those who enjoy our coast and the landscape of the valley. <br /> <br /> Additional notes; In Joe's Bar (the Jed's Tavern), the original name of the movie was Welcome to Buzzsaw - Old Erba's parking lot was on the town square, the backyard was drawn out of Grove Street in Boulder Creek; Turn the capsule of thought off and watch some actors for the first time.
