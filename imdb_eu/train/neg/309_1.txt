Hello I'm Paul Raddick, a.k. WTAFen Panic Attack, Channel 29 Philadelphian. I'm going to tell you about this amazing goddess based on the adventure of Adam Sandler, but after a while he was digitized. <br /> <br /> Sanding commits an aspiring comedian who gets a job in the cruise ship. and it fails ... or so I thought. Sandler will find Part 1 of the World Story and children like Rebound. The children had to think, but, actually, Sawtooth flees the world, the most popular cannibal ever known. Adam Sandler did badly on Going Overboard, but he did better at Big Daddy, Billy Madison and Jen Leono's 50 first dates. Men, Drew Barrymore was a little hot. Spanglish is red, Going Overboard is not Dooley squat! End of file
