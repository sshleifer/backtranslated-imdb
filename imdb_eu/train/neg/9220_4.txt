When the movies started in the first 4 minutes, it seemed like a travel guide in California, I asked that the tapes were mixed. Then I drank the rest to see Paul Thomas with Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is spying on by Jimmy (young Tom Byron). Jimmy Aunt (Honey Wilder) is worried about his behavior, he recruited a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could do it without any animation, robot roles or inattention aspect. There's a good sex scene between Byron and Park, but it's not enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> My grade: D +
