"Ask about dust" seemed like a thriller, and above all we like all the actors. Unfortunately, the movie was not quite compelling to play drama, and it was not a comedy comedy that was quite funny. He almost became seduced to himself and without any entertaining effect. After seventy-five minutes of improving this thing, my wife and I were away, we did not waste in vain. It was simply not interesting, moving, funny or artistic. He seems to have written, produced and directed by a high school child. even worse, it was a shameful waste of other talented actors to mention our time and money.
