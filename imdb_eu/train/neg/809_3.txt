I expected something from the "K-911" a bit, I mean I had a nice movie. I always liked dogs comedy movies. But he seems to be Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee. The plot was quite lame and the two interests of love were not really chemically initially. Obviously there was no sexist approach to James, although the writer did not go in that direction. James is just really ticked me off over half of the movie. The dogs were real stars and they were very sad that the actors shone brightly. <br /> <br /> So, I'm glad I do not agree with the IMDb because the movie was pretty stupid. But, fortunately, James is considered to be his most talented brother Jim, he will not be guilty of anything, but no one has his brother star. Do not you, Ashlee Simpson would take the same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
