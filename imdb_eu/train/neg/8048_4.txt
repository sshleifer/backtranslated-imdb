Let's say you've been in an empty island for the last ten years. I have not heard Scream and let's leave the 1st part of Halloween into film. Then, this film exploded and the horror scene was completely new. <br /> <br /> At the moment, 2.7 rating is on IMDb and it does not deserve a little appreciation. All the way through, I know what I have done, and when I'm convinced of the finalists he persuaded me for that. <br /> <br /> It's not surprising, just a nice movie, with a glue, see popcorn and want to get a difficult plot, to see deep characters. If the videos are out of the main titles of rental, you can take them safely, but do not expect masterpieces. I've seen a lot worse.
