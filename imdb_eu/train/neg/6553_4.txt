One year after the last fall of large corporations, the world has fallen into a new dark age, because the cyborgs are gathered in their parts. Cash, a cyborg woman travels to a desert doctor to report pregnancy. Recyclers (cyborgs hunted prizes) runs into Cytown, the mythical protection of cyborgs. <br /> <br /> "Cyborg 3: Recycler" is the third (and the latter, so far.) CYBORG trilogy entry. The first film was originally planned to be followed by MASTERS OF UNIVERSE, but soon broke into an apocalyptic art martial arts festival that became something of classic worship of scenes of white action. CYBORG 2: GLASS SHADOW was a sequel to its predecessor, but it was not widely seen (few were seen as cheap fodder). <br /> <br /> This film tries mainly. The combination of the first two films (the first cursi action movie was the second, Cyberpunk was a smart story) but unfortunately it is short in both numbers. The budget was clearly less than CYBORG 2, and the films set in the desert desert (like a series of apocalyptic action films from the 90s), to save on the costs of the old industrial buildings. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story of the movie is based on a plot, the incidence of a pregnant cyborg, which is as absurd as it is interesting (this movie is not the first one to try this idea; anime OVA series III uses more size). But the movie is in the same trap when low-budget science fiction films are so much victims; For the obvious (synthetic organisms) are just android. Visual effects are just the effects of prosthetic arms and make-up. <br /> <br /> Operation is a very standard for this type of film, the main actress (Khrystyne Haje) is the worst showcase. Instead of being happy, instead of being pregnant, he feels dizzy. His stars are much better, Malcolm McDowell is a typical gangster, which reveals his scenes. Richard Lynch has a great fun as the main stick. It is worth noting Andrew Byniarski playing with Lynch's right-hand man, later in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake and in his prequel.
