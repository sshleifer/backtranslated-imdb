They needed 9 years to complete this film. I think in those 9 years, someone would say, yes, this movie is horrible. I've seen better in porn movies. The story is tired and considered. The child abuse is a serial killer. What happens for a new change? What has happened to the child abuse to become a florist? It would be at least a new tour. Why is all the ideas of camera and film (especially the special ideas of the films) thinking that they are the director? I'm looking forward to this film, which took 9 years to complete. That's what nature and nature show. With a kind of unit, we hope that the next time they can focus on a better script. If you want to see a pure experiment in an independent film by a Michigan writer / director, see a Hate Fool. A Michigan writer and director wants you to film a good movie with Evil Dead.
