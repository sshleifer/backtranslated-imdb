Homer Simpson was the movie "more boring than the church". I did not quite understand it, and I thought it pretty well, but (SPOILER HOME), he sent Hermann Braun to prison and started working for his chief, and he just started dragging and struggling. to keep awake. Again, maybe it symbolizes something, but eventually the explosion was very forced and out of place. (End of SPOILER). In the end, I do not see why they think it's so great, it seemed to me very boring. By the way, I did not watch the movie myself voluntarily, because it had to be seen in a cinema class.
