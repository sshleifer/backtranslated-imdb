I have compared traditional comparisons with the usual New Yorker neurotic neurotic neurothemics, in fact, to compare Josh Kornbluth with a shameless loser, just an insult to that director. Also, I will mention the spot-to-spot satire "Office Space", in the same breath of cellulose catastrophe. However, can not I compare it to your surgical wake up? seeing it is very painful and you wonder if the surgeon really knows what they do. The Haiku Tunnel is the type of film that you want to tighten in the initial phase of production. Life was cruel and, as a result, audiences around the world are suffering. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film? If there is one? He deserves more controversy, but I will give it to wisdom. Josh Kornbluth is a permanent worker with a serious phobic engagement commitment. Its main responsibility is to send 17 high-priority letters to its chief. Unfortunately, he can not do this simple task. My reaction? Great! Is not this story? It's the best thought that should overcome any respect for any film maker. <br /> <br /> The main actress? will you call that? It's a clumsy clone of a man, chubby with features, backstage, an intamed moon, and a disturbing expression of the face from cringe-making from worrying. Where the director found where? What do you say ???? is the director? Oh, my mistake. Playing a script while playing live, Mr. Kornbluth is not as convincing as a human being, instead of leaving the actor. Surely, this is not an unhealthy character, but I have never been so impressed with the actor. My frustration was completely confused with his single-monologue monologue with scenes. I mean, to understand this rumor that the viewer needs a manual ounce, Kornbluthe will explain to us more by means of "explaining" action (the first rule of cinematography: showing a dramatic presentation, not saying it). Who thinks that guy? He has no charism, he has no charm, and his shirts play Oiasso, a nonsense style. Your casting agent must be empty! <br /> <br /> The assistant actors do not feel anything to ease the speed of my boredom, with just one exception. Patricia Scanlon looks so funny that Helen's former secretary, who has been attacked by his old boss, is disturbed by phone calls, keeping a torch under his face. This laughed at myself, but the moment passed and I went back to see the movie again. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie is wrong. Haiku Tunnel has no similar Japanese Japanese poetry. Do not think that an art film is only played in some of its pretentious titles or movie theaters and thinks it has only been at the box office. That's a good reason! <br /> <br />
