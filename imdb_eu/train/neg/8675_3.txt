The best thing you can say about this movie is Sonny Chiba's fan, it gives you a lot of that movie. Chiba talks; Chiba process; Chiba struggled; Chiba looks at her camera; Chiba punch and throw intense sushi into a series of boyfriends; Chiba seats and chairs sit around and look thoughtful / thoughtful; Chiba drives her car ... <br /> <br /> I enjoy Chiba as an actress and martial artist ... but even Chiba, a fan of this movie too, Sonny Chiba. Obviously, it is something of a vehicle for her. And no, I would not put it in the same category as "Street Fighter," because it plays a rage and anger against the "SF" hero and shares the camera with friends and fun enemies. Here, in the middle and in the middle, he's almost in time, and they need Batman, Captain America, and Bruce Lee. Toshiro Mifune and Chow Yun Fat could not shoot a feature, and Sonny welcomed her. At least the suit could change immediately. <br /> <br /> The movie entry sequence mixes as a result of a completely free and incorrect (apparently the American version of the film has hit it) and a goofy animated "(" Viva !! Chiba !! Viva !! Chiba !!) things wrong start walking Duplication is surprisingly and inadequate: Sonny (or his regular English) has apparently not been able to worry about the American version's voice, so they have quite a different voice and dialect. "Street Fighter" is a pretty confusing face that we know and love. <br /> <br /> Although all these mistakes and excessive, they may be classics, but the camera's performance and battle scenes are not terribly cheesy. I guess it's going to work like a character that is just as amazing as Chiba's character, but the director and cameraman will cover bets by cutting and editing battle scenes, you can not see what it is. it's doing the most time. It's not a bad thing: there are some shots and some compositions, and at least it's a memorable moment and a nightmare, which is really inventive in the customer's bedroom. <br /> <br /> And in the real plot ... forget about it. For a "Bodyguard", Chiba's character is an idiot. The script mistakes and overloads repeatedly (and his "client") is immersed in dangerous situations so that they can eliminate their path and, after 30 minutes, they also understand that type of credibility. it is supposed to be good. (Also, as his character was really trying to destroy the Japanese drug business, his client would take him on his neck in a 10-minute script and shake his teeth until they talked like a castanet until his little secrets flowed out ... and many deaths and striking conflicts would be avoided . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < and I think it's worth watching once.
