- = It has two original versions and a movie spoiler = - <br /> <br /> I am a lover of Notre Dame de Paris and this summer I read the book and I watched the movie today, I was expecting to see a good movie in the beginning especially 6.3 When I saw the score of the moment. The first scenes were good but I waited, the plays came straight from the book, but it was normal, but when I was talking about Esmeralda gringoire, I felt something wrong ... in the book music, music too. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And an emerald witch judges why. He has published the book in his book to answer the number of his goat clocks or write the word "phoebus". Waiting was not a phoebus? In this movie, a soldier is a junk, the creators showed Quasimodo's love and Froll's love ... but it was called Notre Dame. His thoughts in the film of the love of God and love of mankind can not find all that, a man that is really malignant and kills his thoughts with his thoughts ... and without mentioning phoebus, without mentioning love. frollo, jehan (brother of frollo), mentioning the mother of Esmeralda (maybe it is well, it would cut a lot of the story), although they did not mention the real story ... (other PS: frollo was not opus call or some with alchemy He was really interested in becoming a member of the worship, who tries to create gold ... it was stuck in science and religion. <br /> <br /> Finally, do not miss this movie, it's a true masterpiece of the director's edition. and if you read it before reading the book, God was mercy ... you should read a book immediately. <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than the animated movie of Notre Dame de II. Just enough time to watch music at Notre Dame de Paris ... it was enough ...
