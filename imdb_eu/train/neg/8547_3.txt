The movie was pretty awful; I found music to be effective. Likewise, photos taken from the town of Mario were also disturbed. However, I have had three problems with this film. One of the lighting was very dark and it was a bit difficult to tell what was happening, but maybe it was my copy. The second is that the beginning has not been very well explained and I still do not know what happened. The third problem is not an end, but it seems that some people. Although they are also common problems for people who make stupid things, the 70's is a tough male. In the end, close to the clock but its favorite.
