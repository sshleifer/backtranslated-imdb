I started looking for a nice and simple comedy to overcome time, but this was a great mistake in choosing this movie. <br /> <br /> I can not write a good thing. First of all, the script is stupid and it's not fun, totally bad, and recycled jokes and a turtle that creates a confident turtle. In my book, that's not funny, that's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Low budget 'effects' (even though I have called effects) with terrific filmography. It often feels like an indie movie without money. <br /> <br /> Cinema ... I feel the actors. Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards are disappointed that they have decided to take part in it? (Looking at the latest filmography, it would appear). Despite his clothes, Pamela shows his age and, in general, they will not find anything, much less fun. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie. It is bad, as if everyone involved had been sick. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
