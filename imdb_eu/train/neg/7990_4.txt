'Anita and Me' is a drama that grows in a multi-ethnic, "Bend it Like Beckham" or, rather, a "East is East" drama set in the 1970s. The tone is a complete gesture (despite the accents of Black Country), but the film is missing East, East is a force and the result seems pretty thin and trite. Also, portraying the main relationship of the film between a Asian girl and her white friend is not enough to justify the way the film is structured around her. I'm also tired of being a hero-writer, of course, real writers often have something, but it's hardly a cool item in a fictional story. The 'Middle East' was fun and rigorous; 'Anita and Me' seems to be obvious and dull.
