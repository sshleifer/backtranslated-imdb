Another fearful religion, with the new religious "rapture" (with the believers), suddenly disappears and the bad ones (believers) leave behind.

Unfortunately, with all the non-believers, the aircraft did not fail or the film would be more compassionate. Although it may be interesting to have a heavy religious religion, it generally makes a movie a gag; The play is horrible and simulated computer simulations are very fake. He is also a new film that has been shot in Canada in New York. Rescue me ... I read the Bible.
