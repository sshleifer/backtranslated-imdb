It's hard to criticize this movie, because it does not like the story, and good performance would not be saved. Think of the "Raise Arizona" line. The play is right, but Jennifer Tilly is still in the top position (it's not enough to make a nice movie outdoors) as usual, including "Misery" and entertaining sarcastic DMV. The rest of the works tightens the mouth permanently, the stress of their parts or the stress of the total empty exercise. A few hours in the real movie. Darryl Hannah understands the hardest part of the movie. I think how I would end it, but I left, sorry.
