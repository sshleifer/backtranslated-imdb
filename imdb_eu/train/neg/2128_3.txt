It is unnecessary to rebuild and can not get the charm of the original. It causes more than just a few pieces of extreme length. This version is politically correct. The film is lacking in style and, above all, talent is lacking, not only with acting but also direction, sets, costumes, etc. Par. The details of that period do not matter at all. Vanessa Williams is the only member of fashion, Tyne Daly is not bad. They should leave quite well alone. Good song (Vanessa Williams) is poor (all others). Check the origin of the 1963 version and jump. There is not much to recommend.
