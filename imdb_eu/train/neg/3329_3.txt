Take your basic Frankenstein movie, inject some Reanimator (but not good part) and Dr. Hackenstein. Without a doubt, the aforementioned films were inspired but never performed in any way. <br /> <br /> Scientists are accidentally killing their wife, so the whole film is trying to do it one night. to revive his wife. To revive his wife, the body sections have been cut off and, by chance, he decides to spend the night. <br /> <br /> I can not say that acting is bad. nor director. Here everything is normal. Little smiles on humor really work (let's look at the scene when Hackenstein is hiding behind his top assistant, it would definitely be very annoying for a woman and a needle), but this is not enough to recommend this film. Music is decent, what blood is decent, and cast looks pretty good. In the midst of time, this film also made me entertain. But I never felt that time was more than that. Inevitable <br /> <br /> Try Frankenhooker.
