2003 dying first <br /> <br /> I admit the first mistake: I did not know what to do for television. I "dumped" the "R" certificate. The plot is strong, but the movie is about 40 minutes too long. Management and continuity were excellent. In most cases, the extraordinary result was excellent and they worked well with their characters. The lower part of the movie is "Chick Flick" falling into the genre. Although there are some scene of violence, no violence is required as a "R" grade. There is no nudity or sex scene for free. Actually, there is no sex scene. Ona Grauer (absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa and Glynis Davies SG-1 series were all invited, but this film did not do anything to make progress in their career as a low-level assistant. Robert Patrick was fantastic, as usual, and he thought Mitch Pileggi's current Lee Marvin. As a Millennium series, I respected Megan Gallagher, a very talented tale who was not challenged to show his range of abilities. It was disappointing that Tracy Pollan was clearly disappointed. Being an average actor below and not very attractive, his voice is totally annoying. I found the TV mute on the conversation. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a Lifetime TV program. However, I would not be able to pay a fee to watch this movie. Considering anything that does not cause censorship, this is a movie that is only worthy of watching on television, nothing is needed. As a TV movie, I would rate it from 5 to 10. As a feature film "R" and a feature film, I value ten out of ten.
