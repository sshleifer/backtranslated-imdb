It happened as a copy of it. It's not mine and I've spent my money for that, I'd find those in charge and I'll ask you again! I can all say that it is a great movie student. Understanding the support of the film is missing. God is horrible, this story would discard the original series of the Twilight Zone, original and bad, and it's a huge change in the tone of the 'ghost' of the main character. <br /> <br /> I can not agree that the "bright" reviews of this film are friends and family. I'm afraid, though it's not a bad fun. <br /> <br /> Extreme amateur! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
