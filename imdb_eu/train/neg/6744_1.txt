As you can all know, JIGSAW did not go to Blackbuster as a member of Full Moon's staff at Devin Hamilton. Devin is selling to all video channels. She recently released a BLEED movie, sold with Blackbuster along with JIGSAW. The Blackbuster builder persuaded JIGSAW not to take any, and doubled the number of BLEED. As a result, JIGSAW looks flop, and BLEED is very successful. The main problem of this is that BLEED is one of the worst movie ever, and as we all know, JIGSAW is, well, gold. You can invite them to go to the BLEED webpage and vote for JIGSAW and all your talents to make the wrong movie. You should also go to the JIGSAW page and you would vote (if you have not already). We need to throw at least 8 or 8.5 JIGSAW, and 2 BLEED down (that is, listing the worst 100 movie in the internet). Also try to do the same to persuade friends and family. <br /> <br /> I hope you do it well, Matt
