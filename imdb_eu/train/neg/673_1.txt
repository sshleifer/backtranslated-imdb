... let me count on some ways. <br /> <br /> 1. Untitled "remake", which extracts all the topical slasher manuals. <br /> <br /> 2. A plot that makes pathetic soil. <br /> 3. The execution of all attempts to suspect or thrill is totally weak. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> The grade PG-13 does not go unpunished, through violence or sex. <br /> <br /> 5. An insulting or mysterious criminals. 6. So, the characters we do not care about are so written and stereotypical a cast. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7. Any unpleasant atmosphere (similar to Prom Night). 8. It's a dialog box beyond the poverty line. <br /> <br /> 9. A range of cardboard shows (I do not know if the actors are guilty or the wrong script mentioned). A totally inept slasher adolescent slammer is not enough to possess daring imagination or to show a blood puddle. <br /> <br /> They are horror fans to save money. <Br> /> <br /> BOMB ****
