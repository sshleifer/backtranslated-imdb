This previous comment wrote to me. She says the Muslims are blonde and the Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment says that this opinion can be racist. Look, the race is nothing. I'm blind color It's like Pierce Brosnan, but I'm not Irish. For what I could add I'm not a 100% Serb, I had some blood from Austria and Croatia, but what happens. I am a dark head, is it half race? Anyone who uses racial prejudice like Lantos (producer and director is a racist for me). I hope Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman, all monster, and I'm guilty of destroying my life, my family, my country, Yuggoslavia. All in hell, but that I'm proud of being Serbian and my cousins, Austrians, Croats, Muslims, Hungarians, Arabs, I am proud (I am Serbia and multiple families), there is no Serbian or Croatian suffering from Sarayev, terrorism of street groups horrible Muslim extremists, I add: kneeling and praying for my sisters and innocent, Catholic, or orthodox brother Muslims, killed in this war, our misery, false humanitarianism, does not provide any help, Lantos helps her fill her pockets well!
