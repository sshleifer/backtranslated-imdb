I'm not writing badly, this is a horrible and topical movie, but it's nice for Olivia Hussey fans - surely the most beautiful beauty of silver on the screen. A poster said that the look was unpleasant - I ask the ideal woman like me: Paris Hil-slut? Blockbuster should set a sub-genre for this movie, which has become the genre of Fatal Attraction. When does Blockbuster accept "Adults"? Drama and action sections will fit in well enough, right? This film, Olivia Hussey, walks her passion for the night, with the unstable owner of the yacht that can kill her former wife. Mrs. Hussey is very similar. She does well to suck Olivia and thus her life becomes a living hell. I like Olivia Hussey, but I do not feel sympathetic to marital engagement, so I did not make the roots with Olivia a bit faster. <br /> <br /> Violence: $$ (Murphy and Anthony John Denison are violent in force) Denison said they did not let Olivia see Murray's wife, because the bed is very good, Olivia also handles the shooter and squeeze the round you can. You can look. <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$ (Olivia is the queen of nudity and here she supplies a little bit. She has a scene of love with Anthony John Denison and a show-show, shot in a distance. < <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (We've seen this land for the first time, more than a hundred times and many times better.) Truth This film, trying to describe why this movie has happened, is William Riead, a sophomoric and moronic interview on the man Man has no ability to tell stories and does not fail to build human reactions to the plot, these people, like the central strata of society, talk like middle children - with the habit of sleeping in the English class Riead Jart I was never seen on the list). TIP: $$$ (The cast has not been called, but it has been blocked, much for Riead's youth screenplay. Olivia Hussey will face Anthony Jonh Denison as "curious" and "crazy" when he starts to face. It's a role to portray a stalker. Murray was basically right there, his character was not a character, and Edward Asner, an excellent actor with something substance, is not used in this film.
