This is the series that I loved during the Second World War. I was less than ten years old. And this series is designed audience. When looking at it, it must be rooted in its own stupidity and stupidity. The budget should not have any problems, giving shortcuts and repetitions. Operation? This is the Republican images, 1944. They read the lines ... and arguably they had to persuade them. <br /> <br /> One and a half.
