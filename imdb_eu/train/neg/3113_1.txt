This movie is wrong. I think there's also a theater note. With Robin Williams, the video would go live. Badly written It is misleading. The worse off is that it has taken an interesting issue and has an exciting and thriller that has no thrills and suspense without it and has reduced internal or emotional logic. Especially after half an hour afterwards, they make up a series of hilarious pieces of movies. so I saw the audience laugh at the top. Save your money. The trailer is completely misleading - it's not suspensful and there is no emotion - indeed, the film is really more serious, it's simply boring.
