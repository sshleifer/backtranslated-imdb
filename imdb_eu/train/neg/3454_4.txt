It's been like a cut-off post-Scream slashers, most of the horror genre corruption, when it tried to refer to other horror movies. Now, I'm not packing "Scream", I think that "Scream" makes a great job of mixing horror and comedy. The cut most levels fails. It has its own moments but, in general, it just does not work, nor is it "so bad" as a film, below the average. <br /> <br /> So, the first five minutes are fine and the story is set up quite well, as Kylie Minogue can not really act, and ironically, she loses her language, go figure. For a while, a group of filmmakers want to finish the movie apparently damn. And, surely, as you have predicted, one of the drawings and crew provided by the crew has been disguised. <br /> <br /> The original land, the poor behavior and the prediction end are as follows. There are many references to the movie, "Scream" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre". This is not intelligent, it will feel like the director wants to refer to other horror movies as Scream. For Slasher, there is no minimum gore and nudity, that is, the negative one is horrible, but it does not seem like a slasher. Actually, this movie would help me to be an Australian and we are not in our horror (our gems are), but Cut is not one of them. <br /> <br /> However, it kept me watching for about 90 minutes, at least something good. I would not recommend this from hardcore slasher fans, that is, they would be able to try to explore the purpose of this movie, but if you're looking for a good movie, sleep. <br /> <br /> 2/5
