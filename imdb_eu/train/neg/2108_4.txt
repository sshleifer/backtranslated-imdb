Some women kill the mysteries of the altar and later steal the bodies into the bunch. The journalist Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious murders. Before each event, the bride knows she was given a strange orchid (allegedly a boyfriend) and has killing medication. Patricia tells her, the orchestra, first of all, by Dr. Lorenz, who lives in a isolated house with his wife. Actually, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for the crimes, putting his wife in a state of suspension and using his gland liquid to keep his wife a young man. With Dr. Patricia, Dr. Foster (who works with Dr. Lorenz, who works with the mystery of his wife's medicine) will try to encourage Dr. Lorenz to create a false marriage that eventually leads to Dr. Patricia's crazy clutches. This movie was a very good opening, but basically it ended with many shots and other weak scenes. It's a decent boot, Walters and Coffin deserve it, but that's life. Russell robs the show (even though Lugosi does not give her one of her most memorable stars, though her monogram), Lorenz Countess, along with the characteristics of many stereotypical stereotypes of many modern Hollywood presenters. Finish weak and thoughtful too. Rating based on B films, 4
