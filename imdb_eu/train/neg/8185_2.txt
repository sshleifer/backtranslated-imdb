Oh yeah. I decided to watch some of these lightweight and sensitive Christmas movies and I'm scared to visit the movie theaters. Movie failed. Full-stop Paul Giamatti played a role as a good actress and played a great role with Vince Vaughn. He has always been my favorite. They try to make a Christmas movie in a new style. Bad, good mixed, but very bad. The first ten minutes were not bad, but after seeing Santa, it was over. There was no better way, the same rate remained, there was no development of the character, and definitely, it is a bad Christmas movie ever invented. Ignore everything you do.
