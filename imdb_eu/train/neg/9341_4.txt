Hal Roach's comedy, A Tough Winter, eighty-ninth edition of the series "Our Gang / Little Rascals" and eleventh. The black comic Stepal Fetchit is a special show that gets special billing here, we'll see it looks like a gang. Farina retrieves her e-mail letter and Stepin says she can not read because she does not read the day when NIGHT goes to school. It's happening to her mother from tenness, so now Farina needs to be full of cotton in her ears so she can hear too hot. In a different room, Weezer releases Mary Ann's instructions for a radio tatffy, but continues in the kitchen and continues, as Lady Ann mixes the rice pudding and tamal Spanish with Tabasco and Lux. After finishing the mix, Jackie and the other gangs help themselves with a huge tasting but all the sticky ones are stuck in the walls. As they try to clean up badly, Stepin works in the basement on different pipes and electrical outlets that work on different devices, such as a vacuum cleaner, a vacuum cleaner and a refrigerator with music! End What I have just described shows the nature of the meander that has served as a short series of The Stepin Fetchit short film "Our Gang". Similarly, Fetchit has never happened, the characterization of vain, that it was fun only in small doses and would be very offensive today. Many of the scenes I have described are some good laughs, but the final sequence was so confusing, because the results were just for me. So a summary, A Winter Hard is at least a curious sight. By the way, the real name of Stepinus was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
