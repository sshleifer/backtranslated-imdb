This movie looks like it looks like commercial, but it was a reason to throw away real movies. This is below the average below ground level (less than that) and has no plot. I mean all the houses are afraid and sure to feel, a Japanese dead could scare her clay, but what? Watch the movie watchers and show them not just horror and some hair (the Japanese dead). Do you say "Samara Terrible"? Do not start with "dead child". Not even scary! And what? He has a cat and he can imitate it, a huge deal! Just bury the underground zombies and save Grudge from having some potential life! 1/10! Yuck! >. <
