Will poorly rotated in his grave, making use of this adaptation to German television for his classic theater. It is clear that the money was spent very little. A staggered elevator, a walk and some random columns pass through a series. The movie was dubbed in English, from time to time English voices make the actors cheer up their lines. The entire production was very dark and dark. And yet, was Fonterbras in this movie? MST3K gave it a treatment worthy of this manual production. <br /> <br /> Be it or not? This movie never wanted to.
