Sometimes everyone creates movies that Disney can create. One you are asking yourself to finish. In the tradition of the Pirates of the Caribbean, the movie becomes a ghost and kills your town and rages. It's horrible If you want an innocent, "innocent" action "Action", go ahead. I think that children can enjoy young people, they like it EVENING EVERY wins. But I like the raffle where the movie will win. This movie never wants to be bad. In the end, when the heroes leave an "unknown" hole, you will know that they will come out. Everything is perfect for Dage Cage and her friends, it's time to think or guess over 10 seconds, even if it's not complicated. See this movie if you want to see some stunning designs, you do not want to see a good performance or a good movie. Go to the superman movie, it would be much shorter, and children would like it more. For example, Cag escapes the armed men, and all bullets run away from the fire of a fireman. (And I'm not talking about a fence, nothing, just a pickle) This film shows the disintegration of film and industry due to its small and realistic films and offers a lot of short films.
