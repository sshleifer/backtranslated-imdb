6/10 Play, not very good, but good performance. <br /> <br /> 4/10 The director makes stupid decisions for this short film. <br /> <br /> 2/10 The writer, the story does not make sense. Everyone has a lot of errors. <br /> <br /> 4/10 A general score for this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this time with this film, it's not worth it. I gave 4 films and it could be too much. The characters are so completely conceived as in real life, and some unexplained things are "story", not in a good way. Due to the style that has been shot in this film, you get bored after 30 minutes (there are too many special effects: slow movements and heavy cameras). It is really good that the film uses music to make the story a smooth one, but there are too many tracks. At first there are almost 50/50 conversations and music
