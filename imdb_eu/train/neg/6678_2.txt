This is a copy of the Doris Day classic of 1948, High Romanticism. <br /> <br /> The story line is the same or less, but it is contemporary. Govinda plays a sharp spouse who represents her husband in this trip. While playing at Rani's wife's friend's collegiate colleague. It seems they try to catch each other while their husbands and their bombs are trying to travel together. <br /> <br /> On the route, Govind attacks another girl Sanjiven and falls in love with her. Awesome Raani Lever has two aspects to father and son, lawyers specializing in divorce proceedings. They fight against each other. <br /> <br /> The attempt to copy the original classics is bad and the songs are very awesome. The comedy is a slap-stick and he does not laugh.
