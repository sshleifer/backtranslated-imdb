I usually read the comments before watching the movie. Guess what, I did not do it before I saw the TLB, and I was very impressed with the average score on the IMDb. I found no story. I just apologized (and unfortunately Ryan Save the Private was not in the way of falling into the road), and there is a sudden ending, I am very happy for myself. <br /> <br /> I had to admit that the wounded soldiers seemed quite realistic, especially with a low budget. But be prepared to laugh at yourself ... Some people are throwing in the air after an explosion, as if it were an Olympic gymnast. The high heights are a central cork or a champion for me, especially when the movie is played several times ... <br /> <br /> But the parts that make me laugh I almost cried. There were scenes that had closed combat. The German voices and screams ... disbelief. It seems that an actor / a single-voice interpreter speaks because everyone is the same, and sounds like a typical German voice. <br /> <br /> I totally DO NOT recommend this movie. For anyone, except for those who want to laugh, because of their sad and crisp quality.
