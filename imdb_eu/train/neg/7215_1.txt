This movie is empty. Bad thing Why do we love western films for nine times we rent them to the west? It seems the names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner or Tom Selleck are not covered on the cover, it's not worth it. Most often, the main action of Shiloh Falls occurred in 1892, but the revolvers were the models of 1860. The shooters were too bad: in one scene, the Mariscal shot nine shooters nine times and did not attack thirty-three meters. I had to turn it off for about 15 minutes. Perhaps those who participated in this film could take lessons in the Sunset Carson School of Acting.
