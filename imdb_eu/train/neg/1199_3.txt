This horror movie is very weak ... that is, I was commenting if the movie is correct. Nothing really awful does not happen because a family takes nice little German Shepard. I had a German Shepard and it's a very good dog. I have not got any idea to get one of this film, but the comedian "K-9". This is another story. This movie has no fear of horror, because it has a spectacular show in the past and it seems very cursive. Additionally, we can see that a guy almost places his hand on a cutting machine. That's it. My father suspects something, since his family seems strange to us, if he finds somewhere that he finds a mirror if he finds himself sleepy, we will see that they are aware. All horror films are actually television sets ... television movies like "House of the Possessed" are pretty good, and there is another season around a woman and a strange creature, but rather a good one. This is really boring.
