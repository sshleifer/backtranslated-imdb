Henry Sala's "Nightmare Weekend" is a piece full of sleepy Troma. It is a low-budget youth, unhappy and stupid, about teenagers who spend this weekend at the palace. The evil assistant teacher girls give girls a strange outline. to make awesome experiments. Using a brain implant, the victims and dates become zombies. "Nightmare Weekend" is a piece of junk that is completely hanging, with a lot of nudity and cheeks. It is horrible and the script is totally inconsistent. Why this dirt spreads beyond me? Avoid plague like 10 to 10.
