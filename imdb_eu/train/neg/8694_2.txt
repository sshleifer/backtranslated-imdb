The female conductor was a great actress, because she did not make the whole movie a bit. Too much smile when he went to the camera to talk about his daughter. The police could suspect. In the same situation I would be impossible. He found his mother unmarried. It did not even want to be a movie. Jennifer Aniston would do better. And much more money would get such a controversial and important issue. The others were great. I do not know where the main actor is, but I expect some plays.
