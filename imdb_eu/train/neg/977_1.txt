"Fever Pitch" is not a bad movie; It's a terrific movie. <br /> <br /> Is it possible that public and critical Hollywood films criticize and overwhelm Hollywood salads to celebrate films that do not laugh at the heavens? That's why I can think of this horrible romantic comedy (and I'm not funny in this kind of mischievous word that I'm not using) to get good reviews. <br /> <br /> Lowell was seated by this Lowell movie. Ganz and Babaloo Mandel thought it was fun for a moment. <br /> <br /> Nick Hornby is a really good movie. Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell adapted the British "Fever Pitch" in 1997; Peter Hedges wrote Hornby's "About a Boy" discovery (2002) and in 2000 they wrote writers when "High Fidelity" was an American. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack, and Scott Rosenberg were not mistaken, because they kept the essence of Hornby's spirit and humor. One of the best films of that year was made. <br /> <br /> Why is the American version of "Fever Pitch" so painful? The British version was not a masterpiece, but it was charming, funny, unexpected and gave us two characters that we loved, respected and understood. <br /> <br /> But Ganz and Mandel have been completely fun at Hornby's work. They immerse themselves in the American story, removing the good and unique work of Hornby and replacing the traditional drivel. <br /> <br /> They have transformed an entertaining story into a romantic comedy formulated never veering from the ever-wasting formula. Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) has three girls, each with a different function. One is overweight, the second is cynical and ambitious, and the third is romantic. Do you want to guess what Ben should be (Jimmy Fallon)? <br /> <br /> "High Fidelity" was so good a man and a good female head, but also an assistant character. The friends of "Fever Pitch" do not make fun or say. They are so insignificant, though they are not ornaments. The only reason why they are playing in the movie is that they are. Skinny Ione Skye makes Lindsey's pals gratitude. The beautiful Skye Lloyd Dobler wanted to get in and carry it. Think, Cusack Ben would be great. Of course, Cusack is very intelligent to make the screenplay completely boring. <br /> <br /> There is no lonely and lonely moment in this movie that gives an original or unpublished image. All round turns can be predicted, telegraphic txistuka jokes. Ganz and Mandel laugh at each other. The first 45 minutes are very slow, you wonder if you were writing this comedy. It turns the line on the ground by the clock. Ganz and Mandel almost seem like a screen that writes a formula that is glued over the wall. When they arrived at a specific page, they looked at the formula and said, "Okay, the guild says it must happen now." Presto! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < They do not have concepts about how to present their story and characters (VO. Narration will be delivered to the protagonist, but Ben is another guy who sits behind Fenway Park). Thanks to a very sad writing, Barrymor and Fallon will be able to see their first excellent meetings. <br /> <br /> Barrymore makes it wonderful and more adorable than most. Goldie Hawn is very good at his time. However, his drunkenness can not save a horrible movie. He makes every effort to break the energy and humor of this story. About 30 minutes in the movie, Lindsey said to Ben, "You're fun." The only explanation of his warning was that it was in the script. Fallon Ben has never said farewell fun. Fallon is not fun and not funny; When he cometh, he superimposes it. <br /> <br /> Fallon never got out in "Saturday Night Live". Probably the smallest person in that show. Did all the voices remember sneaks around a radio DJ? The "Weekend Updates" occasionally worked out the only reason for knowing about comedy about Fallonen Tina Fey's collaboration. <br /> <br /> Whoever thinks they are fun and rarely play, they never think so funny. It's true of Fallon. He thinks he's unexpectedly funny, he's almost screaming. His stuttering, no doubt, his-shtick did not work on the small screen; It is smaller in the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with Fallon, in his role, this picture is sometimes required. If you thought it was a bad comedy, wait until you get the load of dramatic material. Two scenes in particular: the first park, the second in front of Ben's school, is painful to watch. A scene actor is required with great dramatic ability, but Fallon does not have the ability to work or know-how. The range of her emotions is not placed on A-Braino. <br /> <br /> Well it's not a personality and a deep one. He often finds himself. And that is not an affair. He reminds us that Lindsey would be very attractive to her. Compare Fallon's screening at the Firth in British, and you'll understand that Fallon's Ben is flat and unflattering, and what's wrong with that. Fallon's "Fever Pitch" is a long, long-acting comedy featuring Ashton Kutcher's dramatic depth and comedy! <br /> <br /> Just like "High fidelity", an American "Fever Pitch" can work brilliantly. Better writers, the director needed powers and, undoubtedly, needed a stronger, more entertaining and intelligent mind. Make yourself a big difference: Avoid this rotten film; He rented the British version of 1997 and read Hornby's book.
