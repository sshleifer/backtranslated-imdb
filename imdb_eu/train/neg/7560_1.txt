This movie can be so much of a fascinating, complex and mysterious aspect of the original story, or the original movie is really outstanding. An unbelievable and slim drawing, ankle-deep characterization and a horrible motif (replacing the tension with noisy noise, replacing the arcane references of the original by replacing digitalized crashes and roars, then there are original references ... The crackers are just "stuttered" ... Terrible. Gormless In the Italian Italian, Job's brain-free remake (a tear that appears), Carter (crying uncontrollably) and Alfie revealed our screens in the end: this proverbial cookie takes on. Exceptional nonsense. How Ellen Burstyn is never surprisingly involved ... Rubbish.
