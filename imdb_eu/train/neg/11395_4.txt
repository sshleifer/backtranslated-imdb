It's not a new story, but this romantic comedy works the concept. A young man (John Cusack) and a pretty woman falling (Kate Beckinsale) are casually recruiting and asking each other to come up with each other. In spite of the order they gave to each other ... they are surprised that their soul mate is still somewhere. In some places a little sappy, but viviva la love. Being a romantish is almost imperative. My favorite scene is Cusack on the ground and the snow begins to fall. In the end, it's almost sweet, but worth it. This is not one of Cusack's most profound functions, but Inferno can not get acquitted by Beckinsale. A great help from Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett makes the worst role I've ever seen. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is funny and funny. Check this out with your soul mate.
