Ok, so I saw the movie, although it appeared last year ... I generally thought that the movie was decent, except for the story, it was stupid and horrible ... First of all, we never know anything about creatures, Why did they appear, if they did not do in our world, and they really were only on the Earth before or when they came alone? Secondly, the order to kill the order butcher is actually ... Indeed, how could an underground underground station? These creatures were so much alone, so I think that instead of wasting people, they only worked on some tactical bombs, or maybe they are clear and Nuke would do the job. I know it's fun because of that, but I do not see people dying BEFORE ... Third, Leon plays Superman as a train and plays Vinnie Jones. Once again, when he does not face the director, he does nothing and blames him, watching all abominations. I agree, the director had a great help (lol), but Leon was so brave, he would go all the way ... First of all, he has a life risk and then he has nothing to do with it. He could have died as a hero, but he's like a coward ... this might be, but not before he showed so much courage ... Then, the police ... come! A city was one meter long. I bet I have to have another police officer except that lady except other police stations. That was really stupid ... All this, Vinnie Jones's superb performance, an interesting idea. It's not really all built ... By the way, what did the signals mean on your chest? Vinnie Jones can not fix the rest ...
