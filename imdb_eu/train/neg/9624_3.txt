Given the potential of this movement, the reality was disappointed. It's always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie, though that could not be turned. Most actions can be predicted. They were jokingly shining. And the characters were not very interesting. I wanted to like this movie, but it never happened. Ben Stiller was the most horny "Mary something." Here it seems that the motions have only crossed. If the points of the plane should raise their "Friends", they should know that something was wrong. Toilet mood should stop in the closet :-). <br /> <br /> See "50 first dates" instead.
