Although the story of Dracula's story (albeit with traditional customs) is very sharp (in the dark), the story of the late prince is not quite interesting, it goes completely back. I tried to see it for the first time, I only halfway through it before losing interest. It starts with a good start (especially the scenes with robbers, and then Dracula's findings), but for me, it less implies that when New Orleans hits the daughter of Van Helsen. To set an excellent spot, but never to take advantage of its settings (although it is a damned paradise, where Dracula could bloom). It is produced by Wes Carven (and that name is thrown into it), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. She has artistically been her moments with the visual images of dreams, but some kinetic and cheap publishing are not helpful. The wicked script is pretty nonsense. Lussier's work is quite smooth, it continues to be glass and a lot of blood is added (make-up is successful) and there are many "Virgin" ads. No, I do not mean to be a virgin, it's a music company. She has several shots and her daughter in Helsing also works. Oh, this was not a clear planting. The soundtrack is a fun option for rock tunes. Now all the performances are on the store, but there are few known faces (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Dracula, Gerard Butler, was not there because there was not much presence. The beautiful ladies of the night shone brightly; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan Dracula's wife. They are like Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell. Christopher Plummer alternated with Van Helsing and Omar Epps having fun.
