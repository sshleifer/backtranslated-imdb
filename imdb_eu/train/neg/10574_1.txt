Except FAMILY, this new season is worse than the first season. I can not think what they think. As it is a horror hobby, many gore and mindless mayhems can be endured, but this series worsens at each exit. I can not imagine how active and the crew are to be boring to go to work every day, to work in the trash. STORY! Do you want to ask too much? CHARACTER! How can we give the fate of ENVIRONMENT in these stories? If we do not take care, who cares if we take care or what is it? Almost every episode is left with dangerous blood, without great excitement without revelation or effect, or the reason why we were bleeding for an hour. Although Dante's effort was disturbing for sexist violence this season and he was diverted. Ironically, the production values ​​and performances will continue to be at great speeds, but the content is wonderful. I'm looking forward to the production of Escal, producer of Garraren VALARIE, but we'll see it.
