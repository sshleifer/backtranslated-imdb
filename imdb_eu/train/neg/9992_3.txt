Oh, yes, Sci Fi Channel creates Yeti another abominable film. Crash scenes were taken to me, especially when they were alive as they searched for games, they burned at least half a dozen? without apparent reason? in different sinking points.

Then when vegan (hah) burned their bodies, what used an accelerator? Do I mean these boys are frozen? maybe not. Although they were low temperature apparently, everything they ate was jumped. Maybe I'm just, but even in a totally incredible story (no-one survivors ever heard an abominable snowman ever), taking care of smaller things becomes more and more acceptable deals. Oh, what has the prologue (1972) done with the rest of the movie? And the revolver, warm enough to hold his hand, was frozen and not burned. Think about it Well, at least Carly Pope, another beautiful Canadian woman. And, ironically, as Ed Marinaro coach. <br /> <br /> Well, I would add it well, the rabbit they ate (even if it looks like chicken) is not a rodent, but a lagomorph. Now if it was a squirrel (or rat) it would be a rodent, but it still looks like a chicken. And the writer has missed the chance of warning someone "likes ..."
