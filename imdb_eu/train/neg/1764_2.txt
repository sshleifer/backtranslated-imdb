In many ways, I agree with the comments with other reviewers. I see that land and ideas are very good. Many supporters were very good. The serious problem of this film is Ellen Pompeyo. I'm sure, I've never seen a talented "actor" as this person has ever been in a movie or TV, I can not imagine. In my opinion, Wal-Mart would be much better. To ask a person with a low level of talent involved in paying roles requires: "Who knows?" I would very much like to watch it again with a bit of talent. I'm not guilty if the writer is the time he deserves to see this movie.
