Although it's been two years now, I still remember the debris that makes up the entire plot of the whole movie. Unfortunately, I met this movie after my friends and I crawled through the new Blockbuster versions. We decided to select a movie because it was the only one we did not see, and it seemed nice to him. Although I saw the movie for a long time, I still remember the loss of the plot (seriously, there are no real plots) and the time that was being watched the movie was over time. If you are in the video store and this film takes your eye, you will walk and find a better film. If you have finished watching this movie, I understand your pain :)
