THE KING MAKER will definitely be successful in Thailand, where Suriyothai's (but superior) "Legend" similar (but superior) set up box-office logs. Based on the history of Sean Casey's 1547, a number of stunning visual elements that show Lek Kitaparaporn's films are unarmed, but one of the most important scriptwriting scripts in film is disarmed. <br /> <br /> <br /> The event that illustrates the image is the departure of the Portuguese soldier Fernando de Gamma (Gary Stretch). The revenge of the father's murderer will be taken to ships, captured and slaved and placed on the Ayutthaya block of Sutt. She has bought the beautiful Maria (Cindy Burbridge), authorizing her father Phillipe (John Rhys-Davies), as the story goes by with the name she reveals and a man of the past. There is a plot to overthrow the king and Fernando and Tong (Dom Hetrakul), another assistant of Siames, after the best silliness of choreographed martial arts CGI, has been awarded the reward for converting his deck corpses. (Yoe Hassadeevichit) reveals his plot to kill his king and his son's son, Lord Chakkraphat (Oliver Pupart) to reach Siam's rule. But, of course, Fernando and Tong flee and fight against each other, they are condemned to save their families' lives (Tong's wife and children, and Fernando, now with a strong love with Mary). <br /> <br /> The effect (except John Rhys-Davies) is so weak, sometimes it seems like a movie camp. Mainly the original workshop is fought against the dialogue written, so we wanted to be used with subgroups in Thai. The musical scores of Ian Livingstone feel like it is turning on the TV shows. But if there is a visual brightness, after that there is a lot and that's just the movie. It is a film with a great financial backing on special effects and the mass range and their good intentions. They are the basic elements that are missing. Grady Harpa
