The nonsense I've seen for a long time is boring. The plot is irrelevant, and the play was the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Increased use of camera angles to make it worse. The conversation struck (perhaps not bad), and the San Francisco plans were stolen directly from the promotional video tour of the city's table. <br /> <br /> Oh, and compulsory sex. The scene was not half done. Better lighting next, please.
