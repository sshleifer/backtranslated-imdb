One day, a science fiction writer, H. Beam Piper, wrote a classic "Little Fuzzy" about a man who knew about a race of adventurous little humanoids on another planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but many Hollywood and today's writers began to steal the tomb before the coffin began to grow cold. This is the book that Ewoks got the idea. <br /> <br /> The revelation of "Little Fuzzy" is so severe. I wonder why I've never even noticed? <br /> </ br> But do not take that word. Here is the link to the Guntenberg project, downloading a copy of "Little Fuzzy" for free: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137.
