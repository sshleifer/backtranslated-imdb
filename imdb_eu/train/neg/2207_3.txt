Hammerhead is a combination of mad scientist and sharecropper genres. In a type of writing, Jeffrey Combs plays the aforementioned crazy scientist who develops a man / shark shark creature. If you're terribly, he's his son, who has turned this monster into the dying of cancer. Or something. <br /> <br /> Invites a group of partners to the private scientist's private island. They are finally used as sharks or sharks. For some reasons, IT has led the computer manager into this group. Who knows why? Fortunately, Ramboesque is a hero, but it's too heavy. I'm working to learn how to handle the attacks that make up the work day in a first aid line. A common day for the information is probably someone fixing a network connection, and then a call to the criminals who throw guns. Or maybe someone has to schedule a computer repair call between physical terrestrial humans and hybrid sharks? However, it is amazing and saves the day. She also got the girl. <br /> <br /> The shark man is sucking, but I think that, in general, this film is due to effects. And the movie makes a sincere pace. Of course, it's a whole hokum, but if you expect a movie that is Hammerhead and you're a complex drama of emotional conflicts between male-based fish killers, you're not guilty of it yourself. It's guns, gore, girls and an explosive helicopter. It's rubbish, but we can not say it.
