Roy Rogers and the company try to restore "Sintown" life; That is, it's a ghost town. Silver mining may be a success. Andy Devine ("Cookie") slapsticks around. Jane Frazee (Carol) lost some of her strange pieces. Rogers's sharp read. Foy Willing and Sage Purple Riders (or, does it sing?) A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the pioneer children. James Finlayson (Laurel and Hardy) adds the "slapstick" of "Grand Canyon Trail". A loose soil board features a comedy show. Mr. Devine's Move kicks the heels. In addition, there is also human activity, but the material is not great. <br /> <br /> ** The Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine
