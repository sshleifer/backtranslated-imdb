Well, 90 minutes of my life have not come back. This movie is made up of television series "California Dreams" that looks like "Almost Famous". The horrible play and story were realistic. Do not even start at the forefront of this story, I do not like my flag. You think you were one of the hottest flags of the country and there's not enough irony. to accept that world. The guitarist is seen as a heroin user, I do not blame him, as I might think about a band, I'd be injected into the old theater and the wooden theater. <br /> <br /> If you've taken music remotely seriously, avoid it at all costs.
