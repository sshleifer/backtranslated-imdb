Following Highlander 2 (I was still unknown), I think it was impossible to cry, because it could be so bad. I was wrong. I love the original Wargames, but this movie is not accurate with the details of the computer and the original movie. The original Wargames had at least some hacks. Whoever wrote this movie did not know how to use the word processor to learn about COMPUTER PROCESSORS. Without a doubt, he saw the original movie. The play is not convincing. Save yourself, do not watch this movie. I do not care if the TV channel is stuck on TV and that you can not turn it on. THIS SHORT-BREAKTHING HAS TAKEN OUR MAIN LIFE.
