I watched this movie and I did not read the book. The good thing about the movie is that you think a bit about spiritual issues, evolution, honesty, and the world. <br /> <br /> However, plunging the movie breaks easily. and there is little relation between the audience and the characters. It is very clear that this book will lose a lot of the movie version. The events that happen in the synchronicity are almost unknown. There is a great need to be made to see the spectator as a scene of coincidence, and even to think of something that is more of a purpose. <br /> <br /> The enlightenment scene is visually inadequate and does not create a presumed feeling. Do you remember the light Keanu Reeves (Little Buddha)? Well, this is not something like that. <br /> <br /> Most scenes are poorly executed. There are a lot of scenes that do not really develop the story, and they do not even give you an atmosphere to create a space. <br /> <br /> The best actors in this film are Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow. In the first 2, characters seem to have kept their scenes from trying to save the movie, and they paid more, but that does not work. Most of the scenes are not really necessary and they do not make the story easier. <br /> <br /> Jürgen works well in his scenes and sells him as an evil man (as always), but the script does not help. all. The scene that strives to persuade John with John (Matthew Settle) is a bad script. When the explosion is dying, the execution of the scene makes it a bad absurdity. The movie flashbacks can not comment. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is a great waist for a long time, read the book! I have not read it, but it's probably better than a million times better. <br /> <br /> It is so bad that I should write my first commentary on the IMDb.
