Oh, my God, what happened here? !! I will not tell you again, but what kind of backwards movie is this? This is worse than doubling the "King Kong vs. Godzilla" doubling. Linda Miller must be the worst actor and the costumes are really bad. Dr.Who is a creator of a robot. King Kong has the same strength as the gorillas, but when he breaks this robot he builds another one and tries to kidnap Kong. When it's done (Linda Miller gets annoying) Kong's slave does, but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes After that, he sends it to Dr.Woh after the robot. <br /> <br /> Then, when I saw the movie, I got a pinhead Linda Miller and other clowns started to moan. As I was playing, I expected the movie to fight against madness. In the end, it must be a bad thing for Kongs to re-exhibit their dinosaurs on their island. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie in any way, or if so ... be careful.
