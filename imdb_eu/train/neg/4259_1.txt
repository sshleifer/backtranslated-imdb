I did not know anything about this film. I saw that a friend had heard that "the endless epic battle was unstoppable from the beginning". That could not be true. This was a miserable movie that was not bad, boring, poorly written, directed amateur and one of the directed films. I think it's the worst film in that era, Battlefield Earth. It's basically a story, it's hard to believe that the makers of this film think that this toy pill will be a serious garbage that is a true historical event. The worst case I ever heard ... like this little treasure ... Guy tells the girl "Smell like the moon." A girl replied: "What does the moon look like?" LADY LOVE! You have to be kidding! The guy was drawn in scene and quartered by the audience as they gave them some ridiculous laughs, and reminded me that someone who sounds part-sounded on the mouth of the FX sound guy. If you play in a nearby theater, avoid at all costs. This movie is very bad, I really decided I decided about 45 minutes to achieve that I had to catch my sleep ... and I did it. Scary.
