The role of Assassin Hauser (John Cusak) is Mid-East Oil Minister, who is named after Omar Sharif (Neikov) in Turaqistan, a country led by American interest. Hauser poses a Trade Show as a producer to reach Omar. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, the satire may be excessive and it becomes annoying. It's too much here too: I mentioned people who do not accept government, politics, music, war, and "war." And what we have here is - the most annoying movie that creates bad nightmare. I still wonder why I have continued with the DVD. Also, Cusak is so many family members that John Cusak is ashamed of that family or is it that? <br /> <br /> While John Cusak was a movie a bit offbeat, he was finally good. Not here Believe that John Cusak had a hand to write and produce that mess. Do what you want <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Probably. Your idea is forgotten for up to 15 minutes longer. In the meantime, it's unlucky in every cast. And, between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I do not think, but you know, boy? They needed something for their little girl and more time. <br /> <br /> Yes, what they supposed (wrong and annoying) Duff and Kingsley's performances were good. When I saw the character of Dan Aykroyd, when I was sitting in a sink, I knew that the rest of the show would also go on the tank. I was not wrong. I'm sure they will sing a few efforts, but if pink is still with a different name, so it's too much confusion ... ?????? <br /> <br /> Now I remember why I continued with the DVD. I expected that the story was somehow level and the same. Never. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Relevance: No. Language: yes.
