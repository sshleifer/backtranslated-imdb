"54" is a movie based on the wicked "Studio 54" of the 1970s: the elite society and the party club. In Ryan Phillippe, the main character is the studio principal from 1977 to 1982. <br /> <br /> The problem of the film is glitter and style and not substance. A satirical, "Boogie Nights", is really dull and it's trying to test it, but eventually it appears as a lover of the bottom. Mike Myers will give Steve Rubell an incredible job of owning a cocaine-born club. It's just a bit of a comedy, and if the drama of Myers Lemmon and other comedian commercial actors is shortened all the time. <br /> "54" could be sensible and interesting, but instead it's just another boyfriend that is entertaining or distant. See your danger.
