All horror directors want to imitate the "Exorcist" somewhat of the whole riddle, because William Friedkin's "classic" film is overflowing and, in my opinion, is not so serious and moving. However, this time there is another clear espion, this time a Spaniard who repeats the story of a young man who is mistakenly wrong and turns his family against him. Paul Naschy (I have to admit that here seems pretty hot) John Gibson plays the honorific priest, because his sister Leila has changed her new behavior. Initially, the priest does not believe it, but when John's body is turned into a collar, Leila becomes more demonic in his behavior ... "Exorcism" is not only very original; Besides, the film is boring! Here, the director of Naschy and Juan Bosch have had an open-minded film of exploitation of religious themes, full of blows and rudeness, and yet the result is a pleasant and bloody drama. In the last thirty minutes there are some moments of the atmosphere, although they are very stupid, and they have filmed an elegant naked woman. The absolute lack of budgeting is no excuse Paul Naschy has already proved that he had enough imagination before he could scarcely make money. This is just a terrifying movie, the end of the story. Other "The Excorcist" European corruption are "Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door" and they suck!
