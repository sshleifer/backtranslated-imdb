Budgets, decent actors ... these things were well known. Do not waste this junk time. The effects are empty. The play is pure. Even though this was the only thing that could be sustainable, T & A was cheap and ruined in the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The quality of the video for the distance from this movie is only very shameless. They have never fought like 7 people on the planet. Caps off! <br /> <br /> If you want to see a pretty dress, go back and look at the old photos. The best way to make Bigfoot movies is to have a great budget and to have some actors that are not for Frogballs Community Theater.
