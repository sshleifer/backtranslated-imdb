I saw an interview with Rob Schneider (in this film he was the star of Marvin Mange). He said he wanted to emphasize the physical comedy here, although the volume is off, you would laugh. in this movie Of course, it must be secret. The volume appeared. I was listening to this thing and I thought it was a disaster, completely unknown - Schneider was disappointed after the fun performances of "Deuce Bigalow, Gigolo" <br /> <br /> <br /> < br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> It begins to control the "animal sense". "This is a" superpope. "It is able to dispose of drugs hidden in the body and cavalry of the horses, of course, people have a bad habit of catching cows and goats, but it's probably a low price to pay. /> <br /> The play was a long way from the movie, Hollywood is the worst actor in Hollywood than John McGinley? Here, Sgt. Sisk, Mang's police commander, as a cartoonist ("Scrubs" is the medical figure of his unknown television series) I was looking forward to the first work of "serious" work by Colleen Haskell, which is called a "serious" movie, which, of course, won the first "Survivor" as a competitor and here proves what we know: it's nice as a button. It does not prove to be a talented actor, and what is Ed Asner Wilson as the chief of police? I mean, how old is he now? It's the size of a cow's manga She tried to make Mange food, and by the way she breathed completely. I was surprised by filming. Adam Sandler (who was also an executive producer) has a short camera at the end. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I worked twice: the police car was playing with mange toys, and the scene with Schneider with Haskell and orangutans - has an orangutana talented actor! So, two chuckles - 2/10.
