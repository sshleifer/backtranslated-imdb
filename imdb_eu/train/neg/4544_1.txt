This movie is not worth your time. The dependence of local mysticism is an interesting deviation. Plots are recycled several times. <br /> <br /> Some of the people who asked me to make a comment about the time I had to give a comment tried to defend my reputation. feed Their motivation and objectivity are doubtful because they encourage you to look at the mistakes of film, but when New Age consciousness is well invented. <br /> <br /> So it would be appropriate for thirty or thirty Christian Evangelists. Or did the Islamic Fundamentalists throw positive ratings on films and televisions that accept their opinions? Although it is a bad quality of production, or is it a historical foundation that does not involve truthfulness? I do not expect it. <br /> <br /> I'm sure followers will come after me to say things about that movie, though it's true.
