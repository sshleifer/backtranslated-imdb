Can not be described in a terrible way. It's a bad start and then it's even worse. When you start, you need to really see it, because it is impossible because it does not believe it is worse, but not afraid. He wrote another bad donkey for the manager of the ship. It's hard to decide whether or not to make the script worse than to correct it or not. As for the hero, he hangs well with a scene that includes hard-working lights, opening the closet door and breaking the window. And in another scene, it is thrown through a window and it falls towards the concrete 20 meters - it does not blink, and immediately gets up and sticks between the wicked. It's really a ridiculous movie. Fortunately, I'm going to rent $ 1.
