The ugly shoot, the successor to classic Joe Dante's 1981 classmate was no script and enjoyable. "The Howling" is a good three or three LUPACO film, but it has also been "rewarded" for such successive audiences and transient ones. If it has consolation, it is just a continuation of the name "Stirba", and there will be no characters or events with the Dante movie. So here are the wilder worship of the Werewolves in Transylvania? especially female? Stirred head Stirba, Sybil Danning, plays an elderly woman as a blonde, with a huge, ugly eye (with a huge eye) in an eye gesture and becomes hairy when it's on. His arch enemy Christopher Lee is apparently a pain. His character ?? Stefan Crosscoe ?? He is a hidden investigator, who travels to the kingdom of Stirba, because he lost his friend to his friend, accompanied by the American couple. If you are looking for a dirty and free search, this is your movie. The smallest murder is also shown in great detail and also shows the image of a nano that explodes explosive loops and a bad star. However, if you want a little substance or depth, you will be very disappointed. Conversations are shameful and there is no tension to capture. Scriptwriters are constantly confused with vampires (in Transsilvana, garlic, wooden stakes ...) and Danning's beautiful balcony exploits the only film of the film. During the final credits, a shot that removes itself is repeatedly reconstructed (as Dr Gore's classmates say seventeen times less!) It is quite pathetic and useless. Music is fine and some landscapes are beautiful. During the initial credits and in the dark sunsets of the castle Stirba, I am feeling a bit like a state. Philippe Mora's management mess is huge and ?? For me? He deserves his single movie "The Beast Within" released three years earlier.
