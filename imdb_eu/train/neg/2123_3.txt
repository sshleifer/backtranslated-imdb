I go to UCSB and I take classes with executive producer Alison Anders. He is a great teacher and director, so I thought it was a good thing to do with his name. This film chosen at the Santa Barbara Film Festival was a good opportunity. <br /> <br /> While this film included films and cinematography, everything was trying to get rid of the story and the lack of coherence. to fill it. My main problem was that of someone's first movie, of course, it might have been said. A bad performance and a worse screenplay stopped the movie. The soundtrack had a pleasant feeling for what was most popular for those of the main characters, and now he has grown to face the sadness that he has returned to his place. I have to say that despite being one of the best works of the movie, it was a good thing to avoid the good and bad stories.
