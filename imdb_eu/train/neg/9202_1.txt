I own this movie. No choice, no. One day I was terrified and the box was fascinated by me. So I slipped on the old VCR and spent an hour and a half of my life "why God is why?" Crying. The story was not so bad, I appreciate the extravagant pieces of gamer. I think maybe this movie has been part of the romantic scenes that you create super-scenes with cheese. "I always thought myself like Vulcan, like Dr.Spock ... that is not capable of love" There are very few good things to say about this movie, it's really huge. But if you have a really bad movie, that's it for you !!! The real story is much more interesting;) <br /> <br /> Summing up this movie in a single word: <br /> <br /> It would be LAME
