This romantic comedy is not bad. There are some fun things here and there, and there are some memorable characters there. While some scenes are very fun, others are embarrassing. In particular, I found some "romantic" part of the story. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's worth to watch football and romantic comedies. It's not really a bad movie, and the end feels pretty good. Just do not expect anything ordinary. It's enough to have an hour and a quarter to die.
