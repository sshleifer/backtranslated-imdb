I have had to change the worst movie we have seen in the world. This is! <br /> <br /> Do not make mistakes, this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of reasons: <br /> <br /> The story of an unexpected experience (based on the fact). A tremendous impact (Judge Reinhold thought) An unbelievable accreditation. Children's conversation. Continuous continuity. Lack of atmosphere <br /> <br /> Got in the picture? <br /> <br /> <br />
