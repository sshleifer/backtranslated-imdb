I had to be American guy who did not like this movie. I think this was not my style or something, I just did not see what is so fascinating about it, this has been * barely entertaining, let's even one of the greatest achievements in film history. <br /> <br /> It's about a guy who has not done anything and will become a drug lord. It's a pretty simple way of describing the whole movie, which is the feeling I'm about. As a lot of people think, because a movie does not automatically translate into a movie because of the mafia / drug trade or criminal gangs, do not forget about good stories.
