A girl named Susan Montford wrote and directed this "movie". It is not surprising to write or correct other names without him. He made a serious job defect in his career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium. <br /> <br /> It is crucial that a film that overcomes four stories of a fledgling fleece. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After leaving the center, four thugs approach and surround each other. Tell me: what woman would receive a potential aggressor while she is surrounded and insulted verbally? I do not mean to start an attack because, of course, it's totally normal for someone to fight. But he pulled that guy up and was much higher in the next level. A woman should not do this (1) unless she is aware of a weapon, knowing that the backup is very close, and therefore there is little damage, or 3) the attacker is very young and is quite certain that he is sure enough. can carry it. In this situation it has not been applied anywhere; So it's like someone who wants to be raped or caught. And by the way, when the security guard approached Kim Basinger, when he had come to see the distance, why would he not immediately direct himself to help or shout? <br /> <br /> ** When the security guard flees after firing on his head, he drives and drives an empty part of the town. He had a good three-minute progression of sixty-five minutes, and he also ran in front of his diagonally on foot, climbing up and climbing the fencing, pulling out his Toolbox and starting the hood. I understand that trying to fix this car, but it should have run. <br /> <br /> (I did not mean that I have a chronological summary of this movie, I hate people who do it. Their reviews, but this is the reason why all the main sequences in this movie have something to do with no comment. /> <br /> ** Why do you want to take away the Red Box, as if you were trying to get away from the darkness? When it comes to it, it requires a joker to open its box, and first it opens it afterwards. The scene here is so rich that it is under the breakdown of the dramatic effect of the break, and it's the worst scene in the whole movie. When I was asked to open the box, he was thinking of initially trying to open himself up without renouncing himself, as it can do in some movies. A person must constantly touch / touch / open / manipulate a device that he constantly demands and refuses to open that hero When it comes to knocking, the enemy takes this device, this device will automatically distribute face / render unconscious, along with the hero's plans. He feels like he was trying to do with Kim Basinger, because he pulls out the toolbox and quickly sends a WRENCH and sends a thugs, but he moves away with himself and with other thugs. <br /> </ p> <p> In the rest of the movie, especially what you see is this suburban house. It is hiding in the woods while carrying its Red Toolbox, as it extracts various weapons to kill weapons. <br /> <** Once he was in flight, how did the rebels last again? I think they were playing this radio listening aloud the homage of the deceased. I thought I was moving away from them, so to speak <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ** Finally, the very premise is so weak, because, first of all, it is the reason behind it. From the point of view, they were murdered against the official security as soon as they were witnesses to a murderer, and they believed that they should kill him. How ridiculous One of the smaller ones also said that they could leave the city and return to wherever they came back, he never saw, and probably did not get the enrollment. Although these options are not in their favor, how does hell and capture capture someone, to improve their chances of getting rid of their original murder?
