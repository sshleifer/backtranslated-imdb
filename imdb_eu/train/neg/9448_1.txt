Functions without film, this movie is rubbish. His jokes are not fun. Children's humor is pathetic, and the effort to send them to adults adds bad luck to the wonderful package. I would be sitting next to my children, something that would come next to me. I could not enjoy the movie. Although she bought the DVD, she had a new DVD, she and her sisters were not interested in seeing it again, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc. Get frequent repetition requests.
