A huge recovery of a large series. It should not be named Battlestar Galactica, because it is only the name. Too many changes are just changes. You have characters from female men to black women in Cylon, all in a way that "attracts a female audience", as stronger women were more powerful characters. The Egyptian feeling was gone. They're looking for the Earth. The cylinders to go to the terminator does not remove the movie, especially when a fembot is made. The original show confirmed that he had a lot of cheese, but he had the following. They tried to keep up with this, but they did not give anything to their fans, especially because they made their "story" flowing on their faces. The changes are good, not just when they do something better.
