It's one of the most evil films of the 90s. I would not recommend it if you want to do something better. <br /> <br /> This image presents Afro-American as a wild, religious, violent, inarticulate and reactive sociopath. Fudge (Ice Cube) and his home-based possessions are continually respected by others in the room, not only white but Asian, and never disciplining their disciplines for their actions. In spite of this tolerance, we are always crying and crying white opponents that the wicked run their way of life and stand on their way. Indeed, the effect of Femmge is that Remmy causes the head of the skin to bind him out of the university, and eventually kill Malik's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Skinhead presents as sub-groups of hidden subgroups. outside the campus, and stay outside of the rest. They never mix music in the music and hurt the police. Crimes are serious, such as drums and rapes, however, they are not so evil or threatening, such as Fudge and Dreads (Busta Rhymes). <br /> <br /> It almost plummets a lot in this film. do me or giggle me. Some of the following are as follows. <br /> <br /> Fudge and Dreads are named as students of the Columbus University, but we have never seen them in class, and it is quite clear how they pay for teaching. It remains only that the smoked smoke is something related to their finances. Although they are a student of a private university, they can not provide a single English line. Their characters are only developed through their commitment and xenophobia. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kristen the drunken (Kristy Swanson) knows why he was taking his drunk Billy home. He also asked for a gum to start. As a result of the lack of condoms, it became a rape, but it would be a marvelous sex if it were available. Later, Kristen Taryn (Jennifer Connely) assured herself that she did not take any responsibility, and was trying to get into a man's bed, even if he was using sexual predators. He later met a week or so later, and he slept, avoided avoiding the touch and made the condom that he tried very responsive. The director stressed well-known contraceptives. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like black people look like women and women seem stupid and weak. They are the only reasons that can be thought of by Cole Hauser and the accent of Laurence Fishburne. The writer / director is, of course, a man with a limited intelligence. If you want to move forward and limit yourself, but keep in mind that neurons do not grow. Keep the tips in the end and UNLEARN.
