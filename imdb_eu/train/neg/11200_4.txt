The good lies in the Webster Dictionary define logophobia as the fear of words. ' It may be logophobic. If the combination of some words does not frighten them at the beginning of a movie, the credits will contain words "Produced, Recorded, Directed," and the name of each person will follow. Think about it There are carpenters, electricians and refugees, but so many trades. Even the best directors like Speilberg and Scorsese have no control of their films. But I was there, located in my theater seat, with the hands of popcorn and order I was thrown out like Nolan Ryan fastball. In that order, Brian Helgeland produced, wrote and directed the words. Pull it! <br /> <br /> Being a filmmaker, I knew Brian Helgeland. As a writer, in the last 10 years his filmography will be similar to the sales price of the company dotcom in 1998. The critical and successful successes (LA Confidential, Mystic) were as much as unpleasant theater (Assassins, The Postman, Conspiracy Theory). River). Was it being replaced? One good thing, so bad, that his last film, BloodWork, was one of the most lost efforts in Clint Eastwood's career, I breathed and I hope the best. With retrospect, I would not breathe. <br /> <br /> The order is Heath Ledger (Helgeland's A Knights Tale), as Alex Bernier, a priest, in the so-called Karolingian, is called to Rome after a priest has died. Bishop plays "strange". They also found Father Tomas (also called the Order and Still Positions by Mark Addy) to write the enigma behind the death of the priest's death. <br /> <br /> Problemizing matters with Mara Sinclair (Shannyn Sossamon), Alex fled to an institution that tried to kill an exorcism. Alex has feelings towards Mará and, for some reason, he does not know about the audience, they travel to Rome. <br /> <br /> Good night sleeps today, and Alex must be William Eden (Benno Fürmann). A century without a Eater. Without sinners, as we are saying, they are those who eat sins of those who die, without allowing the church to enter heaven. William, luckily, is tired of healing, and Alex takes on his role and freed himself from the world. Alex is reluctant, but after his murderous love, Mara will recruit the sinner to save him, to save him and transform it. Alex, afterwards, is looking for many of his queries when Thomas Aita, after passing the Vatican's arguments to the authority investigator. <br /> <br /> The order is not a horrible film, but it is very boring. The special effects were ridiculous and there was no connection with the characters. Even in the most dramatic scene -which enters Alex's dying Mara-she is pale and gentle and leaves no emotional response to her partner's wife. It seems that everyone talks calmly and emotionally about the fact that films are being administered flat lines and aromatic salts to try not to relax in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> So, Mr. Helgeland. I tell you I do not try again. Share your opinion with others and help them get more guidance in those who do not direct us. Until then, nothing will be given to indicate that there is more than one grade that fails. Two stars <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
