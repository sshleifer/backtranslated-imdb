Slow, boring, very repetitive. It's not surprising that Weinstein did not buy it. This Spurlock had to eat more McDonalds while shooting and leaving it to produce. You have not seen and enjoyed any way. The preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not fun. You can make a 2-minute movie that's not a function. I'm sorry I rented this movie. I will never see Spurlock's name. It's completely rubbish. Such filmmakers must be on YouTube and they will never distribute their dealings. Movies Consumers of America and their purchases are guilty of saying that current depression when purchasing and buying products is a basis for healthy money to circulate in the system.
