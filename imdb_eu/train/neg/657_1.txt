PROM NIGHT (2008) <br /> <br />: Nelson McCormick <br /> <br /> protagonist: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis <br /> <br /> Plot: Three ago Years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) had killed her entire family by her teacher (Jonathan Schaech), with a bit of death. Now, her senior prom is preparing her stupid stupid friend. There, they die, one by one, because the murderer has escaped from prison, and no one remembers to warn Donor. <br /> <br /> Pros: I've got a lot of laughter, a movie, a terrible conversation and a stupid character. <br /> <br /> An example: <br /> <br /> Everyone decides that Donnari does not take away a man obsessed with his escape from prison (it does not seem too great). The reason: they do not want to shame before all their friends. LOL <br /> <br />: Let me tell you I'm a great Slasher fan. Normally I can also have fun. I also like some PG-13 horror films. TURISMO TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, PG was an original. I also enjoy POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). That's why the PG-13 classification slasher is a mixed movie, I have nothing to do with enjoying the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I had a big problem with the story. I also like movies with no story stories. They may be at least entertaining. The student is about a teacher who is in love, so he kills his whole family. A few years later, he is trying to find him and he tries to kill all his friends ...? Then I would question the sub-squares that everyone cared for. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is struggling with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and I do not care less. This should be a Lifetime feature, not a new version of PROM NIGHT. <br /> <br /> And then ... this is a movie slasher, with terrible death scenes. I do not care why it is not that my favorite slasher (HALLOWEEN, GURTZAK, original PROM NIGHT) was not that great, but they still had effective murders. Here, half of the characters that die in the same room in the hotel die on the screen, a woman who has been strangely absent is not injured without any injuries, while the actress shouts his faces on his face while crying. I'm sure 10 year old girls are scared, but not me. <br /> <br /> I also hated the characters. Bobby's (Scott Porter) was in a non-marital wife and I almost assure myself that a husband and wife will never meet you in your life, if you are a sensitive man. Then, we were annoyed by friends Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and what Chrissy (Brianne Davis) had said. If you think the characters in DEATH PROOF are annoying, try watching this movie. And do not get started by Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and DJ (Jay Phillips), they gave me a recovery in Usher's SHE'S ALL THAT <br /> <br /> Add a pre-owned plot to all of them, horrible. the soundtrack and the non-respecting original material, and you're pretty sharp.
