Whoa boy. <br /> <br /> Have you ever wanted a documentary about spoiling her life and alienating her on a megalomaniacal jerk? Well, they exist in many ways. But do you ever want to see documentary about this documentary, despite how many praise of an artistic genius? Well, surely, you can take a camera and find someone like that in any local scene (I know everywhere and I do not even follow the local scene), or you can save yourself by seeing the problem spending money. <br /> <br /> The premise is good and, honestly, it is not exactly the filmmakers knew where to go, it was one of the difficulties in making a documentary. Two groups, The Brian Jamestown Massacre, Anton directed and The Dandy Warhols, directed by Courtney. I've heard it with The Dandy Warhols before seeing this movie ... with Brian Jamestown Massacre. Why? Well, from the perspective of this documentary, Brian Jamestown Massacre's dysfunction team refused to make it really for the music industry. However, instead of being a two-way analysis, and how successful it has been, Anton focuses on it and its madness becomes much more. <br /> <br /> Because, see, Anton "is genius." "Because he plays rock music, he really understands" the evolution of music "... because he plays rock music with different instruments, his music is considered" retro-modern post-modern "because it is rock music, it wants to bring the" Revolution. " . rock music. Well, so wait ... twenty minutes and I want to see a documentary I watch for one of the most stupid children in the world. <br /> <br /> The documentary itself does not provide any value. Anton talent, 2000 Due to the fact that the hourly material is due to a quarter of a quarter of an hour, we do not have time to deal with it, so we see that Anton is "genius," a Socio-Manian loser, two hours to go and understood how to make really good music. , because the documentary does not have enough time to prove it, I know that he is calling the music god around the country and he does not protect anything, leaving a story that tells himself to be a bad man. can you help me? People like Anton does not seek the attention they deserve, the hope and admiration of these different people, and especially the lost potential of the bankruptcy mailboxes. This movie cuts two special VH1s of two hours for a reason: it continues on music, but it's the image and attention. Look at the guy, look how he is dressed, look at how he behaves, check how he tries to market the debates. <br /> <br /> In film, this is the only interesting character in this film. Joel, and that's because of any of this documentary, Joel is the only person that seems fun. Maybe because the pandero is a man. The rest are "rock rock". We deserve our attention and admiration and interests and commitments! They are "for storing a rock and roll". Do you remember that White Stripes had to keep "rock and roll"? Yes, Anton is due to this, and "it's selfish that I am not (Anton) as an inspiration." What a load People like Anton are forgotten. This documentary explains why the main music is - why the music director might have to deal with people like Anton, and, ultimately, only someone can put their power to the safe and unpredictable. Thank you, Anton. Your theater broke into music, to all you touched, regardless of the opinion. When Anton "recognizes" people who do not agree and is really a genius, he still shows how bad this documentary is. <br /> <br /> --ParisDiB
