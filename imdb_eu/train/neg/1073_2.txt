I can not believe that such a talent can be lost in a movie! Gingerbread Man starts at the right foot and creates great end-results. In any case, in some moments, the movie has become a story that has never been wasted. It's so unbelievable in Mallory Doss, Kenneth Branagh's character loses his nose. The film is very important and flat because the sun is very long. Gingerbread Man is the worst movie in Grisham, and this has not changed because talented films fill the movie. Do not waste your time here!
