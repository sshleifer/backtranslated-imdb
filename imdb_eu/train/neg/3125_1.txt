Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, an old and lonely nurse living with some servants at the Morhenge Palace, and says to his doctor: "Do not try a doctor, doctor! Invites his nephew and nephew to his house and warns that he is inherited as madness They were the genetic disease of "brain diminishes" (?) <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Mortevalek / Karloff ends up killing and relatives' killer "toys" designed by "dead brothers" They started dying, a small gun carrying real bullets on the boys' face, with babies with a large armor, with an ax and a sheik with a dance knife, a guy who joined them ridiculous faces, and Julissa and her boyfriend Karloff alive The steel doors are still hidden in a dungeon and hidden in a dungeon, it plays a recurring sound of organ music (similar to the death of a murderer) , the spirit of the brother begins to speak ("The whole house will go with me!") And the palaces rise to the flames. <br /> <br /> This senseless mess is dark, boring and stupid conversation is never in line with the lips.
