For your sake, it would be best to discard positive reviews about this movie. This Flick is STINKS. Now, I like low budget horror films (at least in theory), but this is the worst mistake for low-budget films: it takes the same way seriously. And unfortunately that is not the only problem. <br /> <br /> The story of the deadly British clan Ilses Beane was sent to modern times. The premise is interesting, but there are two things that are immediately visible around this movie. <br /> <br /> # 1- Why is the name of the Jenna Jameson CD box? She is a woman with an average look, she can not act, and has a small role. RESPONSIBLE: It seems like a popular porn star (as read in other revisions), so I think this is a "cameo" look. Seems to be the movie that requires "name recognition". His main billing is not a sign of his talent. However, the figures will give her that the rest of the cast is not overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> # 2- How can filmmakers think they might be so stupid as they went to Canada in Ireland? It's not far from the Irish look. And the house in the guest room / victims is this great American wooden frame. Beane started the story and developed a story that happened on the NA. Also, if you want to make a movie in Ireland, you probably have more than one character (and that's the best) with an Irish accent. It really was not really an Irish accent really. Well, this would not be so bad if the director did not try to make the next "Dead of Living Dead," but it seems that he was there. Bad. He could have liked it. In fact, some scenes did not want to be far from being comic. <br /> <br /> For example, like a gipping scene, the woman was chained to the table, naked and then split open and eviscerated. It's fun, you ask? Well, in the deleted scene version, the killer changes a mile from a few miles of fences. It's really fun for a while. In any case, what respectful cannibal eats the intestines? Cows and chickens ate intestines? We do not eat fish, we eat ham and ribs and drums. Oh well. <br /> <br /> The annoyances of another cast: Howard Rosenstein was noisy and horrible. I'm not sure, but I think he should throw it as STUD. In fact, he's a loser and a big ball that would say his name. This would explain why Gillian Leigh was fallen into that annoying character. <br /> <br /> I examined Gillian Leigh on his IMDb link, and it was apparently important to recognize that he was a bachelor of secondary education. I can not decide to learn more fun or pathetic after graduating a few years before, honored students make a nude soft-core porn with a man named Howard Rosenstein. Do they still ask the classmates to see the movie? If so, fortunately they will get the message: BEFORE YOU'RE BEFORE! Go to COLLEGE ... I could go ahead, but why. If you like Gore, you'll find something in this movie, but not much more.
