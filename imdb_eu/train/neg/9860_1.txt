I enjoy movies like this. It is a documented film shot, but it's a great deal of acting and writing. The play is woody and hard and the writing is so topical, but it's not right. When I'm writing this, I'm surprised at the 5.2 / 10 on the IMDb. I am sure that most of these votes must come from the members of the film crew. If that happens, you can manage a couple of laughter, it is always fun to make your family / friends movie. Well, in a way, this gives hope to all writers, directors, actors, etc., if they can do this, you can do this. Maybe you should not.
