When there is a concrete improvement in Rome there. When I got it, I found it predictable, resembling and slow and I still think it's still Olsen's twins. However, while the movie When In Rome is not horrible, it's not very good. In short, I should sum up one word. It's fun for teens, but I think adults do not follow much. <br /> <br /> If you have good points in Rome. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen really are very decent actors, certainly very nice. I'll admit at the age of 12, I really liked it and I like it in general. And some of them have enjoyed movies like Paris Passport and New York Minute. The goal once again is that the two girls do not work bad, they are very attractive. In addition, their clothes will die and Rome is a unique landscape. The soundtrack is not too bad. <br /> <br /> However, where the movie is shot, it's on plot and script. Most of the screenplay will be played and it has already been touched. Like most of the paintings, Mary Kate and Ashley, it's very predictable, and anyone who knows Olsen's twin sex movie will find some extravagant items. Most of the characters are thin cartoons, and you do not learn many of them, and sometimes the rhythm is different. Unfortunately, the breathtaking scenery were ruined by the slapdash of camera work, which was constantly running. <br /> <br /> With all, it has its own good points and, definitely, a step. However, to my liking, adolescents are harmful and predictable. 4/10 Bethany Cox
