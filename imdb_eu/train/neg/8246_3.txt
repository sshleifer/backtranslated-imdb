Dad's daughter Florence Florence and Dorothy West are terribly upset at the post office if they are not aware of being in charge of the abusive Charles Inslee. In the meantime, David Miles receives a message (by the young Robert Harron) who asks father to leave the house; So when young women come back, can they be? only at home As part of the weakening of the afternoon, the "Black and Hot Balance" begins. And, a dark-skinned drink gives an additional risk to D.W. Griffith's dynamic duo ?? <br /> <br /> Mr. Inslee has one of the best roles of his Biographies, stealing the movie "The Girls and Daddy". Ironically, the director Griffith showed his black face on the "Black and Tans" balloon. "Biograph Girls" suggest Lawrence and West "Griffith Girls" with Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in "Storm of the Orphans" (1921); And they have excessive love in bed! The racist tone is unfortunate, because the story of a robbery that has saved the potential victims of greater risk is interesting. <br /> <br /> *** Girls and Daddy (1/2/2) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
