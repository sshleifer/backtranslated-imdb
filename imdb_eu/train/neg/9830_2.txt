I think I'm afraid that it is a very large majority of people who value 10 films in this movie. I'm not. If you're looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this movie. If you're looking for a good overall movie, I think you'll have to go to another place. <br /> <br /> I was angry at the characters and their abominable behavior. The premise of the film is that moral teaching without teaching moral is that Jesus is the same as the moral foundation itself. A scene shows the main character who tells a boy who steals a boy and then the character is what Jesus taught us. I find this offensive: do you think that "you will not steal" Jesus came? He wrote ten orders? And was this robbery acceptable before? I rented Netflix movie. From suggestions I realized the nature of the movie. Okay
