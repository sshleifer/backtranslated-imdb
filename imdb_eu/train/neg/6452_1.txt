You know this story ... Only kids in the woods, BAM! It starts to cut something. <br /> <br /> Once this lime is not different. The male range becomes male twin. brother, a few years before, disappeared. Suddenly, "UNKOWN CREATURE" cuts the stars and his only help is a doctor / biker. <br /> <br /> It's little to say that this movie is bad. The performance was horrible. <br /> <br /> The creature was very tender. And like every movie they do these days, they do not try to get that end! <br /> <br /> The brightest spot of this PINTOR star in Maggie Grace is the female leader.
