The play dies in a movie. Vanessa Redgrave is dying, but before her daughter starts telling her story of life and her secret love ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that looks and hopes. An excellent movie, which has so many good actors and actors, it really seems to be what it is. It's not bad, for example, Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Clare Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all of us give good shows). It's just like Arlekin's love. <br /> <br /> Waiting Cable.
