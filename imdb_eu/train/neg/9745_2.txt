This movie is a scam on a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode. I think MST3K's best film was to rip this movie. <br /> <br /> Awesome play, make-up, bad effects, underwear underwear (1960's). I give it 2. <br /> <br /> Because make-up is difficult to understand, sticks. The companion will tell you how sounds like NACHOO. (thought sneezing). Oh, it's just bad. Long eyebrows are ridiculous in a character. <br /> <br /> I still do not know what the 'Projected Man' plot is. However, I lost an initial one. <br /> <br /> What is the minimum 10 online message?
