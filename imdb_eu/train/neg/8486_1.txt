I can not believe anyone who thought that something about that movie was original or interesting. I am a fan of science fiction with the next, and I can also make fun of the old movies with hilarious locks when it was written by another monkey. (See, for example, my bright review of Altered States (1980).) <br /> <br /> The monkey could better explain why I should take a second seriously as the basic idea of ​​this movie.
