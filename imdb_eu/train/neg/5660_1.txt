I'm glad to read the negative comments about Tritter. Everyone who speaks say the same thing. They love the nature of the house and their intelligence, but they like the proclamation of this continuing plot. It reduces the true nature of the hospital story and the police authorities annoy you. It must be more careful not to replace the violence directed at the hospital. Similarly, it seems that Tritter has many legal uncertainties about what he is doing. He can not alone freeze accounts and have the authority to write recipes to doctors. There is also a lot of violence that shows up to the hospital's ill patients and it does not draw a good story. The fraud was horrible, not because of the story itself, but when you insert the Trittor piece, the other plot is hurt. People say they hate watching story lines. Change. Get Tritter.
