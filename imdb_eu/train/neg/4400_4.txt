Frances Farmer's first movie; It's absolutely beautiful at age 22. Bing Crosby is a wonderful voice, but the songs are not the best. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interesting, but his comedy, probably during his time, is now very sad. Roy Rogers also appears on the song. I think you're a fan of Frances Farmer and I'm worthy of being a Bing Crosby fan.
