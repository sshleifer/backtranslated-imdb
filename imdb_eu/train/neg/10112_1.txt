Every year, I've seen hundreds of movies, including many direct abominations of low-budget amateurs who do not want anyone to ever see. I have seen thousands of movies in my time, many have been brilliantly, many times overdue. Zombie Nation will definitely remember what I've ever seen as one of the 'most promising horror movies'? In truth, I have not recovered yet again. <br /> <br /> The next day looks like a strange dream. Did I see what I saw? Why do police work in a warehouse? Did the Voodoo Priests really recommend 'zombies' eating popcorn? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? <br /> <br /> I do not recommend the Zombie Nation to watch the movie "good", and I would not recommend it "so bad." However, if you get a prospect to look at films that are more indifferent to never before? this is for you. Now, anyone who asks me is the worst movie ever I've ever seen, I'm telling Zombie Nation. <br /> <br /> Seriously? I think the boring movie is a serious crime, and Ulli Lommel should merit a movie that honestly took her. Actually, it is Ed Jr. of the digital era of Ed Wood, and I can not wait to make this movie so ridiculous.
