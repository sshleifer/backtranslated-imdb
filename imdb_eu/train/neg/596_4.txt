Basically here we are in the 1970s a remake of a hilarious 'Death Line' horror kitsch, that is, as ironically as this shoe. Aldwych also filmed underground underground station. <br /> <br /> Good use of one of the mentioned Jubilee Line platforms of Charing Cross and the aforementioned Aldwych, this film basically has the same plot - killer drone tunnels that lost passengers lost to lost passengers on the final train - originality This film is not a powerful point. <br /> <br /> There are really strong points missing. While Gore is poor and unnecessary, Gollum Nutter never fully explains that less than one sub-device developed on the plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < led by multiple rats. <br /> <br /> If it's horrible, the movies that are under the London Underground are your bag, or if you just want to play in the pipeline position, they get this on the DVD when they enter the bargain. If you are looking for a classic horror, go to the Death Dig (Raw Meat) copy. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for quality-written and targeted film, you'll need to change trains. .....
