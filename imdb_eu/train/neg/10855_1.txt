Surely I'm sure I will not be a comedy. <br /> <br /> It would not normally prohibit commenting on this movie: it's so small that nobody will ever see it, but it's just as popular as Kazaa in P2p sharing networks, It is necessary to explain what this production is. <br /> <br /> So what is it then? Well, of course it's not a comedy; Instead, it's a horror movie, the "intention" is so much a key here. The script mess is completely incoherent and unbalanced, because special effects are particularly pathetic and in terms of acting, let us say well if I graduated in primary school, my teacher's teachers would have wept before our talent. <br /> <br /> Of course, I think it is a low-budget movie, and in those cases, expectations must be diminished, as far as special effects are concerned. In addition, I am a fan of the horror genre, but I know that these films are a bit in search of interesting script and high-level plays. <br /> <br /> But still. /> <br /> B-movies often lack some functionality for recovery features such as humor. Cradle to Fear's only laugh consists of ridiculous performances. If you find a sense of humor and I am about 20 minutes away, it will be the only thing that will be able to relax afterwards and then the movie. Oh, that and two or three breasts. <br /> <br /> Woohoo, exciting. <br /> <br /> With regard to the story, there is nothing that tries to convey anything: victims make drugs or / or serious crimes. Lesson: Be careful, boys and girls, because you'll do it one day. <br /> <br /> I'll rest my case. <br /> <br /> So completely a bit of sex, a lot of medications, but absolutely rock zero shot. <br /> <br /> I bet this from 10 to 10, but I would go to 0. Or maybe I would not: it's worth writing the titles of the actors 1 correctly. I mean, is that it?
