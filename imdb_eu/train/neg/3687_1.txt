It's not a bad movie; Not only are four of the best "Mexican" film producers; the script is awesome That's just ... this movie is a great time ... People are losing money in awesome scripts. It is a criticism of Mexican society, but we eat such films. Does the bad language seem fun? I do not know. There is a big problem in Mexican cinema to continue playing these types of films (writing and production). <br /> <br /> Please do not think that this type of film is well received in Mexico: we hate it and do not reflect it.
