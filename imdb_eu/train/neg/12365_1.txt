This piece of garbage is considered to be the best proof of what can be a good idea, why do all those American entertainers say that they want these stupid versions of GI JOE with good stories these days? Looney Tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history, but they were not created to be Xtreme, that is, come! Tiny Toons was an excellent example of how to update the old idea without losing its original charm, but this piece of junk is just an example of huge corporate decisions because he loves children! ! Do children love superheroes ??? The whole show is just a waste of time we can see new versions of Looney Tunes, but this time as a superhero, this is not a bad thing, but the problem is that this concept is hard to copy as a single series. animated series or new lawsuit, result ??? flash copies (road runner) or problem of superman (who is the other bugs bunny) is Looney Tunes were not meant to be dramatic, they were supposed to be fun! As I said before sucking the series, and many people wonder why it's cheering around the world ??? This show is about to be dramatic and action-packed, but it's something that you can do with series and anime, if you want to see a new version of an old show of Tiny Toons, this is a life-long come back. old characters, but respecting the good story and original roots. It's wrong when the show is dead, I suppose another reasonable decision corporation.
