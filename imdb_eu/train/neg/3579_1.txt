After renting and seeing a few years ago, I decided to define an absolute zero in the absolute movie. There was no movie that could have been worse than anything. We still value films today, although they are very bad, better than "Lonely Lady". <br /> <br /> I had a conversation with Eleanor Perry for a long time. Among others, "Last Summer" and "Diary of a Mad Housewife", he was asked to write the script for Harold Robbins's "The Lonely Lady" book. He sent a treatment and said they had been dismissed, because they understood the difficulties of a woman in Hollywood scriptwriter. Then he said "I think I should write someone else." The interview was shot before filming. He died in 1981, and I bet on heaven, thanks to the implications for God to thank him for this result.
