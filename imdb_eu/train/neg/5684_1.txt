misguided garbage a mediocre sadistic nihilist script ... if you are a person you like ... watch it shrink. Even if you are a person, it is not a good movie, the performance is very poor, the story has a hollow story, the director must actually leave it and find a real work, for which he has no talent. I see why they like uwe boll people like it. Lately we have had some movies and this is the best, really sad! No humanity seems to be a human being, but there are only networks here. Horror movies may be desolation, miniature artwork, good observations in other things ... SEED is really poor.
