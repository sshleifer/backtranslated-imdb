I do not like this movie, but I did not think much of the book, though I often praise it as a "masterpiece", but I have not found it much more in the development of nature and the unlabelled plot. Fante's "amazingly" "amazing" first effort has not been published without fascinating Fant in the mid-80s. <br /> <br /> I was interested in what kind of soup Towne would look like little ingredients. He has been working on the shortcomings in the book, but my money has not been rescued. While trying to be loyal to the book, Dust Dust was never a movie. I'm playing this stupidity of the Towne film. <br /> <br /> In a word: unforgettable.
