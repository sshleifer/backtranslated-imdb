I read reading W.Snipes, so it's not surprising that you would like to participate in low-budget projects like the Contractor. The next growing club is nothing more than a mere star of the 90's (Van Damme, Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here is the starting point for a single shot filmed in Bulgaria (we think it's positioning in London, as it would buy full moron) The story is from 1000 other films: retired special forces are good. The Government once again recruited the work for wet work. When the government wants to get rid of it, it takes away the good guys after the bad bangs (it's not guessable!) The star of the movie: the girl (Eliza Bennett) surpasses the rest of the stars. Lena Headey is a star with her star for a candy eye, 2 stars. Snipes fans only! Others: Avoid!
