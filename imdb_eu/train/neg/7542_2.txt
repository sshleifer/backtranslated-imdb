This movie is supposed to be a mysterious and serious thriller about a man who is looking for a girl. However, in a 30-minute movie, with funny stories and a random scene, it becomes a fun and realistic tale. I can not imagine Cage randomly, to any old lady who does not laugh at Karat, or when she is a blonde girl. Lines, characters and play are wrong. I've always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but this year he has made some awesome movies; that is, far, worst (yet ...). <br /> <br /> I would not recommend the movie so I can see the story live in a thriller. If you want to enjoy this story, rent the original. However, if you want to watch, be prepared to laugh at some lines and take the final scenes seriously; This is the only way to enjoy this movie.
