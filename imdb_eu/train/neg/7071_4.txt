When the film was released in 1997, "special effects", such as the poor. Many films made in the 1980s and 1970s and 1960s have the same or better work as SFX. Certainly no one was looking for an Oscar in the production of this film. Fred Olen Rayen's usual things are ignored; Most of them are in the title "Bikini" (Bikini Pirates, Bikini Chain Gang, Bikini Girls Lost Planet, etc.) and much more than T & A films, but we're here for a "U" movie and a kiddies. You have to make a credit for diversifying !! The live video key was correct. Then he got two visuals: Invisible Mom 2 and Invisible Dad. Dee Wallace-Stone (whose career has declined steadily in the 1982 "ET") plays an invisible title for the movies and will continue to be Russ Tamblyn's sector (also a 1961 career lineup) "West Side" Story "with Dr. Woorter's performance He probably says that most of the Casts were in their careers, they would have to do almost anything to pay the bills for that month, but the young Trenton Knight, it's like Josh, although he had worked before this movie, "Invisible Mom 2" Despite the fact that this young actress who has not tracked the film has been damned, perhaps this film was damned. She is very good for a child, not better than or better than any one of her super-heroine. <br /> < > As we have mentioned, they say at least the "invisibility" effects, the direction is inadequate, the handwriting is clear and there is nothing in the house for this film for anyone under ten years of age Without it, this movie is pretty nice. Most adults want to make sure they disappear again, and I would not be pity!
