This movie is really awesome. After seeing the announcement for this, I thought that he could have his charm ... but he did not. Girls can not act, and they can not sing. The soundtrack of this movie is full of songs, and it's not so beautiful, a terrifying story, an unbelievable plot, the worst movie of FAR's Disney. Ally is not a bad actor of "Phil of the Future", so I do not know what happened in "Cow Belles". And it seems that her sister AJ is just a ride of "fame" for her sisters, and never shows her talent. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, girls end up learning the clue. Moral, but it will be late to rescue the train's disaster film. <br /> <br /> Soul
