I think the txorimaloak are horrible, so this film is no longer created. <br /> <br /> A batch of robberies makes an emergency parachute to make birds fly to a terrific area. One of them is missing out on the spoils, so the rest affects badly-minded scythes. The operation is hammy and the birds are not impractical (when they move). In a positive way, the director leaves the stomach spurs. As Alfred Hitchcock says, "a bomb goes under the table, and it is shocked. We know that the bomb is under the table, but when it's not lit up, that's a suspense."
