As the people most liked the concept of cinema, especially when he wanted to emphasize the fact that he wanted to point out that "movies were attacked", the image of the filmmaker's coat was behind an angry multitude. <br /> <br /> Then watch the movie and, what do they mean, "filmmakers were attacked," some children rolled up in a sign and a lot of people were loudly loud and said "Someone would need it" two Beat those children. "As the cover image was" behind "? Complete manufacturing, I connect with the subject of the movie, that is to say, stupid and meaningless children, to manipulate unnecessary time and sense and make sense. <br /> <br /> No I know what the viewer has to do with the great truth, far from this film, it's like Michael Moore's "Roger & Me", but "Roger & Me" Moore was the mocking of Flint people, it is straightforward and totally inane.
