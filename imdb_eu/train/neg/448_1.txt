According to what I hate about this show, it's written incorrectly by the director. These women do not respect or dignify themselves. They play the whole lot to the boys. Amanda Bynes's talent is utterly useless. "All That" and his show was superb. Why did they write her and Jenny Garth sour, airhead, disappointed, after men, wannabes "old-fashioned" beyond me. <br /> <br /> Their plots and conversation reminds me of "The Simpons", Homer says Poochie's cartoons are not on the screen "Everyone should ask where is Poochie?" All lectures make sense to the guy and then to nonsense. Sometimes they change and the guy weeps. They are then returned or ended. 2 women are also superficial, stupid, or sexual dependencies. The only word that you can think is "sucks".
