This movie has recently come to local television here in South Africa, and I think it's fun to see the bad news for B (that is, what I do). The land belongs to a couple who visits a country house. There are some unknowns and ... The problem is that most movies, shot at the beginning of the seventies, make extreme people walk in real time and slowly from A to B. This makes the movie. At the end and the results of blood and gore payments never happen. I'm really curious - how many people have actually seen from the beginning to the end?
