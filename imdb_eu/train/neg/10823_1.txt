I do not like the word "terrifying" to describe any movie's work, which generates a lot of time, effort, talent, and money, but Zefferell is an effort to adapt Charlotte BrontÃ« to "Jane Eyre". full loss of time <br /> <br /> The script is not lacking and powerless, not all of the viewers are exposed in doubtful terms, leaving little imagination. The actors actors are misunderstood, contracting the names of the stars and the sad and sad musical scores. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt do not chemically match each other. Noodle is like wet, much worse than Joan Fontain, who had at least a lot of emotional implications that should be a story of a frustrated passion. And William Hurt plays the whole film in a single tone, and this tone is flat and lacking energy. Of course, heavy and penetrating handwriting does not help these excellent agents to get the smell of that life. <br /> <br /> Joan Plowright Mrs. Fairfax is as enjoyable as Disney's creation. to enjoy the best scenes to leave. <br /> <br /> The story of Rochester's first wife is not a mystery. The second wife of the Future, played in the Barbie Doll as Elle MacPhearson, is a pure cipher. <br /> <br /> Fiona Shaw, an excellent actor, is totally in vain with Jane's aunt, Mrs. Reed. She would be better than Mrs. Fairfax. Only Amanda Root, as a dear teacher at Jane, reminds us of true sympathy or credibility. <br /> <br /> I saw this version of "Jane Eyre" for Robert Young, British television, in 1997 and with Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. There is no difference. Young's version, romantic and deeply moving, is an explosive version, compared to the generous Zefferelli generous. <br /> <br /> I will now be interested to see the 1970 version of Timothy Dalton, some of which I have read very well. on this website. I'm surprised how much the Zefferelli Yorkshire photo books liked. <br /> <br /> Everything that's good about this movie is that it's a beautiful house and cinema is a very colorful one, it's really wonderful.
