I'm sorry, but this is a bad movie that is hilarious. A football hooligan in a travel home? Clothes? Shades? Alank clearly was not talking about what he was talking about, as far away as possible. <br /> <br /> The questionnaire was cruel ... Gary Oldman as a football hooligan? It does not look like a terrifying, terrifying, or somebody who likes football. And in regards to Yeti? What about hell Costumes, shadows and a trip on the road made the baby affect each other with "nonsense". Please. <br /> <br /> And Yeti gangs throws ICC clothes? <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone can take this film seriously. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The worst portrayal of the crisis in the late eighties I've ever seen.
