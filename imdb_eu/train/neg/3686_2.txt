I'm surprised everyone (and even critics) seem to think it's a good movie. It was a topical thriller I've ever seen. 'Good guy' (or girls in this case) has something wrong or we want to face it. The "good girl" of this movie has to use her mind and skills to defeat the "bad" and save her days and loved ones. To use charisma, courage and even luck to save on the day. <br /> <br /> Where did you start? A young woman named Lisa Reisert meets a man named Jackson Rippner (a nice name) at an airport. One coincidence creates another one, and soon feels that these two fate come together. Sharing beverages, sitting next to each other, getting in every way ... Is there any more stunning? Could these two be between each other? "Fate" is no reason for his strange and daring encounter? <br /> <br /> Well, as it turns out, unfortunately. Jackson needs Lisa to kill the director of Homeland Security by moving her from one room to another in order to launch an attack. Oh, if it does not, then your dad is dead. We have never known specific reasons, and who is really mad at it, Jackson further explains how it will happen and why Lisas is in the best interest. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lisa defeated. In his intention and in the process, he ties his evil plan with his neck, overcomes the chairs and strikes it with a hockey stick. Oh, and before that, he was taken to a brutal harassment during the Miami airport, where he spent 9 9 safely and later steals a car that man ordered to kill his father later. <br /> <br /> Yes, the reason. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, it seems strange that a man like Jackson has access to high-tech weapons by a man who needs help from the hotel manager. Could you not enter a bomb into the building? Was he not safer for himself and leaving his team to third parties? And why are characters like Jackson who will threaten anyone who threatens to do it? Is not it why people made it easier for them? <br /> <br /> The actors made the best film for the movie. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still awaiting actors. I also think that Jayma Mays (who has played the 'lovable Cynthia') will be someone we'll see more. It's very bad to be stuck with everything. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 2
