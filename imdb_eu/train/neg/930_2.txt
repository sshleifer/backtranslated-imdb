Some children make hiking in the mountains, one of them enters a large tunnel and finds the old mummified gladiator. It puts the gladiator's helmet and passes the rest of the movies that will kill the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely absurd madness. Here there is no brief list of things without meaning: <br /> <br /> 1) The guy and the girl are in her tent and they hear something from the outside. He takes the guy to investigate and finds another cyclist outside. Then she listened to her girlfriend, so they went back to the tent, the next morning they arrived?!? Only 50 meters away! <br /> <br /> 2) Two dunderheads listen to another girl who is listening (What, 100 meters away?), But do not investigate, because they are afraid of losing. <br /> <br /> 3) Another guy and girl walk around, and around the tenth scene, the girl informs the girl that she does not demand that the protocol be taken as a teacher. I mean, what is ...? First of all, it's really stupid to say; Secondly, he never called his teacher together with his nine scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He taught him how to kill the gladiators' pieces of training. Yes, yes, we noticed that he was injured and he was dead because he was walking. But for the rumor of this information. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> 5) Demonicus's reef is tied up by a girl, and when someone tries to release it, she helps that person. Yes, apparently idiot, if you were freeing it, it would take about 5 seconds, it would not get help. <br /> <br /> And it goes on. The middle part of the film goes through the two idlers lost in the woods, then they fight and then put on a tent and discard their friends' shouts and then walk through others. That's so boring and absurd, I dumped the DVD halfway. <br /> <br /> None of these characters are sympathetic, especially those who get the most time on the screen. Demonicus himself laughed at each other when I saw him - he's like a boy in a Halloween costume to look up his wicked face. It runs, or should I say around as a gay cyclist. Special effects are comedies, the interpretation is most horrible, and nothing makes sense. <br /> <br /> In general, maybe this concept would make more time and effort if you could make a nice movie. It is removing playful conversations, creating characters with real characters, having a certain logical flow to the initiative, and perhaps a terrifying character of Demonicus in a sexy Gladiator outfit. But no, we get this absurd stack of nonsense that will give you death.
