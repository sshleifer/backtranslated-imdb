The "Gremlins" hit hit 1984 is probably the biggest railway ever ever made. Even for a "B" movie, all of the horror movies that are in the same platform are completely dwarfed on plot, acting, and goodness. <br /> <br /> It starts with an old and random security guard. The young punitive youth, the name is irrelevant. Why? Because a few minutes of the movie is part of the 'banned' security and it's a fantasy because of having a rock star in a cheap pub. <br /> <br /> This is just an appetizer for scat. full course filled The main character KEVIN struggles several times to prove himself to be more than one pussy. Perhaps he is successful in the film, but it proves to be a mere actress. Kevin gets a job with the old security guard and guides the security change (wait) in the abandoned studio. Why do you think that a group is involved in the same studio? Back to the movie Kevin opens a security for somehow prohibited and releases Hobgoblin. Hobgoblins force people to live full of fantasy and die for some reason. They must return before sunrise or else what? <br /> <br /> Other characters are Kevin's "macho" friend NICK, Nick's "DAPHNE", whose character has no substance more than clothing than prostitutes and prostitutes. Kevin's girlfriend is manipulative and "reserved", AMY's deepest desire will be apparently portrayed by Cher, especially with fish trousers, with a couple of under the grandmother. Do not ask how it works. Perhaps the most entertaining character of all is KYLE. It is asking how to make these friends' groups. Kyle does not have a perverted thread that can not help stimulating himself for an hour. His hobbies include the call of sex chat lines of others and ordinary sniffing clothes. <br /> <br /> Stories are looking for hobgoblins heroes: tall creatures of the knee (ie hand puppets). For some reason, trying to get out of the boundaries of the local neighborhood. Each character lives in the wildest fantasy of millions of dollars ... or a great budget movie. <br /> <br /> THE HEART OF PROGRESS: At the end of the film, the movie asks the viewer "What?". Hobgoblins will return to security ... voluntarily. The sun may wait for patience to cause ruin, or maybe writers get writers' creams and they decided not to worry about the end. When returning to safety, the old security guard shows "the military learned" and breaks the security that destroys the explosives, indicating the end of the evil Hobgoblins and the end of this Russian mountain; Ideal for a mechanical staircase. <br /> <br /> The iniquity of this movie is enough to send somebody tears. If you plan to watch, I recommend drinking alcohol without prior notice to take into account serious movie issues.
