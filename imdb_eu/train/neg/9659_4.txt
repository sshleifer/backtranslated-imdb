After seeing this movie, I was disappointed, because they were not actors, stories or directors - I was disappointed with these movie ads. <br /> <br /> They suggested that the battalion for the "third exit was chosen". Even if they were not rendered or killed (Polish infos also chose to kill artillery or German weapons, even though titles were reproduced incorrectly as "a fake battalion"). This has chosen the right place and I bought the movie. <br /> <br /> The victory began when I realized that I was sitting in the third place and when I realized it was nothing but the death, sitting and telling the dead ... Then I began to think, "well, this story is not so easy ... I would bet This intelligent officer has some strenuous ways of saving his troops. " Well, he did not just sit and wait for something to happen. And I was also. <br /> <br /> The story was based on real world events, so writers could not use much more imagination, but I thought that this movie was really dubious and even more so. boring. And, first of all, I have not written, actors, writers or directors are failing, above the level that can be faced by the movies that I've raised the expectations of people of my marketing.
