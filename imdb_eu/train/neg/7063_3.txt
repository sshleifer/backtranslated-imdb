The guy designed a lot of titles for a series of films, and I think he was one day; I would have to choose a cheap scenario, try to put the titles as far as possible (after all, I'm a title designer) and try to persuade people about this movie. Although one of those I have seen is certain. If you are interested in seeing good titles, check out some posters that do not miss your time watching. <br /> <br /> Ironically do not you think, did you see the poster? The only project that should have the work in the title is almost nobody!
