I know that movies are not reflected in reality, but this makes them nervous. It perpetuates unknown stereotypes about "psychological trauma" and mental illness. "Psychology" has been done too much before (and usually better) and the rest is far too far away. The play was not horrible, but nothing was heard. <br /> <br /> Highlight: The Hospital General is a former car enthusiast and has been a former traveler to see one of the regular roles of the regular GH. Lindstrom. <br /> <br /> However, if you forget the fragments of psychoanalytic defects, a person must hang reality / decision when watching many movies, then this movie can be sustainable. If you do not have enough things and standards to do it. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I'm seeing time.
