I borrowed this library from the library, and I think it could be nice. How wrong I am! <br /> <br /> The bad movie is something I need to write about it. Mira Sorvino is a very bad movie, it is very painful to watch the scene. The girl is pretty, but this movie is not an attraction, but I have to see the great attempt to fascinate her other main characters. It's so horny. <br /> <br /> And the film's conversation is so unforgiving, and a humorous act that is acceptable is lacking. <br /> <br /> Totally bankrupt.
