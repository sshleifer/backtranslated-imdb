I have been environmentalist for years and I really expected this show. I set all the episodes to record, because I thought I could learn some good news. Maybe I'd be Rachelle. <br /> <br /> Surely this is because staging is a reality show that reaches the viewer's class. It does not really work for anyone interested in improving the planet. <br /> <br /> This show must be called Nagging with Rachelle. <br /> <br /> Since it's a great source of information, it's probably a good idea to have a good second on the environment. Lying things do not need some of us. <br /> <br /> I have not already recorded the episodes or seen the show, but let me know if there's a true green show.
