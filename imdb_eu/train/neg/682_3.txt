Please note: I can see from several messages that there was an original silent version and the sound version of this version of the movie as well. I saw the sound version and it was aesthetically noisy. Considering some that the original version was LONGER and without crappy duplication, my review should be read in mind for this. <br /> <br /> Although I know that Rene Clair has a reputation as a filmmaker and Louise Brooks knows. Similarly, following a bit of worship, that is, in many ways, a technically wrong film. As Hollywood changed its sound to 1929, in the early 1930s, almost all the famous French films featured significant films; Some conversations and sound effects overwhelmed a lot of bad films. Many lipstick movements, and especially this movie, are not in line with what they are saying, which would explain why an American, Mrs. Brooks, can do such a French film. It's just that, and I would rather have made a silent film - and it would be an average movie as a silent movie - with a brilliant camera (sometimes) and a light-silent starring performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < For a silent morale, when it approached 1920, it would be fine, but according to the rules of 1930, the plot is a little bit (that is, "old" is not "slutty"). A lady has won a beauty contest and her stick fiancÃ© can not handle it. It takes time, but it adds to a temporary way of life, which ends its life! Melodramatic, right? And also a bit simplistic and little developed. <br /> <br /> In the end, the girl's friend's character (?) seemed very disturbing and unreal. He looked like Harold Lloyd and most of his films and friends were released and filmed. He had only taken over the whole film and had no resolutions, his character seemed useless and he received the most beneficial treatment. Were audiences laughing because of their abuse? It seems that this is an implicit and I do not like it. <br /> <br /> Still the best French films of that time (Le Million, La Femme du Boulanger, Fanny, Regain and others). ), as well as silent films. I can not understand much about this movie.
