In the 1980s, T. Rama Rao made very beautiful films, but it seems that he can not come up with a filmmaker, with times, style and fashion. It's like sticking to the same old cinema style. <br /> <br /> The actors are not bad, not good ones. Anil Kapoor generally has two roles in his father and his son to persuade his conduct, but the direct mistake is often fun and pathetic. It's a good thing, but then - it's always good, and here it's not more than that. He takes advantage of it, but he always does it. As a result, nothing is great. Raveena is fine, that is, it's plain, not bad, not good, it means anything. <br /> <br /> This movie is melodramatic, occasionally stupid. Maybe it's a delayed movie? Well, then it would still be below the standard. The script is horrible, the movie is too much and the story is nowhere. It feels like a movie made in the early 90's, but the script seems to be even older, the style is from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend, if you are a big fan, the protagonists.
