I have seen a lot of good Korean movies with thrillers and darker movies with dark shades, but this is horrible. The director seems to be a sadist, someone wanted to produce some garbage. The movie lacks any entertainment value and is no excitement. I can not believe someone really plays this. Although acting is fine, the story line and the feeling left are huge. <br /> <br /> I'm sure, I have not seen the director's movie. It is not sensory to make movies, and it is very disappointing to have thriller moments. All this shows psychopathic scenes, it is exciting to think about the badly shot scenes and more blood and violence. The movie is very disappointing and it is highly recommended to skip all such films.
