"Little Man", now on DVD, is Wayans Brothers flop. Marlon Wayans is a story that is less than cancer-targeted, hiding a diamond in a lady's purse. He and his pair were trained Morgan to cook, Marlon disguised her baby and planted her at home. Then, she goes through all kinds of "Home alone" or "Child's play", like chaos, to get back the jewel and treat it as a baby. I was surprised when this movie was humorous. The jokes have been made in other places so many times that they are not beautiful or fun. I almost believe that the movie might have been more fun if CGI was not used and he used the little actress stuck with Marlone's faces. Seeing the deleted scene (minus CGI) this actor was fun in Mini-mode mode, but another way was chosen. Some cameras and Tracy Morgan make some fun scenes. Rent your rental cost at $ Borat if you want some real laughter. <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
