Or listen, that's why. The soundtrack is also boring. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have not seen the worst movie gay movie I have ever seen (Billy), but there's a barrel next to the bottom. <br /> <br /> Dragging and dragging and dragging this thing. Plots are not great - it can work in the hands of a good writer. . . it could be more entertaining. There is no plot of land that can not be seen ten miles down the road. The conversation is flat. Jokes are old To add an offense to injury, they are stereotypical in one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that has persuaded me that there are two possible situations or relationships that are possible, much less. There was no chemical, there was no dynamic, because there was no reason why they brought each other. . . They are in love We find it difficult to find difficult when they are not compatible with sex. Do you like the same book? Stupid <br /> <br /> The play is not quite bad, but the intermediate is very slow. I mean almost Jarmusch - slow but Jarmusch without quality. In fact, it would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch movies, avoid this.
