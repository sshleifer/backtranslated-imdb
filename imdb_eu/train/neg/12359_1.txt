I thought it was a really cool movie - I found a couple of times with my television really shouting. One or both of the male men's men were confused; There was no chemistry between them, and Richard Ruccolo preferred a dog to kiss. The film includes their long-term and tortured ones, emphasizing the decomposition and make-up, but does not include any details. These reasons would bring interesting characters, not a fight or make-up in bed (for example, if you like the movie). <br /> <br /> <br /> Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine as a character, but they do not want to be rented in the movie. Save your money.
