A woman's nightmare is afraid of being buried alive. The fraudulent husband wants to kill him and wants to take advantage of his phobia by going into a coffin and leaving it in the basement. B-horror queen becomes Brinke Stevens queen. The only reason to see this unfortunate movie is Michael Berryman with really small coffee and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard. And it's pretty funny to see Brink's bloods last twenty minutes. Better heads are seen again "Scalps" or "Alien Dead". Of course, I do not expect Fred Olen Ray's stunning entertainment, but "Haunting Fear" is too dull to be nice.
