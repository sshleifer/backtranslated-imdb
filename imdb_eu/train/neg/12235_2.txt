In 1974, in 1974, if you want to know what music they want to hear, this is a movie for you. But you'll have to hear a lot of flute and violin (see References to My Girl 1 for reference). <br /> <br /> Forgive acknowledgment: I approached My Girl 2 with cynicism and dirty. after visiting his predecessor. But at the end of my home country, My Girl 2 looks like she was looking for her, they were looking for her mother. <br /> <br /> In a different way, everything I have liked about My Girl 2 has been nothing to do with My Girl 2, but asking a protagonist, as much as I'm adopting, "who is my mother"? And if my mother's movies are in a theater group, I can do my own film about it. <br /> <br /> People are insignificant. Films would not be necessary. My Girl 2 (just like My Girl 1) is just "listless." <br /> <br /> If you're not avoiding bad sweating, because some anger is consoled.
