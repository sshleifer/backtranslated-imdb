When I was younger, I liked this show, but now ... BLECCH !!! This show is sappy, poorly written, and rarely funny. The three roots were good actors and funny men (Saget stand was much better than the things created by this show, as Coulier was better and Stamos was better than the average actor). After a while, he wanted to abandon the Stamos show, because he wanted to do more serious things (who could blame him?). In the end, many actors demanded more money when the show was canceled. <br /> <br /> Here are some things that overwhelm me with the show: <br /> <br /> 1. Catching expressions: how many times a person can relieve words such as "how rude", "scary" , "cut" and with a 24-hour period. ? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimmy Gibler: An annoying character who has ever written for television. <br /> <br /> 3. Deprecated writing and oreo as a cookie. There are good topics and bad writing written. Written by Full House. <br /> <br /> 4. Three men who live together in San Francisco - they have just said. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 5. Realistic things. Remember too much. <br /> <br /> 6. For trendy children - Girls have all the latest fashion trends and you will see posters of fashionable recording artist. <br /> <br /> Now the show is on Nick @ Nite. I could hardly call a classic. I have nothing wrong with people involved, many of them have talent. But this show was sweet sugar, but I could not stand it for some time.
