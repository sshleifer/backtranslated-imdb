The most prominent movie for me is Tom Hanks. In Mike Sullivan mode, he definitely pulled the opposite type and showed himself without having to handle his role (for him). Hanks is a good boy in the movie - what you like, admire it. Certainly Sullivan was not good. It is true that in the context of this film he has become a nobleman, in order to fulfill his wife and younger son's murders. However, he was a gangster and murderer before these murders. Hanks took on the role he had hoped for, and he drove it well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < After an inauguration, I would describe the enigmatic very well (this was not exactly clear to me where it was). This film is very dark, about the complex relationships developed by Sullivan as a gangster. (Paul Newman), who is one of the bosses of the underworld and is trying to raise his two children and, to some extent, keep "clean"; his business isolated After a murderer's son, the gang tries to kill him to keep silent, he gets the wrong son (and mother), and Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr.) run. It becomes a strange relationship between father / children. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that there is little hope (in the general context of the story), it is very dark. Many scenes that are filmed in the darkness and rain rains. I have to admit that while I was estimating the performance of Hanks, the film did not fit in. 4/10
