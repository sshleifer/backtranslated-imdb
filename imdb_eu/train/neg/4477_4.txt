What is empty and not a classical brilliance for the interpretation of the novel. I would like people to interrupt the classics, when I do not know the real intention or point of the original. This version is different. I found the version of Ralph Fiennes much worse, like Juliette brioche casting, Kathy EVER ... to make the worst decision-making decision. He wants to be like a contemporary story and a style of music. It has two successes, but the art is high at night. Looking for the sun's storm shedding ... perhaps the direction was average and editing. Even worse is the old Quincy. Deepak Verma makes a great turn like Hindley, and indeed she is one of the British talents. Heath's charm and belief was played and I think the questionnaire is the strongest point in this project. Even though a talented manager uses the facilities that are better used. It was clear that the director of the rent was not taught the project with the deserved passion.
