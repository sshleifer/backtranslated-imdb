An interesting idea (stealing banks that steal revenge from four African women under the boot of society) is a slow and horrific one of F. Gary Gray (Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier). Understanding the role of urban women struggling to fight a continual fight against the sea in a world in which a man suffers from cruelty prefers Gray, Bufford and Lanier to suspect that suspects may blaze them with the best ideas of operational tragedy. It's the greatest melodrama. Gray has plunged his actor into all tired lines and refuses to abandon John Carter's refusal to refuse to refrain from training his camera malignant faces. And they're shameful: Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise, and Vivica A. Fox have a lot of talented talent (Queen Latifah is the fourth and acting rapper as an actor), Gray needs a more secure hand. This results in rigid and uncomfortable front cameras. Take care
