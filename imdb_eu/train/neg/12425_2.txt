I do not know what you are inspired, but please stop. This movie was full in the trash. <br /> <br /> Macaulay Culkin Kevin McCallister was fascinated, pretty, lovable, very fun and very entertaining. She was innocent, but at the same time powerful. <br /> <br /> This new boy, Alex? Hell we all! He's just trying to match Culkin's charm and grace, unfortunately not failing. <br /> <br /> <br /> Evil, empty. Harry and Marv on the screen were so entertaining. It was comical, it just made me think they were more humorous and they wanted more errors with Culkin, which is why he thinks he's a good man. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are essential for these roles. On the other hand, on 3rd, we have just 4 idiots, just a bicker and again, try to capitalize on the first charisma and charm charm. It was horrible, but they were not memorable, or even more entertaining. More on the side of the korny. <br /> <br /> Then we got real movies. 1 and 2 parts, classics. Memorable It looks like Christmas and brings a wonderful Christmas sensation that brings so much emotion. He loves the story and helps you take care of the characters. Simply memorable and close to masterpiece. Part 3? Cover masterpiece. It's enough to say. <br /> <br /> With all that, I do not know such people. I think people really do not know what a good movie is there anymore. His mock segments are rip-offs with real-world traps and the robbers would like to beat at least robberies. <br /> <br /> Run, run away from this litter. And it's even possible to start the 4th part!
