This movie is perhaps one of the most boring films I've ever seen in 2000! Mostly, music does not create suspensions when people suddenly disappear. Similarly, parties such as martial law are not treated with seriousness. This story has problems: the UN could not take over the power of the world, because only the United States did not allow China, Russia, Japan, etc. They would not even have nations like them. The Nikolai Carpathians would play against what he would play as he does. This is what James Bond films reminds me, only those who have more action! Of course, Christians only make films and Christians, and they can enjoy it. I can not think of myself as a crucifix, it seems to me to be ridiculous. Moreover, it seems that this prophecy is true, it is dangerous before other prophecies of the end of the world's cultures. Why are we afraid of such a life here when we can bestow on Earth?
