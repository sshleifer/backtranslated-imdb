Come on! Get Pakistan's blows. Bollywood can not make excellent films, but it can affect the whole audience generation. <br /> <br /> I'm a great fan of Bollywood's HOBEKTU, but Pakistan's films were too much in script, cinematography, and enjoyment. sequences-everything <br /> <br /> I'm really glad that the viewers on either side of the border rejects propaganda and films such as Main Hoon Na are brilliant, because they are not only worthy. Bollywood's masala for quality, but also because it means: peace is an opportunity and shows that there is insanity on both sides of the masses.
