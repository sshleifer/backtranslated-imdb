Rancid Aluminum was a mere two hours, the line line was thin and confusing, the famous players had a great deal of conversation and had a very uncertain accent. The camera's work was somewhat experimental, and only the director could see what he meant to do but made it harder to see it. One of the most annoying facets of Rancid Aluminum is the use of the narration almost entirely as a movie enthusiast. The best performances were not related to acting. In fact, probably the greatest performance was with all the people of Dani Behr, although, of course, he is the secretary of the stereotyped office. THERE IS NOTHING in any way to watch this movie for a reason to stay for some reason, the hard earned money is to use cash flow.
