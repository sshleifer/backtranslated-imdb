CAMILLE 2000 <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 2.35: 1 (Panavision) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Monkey <br /> <br /> If you visit Rome, a noble rage (Nino Castelnuovo) falls in love with a beautiful young libertine (Daniele Gaubert), but it is not so pleasing to Castelnuovo's rich father (Massimo Serato) and Fate is a tragic blow ... <br /> <br /> Sexual love The story of the eighties, Michael DeForrest's screenwriter (Alexandre Dumas, "La Dame aux Camelias"), and directed by Radley Metzger, along with Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno. Refine the parameters of 'Adult' cinema in the 60s and 70s. Using Metzger's 'la dolce vita' study of the latest period of his career, research is an excessive visual richness (emphasizing reflective skin, for example, emphasis), although the sexual integrity of the film seems disturbing by modern rules. The production values ​​are very beautiful and the performances are very humane (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are especially memorable), although they have a poor synchronization. Although focused on a specific future, the apparent local design of Enrico Sabbatini places the film in his time, and Piero Piccioni's "wah-wah" musical scores have become a cult element amongst the exploiters. In the end, CAMILLE 2000 is pleased, but the fans of the softcore erotic style of this director will not be disappointed. Next, Metzger was THE LICKERISH QUARTET (1970), which is why many play their best movie.
