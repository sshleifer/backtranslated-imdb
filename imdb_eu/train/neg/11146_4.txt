Well, no, really. It's not really a good movie, but I thought it was not so bad. I really do not feel the money of my rent, and it's sometimes what you can ask for. The plot is fine, nothing spectacular or new, the performance is pretty bad, but the cast is beautiful. Management is a good one, but the effects are horrible, especially in the case of male daughters, in the male film, it is a serious problem. The heads were pretty good, it's pretty good for me, but it was not so hot. After all, it's quite correct to watch the movie, I've never seen the worst movie I've ever seen, and if you get bored by the genre fan, look at it sometime. I saw it again. <br /> <br /> The horror geek bonus, Kane Hodder (in some Jason Vorhees) plays a man's wolf.
