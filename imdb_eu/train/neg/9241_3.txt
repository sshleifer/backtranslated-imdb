A few weeks ago, the German TV show "SAT1" published its "annual television event" - I apologize, but I've seen better things on TV this year. <br /> <br /> I did not. I thought a big part of the film, but I saw the commercial movie about two horrible movies I found out, since the Titanic and the Pearl Harbor were just as well-known as the "heroine" (if it can be called) and next to her "dear" - Pearl Harbor, anyone? Actually, the love story male version is Pearl Harbor's version and it was already poor! <br /> <br /> But I decided to see the garbage that I liked when watching movies and their models. The film begins with a physician who leaves his family asking him back to his wife to obtain a military strike on the end of the third Reich against Russia. He quickly moved forward to the spring of 1948: Germany lost its war and allies and Russia were captured by the country and both sought to eliminate the power of the world and their ideologies: capitalism against communism. Well, I know you know the story, the movie is not so worried and it literally flushes out in historical events. The film depicts the US government as an angel and completely excludes the contribution of other countries, especially in Britain, which is trying to help one country from one country to nearly a quarter. <br /> <br /> Rarities were also the historical remarks made by people as they said in the film, as the mother of the hero told her daughter, as German could answer with two games: "That's impossible!" Or Stalin (the director says that he plays a mustache with the actor and it resembles him), Russia says "Coca Cola" must stop in Germany. Yes, Stalin has never said such a thing. Or there is a US pilot, who learns about bread and tells everything about meat - please! In those times, burgers were invented. <br /> <br /> On a map that shows the airlines on multiple occasions, it seems pretty fun for me to get the maps from a laser printer - 48 in. Lucius Clay, the general idea of ​​being a general US general in Berlin, is a guy and grumpy and historically, for example, all the ideas that he liked flying, portrayed Phillip Turner, the interest of the main actor who carries love to other parties: there are not enough American African American soldiers in the movie, they were two of the whole movie! The relationship between the American soldiers and the German civilians was not allowed and the relationship between the US soldiers returned home. I do not mean there was no contact, but there was a couple that was almost married in this movie, which was not very unrealistic because of the death of the fake pilot CGI. yours! <br /> <br /> If not enough, the Americans in this movie spoke German accents, even though they were in Germany for a few months. When I look in America, I live for my whole life, and I have a small accent. It was remarkably bad for the baby to play - the children had faces on their faces: "Robot, plain and monotonous" and smiling. <br /> <br /> Everything that was moving in the whole movie slowed down from the beginning to the end, especially in the middle of the conversation with Pearl Harbor. Fortunately, the movie was successful: 8.97 million first episodes and 7.83 million in the second half of the second half, SAT1 received two consecutive victories in the overall market share and in the corresponding commercial group. But as I always think: the biggest bullfighter is the place where birds fly.
