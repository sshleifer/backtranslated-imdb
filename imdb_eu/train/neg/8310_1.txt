A large number of other conspiracy films that attack the US government and the armed forces (especially the army) from catastrophic floods. Everyone who has served time in the US military can see what is wrong with this movie. Uniforms, equipment, sets and manners are wrong. (And, of course, Senior Senior Officers are corrupt or completely idiotic criminals). A clear propaganda that has no attempt at objectivity. Most of the submitted theories are disproven in recent years. It is used in every place, rumor, and the Legend of the City of the Gulf. They are presented as all gospels. (Indeed, no one knows for sure why some veterinarians of GW are just as good as others and horses are healthy.) PS This is not new. War is NOT fun and I know the old World War I, Korean and Vietnamese, as well as serious illnesses. (And the government is responsible for all of them.) Such sensationalist films are not the problem!
