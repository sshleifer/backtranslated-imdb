As many say, it's a horrible movie from every aspect of the film. It's amazing how to get some well-known actors called on this project. <br /> <br /> Many people complained that they had filmed a 'cheap' video game. Yes, the video is shot, but it's not a "cheap" video. Bad lighting, white balance, shooting technique and edition. <br /> <br /> They used so much shooting and editing techniques as a mix of production. Hard-wearing, non-consistent lighting, the use of hand-made film (or Woody Allen), making edides (another technique of Allen), but poorly done, without a real goal. scenes are shameful; very amateur <br /> <br /> Simulated scene scenes were of no value at any level. <br /> <br /> Video printing mode is not for me. It's worth to see how bad it is to see.
