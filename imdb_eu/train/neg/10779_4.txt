I thought this movie was very inadequate. The director's right talent, especially Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (without mentioning four protagonists), are utterly wasted in an uncomfortable and middle-class story. inserted stereo characters. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is very annoying (her role is for great fidelity, less for mumbling). Crystal plays a similar hyperactive, neurotic, alter ego that is annoying. , apparently the project is completely bored. <br /> <br /> What is supposed to be a 'romantic comedy' is not among the main characters of love, still in chemistry, and comedy (it is possible). SPOILERS) well, the only moments of mood were in Cossack's Grosse Pointe's role and his relationship with Alan Arkin, the scriptwriter, of course, could not show any originality. (Spoilers) Azaria was reasonably funny as the Mexican lover and Walken's pretty funny turn-around arthouse-Maverick-Dogme type parody director-but these parts were very small screen time and instead we were treated (Spoilers) by Billy Crystal. His groin should be sniffed by a dog. Pure genius <br /> <br /> In order to be a fan of most of John Cusack's work, instead of just mentioning other fantastic pieces, I completely neglected the films with great ideas and at the same time exploring or practicing one of those who do not want to totally unwind, with the same old-fashioned old genres and sometimes even the "young movie" in the interior of humor. <br /> <br /> Very bad 4/10.
