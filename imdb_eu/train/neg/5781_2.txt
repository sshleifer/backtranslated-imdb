Roman Polanski has made many films, unexcused. His reputation bewilders me. There is nothing remarkable except for Chinatown (I have not seen 'Knife in water' or 'Tess'). The contribution of the film that ended with more than 20 years had finished; His work is shy, safe and sad (pianist, frantic, Oliver Twist, ninth gate, pirates). <br /> <br /> R children have to report the end of the establishment when they arrived. Luxurious production and a concept of 1968 "horror" is quite high (never show the baby). But this is not a horror of horror. Everything is art, as the line becomes as soon as it becomes clear (Um, for the last title we want to thank you), and in the light of day we see the end of a few days. He did not give me any interest. Regardless of this movie, the 1960s feminization version was completely dissolved. Farrow is worried, such as, helpless Waif / housewife. His fragility is excessive ... he gets angry at the end. There is no real idea ... think of it except the devil's mother. <br /> <br /> Dakota is hardly exploited due to its enormous power.
