The film had a great potential, unfortunately, due to weak / not-ending stories, as a result of the general lack of content and content / substance. It was one of the most obvious mistakes that Sean Connery, who was a Arab man, did not know how to pronounce her Arab name! This seems to be a flaw, but it seems that there is no effort to focus attention. The quality of the performance was evenly below the average. <br /> <br /> The tour of the plot at the end of the solitaire of saving the film; and a French song (I do not remember the title). In general, Sean Connery was a pretty bad movie.
