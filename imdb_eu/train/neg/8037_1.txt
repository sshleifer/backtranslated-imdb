Okay, a slasher movie. film slasher very, very stupid. <br /> <br /> Something in your stereotypical teenage home. We've seen an FBI agent Harry Dirty is too much time. "So what's the secret ... punks?" We have no plans for the 4 scenes with small cameras and the scene. "Oh, man, I'm sprinkling my head" ((the guy was a favorite part of my film)) Suddenly there is a preacher, seeing a link in the couch watching domestic movies, he dies. <br /> <br /> They have followed the murderer in the center of nothing, without police. Suddenly, she is in a church wearing a wedding dress. I swear I've never seen the slasher movie I've ever seen.
