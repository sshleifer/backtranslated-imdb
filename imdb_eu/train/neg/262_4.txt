Jamie Foxx is my favorite comic book. However, I feel that he had sold out his first big budget lead role. Foxx tracks the steps like Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple. All of them have seen that stereotypical producers who believe they are losing their capabilities, a black concept that makes beautiful crimes a fun concept. (See: Money Talks, Blue Strike). <br /> <br /> Well, I have laughed many times and I have continued to play funny comedians, but I would like to see these guys or Marlon Wayans Requiem to a Dream portrait. Or Living Color's Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans began performing performances of Spike Lee's Bamboozled satire.
