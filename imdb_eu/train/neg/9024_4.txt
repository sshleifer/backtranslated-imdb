A story that brings the character "Shinobi" to death automatically is one of those films that give a sense of emotion or gravity. Unfortunately, to make the audience really kill people, you need to develop their characters, otherwise you only have a series of randomized acts of violence. The problem is especially compounded when all the characters die. <br /> <br /> Okay, so you can not worry to make the characters look more memorable or enjoyable, at least you can. Do the reasons why you die credible, right? Laguia. Here is the war between the two ninja clans, because there is no reason to know why they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. However, as clearly it is evident, if the Emperor wishes to be dead, they still have no sense of mission. This is not stupidity ... that's just stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, well! There is no character development, and the plot does not offer fair reason. They die at least one cool action scene, right? Again, NO! In fact, many battles are not a struggle: when the movies spend so much time and effort, they suddenly die (and stoop it, in my opinion). "Lalala, I walk and I break my neck". THIS USEFUL CHARACTER In the middle of the movie, I threw my hands at the frustration of his behavior.
