I'm never a fan of Taiwan's film production in Korea, Hong Kong or even China. Efficiency quality has hardly been found in this film. I do not think I like the people I want, precisely because it is a fan of indie films. However, the movie shows a bad plot and slow pace. I lost the plot in the middle. The operation is definitely not improving. Rainie's performance is just like "excessive action", to be wonderful and pretty. It must be acknowledged, although it looks good. On the other hand, Isabella Leong has a more comfortable, sad, regrettable and highly respected character. In general, this movie is disappointing.
