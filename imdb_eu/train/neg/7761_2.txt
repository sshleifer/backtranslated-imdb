After a few ceasefire in the remote zoological island, there are social and heavy residents of the tiger island genetically engineered. Man, the bad "original" science-fiction channel has made bad films, but I think that this may be the worst now! This nasty written and directed "Jurassic Park" offers all the usual clich√©s (dying scientists think that people who die monsters are "offensive to loss", characters that are only dark and long corridors, whose only function is to kill the brain dead in a dead movie, etc. ), and, of course, there is no suspicion. Special effects are dreadful, because the heads of the nearby puppet with the beast of the title are quite bad, looking at puzzled dolls, but the dinosaur generated by computer generates CGI's "Dinosaurs Wander". By comparison, they are just awful. There are some gore, but most seem pretty persuasive. Oh, and finally the scene of the death of the scientist is one of the worst things I've seen in years. I can not laugh I was so bad! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, this is simply not bad. <br /> <br /> 2/10. <br /> <br /> O, and here is the curiosity for you, this film that was borrowed from the music fiction movie "Alien Hunter" of 2003, is much better than this gap.
