We are not the fairytale naked emperor. We can recognize the truth of what we see, being stupid, confessing, that this conception is incomprehensible in many respects, and it is clear, a great part of it without the real concept of pure intuition. <br /> <p> Well, of course, many people like things like that. I do not have. I prefer planned and thoughtful shows. And I also admit that the show is a bit like my taste and boredom ... these stories of love and drugs ... There are so many exciting soaps with lots of suspense (such as Dallas), but Twin Peaks can not catch my attention. I do not like the people except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
