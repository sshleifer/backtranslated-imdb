Before George Romero's definition of the Night of the Living genre, they were pretty good zombies. Without a doubt, the ancient boarding tables were much better. But aside from the social protocols, did these early zombies really like public cinema? According to this film, no doubt. <br /> <br /> The story is about an expedition in Cambodia, whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombies. One of the parties knows the secrets of themselves and places issues on building their own army. <br /> <br /> This movie is a love triangle with zombies. However, since it is a 30-piece movie, today's areas are like somnambulist than meat we are currently thinking. It seems harder than a mental control to make appetite insoluble. And, to be honest, 'rebellion' is also quite slow. The whole thing is very sad. Aside from the lack of fear, there will not be the greatest melodramatic theater. It seems that this could give 70 years of great entertainment. See if you need to see all the 'zombie' under the title, but otherwise I would recommend this.
