It was a dirty movie. The premise was fine, but at first it might have been confused with people of normal size (although Hercules' conclusions were better), I know that it would be bad. But the big part of the movie is interviewing. Inconsistency, stupid and stupid completely. I felt it was written by a Creative Level 9 teacher. Casper van Diem and other actors slap slam I want to follow this film. <br /> <br /> I have a bad movie and film (I love the vibration series), but this ... I do not recommend it. The thing is stupid and the conversation will be very bad and bad.
