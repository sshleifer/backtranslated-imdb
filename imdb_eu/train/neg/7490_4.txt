This movie was disappointing. It was not complete and it was sad. While Alec Baldwin wanted to present himself as Just Attorney Perfect (rather than referring to an executive producer), he never wished to show a defense adviser or had a challenge to the audience about how significant a country could do. it fell from that terrible path. <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody wants to defend the Nazi vision, but it was the origin of Nuremberg routes! Four hours just bashing against the Nazis .... c'mon! That has already been done! <br /> <br /> I really think that Alec Baldwin wanted to be a husband of Kim Bassinger. <br /> <br /> After finishing the movies, TNT showed the 1959 movie, Trail at Nuremberg. . The upper FAR film is.
