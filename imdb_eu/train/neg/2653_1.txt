I could not believe that this movie was horrible; I rarely see commercial television, but thought "Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching." I corrected. Everyone involved should be shy. <br /> <br /> I know that there are not many female roles of a certain age, but for that the script was so inadequate, stunning and shameless. He was surprised if he had ever begun to develop or that Mrs. Keaton could think she could make a silk bag in the ear of this sowing. There was no character at all, it was a little credible and very difficult. The plays seemed like exercises in BEGINNING class: I was terrified when I asked about it: "what did they think?". Very, very sad, that's it. Do not waste your time.
