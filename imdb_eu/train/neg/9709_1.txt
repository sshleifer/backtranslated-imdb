In the initial credits in 30 seconds, I thought it would be a bad movie, but I did not know how bad it was. After that, the actress who plays the evil Nazi scientist opens my mouth and my friends and I decided to reduce the volume of survival of the film, complete our own dialogue and double the DVD speed. But that did not help. We turned the halfway path halfway down. Now, I've had some very bad films, with the help and help of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie", but there are some questions that I can keep from Botsa. The hypnotized people most believing that zombies were most preoccupied by the movies most often rotted the skin. I think they were hypnotized in death, and then they were hypnotized their rot. Paste the real B-movie cult classics "Plan Nine From Outer Space".
