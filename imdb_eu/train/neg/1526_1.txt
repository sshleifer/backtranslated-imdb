Maybe I've seen worse than this movie, but I do not remember. Or maybe it blocked them. Who knows, if I have to undergo hypnotherapy, I will remember, at the same time, that the foreigners have kidnapped children or other traumas. If so, I would happily exchange the memories for watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I'd give him some credit for the film: he created an emotional response. I was really annoyed by the scenes that were broken by the movies and television programs, because they dampened this collaboration. I am afraid that I can not see films like Dr. Strangelove again, even though this film is immersed in the eyes of the mind.
