Based on previous positive reviews, we have seen the projection of this free night. I now know that filmmakers make positive reviews, because there is no way in which objective people have written. "Do you intend to become a classic cult?" He packed theaters, apparently with the production team's friends and family, only a few of us left for the first hour. The music was the most literal I ever heard in a music. ?? "Do not take the knot, honey, there's a wolf in the woods ...". Debi Mazar's eyes began to flutter. Fortunately, most of the melodies lasted a few lines. <br /> <br /> Now, the wolf in this story has to be charming and attractive. Instead, we get Neyzyncer Joey Fatone, who lives with his name, because he does not age well. He did not shake his additional 50 kilograms and a high-quality little school make-up and an unknown melody in detail. Seriously, this guy was in the group voice? The rest of the actors are semi-appropriate, but they can not write much. Do you know it is possible to write adults and children at the same time? See under "Pixar". <br /> <br /> In a positive sense, the virtual sets seemed so pleasing and well integrated with the actors. And it was not as offensive as "Crash."
