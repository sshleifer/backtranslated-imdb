This movie was a movie ... first of all, it could be a better question; The main character of Katelyn looked like his mother TV. <br /> <br /> Likewise, the land was strong. It was very topical and predictable. The end was very disappointing and cursive. (but I will tell all this). <br /> <br /> The bag cloth, however, was a scene that Katelyn (Jordan Hinson) was tired, but the girl could not shout! There was no tear down silent on the face, they were just some unbelievable jokes. is not a dynamic actor He gave it the same little dumb laugh as Lizzie Maguire (sp?) hill hill. That is when the movie was not so good. it seemed like acting. <br /> <br /> In a word: the movie was really bad! Any movie template in the 1990s was a kind of mix, everyone was doing it - just worse! b / t / w when I saw the nursery when I saw it). <br /> <br /> However, if you have 9 or less, you'd like it. ;)
