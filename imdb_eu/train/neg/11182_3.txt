Very stupid movie, stupid linens and references to the Jews. It was a serious movie but it could not be taken seriously. Films known to live ... In the wrong place during the wrong time. Kimberly Bassinger atrocities atrociously. Very robotic and very regiment. I have noticed Al Pacinos seems to be performing abilities. Troubleshooting, but it's not so bad that Pacinos Atlanta's horrible accent. Damage to a movie to control damage is required. OK my hats are bad, but they are not so bad in this movie. This movie has not been boring, but it's not boring. Usually a boring film is seen for the wrong reasons. This movie is not visible. I sat by this. On the plot, a bit better written, in the theater, perhaps better performing and delivering awesome templates, and even more baseball, could throw this thriller. What we are left with is a dull and stupid movie, that we were punishing Eli Wurman. All popular Jews are ashamed everywhere.
