I've seen recently in the 2009 Palm Springs International Film. This is the first feature film of the first feature film of the Dutch actress Monique van de Ven. According to my observation, it will be the last. So, I almost hate movies that are scattered all over the scene. This movie immediately breaks its head. When he starts, a young photographer who works in an international support organization and his girlfriends travel safely across Afghanistan-controlled Taliban, a conversation about their love, when a rocket stops in front of a truck. From Talliban rockets, five pistols, rifles, bracelets and grenades have been pulled out of the vehicle for five people. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) begins to take photographs of everything that has seen a rebel who catches a grenade killing his girlfriend. far from the far distance from the hand, they are not more than 50 meters away, but it still escapes. Her girlfriend is awakened and the moment of the killing of the grenade dies and she has won the award as an annual photographer. Every scene and situation in this movie is as ridiculous as opening. The following year, Bob will be awarded an assignment to National Geographic in a Dutch island, where he will meet with Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and his international drug addicts to smuggle drug smugglers. Avoid this movie. I gave him a 4.0 to 10.
