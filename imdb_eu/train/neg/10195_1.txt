The writer and director of this film, of course, does not know anything about cinema. I think it has been replaced and replaced by a DP monkey in this project, because the sight was darker or warmer than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story is horrible, the characters were very unique. Someone who made the movie for fans of poker and non-movie lovers was asking someone to cheat themselves (probably a writer / director). In this world there is no favorite poker fan this movie. Your money also hates this project. You can not get into playing with a casino and play hands to give you an experience of writing about poker. Keep your day job. And if playing poker, then you need to be injured.
