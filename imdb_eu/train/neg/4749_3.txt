This movie was so written and correct. I slept the movie for 30 minutes. The jokes of the movie are tidy and although it's interesting in some plot angles, it's too far and sometimes - it's ridiculous. If you are 11 or older you will forget to write the movie and you will be disappointed, but if you are 10 years old or younger, it is a movie that catches your attention and it will be surprised (and more likely) with stunts. and I wanted to be a warrior. The questionnaire on this movie was not very good, and the music was very disappointing, as did the tension, but it did not have any problems. 1-10 on the 10th scale (10 being superb, 1 being immensely) 4th play this movie 4. It's a great tale in a comedy, but with this type of movie, in some of its greatest settings, it was its performance. laughable When he posed some of his "fights", I began to laugh aloud. The worst thing about this movie is definitely correcting, for example, becoming an enemy of evil evil who is possessing people, how his voice becomes dark and evil, I think this was very stupid, and how Professor Wendy (Brenda Song) teachers at school They all had monks, it was pretty ridiculous. So totally sumamrize, depressing movies, but well 10 or at least.
