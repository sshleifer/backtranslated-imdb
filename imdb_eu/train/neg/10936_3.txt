I liked this movie, I really did. He has won good cast but is flat at the end. He tries hard to be fun in some places (more than a kitchen trying out), when he comes to others (someone cleans the scene in the yard, so he admits to join the group) and has some scenes, but very interesting. They are really just filler (all work scenes). And I did not fear the "villians", or I found it worthwhile to hate so much that they were annoying in childhood. <br /> <br /> I met people in the movie while playing the church ball. And I'm going to say that the referee works well, but in the end, I do not like all the people, or the recognition of the church ball. Maybe all of them were one-dimensional, maybe I would not care if the movies were more fun or generally seemed a bit more smooth. <br /> <br /> Kurt Hale and Halestorm's entertainment have made good movies, but it's not one of them.
