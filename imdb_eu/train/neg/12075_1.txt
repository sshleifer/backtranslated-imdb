This hamlet has never made one of the most boring episodes of MST3000. I am not a Shakespeare enthusiast, but I do not think work would be a slow and curious career. One of the hardest movies to find is also in the Hamlet list. As I said, this is pretty boring. It is in black and white; The slowdown is slow and the landscape is less. The actors are also dubbed, so it does not help. This is the MST 3000 I can not see sitting in a single, why does Hamlet say that his line can sleep.
