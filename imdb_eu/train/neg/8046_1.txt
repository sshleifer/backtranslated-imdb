No I do not think so! Well, in that case, everything you need to do is stay away from the "Distractions you want to know", since the tenth unnecessary post-vacuum is the value of "Scream" slasher completely free. The plot is very ridiculous; The characters are not bad enough; The gore factor is negligible and the whole thing is boring! As the title already emerges, this film is inspired by "I still know in the last summer" because the events are similar in scope and the motivations of the murderers are stupid. In any case, anyone who wants to steal ideas like "IKWYDLS" is a mystery to me. At least, the film will depend on the precious portraits of Jennifer Love Hewitt, while the girls of that garb not only have a headache, but they are not very attractive. A year before, his boyfriend, Beth Morgan, his lover and another four other college-based schools, is planning to go to Florentine on a holiday vacation on a spring vacation in the beach. The murderer has not made any movement all year long, but now he continues to move to Florencia, and he starts pushing it as a card that leaves the message holder behind. You really are not afraid to be an expert, it is a frightening mask that conceals the face you want to figure out right away and the efforts of bad writers are not ashamed. As the plot is so thin, most films do not play a major role, including flodio police police sub-lines and the mysterious FBI inspector, it seems to have a personal score. The murder is out of the screen (do not you hate it when it happens?), There's no T & A to enjoy, and it's better not to start the quality of conversations. With this kind of dizziness, you feel the good spirits of the 80's are well-off.
