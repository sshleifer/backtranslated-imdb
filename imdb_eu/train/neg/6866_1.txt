This film does little to the Strangers on a Train in the classroom or even, compared to the accident, although similar similarities, I would not really feel like one of them. Yancy Butler seemed like a character, I was scared to continue to see the writers and directors. <br /> <br /> I do not enjoy many movies for life; interest in promoting home harmony. I often cry, but this film protests aloud, I stopped standing up and, marching around the house, I was weeping, I usually returned to my favorite chair before torturing it. <br /> <br /> Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
