Simply, I'm not a western fan. And from the beginning to the end I never wanted to see, "My Darling Clementine", and I saw it all the way, for me too. Initially, it was a disturbing expectation. The play seemed to me crazy, the landscape (your standard dessert, horses and cowboy) was boring and time consuming and painful. However, when I got up and talked about it, it started to last for 20 minutes before it was easier for me. Focusing on cinematography, and John Ford's way of getting strangest things (and losing it with me) seems to be somewhat astonishing, it made it much more interesting. <br /> <br /> In the end, I can not say that I enjoyed enjoying the movie at the end. However, it was enough to sit down to set me up, which impressed me.
