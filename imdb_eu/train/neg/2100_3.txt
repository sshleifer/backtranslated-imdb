The first landing on the moon would be quite dramatic, without having to do anything about it. However, it seems that this documentary must be clearly discarded. She describes the risks associated with the moon module and Armstrong mentions a serious accident with the workout vehicle as the coaches and spacecraft need to do each other. Finally, the problem of computer alarms 1202 and 1201 found in the landing sequence (when the catastrophe occurs when the computer overcomes the problem) is simply a crew. And they must be called "thirty seconds," before thirty seconds of fuel remain exhausted before the abortion takes place before thirty seconds. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Apolo documentary or dramatization 11, go to "Earth to Earth" or a PBS documentary, but skip this.
