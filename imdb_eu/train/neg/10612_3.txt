Let's see a movie as an excellent premise: shoot with a block of writers, which will take lessons in tango. Hey and what better idea he gave to filmmakers who are interested in tango. Gosh I wanted a great talent. I'm both sarcastic. <br /> <br /> Money surprises me with this potentially zero type of money for cinema. If you're a fancied tango (I confirm that they do not judge by comments) or a hard-fellow member of Sally Potter fan club (?) There's no movie in this movie to see. Most of the movie is like a tanga, it's like absurd scenes, like a home renovated, or a wheelchair like a man who walks along the road <br /> <br /> Soon, the REGIONAL COURSE in Scotland has failed. The shorts he watches sits on a computer that is very sarcastic but very entertaining. Theo Robertson is bored by the shock of Hollywood's latest beat, crying as he gets a letter of condemnation from a movie company, he falls asleep by taking a bath and making soap in his body soap.
