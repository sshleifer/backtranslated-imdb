This scriptwriter does not try to re-create the "Exorcist", but put a blah-blah love story, instead of the patient. There is no substance in this film. It has been something special. But the blow shows everyone who does not care about people, very boring, when I saw that I wanted to leave the theater, but the stupid movies were expensive tickets, I had to endure the pain of torture that lasted forever. The screen is not relevant about what characters are talking about. <br /> <br /> They use computer graphics here, instead of wow me (I hate CGI, then I hate CGI), it further ruined the movie. Some people say that the film made a great show in the cinema as a "thought-provoking" and "slow-action" act in the theaters. What is so intelligent or thinking story basically? How about a pretty boy Eath Ledger as a priest, with an interest in love and a disobedience to his religion - a source of no inspirational inspiration - there are some jumbo jumbo jumbo about the "sin-eater" (originally called a movie called "sin-eater"), the concept of Lame but the movie "sin-eater" was taken seriously , it became a pathetic movie, and it was a bit dark and intelligent, yes, I know that in the Middle Ages it was really sinners, but that movie is cursed only. <br /> <br /> I did not direct anything at the film and I forgot to see why this film If I wanted to be a great horror movie, see Rosemary's Baby, Tenant, Naked Blood, Society, Cannibal Holocaust, Pin, Exorcist, Omen or Romero, "Dead Trilogy". The lack of dialogue is not similar to intelligent people, as the main film lovers believe (like Hulk, the same people as a movie movie is a movie masterpiece). If you're afraid of terrifying fear, see the Order. This movie seems like a church-like mountain race.
