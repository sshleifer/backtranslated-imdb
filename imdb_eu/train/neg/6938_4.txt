In this movie, the old Amitabh Bachchan is in love with a younger woman. He found himself in his restaurant. A younger woman, Tabu, flirts with her. He does not know what to do and he asks. The reaction to his invitation is very rare. It would be fun to think. <br /> <br /> And I'm angry about such movies. It was not so fun. Jokes and scripts were awesome! I really liked the jokes that only one server liked but several times they did it, even though it started to get bored. It was a strange relationship! Little girl in the head of an elderly woman! He was afraid! I know someone can be added to the boy, but this man has conversations for adults with his child. It did not make any sense. <br /> <br /> Tabu father is Paresh Rawal. Amitabh needs a hard time, but we all know that Paresh can not do that. So the last conversation, sitting around the table, would be fun too. <br /> <br /> I really like movies that are really fun. I think I will never see the movie again.
