Mostly, On Demand offers some horror movies and offers all the horror films, they have already seen each other and they already have the opinion. This is either, or Invinicible (I like Mark Wahlberg's films), and I did not see it, and I saw the movie in a mood, that is, many times I do not see films that I have already seen. One million times, that's a lot of movies, and I'm not interested in new movies, and guys, this movie made me regret. I will not put any spoilers, but I will tell you that only a few actors in this movie seem half good. The main girl, the one who kills all the murderer, seems very annoying to me, but it is convincing; Every day I would take it from the psyche, so it fits the shot, even if it's my hands. Blood is not very good, it's just some dying, or I can say "wounds", but you do not see much, and there is no part of the body to convince the props of the movie. At the end of the film, I asked the girlfriend to shut up the maid and, apart from being a member of the group, the pieces of 'recording' were not very interesting, but it was happening in the recording. I finish it if you want to see it, fit it.
