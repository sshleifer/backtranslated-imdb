I love the first movie "Azumi". I saw Mrs. Ueto on television appearances and I saw samurai and ninja tournaments that were reasonable. I should say that this movie was much weaker than I expected. <br /> <br /> When the movie was cast and "Azumi", the movie could have a better job. , but instead it was slow, divided into pieces, and bad, unconventional, and woody woodwork. <br /> <br /> When they made reference to the first film, they were quite free. and weak It is one of the best teams of "killers" in the title "Azumi". In "Azumi 2" it seems to be, in a way, less and less visible. <br /> <br /> That was not a complete loss. There were some great fighting scenes and the main characters. Unfortunately, the film suffers that Shusuke Kan and Yoshiaki Kawaji are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. These last two really played manga in the script, because the first one did not "get it completely."
