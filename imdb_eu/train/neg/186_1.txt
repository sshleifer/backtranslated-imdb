I did not know how to make fun of or disapprove of this condemnation of Canadian history, especially the confusion of the history of the Knights Police in Yukon. <br /> <br /> I will leave Pierre Berton, who says. historian, Dawson City, born and born in Yukon, and Klondike gold rush history, Klondike: The Great Golden Witch, 1896-1899, the author's challenge to express these stupid films: <br /> <br /> <br /> < An indeterminate limitation dominated by individual heroes with six guns continued in The Far Country, which is about a western cowboy in the United States - Wyoming this time: he introduced his cattle in a gold country. Photo is a nightmare of geographical disability, but is the real incongruity of the plot which has the main assumption? When there was a gold rush there was only one policeman mounted on every Canadian Yukon and could not do it unlawfully. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan arrive at the Yukon border, the cattle customs huts are empty. <br /> <br /> "Where is the accountant?" Brennan asks, "River, the problem with Chile," someone answered. It has a real hard work, that document. It has ten or twenty thousand square miles. Sometimes it does not arrive two or three months home. "<br /> <br /> True historical is the nearest state police station in the Yukon Territory during the golden age of the North American United States. The North Korean horseman was much longer than the Klondike strike First, the route was controlled by Yukon and made no sense of nonsense, they collected new habits, often more than just ridiculous adults, they did arbitrary laws in terms of river navigation, and if men did not return enough supplies or they seemed to be bad, Canadian real way , the communities established moral laws in Dawson, the Law of the Lord's Day was strictly observed, a punishment was punished on Sunday to cut off your wood, and deplorable young women arrested the sharp facial police officers who called them "performing a dramatic performance" in general, Age of dances suggest more than anything to reveal socks for laughing. <br /> <br /> In a similar community it was unthinkable. A wicked man from Tombston hung himself on his arm that a young war hero who was armed personally was trying to get out of it, to make a salad, to speak out loud. He left the evil man as a lamb but when he was protesting the police, he would let him know he was carrying a gun. "No man has ever taken the gun," said the American. "Well, I'm taking it," said the accountant, slowly, and he did it, without resistance. Many revolts were confiscated in Dawson, the police removed them as a dollar and bought them as souvenirs on the fireplace. <br /> <br /> In 1898, the drawing of that year, there. Was not a serious crime? just let a murder? Dawsonen. Skagway, a legal town run by Soap Smithe, was a contrast to the US side. But Dawson, a Soapy Smith from Skagway, is seen as illegal community in The Far Country? Is Gannon called the picture? easy to control. (A man from Smithe tried to cross the border in real life, confiscated all of his equipment and a sergeant from the police sent him a sergeant again). <br /> <br /> {The only film Mountie says} "Yes, I am a lawyer, I represent the law in Yukon territory, about fifty thousand square kilometers." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Then why not have any more?" <br /> <br /> "Yesterday it was wild. We did not expect to have spilled thousands of discharges. Now that you are, we will protect you." <br /> <br /> <br /> "When?" <br /> <br /> "At the beginning of May, there will be a position in Dawson." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "What happens between now and May? Will it be here to keep the order?" <br /> <br /> "Parts of time." <br /> <br /> "What's the weather around?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> he entered. It needs to be ruler "" <br /> <br /> Mountie leaves the movie and will not appear again in the image. His amazing suggestion? A marvelous American city, made up of tin-stars, swore a group of citizens living under British jurisprudence? allowed Of course, Jimmy Stewart wants to become a marshal; clearly fits the part. But Stewart plays the role of Loner, who cares for number 1, so another man is chosen to shoot. And that does. Others shoot. Even though Walter Brennan kicks off. Stewart eventually reluctantly concluded shooting all the filming with his shoot. He stays on the starry star and Gannon and the bully breaks each other together into the unavoidable western. <br /> <br /> North American food shop. The story goes through a rational belief. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Hollywood part of Canada, Pierre Berton, 1975.
