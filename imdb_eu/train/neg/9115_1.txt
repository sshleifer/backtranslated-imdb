The first thing that you ask me was really better. Check out Sarah M. G., a real, evil and cruel girl, check out Amy Adams has only one little fool. It's nothing! People do not adore. Secondly, Sebasti√°n was a sweet and hot film, now it's "baby's face". The story is not good, and I do not understand. Why did not they do this first, it's the beginning. Actors, nothing with the story. This is not cruel, this is being considered. The former has better actors, a better story and its average. I think that music is more satisfying in the first aim and music is better in the cruelest intentions 3. I have not seen the worst movie I have ever seen, but with the first one there is not much, very little.
