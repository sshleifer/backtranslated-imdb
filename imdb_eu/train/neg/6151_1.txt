... and, in any case, * as clean, logical and understandable as the image of a pessimistic image of the sumptuous cliches of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I am 27 years old and has been fighting for 16 years with a delusional phobia and paranoid hallucination. As the main character in the movie, I had a success as a result of logic: I had to think about the delusion of reality and what happened and what I do not know. In the end, I was really successful in medication, but I definitely fled the madness, I knew what was real and what was not. <br /> <br /> So, I can say that this movie is a scam. It overwhelms the story of the main character (his wife was not faithful, that is, he was bisexual, which is very important here), but above all shows a pleasant and educated view of schizophrenia. <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is a structure of mind, not a disease. Schizophrenic * is not a "normal man with illness". It is what people feel and feel in a different way: people, things, time, space, and personality are not strong. Feels that it can be bent, it can change, it can mutate, and may disappear. To face this, the schizophrenic inner world is very rich and imaginative and people do not expect "normal", but it is trapped there because it can not connect with most people, and its world is getting worse. extreme empty, in a pure illusion. <br /> <br /> This is very different from "cure", tear jerking shown in this movie. It would be terribly frightening. The non-main character should appear strange, curious and absurd, for example, in Lynch's "Eraserhead". Really, they should be terrifying, strange and raw, that is schizophrenia. It's not about * details. <br /> <br /> I mean, see "Eat naked", "Lost highway", read P.K. They see Dick's "Martian Time-Split" or "Ubik", DO "Cell", "Perfect Blue", "Dark City" or "American McGee's Alice" on your computer, and maybe you have a fuzzy idea. Do not miss a movie "feel good" with banal situations, characters and images, and stupid plots. It is the most accurate film about the "schizophrenic" "head" cell, its perspectives and internal coherence: violent, strange, confusing, and very scary. <br /> <br /> Once again, schizophrenia is not the details, it is not difficult and bad play. It jumps on your face and will not leave you: the walls fall, the people make them into strange enemies, you feel like going back, you are not sure what you are doing, you feel everything. ... strange, non-natural. Believe it is much more than what is depicted in so much soap melodrama
