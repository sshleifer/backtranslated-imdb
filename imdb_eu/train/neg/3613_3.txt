The movie is bad, but I have to give it to the main actor ... Forbes Francine. At least it was acting and personally I thought it was nice. It's bad that only appears in a different database movie. In addition, the film fills up with dreadful gores and fatal deaths. People get tired and lose 2 gallons! But if you want to see horror movies, I highly recommend this.
