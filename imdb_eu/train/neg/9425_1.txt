Has anyone edited the movie? Or is the note of the DVD that had thirty-thirty second vacancies in the scene? Okay, but I saw sleep for the first time. Then I slept for the second time and the third time. The plot is not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's close. Playing was not the worst thing I've seen ... but it's close. Production ... well, I can honestly say the worst thing ever in my life! It's not to be painful, but Unhinged can use more production. <br /> <br /> Do not think I'm a drummer of horror movies, or even do not enjoy this movie. I felt much more laughter than I was laughing in that movie. The terrible moments were not very bad, but they could be better with a budget quote. <br /> <br /> The characters seemed to be in a poorly developed or totally excluded way, the end of the tour was pretty bad and the exhibition was taken forever. without much revealing. <br /> <br /> I would recommend avoiding this movie. 1/10
