SEX WISH was actually released (less than ten minutes ago, ahem, 'extreme' footage) here in the UK's first boom video, and the Tabloid caused a storm in a teacup, he allegedly inspired a copycat murder case. Strangely enough, the paperwork under the rug carries such a great deal of concern over the most damn damages as FROZEN SCREAM and NIGHT OF THE DEMON, and the film has forgotten. I jumped into a DVD-RW and I gave the floor to the floor for the most part. Has not it been so politically correct as demented, did the Triple X take on Michael Winner's DEATH WISH (title as a toy type of inspiration?) With hardcore sex and already bad violence. Bubble bubble of the seventies. When you think you're not there, you can think again. Once you have finished SEX WISH, wash your eyes with the disinfectant cleaner and take a long double water to clean yourself. If any movie really deserves a "true movie, the only movie, the single movie", it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Highlights (or drops) - as a victim with the victim robbing the muscles of Harry Reems's robbery scene, as a young black couple forced to face the killer sword-murderer (Oscars won the academy had been completely credible the Academy he was crazy) man casts his worries and leads some harmful directions to overcome those who put their origin to light. Do not say that you did not warn. If you think thirty years ago as a place innocent in the world, SEX WISH will prove very badly.
