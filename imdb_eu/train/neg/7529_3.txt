Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this film is still one of the worst film ever made. Bruce Leek dies after falling as a helicopter after falling into the back of his neck as a ninja-knight, but he does not explain how he came from a helicopter, since he has a close-up scene. But there is a 200-foot helicopter in the air. Since then the nonsense is absurd, as something out of the ordinary comic books. Perhaps this idea is not so rotten, but it is not because of the fact that the film is based on a point of view. There are dozens of martial arts bombings, usually made in Hong Kong. Jean Claude van Dam has improved the genre of filmmakers who know how to use story telling stories in their films. Although Steven Seagal's films are better than 90 percent of martial arts filming in the 1970s and early 1980s. The film "Death of Game II" is included in the category of the film series, although Bruce Lee is there.
