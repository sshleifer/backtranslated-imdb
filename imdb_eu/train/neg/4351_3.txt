All generations believe that the last hours live. It's true for thousands of years. And such films are as follows. How did Orson Welles get to tell the ruin of the train? This is a documentary about Armageddon's biblical prophecies. What happened with what happened in the time that the Prophet tried to unite was dated and strives to be stupid. <br /> <br /> Those who decide again for "Mystery Deleted" but without much production value. People should be ashamed to participate in it. In short, the movie is dated, stupid, reactionary and useless. If you want a good laugh, but it's not enough to actually look.
