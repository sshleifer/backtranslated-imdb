Of course, great talents behind the team members worked in this movie, so do not look at the end credits, you will only resist them. No one was interested in watching this movie, only 3 in the theater; It happened two minutes after 10 minutes and they were lucky. "Monsters" Star Trek 2, the wrath of unemployed Wrath of Khan and alienated designs from alien space creatures. The film's creators, of course, did not want to cover tertiary movie monsters, so their lines were hired for non-learning actors, or in some cases they even talked a few words before filming. Some scenes are incredibly inadequate, just like what is happening to something happening. If you're in a hurry, if you're in a movie theater, and you're not over it, you're going to laugh at how horrifying or awful a movie is. Some impossible scenes will not be amazed, and Stephen Dorff expresses the feeling of anyone who views regularly the words 'Queen Mary of Curse'. If you need to watch this movie, do yourself one side and wait in a videoconference bargain. If there is justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be rented here.
