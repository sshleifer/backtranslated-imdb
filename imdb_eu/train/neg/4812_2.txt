I thought it was a strange horror movie with Orson Welles. Necromancy was certain, but it was a bit strange for her. The film is terribly lucky, because it is a small town satanist / witches agreement and a young woman trying to escape. Although the director strives to mix audiences, using the sequences of dreams and the sequences of dreams. In the end, there are too many unanswered questions. The worst thing is because the story is so confusing, it's hard to encourage any of the characters. It seems strange that Welles agreed that this film should be completed, especially since it did not need to be done. One day they will put a tape of outtakes and bloopers on this movie. That would be really fun!
