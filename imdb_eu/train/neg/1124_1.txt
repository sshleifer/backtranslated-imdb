It was the best opening film of the Festival because you were expecting to see an independent and passionate film. Archery to open hope. As the "movie" progressed slowly and advanced, my thoughts changed towards "movies": my butter of my crises was too much? Did the actor pay the director for this "movie"? Did I validate my ticket at the box office? Yes, dear reader. I watched this movie in the theater! It would be the only exception that I'm going to watch at a movie theater at home, you can go home. Are there any liberating values? Peter Lemongelli's "nerdy" standard university had its moments, especially in a dog collar. On the other hand, this "movie" was striving to be comedian towards a spiritual drama of the family's uplifter. One of those fronts was not achieved. Oh, and the girlfriend was really bad. I was the only one I found for his screenplay.
