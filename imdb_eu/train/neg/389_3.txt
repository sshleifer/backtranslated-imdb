I bet Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastor are negotiating in advance how many episodes they would appear. Is not Gene very invented to change with the female team and throw his sword? And Big Pussy? What the hell was "look at me, I'm rat!" double pass? All the Mafia of the Hunt is waiting for! The big names that were voted on have been monetized and they get a personalized output. Hmm ... This is not a reality, but it plays drama! Another show by Mark Burnett, "Survivor", was also raised by Johnny Fairplay as he left me when he had spent a short time before his child was born.
