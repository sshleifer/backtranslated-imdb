If this book maintains faith in the book, we can also assume that the author does not know about history. Mark Anthony was never killed by injuries he had ever encountered in battle. The death of cowardice killed himself, and then demanded the slave for him too. The slave chose to kill himself. The real story Mark Anthony was ashamed of the excellent value of the slave and decided to copy it. However, due to death, Mark Anthony was drunk and he failed to commit suicide. Cleopatra cried out and approached him in blood. The zaborrag was removed and later Anthony Mark died. If you like history, do not watch the movie. If you want a wonderful romantic, you will surely enjoy it!
