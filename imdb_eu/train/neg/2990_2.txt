Ohhh man! Now I'm doing it! Regarding the bad / bad horror films, this movie was in a class of itself. Real treasure! <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie was not originally in English. Okay, because the voice double was really excellent! Here's my favorite part of the dialog box (and much more came from this) ?? "I feel a little bit better. I thirst for thirst ...!" <br /> <br /> And what drama! Here is a summary of the role of interaction between military and science theater. <br /> <br /> Scene 1 ?? Scientist: "You can not do that, it will be a disaster!" - Military Officer: "Science is just a fiction" (afterwards, the entire scientist is planning a complete disaster). <br /> <br /> Scene 2 ?? Scientist: "Many people will kill you !!!" - Official military: "You do not know what you are doing." (it does and a lot of people die). <br /> <br /> Scene 3 ?? Scientist: "Do not do that? Everybody will die!" - Military Officer: "That's nonsense" (everybody dies) <br /> <br /> Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (You get the idea). <br /> <br /> If that was not enough? There were some scenes that appeared as an instant classic! In a scene, the military literally has 10 men with gun pointing at two weapons without a man. The leader cries out: "Take them out!" And the 10 army boys, one after another, must fight the gun and fist with the two opponents! Immediate classical! <br /> <br /> And do not worry. There was no attention to detail! This movie also featured a hip-upbeat soundtrack / synthesizer from the 80's! <br /> <br /> And trust me ?? I realize that this review can contain some spoilers, but there are so many epic goodies that I just notice on the surface. A movie of this caliber will appear every decade! The real movie you are watching is the experience! Maisulana! Wow!
