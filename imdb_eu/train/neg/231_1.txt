It is wrong to start with three women's groups, such as theatrical gum, endless cigarettes and candy caramel chocolate, "curling the story of the man's best". - Spoiler Alert = - = The character of Andei at the age of 14 was a student when he fell to his young organ (a teacher in an English school, believe it or not), rather than destroying his bitch. - hell 'girlfriend'. ... and then it's a key taken out of it: he forgives "his friend" and the son of the love of organ players and 3 women finished drinking more gin and cigar more began to burn blah blah blah. The character of the dandelions caramel chocolates in the street, a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Mercy
