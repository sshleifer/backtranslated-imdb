"The Leap Years" Catherine Lim is a novel adapted from Singapore's electronic novel, that is, the first Singapore novel to be sold on the Internet. The film was shot dead by a post-production calendar that was shot at the beginning of 2005, which was released at the end of 2005, but only three years later it will appear on February 29, 2008, for a visit. <br /> <br /> Before I say anything, I must first admit that I am not a fan of the love genre, so that I can only go back against that movie - I only saw that it was a production in Singapore, and that loan is available. in my neighborhood library. Here are two cents about the movie. <br /> <br /> Previously, we only say that with Qi Yu-wu KS and Wong Li-Lin, everyone seems to be eurasian. The interest of love is Eurasian (Ananda Everingham), and all three of Wong's friends are, Ewe, Eurasians. Is the stereotype that links this movie to the love of stereotypes and celebrations? Is it "more" than the usual Chinese (or whatever race you are Asian)? I do not know it seems like that. Likewise, all the films talk with a mystical mystical accent that does not exist "somewhere", no doubt in Singapore. The authority is like "half-perfect English", but there is no such thing as MTV Channel outside. The movie is like a dialog box that is forced and dumb, so it can not help with the lack of true blue for Singapore. <br /> <br /> It seems the screenwriter strives hard after stroking a line. one liner After twenty minutes, the movie begins with "nonsense" and plays the movie as its usual songwriter. <br /> <br /> I think I did not enjoy the movie It seems that the whole premise to have a love of 16 years old is incredible. <br /> <br /> There are other credible features in the film. I can not believe that KS (who plays Qi Yu-wu) may fall into one of Wong's girlfriends. And the scene that says the bride is "Before you move my head" is the use of television in series such as East Asian hundred (Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwan) ... <br /> <br /> So this 4 star movie. The value of the production is correct, and Wong Li-lin tries his best, but has not contributed any script. Joan Chen has participated in the 15-minute part of the film's Wong older and perhaps the best actress, but it's just his role as a camera. <br /> <br /> If you find the rental or rental of "Rent in Years", you might want to get a DVD player that you want to know, but you can lose it for people who do not enjoy the genre of love. .
