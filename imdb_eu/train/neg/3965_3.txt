I think here many comments need to be fake. Even if the movie is not necessarily bad, it is below the average. "Dark Footprints" is basically a Fantastic Film, with a premise that breaks your ghosts and bad emotions. The movie is already starting with two empty stories, which are not linked later. A couple loses their children and hangs on their beds. They go to a country house to escape from the past and guess ... the house is terrified, so to speak. From here, Dark Remains begins very slowly with moments of horrific moments (the first ghost appearances are nice and linear sequences are very good). OK, then ... The woman sees the ghost of her daughter, the ghosts of other people killed in accidents or suicides, the man tries to fix the secret houses of the past, the woman is nervous and there are strange neighbors. There is a lot in it, but the premise of being his emotions is pleasant, so you have the wait. There is no turning, a story of history that is mixed up, a curious neighbor, a totally boring prison, and a lot of "shutter" that reminds us of a photographic idea that we've thrown out of dead daughters. The ending is ridiculous, when the movie starts and ends, it's quite slow to play with some of the ghosts with slow piano and piano music, which look like a zombie movie, of course slow-down and piano music. <br /> <br /> Short for ... Restas Dark could have been a fantastic fantasy story if the script was not going anywhere and would not go anywhere. sensuous and contradictory in the basic atmosphere of the film. And next ... please do not use the abandoned prison again. This is so rough and in this case it does not make any sense. "Hey, there's not a horrible prison here, let them shoot." Many of Dark Remains's ingredients were blended.
