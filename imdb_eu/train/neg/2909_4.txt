It's like watching Tom Hanks to succeed Irish mogul as a bit of a Jimmy Stewart racer, it just does not work. I had a very hard time to accept it. I do not think that Tom can not do it by following his career from mouses and monsters, but for some reason, he caresses me. Maybe I'm a fan of the graphic novel and I'm going to play it like a fanboy (it's a cockroach less than a fanboy). In general, the movie fails for me. The rest of the parts I feel cold and I was disappointed. I expected a great crime movie in Bonnie's line and Clyde Mendes's heart was taken out of the story and left only bones. The things that we like in this color, however, is a unique cinematography for filling beautiful images. Paul Newman is a very good man and I have enjoyed the score, but Tom "the angel of death" Sullivan was completely flat.
