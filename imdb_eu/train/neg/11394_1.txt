Oh, crying, I have to be a LAMEST movie that I've seen all year long, and I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry that I've had a lot of fanciful John Cusack. Wherever Seattle Sleepless posts the same message, even though subtle levels, even older, Serendipity supplies it with a snack, then it will take you to your psyche for the next hour and a half by robbery. (And that's my life I never had an hour and a half again, thank you!). The main characters of this film are not enough for the four-year-old children's degree of maturity (I am well-known for their fourteen-year-old children ...), except Jeremy Piven, perhaps. The character of Kate Beckinsale, who was emotionally flush with the wind (literally) had a sensation of a game that was just 15 minutes or less before by my best friend and I was more angry than my belief. I told Rockstar more intelligence to my wife, and at least Rockstar characters were not half functional, as stupid people came up with this "Serendipitous" mess. It is annoying to see the protagonists who have no trace of their lives and feel the fate of fate and fate. Which is totally painful. I am sure that this movie will be the ones who do not want to make more complex life choices and who do not want to be chaotic messengers who live in a responsible way. After all, here are our heroes and heroes happy to live just the second time after the ruin and misfortune of other people's lives (their respective fianc√©es), just to mention other relatives and friends. <br /> <br />
