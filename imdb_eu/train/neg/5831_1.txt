This film is massively boring and apparent. It's just a moment when a sailor gives Mr Barney back (thinks the dinosaur does not go anywhere). The music is awkward, it is sad that Bjork, when he has so much beauty, has been taken to pretentious falsity of his art. The pumpkin's tea seemed like a ritual. The mythologies and cultures that have been lifted are not respected in this film. Not only from Japanese culture but from another filmmaker ... (be aware) "perfect art imitates life" at a moment - the crew of the ship finds a huge piece of sh * t. What is the viewer in the theater? There are some set pieces of heart and very compound --- then they prepare spoilers - I'm talking to Mr. BARNEY. <br /> <br /> The Emperor has no clothes! You have dismissed Mr. Barney! I saw the Jodorowsky's SANTO MENDEA. And your BS falcon breeze lifted. Your images have stolen your style and all the ART CATALOG. Now, HOLY MOUNTAIN has been released FINAL, we hope that the world's Art Board will be FINANCING YOUR FINANCING! Jodorowsky was poor when the Beatles lost a financial fight in the film Lennon / McCartney film. And while BTW is Jodorowsky Beatle - you're MONKEES! Simple college teachers like only cheap and soulless souls. And I'm a BTW filmmaker. If you want to make a reality movie, I will fight legally in a ring that defends Jodorowsky, defending the defense of robbery.
