I will continue to be a second person, after a few years of looking for films with the IMDb, in the Nacho film, The Abandoned was motivated to create an account and post a comment. This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The plot was in the corner of non-existence, and no "puzzle pieces" were ever added. The effect was flabbergastic and a shameful writing. It was completely beyond me for how the movie was protected and it was. The only grace I was able to present was an unhealthy and repetitive way of using the term Anastasia Hilea. (and excellent sound design) To be seen again or silent, I would be a difficult decision. I am desperate, I can not give 0 stars.
