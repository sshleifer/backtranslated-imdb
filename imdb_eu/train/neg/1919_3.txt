I have read the book several times and the movie has not been followed correctly. He could leave this slide after a movie. However, we have serious problems with the movie setting. Nobody mentioned that this movie and its base-based books are based on events that occurred in Nebraska. I live Nebraska. Based on this film I grew up in the supposed town. First, the smallest "small town" referred to as the area is the third largest city. About 50,000 inhabitants. It is a city between Grand Island Lincoln and Denver. Bad landscape for second film. Grand Island is in the valley of the Platte River. It is very flat with a few trees. I tried to watch this movie, but they were mad at seeing me so treated in my hometown. It was a real event. Large sections of the city were deleted. Books talk about cycling on the island of Mormon from the Fonner park. I think it's a 15 kilometer route if you do not mind the path.
