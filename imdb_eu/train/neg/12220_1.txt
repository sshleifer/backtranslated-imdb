This movie is much worse than most movies I've ever suffered, and I've had a lot to do with it. Absolute nonsense The conversation was terrifying and overwhelming; nonsensical plot; They drew a lot of "curly figures" drawn, a high school art project that focused on horror movie. 5/10 among the best female attractions; a long and boring sex scene that says women (forget about what you know about virgin, especially those with fake breasts); He tried hard to understand the speech of some of the characters; and they actually used the Killer Klowns masks in a scene of Outer Space masturbation, that is, the movie that was to save money was quite fun, but it's not. Veden Fell is a bad boy in film history. <br /> <br /> Fully forgotten.
