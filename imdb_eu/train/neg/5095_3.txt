This afternoon I was seated by this film, although I never had any personality or what happened to them, although the two protagonists, Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, were the main protagonists of their time film. He wanted to see this "something different", which is definitely. Both of them gave good performances, but they liked the characters. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole movie is a small Mexican town, almost identical to those who are unhappy (the doctor is, of course, the main exception). . Michèle Morgan never seen Philippe never see him who fell in love with him. <br /> <br /> He thinks he is based on a work by Jean-Paul Sartre. If Sartre's work could have something like this, it would be a very modest attempt to imitate the plague of Camus's Plague. He studied North African plague. <br /> <br /> A film well done but interesting.
