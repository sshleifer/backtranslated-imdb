He was mainly looking for the movie "Killer Tomatoes Attack", especially in badly assembled plays. The plot does not make sense, and the different characters come out of a picture without explanation. When you see this joking rumor, you get more feelings than other comments that caught you so accurately: making cheap and low-quality films easy to use and using the "parody" angle as an excuse for their quality and low quality. The only scene, the females pools are horrified by their tomatoes; How far can a "suspension of belief" or a parody?). The title is great, though. (* 1/2)
