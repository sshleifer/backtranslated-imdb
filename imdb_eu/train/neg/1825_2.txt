I do not know what. I could not laugh I had an open mind. I did not want to be about that. But I did not seriously laugh at this movie. It was not fun to me. In some parts, Ben Stiller and Jack Black seemed tough. You're putting together two very entertaining men does not mean that it will be a great comedy. There are no movies to do. This is one of them. Because jokes are old and the performance is just stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. At least order But I was not surprised. Sorry, I can not give anything less than two. And I give all this. <br /> <br /> 2/10
