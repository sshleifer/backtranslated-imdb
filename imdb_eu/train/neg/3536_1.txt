I do not think a movie I felt before. I loved two previous films by Guy Ritchie (I do not know Swept Away - it was a blind pussy), so I'm eager to see it. <br /> <br /> The comments were bad, and again, I still do not trust the press. It was more disturbing that there was an internet buzz, that is, it was a bit spicy, so I paid a little bit about my Â£ 4.80 yesterday afternoon. <br /> <br /> I will not try to try too. In order to explain this film, I did not think about what was going on, and sometime, honestly, I was standing up and I asked him not. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems Ritchie seems to fall into the main trap of his wife. It does not seem to be good enough to make plots, laughter, good and good conversations. characters It's almost like a list of movies that he wanted to rip almost, here are some of those I've noticed: <br /> <br /> Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, Common suspicions, Vanilla Sky ... <br /> <br /> I think the most frustrating two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were very good, and it was really a disturbing story and the editing / direction left. shot down <br /> <br /> So, for me, a big and big tooth fell.
