A typical flicker, limited to the viewer's appeal, with a weak story that justified Lanza's MGM contract. <br /> <br /> LastLiberal (mostly) as reported by a member, Grayson can not stop Lanza. With its camera out of the dark (and sometimes) breakthroughs. In addition, the scenes that were jointly performed together, the unnecessary habits and the smell of alcohol were overwhelming. After the second movie, "New Orleans's Toast", Grayson was usually quietly in the office of Louie B. Mayer, and did not he doubt that he would not work again with Lanza? periodically Mayer believed that Grayson was much more valuable to MGM to MGM, then Lanza, so Grayson's statement was stuck. Grayson continued to work with Howard Keel and many other highly-regarded (and profitable) musicians. Later, in order to compare Lanza and Keel in life, the answer was that there was no comparison between them, and working with Keel was good and the viewers seemed "real people".
