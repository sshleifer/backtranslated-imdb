I have seen this movie several times (and recently read the movie-based book) and whenever I see it, I want four champions. When Tom Hank's character D & D (Oops M & M) :) was dating people, he's "person, character just does not play" outside the game session. After three months after this and three therapies, all this is destroyed and its deceptions feed! These types of people give RPG a bad name. <br /> <br /> Also, if we cringe on a 'crisp love ballad' and a 'piano cat' with music and 'even stop', music is almost enough to put teeth on the edge!
