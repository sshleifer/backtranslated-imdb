Evil Aliens has a lot of debt with Bad Taste and Braindead with Peter Jackson. I have to admit that God never enjoys those films and that is why I say that. Director of Jake West does not inspire himself and chooses to steal it. It looks like it does. The most important Hollywood camera was James Cameron, who told me about foreign foreigners. The amount of blood and gore here is not fun, the film becomes tired. Maybe it would work like a short film. Poor actors, the direction is weak and the plot does not exist. I can see what the director was trying to do. but others have done much better than here. 4/10
