It's very rare to feel the need to write a review on this site, but this film is worth the money it's worth it, because it's worth the money. <br /> <br /> I felt a different attempt as part of the filmmakers to show that the Palestinian family is strong and reliable. We are discussing the sadness they feel about smashing, but movies are filmed and organized, that the politically oppressed population is Jewish Jewish populations. We do not see proof that it does not match the position of Palestinian adolescents. Other Palestinians are only in jail. I understand that there are restrictions, but the political constraints are designed to prevent peace. <br /> <br /> I got out of the movie, that the victim's mother was in the same place with himself and was completely closed. next to his fence, so to speak. He continued to see the pain of the parents of the break, and his words of anger and hope stopped the last meeting under control. In my view, the attitude of the Israelis to the root of the problem is realistic. Understanding of understanding and freedom without considering the Jewish population's demand for land acquisition. <br /> <br /> I gave this one for the mother's weaknesses, which would be normal. The admirable one in a documentary, however, considering impartiality, seems to be exploiting everything. Not bad changes, as regards the previous situation, and finally, not properly represented by the Palestinian people. In the end, it's a bad documentary and a bad movie. I acknowledge that it is part of the political situation, but the wrong directions are directed to me without taking into account the direction, even though it is confusing and sad.
