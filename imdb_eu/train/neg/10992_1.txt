Underground Comedy Movie, the worst train ever seen. Fortunately, I did not pay for this movie, and my friends agreed to see it again so horrible, but I had to prove how horrible it was. I love color comedy. At least I thought that would be and I would be entertained. But the performance was so scary that the "jokes" were very strange and the plots were not found. It might not have been a plot, so I can not resist this movie. The funny thing about a comedy is very sad: a man who plays an old woman with a man ... Bat Batman ... A man wearing a uniform baseball with a man with a bat. Ridiculous Simply, genius. The creators made me feel like I saw this movie, and they hysterically laughed at their friends. Perhaps, we did not understand the joke. Or the litter that has ever been made is the worst and has to be locked in a vault and it flows into the Arctic Ocean. <br/> <br /> P.S. Do not buy the movie!
