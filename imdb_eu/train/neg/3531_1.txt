This movie is now my breadth and it will compare all the other films ... for example, "was it stupid as far as Revolver?" I also went to the international advertising festival of Barcelona last night, last night, when a room full of more than 2000 people walked in a mysterious silence, after shaking 2 absurdities. Jason Stratham would be amazing if he had only one goal. In the first 10 minutes Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (Soprano's reputation) have given a proposal. That does not feel like it! Then there are some filming, and then it's raving bikini Rayiotta; Then there are some animations, Ray Liota's cough barefoot, shooting, gnashing of teeth, art house wanting to show Lies's body embarrassing all .... I do not know for sure what the reaction was ... 5 times no. Everyone in this movie thinks they're cheering more intelligent than Guy Ritchie is supposed to be in Yogi Bear. The lines of land could not be taken anywhere, but the sight was not in sight! This movie was the only way to make it worse if Madonna was the same.
