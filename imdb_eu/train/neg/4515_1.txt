The history of the "Piece is Cake" is compulsory, reviewing the worst history, through which only the untrue popularity of the (fictional) riders is challenged. In my mouth it left a very bad taste. <br /> <br /> In March 1989, "Flight Month", Roland Beamont wrote about the rejection of the RAF Fighter Command TV mini series. Some of his comments have to be repeated: <br /> <br /> "There was no sense of victory in some of the occasions I saw in some knobs, and all the mercy reflected in" Piece of "was reflected. Cake. "It would not be tolerable at any moment ... The atmosphere at that time was more similar to the rugby club, although it was more disciplined. There was no sense of" death or glory. "He emphasized the need to defend this country's training and now We did not say anything more or less. <br /> <br /> "There was no talk" courage "or" cowardice. People were either courageous or not, but they mostly did. But we knew fear, we ourselves and we met each other to control our own wickedness, and then we continued to work ... "... I did not feel a 'glory' but there was a sense of greatness, and it did not look like it with" Cake of the Cake " "Beamont, in his words," unlike the author, unlike the author. and the latest television series producer was at that time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Beamont served France as a brassiere between 87 and a BoB, Typhon and one of the main indicators ahead of Tempest, and a post-war pilot test. <br /> <br /> "Cake Piece" is a completely fake expression of the Fighter Command at that time. Full and complete dismay ...
