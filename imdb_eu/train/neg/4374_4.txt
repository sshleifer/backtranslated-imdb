<br /> <br /> The backdrop of the Virgin Mary is so curious and incomprehensible that it permits the viewer to be subjectively interpreted, by applying the meaning of it with explanations of sexual abuse and violence. If the feature of the film were essential, it would be a work of postmodern brilliance, of course, but it is not. <br /> <br /> Without too much soil summary, let's take a quick walk around the events. In the solarium, there is an orgy, that is, topless fights and diapers. A van picked up at a later stage is joining an orgasm but, unintentionally, a monster called "a dirty ninja" has continued. This monster anticipates pre-participative attacking one by one, capturing his seed and thus masturbating with someone's secret when he becomes enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> At last he made trips, and then it seems that a scene is already pregnant with a pregnant ninja. All this If you want to rent this movie, it's best if you do not speak Japanese and have no subtitles. With a drowsy Hollywood book on the population season, if you put it on your VCR, it will be equivalent to shock therapy. Certainly it will be something else.
