LOL! It's not a bad start. I thought it was original, but then I found that KING KONG was a remake clone in 1976. I've never seen KING KONG until 15 years. I saw this movie at 9 years old. You will enter into the fun music of the movie's record! Not having to mention Yetians's movie theme. This is the worst creature I have ever seen. At the same time, this film remains the hallmark of the B-movie. Outstanding events: "Take a relaxing and go to bed". "Put Yeti in your deposit and have the power of Yeti." I remember the movie MOVIE MACRABE organized by Elvira. There's a scene in reverse like King Kong! KING KONG takes the girl and builds it in the building, but in this movie she falls down the building and captures the girl (she falls)! That same year also was a clone of MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977) in Hong Kong. Matte scenes and lots of motorized body parts. This movie will make you laugh. As I said, KING KONG is just another clone. Evaluate PG violence, language, thematic items, and some scary scenes.
