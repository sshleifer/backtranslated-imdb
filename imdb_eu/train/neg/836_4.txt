TLK is a dedicated hobby for the film, the first landmark and the second one is the best success produced by Disney, this movie comes ... I am not encouraging now, with voice, discussing music, but that is it. There was not one Timon / Pumbaa screwloose in the TLK environment. It's not a bad thing, it does not add anything. Basically, the movie is a great joke ... and it keeps everything. Make the TLK3 authentic, Disney! There is a potential <br /> <br /> 4/10
