This is probably the best horror movie from Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> I can not finish because I do not know what happened. I will try my best anyway. There are types of lesbian vampires, but changes are made to the body, so it may be a character that supposedly represents any character or perhaps, or a vampire lesbian. <br /> <br /> Is it confusing? As it may seem, it's not horrible, a character does not make sense from the beginning. There are no plots, no character development, and random people will appear, talk a few lines and then disappear to avoid listening again. They are also zombies, though they may be enemies of vampires, but dreaming in dreams is also a kind of sequence in a mental hospital, so it might not have happened, and the hallucination of the main character. . <br /> <br /> Previous? Two lead teaser shirts will be shortened. The special effects are stubborn (like the fierce sequels that I like are incredibly slow and incorrect). Everyone has a stupid Canadian accent that adds to the general level of dizziness. <br /> <br /> Well rent price. We laughed when we laughed.
