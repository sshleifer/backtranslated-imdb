Oh, this movie was very bad. The girl who plays Jennifer is well, but I think that she is involved in the movie, because her body will not let it go by an ash at night, but because she thinks she is going to draw her agent in this piece of shit. . Faye Dunaway plays Mommy Dearest as he recovers and the end is completely stupid. I can not really recommend this film, although I was a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, I had a bit of references to his work (Ravens, a curse similar to Usher and buried alive). He would probably return if he knew this film in his grave.
