I'm going to watch a movie about Zonbi, I do not expect any Oscar-nominated performances, or I'm writing at The Godfather, but I'm hoping that the actors will not look at their cue cards and conversations at least. It seems that it does not write before 10 minutes. This movie was awful, I really got up and I left about 25 minutes and I went by and I saw Cold Creek Manor, which was not very good, but it seemed like Citizen Kane. On the positive side, the girls were very beautiful, that is, my seat was probably in the first 5 minutes; In fact, I left after the dead, but I did not have any interest. After that.
