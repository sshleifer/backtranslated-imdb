This fictional biography of Spike Leek, written and directed, is angry at times. <br /> <br /> Bleek is a scrap that ends underneath Gilliam (Denzell Washington). Underdog His problems are: a non-manager, a saxophone stage and two musicians playing music mattresses. The love of her life is her trumpet and music. The team manager, Giant, has a dangerous game, and the generous owner of the club proves to be an effective negotiator, and it will be best, but Bleek remains loyal as long as possible. He proves to dissolve as an artist but ironically manages to grow man. <br /> <br /> Bleek, Denzell Washington looks like a trumpet, with each arm in each arm. He is curious to have a special attention to his art, he distributes patience and love to the closest key to a distant distance. Fire is just missing. Wesley Snipes, the role he plays for Henderson playing saxophilia would be much more appropriate, but he would have to talk more orally about Lee's spellbound conversations. As a giant, Lee has trifecta with a brilliant performance to unite his writing and direction. When trying to make Loso, Ratso Rizzo tries to reflect with the daring but worthy Bleek's Joe Buck and joins Midnight Cowboy's "I walkin" here. In this case, you want to run this taxi with it. <br /> <br /> Lee's script is a bold argument, generous and herculean humiliation, with some clumsy parole conditionals from Lee. Down. There are sparkling sparkling scenes between the band members and rehearsals, and Bleek surpasses the enormous feeling, talkies of ad text, and conversations. Creating this ad is a visual style pretentious. Monitoring plans, zooming and pans are wasted and without significant scenes. They just walk. <br /> <br /> Blues Lee's love letter to jazz (the mint of remembrance from all sets of minds implicit) is a complete sense of passion and dexterity. They play better in the jazz film that under the Tavernier "Round Midnight" and Eastwood's "Bird". They show more side of the format, the pain behind, the Forrest Whitaker and the Dexter's real deal. Gordon. This Spike Lee Joint offers no buzz. The house is pretty bad.
