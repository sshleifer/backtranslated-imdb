This movie has been a great disappointment for me. I was waiting for this movie for a long time and I was a faithful follower of Chaos Comics until I was defeated. Not only half of the story was in the middle, but the information was changed. Lucifer's Father of Expertise is not a lie of the Father. He ruined his father, but he is not his father. The voices were not suited to the characters, and when you hear the voice of the dear character, the voice you hear in your head can never be translated. I can not remember everything about this movie. If you love the mom line Lady Death, do not see this movie. Just a comical justice is not done!
