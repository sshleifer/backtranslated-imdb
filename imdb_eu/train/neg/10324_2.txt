The Little Mosque is one of the most boring comedies I have ever seen. They are the easiest way to produce the most comedy program for CBCs among peasants with more than 85-year-old farmers in Saskatchewan. You can predict jokes and I can not believe the popular death. Shows are very similar, but I do not react by actors with some stereotyped dimensional characters, probably asked and requested by CBC. The spectacle that they could try to present as "debates" is very nice, less controversial than the boring comedy like CBC The Hour Has 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's Report.
