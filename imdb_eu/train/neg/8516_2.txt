Last week, I looked at Nielsen's weekly ratings and Veronica Mars, "the best show you do not supposedly". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It was sent twice and placed in 147 and 145. <br /> <br /> Translation: it is the lowest position in the national network ... and, therefore, it is worth it. I tried twice as quickly as I could in all press infrastructures, as "great spectacle", showing real life and such nonsense. Otherwise, reality was not. Veronica Mars is boring. It is as realistic as this, and it is worth it to abolish wealth. <br /> <br /> The only Mystery of CW was that he felt that his inaugural calendar should be the most watched show in memory after two years. commercial and artistic.
