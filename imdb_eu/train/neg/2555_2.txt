I have seen this movie as one of the horror movies. The length was not long enough to enter a good story. Also, the reception was a completely ridiculous way for parents to die. Does her mother die suddenly after a shower, after having passed an action image, and a father has shot a police officer? I can see for myself what the originality was, but it could be better. Likewise, he wanted to stop me so much as to stop it before he finished. After listening to Lucy's name and saying that he was 'Lucifer', I wanted to make it to her. Yes, it's interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look up the name. It's a male name. Must be given to a male character. In the end, the movie was bored and he could use a better plot.
