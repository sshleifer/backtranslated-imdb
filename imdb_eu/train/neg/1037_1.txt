It was a great excuse to make a nightmare showcase in Sundance because most indie filmmakers are a great example of what's wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is no cinematography art. . Having picked up a 16 mm camera and pointing it to someone, it's not a real movie. <br /> <br /> We should be lucky that the director does not pick someone's camera ... <br /> <br /> Second, the indie movie is about real people. There's nothing real in this film. None of the characters have reached the remote human being. <br /> <br /> What he considers to be an imagination of a writer's imagination that he wants to impress his friends, showing how "fresh and sharp." . <br /> <br /> Sorry, this is not a good word, or a good manager. <br /> <br /> On the left is the cover of a bad movie that reached to Sundance. It's really hard to remember that one of the best films presented ... <br /> <br /> I did not leave the respect for the Sundance brand anyhow.
