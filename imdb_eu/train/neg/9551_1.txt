This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I could travel through time and do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Discover the "War Games - Code" "movie" where it was shot 2) See the original WAR GAMES my current computer knowledge and the eyes of a 1983 preacher. 3) Entering the 80's of the pentagon and what you have learned and what to remember. 4) Renew WHOPPER, UNKNOWN CODE LOCATION, 5 minutes before the first day of filming. 5) Back to the present, a beer and Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones "memory" with my memory, especially the original display of "The Dead Code" 6. Make another beer and watch WARS GAMES 7) Happy 80 GOOD 80s next to a bad remake of a movie. <br /> <br /> 8) Did I forget Jar Jar to die? I do not know why I should travel to the future. Maybe I have to get into a hole in the worm.
