I have always said that some plays can not play the movie, and this is an excellent example. <br /> <br /> As a theater, this is a very fun and satanic catholic. Church, beard and central character, because such an arrogance is unreal, we need to retire from the natives, even when he begins to die of calamities (one of them admitted that he did not commit sin because he did not accept it), he feels that he is being sent directly to heaven. <br /> <br /> This is just a remote example that is considered as a reality, and it seems that the theater world is working. However, this bigger reality is hardly ever to work on the movie, and it's definitely not here. <br /> <br /> The director Marshall Brickman has made an excellent performance, but presenting all this nonsense realistically. fashion comedy becomes a tragedy and you remain with the feeling in your abdominal hole. <br /> <br /> Set up a play production, you will not be disappointed.
