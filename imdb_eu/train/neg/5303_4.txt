I really did not want to see this. Raj Kanawar's film seemed to be old, even though I started to look, I did not even think it was a filmmaker I thought. The only reason I got this was the look of Shahrukh Khan. I did not know what the film was about, I was sure it was just a fairy tale. So I imagined a love story between Shahrukh Khan and Divya Bharti that I thought was an important role I thought Rishi Kapoor plays his father or his uncle. And totally my excitement, Rishi Kapoor is really a hero! Divya, the young man, is romantic! I was sad to know that Shahruks did not have any substance at all but only in the second half of this idiotic film. <br /> <br /> Let's repeat the question: why would it be 17 years old? Old beautiful Divya falls 40-plus long long hair, hard, swollen like Rishi Kapoor? Rishi Kapoor should have been ashamed to take part; The only thing he did was to ridicule himself. A girl who could be logically younger than her daughter and transformed a girl to make things worse, acts like a teenager in the forties. In addition, to become pathetic, he plays a pop star ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br As long as he is convinced, he will not have any problems. In fact, the main actors have always been the opposite of young girls (Amitabh Bachchan-Sridevi, Mithun Chakraborty-Madhuri Dixit, Shahrukh Khan-Deepika, Salman Khan-Sneha Ullal) and the couple have done well. Also, I do not think anything about Rishi Kapoor, I believe that the actress is good, and Bobby's performance is still very well engraved in my heart, but it does not look like this in the movies, such as Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan or Aamir Khan today look for the day <br /> <br /> That was so desperate. Oh, and that's why every person actually watched the movie, Shahrukh Khan made a good debut. He made his small piece very well. Divya Bharti also made her debut. If you want to watch the movie, go in the second half. Personally, I would not do that too.
