The original Thunderbirds got a place in television history. He was still very dear - indeed, all the first 10 minutes of Wallace and Gromit (Wererabbit) Thunderbirds are a live lift, until the live streaming of the original sequence of Thunderbird 2 (if you do not). Do not believe it, get the movie, and then get a copy of the original passphrase for Thunderbird 2). <br /> <br /> This movie was a small attempt to make a movie for children: when it was original, children and adults also love and enjoy! Originally, Thunderbirds were rescued by people who were caught by mothers or technology at all times (or sometimes it was a criminal act). Thunderbirds endanger their lives and resources, the essence of heroism and satisfaction. There was little physical violence. Thunderbirds questioned imagination. How long would it be to build a Thunderbird 2? And do not overlook the power of recreation, with many Japanese astroboy cartoons with human robots that fascinate them. <br /> <br /> But this movie was a re-image of the original. This movie was found as a tune between Thunderbirds and Loony Tunes. I mean, that we imitate Anthony Edwards Brain as noisy in Porky Pig ????? Most of the actions are Kung Fu / Power Rangers. In fact, someone who was punished in a frying pan with funny sound effects. There was lack of technology that drew our imagination. Instead, children run, never using a plot of the original series (leaving the whole group on the bottom of the kids and Brain occupation). Then, when "Tinko linterrek lifted something, with The Hood" With The Hood, The Hood, "Hood Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", along with The Hood, raised something with The Hood. The "Hail" was "Silly, I'm your Uncle" sitting in the air with a voice in the air. It was the only Thunderbirds when he made his heart. <br /> <br /> Ron Cook was the only bright point that portrayed Parker. But Lady Penelope's actress was like a baby - HUH ???? <br /> <br /> And that is why we hate this movie. Undoubtedly, when someone takes on a famous hobby base and expects money to be seen by fans, then the fans give something like they expect - well, sorry, that's just WRONG! OK, so if you were doing a movie for children - well, the next video was distributed directly, where there are many. But do not pack anything known and change what's inside.
