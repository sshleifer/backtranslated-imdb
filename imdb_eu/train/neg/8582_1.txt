As part of the sequel to The Full Monty film about unemployed men in Sheffield, this movie is fake. <br /> <br /> She was born in Sheffield and, like someone who has a relationship with the city, I was very disappointed. this movie Someone said it was impossible in Oklahoma, and I almost completely shortened that. This seems to be a romantic view of North England over the US market. Probably, many Americans - and many Southern English - did not realize that Sheffield is a big city of half a million with sophisticated urban culture. In Giants, it was depicted as a tiny small town in a semi-rural town, the people of Sheffield drank well in the same old pub and the people's palace was the idea of ​​a party. lookalike This was a narrow and small community, not a metropolitan city. <br /> <br /> The actual counterparts of Sheffield's working class were generally not confidential and communicated together with grunts and shorts. dry notes They do not lie, and they certainly do not sing in the choir. <br /> <br /> Even in rural areas, in the Peak District neighborhood, they seemed strange to me. I got to know some places to go hiking, but some of the dark airspace scenery reminded me of Welsh. In fact, I finally saw credit in reference to Gwynedd (Wales). Peak District is a summer traveling and traveling by car. It is located between two big cities. It's not a wild type. <br /> <br /> A young woman could love love and love, Pete Postlethwaite was a rumor, and could be a male dream. The reasons for his lover never appeared. Man is not a partner or a family; they were vacant. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see the movie about unemployed Sheffielders would be astray. Sheffield was only one of the middle-class writers and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It was a fake giant! <br /> <br /> <br />
