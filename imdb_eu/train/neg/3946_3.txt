I have read a bit about reading Blaise Blaise, both comics and books, and for me it is really a heroine. Although it was not a fan of Quentin Tarantino, I would like to say that, a few years ago, he thought he was making his own movie: could he possibly end up with a good looking screen called Modesty? A few months ago I heard 'My Name Is Modesty' and I've checked the stars here and it was not surprising to know that the point was too high, because lovers tend to be difficult. If the heart does not work well. So I decided to see any movie that I did not read any reviews, and well, I finished watching it, and I'm shocked, sad, and yes, furious. She is sad and angry at more than one hour of my time, when she sees something so beautiful that makes Modesty Blaise a character that turns the viewer or movie fan into nothing. <br /> <br /> Almost everything seems sub-parse and non-professional about this movie, although I watched some actors who first performed in other films, so they can not be good, so I can not blame them. But script and direction ... my god, why do this type of garbage produce a little bit more than your television production average, but worse? I do not know the background of this movie and I really do not want to know it, but I can not ask how Tarantino's land loves modesty and how to say the correct face. this one He lost a lot of respect in my eyes. The director was not suitable for this job, and I can thank him for spoiling the night. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 stars and those stars to actors and technical quality. It was worse. The other seven boxes that are missing are not good at this movie. Well, fortunately, in other words, The Modesty Blaise Movie is going to have other serious outpourings than just stealing money from modest fans. Although people like Tarantino make decisions, I do not breathe.
