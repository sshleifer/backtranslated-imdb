First of all, there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah and other Prophetic Deeds. There's nothing wrong with making a movie like this to try to present the gospel message. So, with this film my doubts are either his sincerity or his wishes. As a Christian, although amillenialist, I think it will be a great tribulation and I believe that Christ would return as much. So this movie is not why I'm telling the movie that it's so small that it's dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> No, this movie is so low that I'm not valued for the honesty or the message, but rather the lack of production values, great screenwriting, the fault of the theater, and compelling FX. This movie is based on some 1950s scifi feeds. No, this movie is with Plan 9 Outerspace. This movie was not as good as it was, and probably got it by the date. <br /> <br /> Producers of the genus of the Apocalypse may learn to not make such a movie, but they have failed. The Left Behind Series, The Apocalypse series, and the Omega Code series failed because they learned about FX problems and appearance problems, but their scripts are still bad and their behavior is wood. <br /> </ p> <p> There are great Christian films with little budgets but this movie is not one of them. I'm surprised I did not ever turn on the MST3K crew.
