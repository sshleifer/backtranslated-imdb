While emphasizing on the four documentary sections on the need for reform of the drug law, these are not well developed, as they are currently illicit drugs. For this illness, the only solution that can be imagined is to prescribe those who are guilty of only those who are responsible for these medications. <br /> <br /> This program generally warns the viewer that seeing it is a drug war largely due to unnecessary exercise and loss of money, which is why it deserves some praise, in this documentary there is almost nothing left for illegal drugs since real problems that arise from all the opposing wars. The drug wizards would say, asking if they want to solve the drug war. For example, during the 80's, many crack cocaine-related high speed speeds that go up in the 1980's, this program does not in any way mention that the same law designed to crack cocaine cocaine is not enforced by drug dealers. their contracts and business organization in the jurisdictional affairs, forcing the business of dealing with violence. But instead of being seen as a major cause of violence by the law, it seems that drugs are blamed. This program has been ignored, however, by the prohibition of alcohol, the consequence of violence and the subsequent ban. <br /> <br /> This program will help the ridiculous stereotype of drug users forever. The first force to boost the drug war very expensive and very problematic. The fact that joining a happier and successful life than alcohol does not really touch. Excessive use of any drug may possibly cause personal problems, but all users do not exaggerate any medication, as all alcohol users are unlikely. <br /> <br /> From one's own point of view, whoever believes that adults do not have the right to go to jails, and the criminal justice systems have been harmed by the use of life-related drugs, especially the very arbitrary political reasons, but based on social and legitimate social policies Due to them. To completely ban users who have not so metaphorically decided to fight against the war, forget about it. There is not one of them here. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is not a category of anti-drug propaganda. Above all, XX. The history of the nineteenth century in the history of the United States is an interesting history of marijuana, LSD, heroin, cocaine, MDMA and Oxycontin. But there is an important focus on drug laws from some people's perspective, most of them (but not all) are very thought-provoking or well-informed, and they are committed to drug addiction mentality, especially in the case of drugs. other than marijuana. <br /> <br /> The criminal justice system, often life-threatening punishment is often hard, of course, is not the only answer or the answer to each of the social problems, but unfortunately it is an epidemic in this nation still unnamed disease, whose first symptoms are imaginative In the absence of social policy, in some drugs, men's lack of compassion, harm to people who use drugs that do not accept government, perhaps the apathy of the prison / police industry and human dignity. It is morally wrong for people to be kidnapped or imprisoned for reasons not very bad, and the arbitrary choice of drug groups does not have this reason. In this drug, this is the main problem. However, this program is not responsible. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, some of the neutrons in this program's history are drug-war mentality heartbeats without drug users stereotypes are pretty good and interesting and entertaining. In terms of drug policy, in the case of presenting non-radical approaches and people with drug problems, but also people who are happy and successful in getting drugs, it is quite disappointing. .
