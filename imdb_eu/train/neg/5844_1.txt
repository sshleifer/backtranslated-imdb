The worst thing I've ever seen in this movie is easy. And I do not mean in a good way. We wanted to see an unfortunate horror / thriller, so we chose one of the most sincere ones in the store. Once upon a time, we all expected the movie. And more! (or should I say it less?) <br /> <br /> The actors seem to read posters behind the camera. The special effects are created by placing the so-called red plastic in front of a plastic camera to give us the impression that we see through the eyes of murderers. And the script? Do not start the screenplay ... And, just as you thought it would be worse, the first part of the film was Oscar's material compared to the end. <br /> <BR> <BR> Remove me, this movie is hilarious if you enter into horror movies, but if you want a good movie, continue. This is not for you.
