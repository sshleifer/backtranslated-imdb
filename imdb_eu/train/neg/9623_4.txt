Ben Stiller does not react as much as he does. And it does very well. It depends on the comedy around it. There's Something About Mary, the stand-up hair scene only because Stiller maintains the straight face. When Mary's two other brides face up, she is a man without a room, but the scene is horny. <br /> <br /> Polly's Along. Stiller has many comedian talents surrounded by it. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman got the best lines, only a few. In other words, Hoffman relies on excessive body humor - he knows how to laugh when we are losing problems. The basketball scene is played by Hoffman (although it creates an opponent with a T-shirt that creates a smile through Stilling's reaction). However, it seems that everyone is acting in a bubble, there is little reaction. Hoffman and Stiller's characters could do much more with each other, much more. Aniston repeats his role as Rachael, but Stiller Ross is not. "With Joel Rachael's heart" is the stage. <br /> <br /> They're the numbers of Polly and that's what's wrong - it does not have a heart. You do not have a character error. We could have a deeper story with a bit of work, but eventually the failure of the movie is a bad writing. You should watch it appearing on TV on a slow night, but you will regret saving money.
