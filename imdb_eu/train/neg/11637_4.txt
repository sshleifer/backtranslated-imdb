Uwe Boll has made it impossible: create a game to adapt to the game, at least a game that is true; It has become an antisocial and aggressive content in a movie full of antisocial and aggressive content. Therefore, as an adaptation, it is a success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we're still dealing with Uwe Boll here, so do not expect the movie to really be really good. While at the moment, the "Postal" is very well dressed for its well-being and pain is often seated. <br /> <br /> In his field, the Postcard is a United States satire, just like twelve. child Bolle believes that the attack seems to be a linear proportion of the comedy value: the more offensive, fun, and more fun it is. This makes the taste a new high-level film that is very popular. Yes, some gag works, but it seems luck. The high points make the satire the director and the trucks and other vehicles give them a violent blow. The low points ... they do everything else ... <br /> <br /> After the start, the postcard becomes boring. Yes, there is a good joke about every 10 minutes in each point, but the rest are hordes of annoying characters and they follow each other for eternity. We have acted as a short film, but there is not enough content for more than 90 minutes (although it feels twice as long). There are beautiful ideas and nice essays, but endless action and endless endless scenes and reducers are lost, for their sake 4/10
