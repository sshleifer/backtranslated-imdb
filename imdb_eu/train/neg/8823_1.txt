This is the worst slashers I've ever seen. Believing is something to be seen. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Harry Standing and Phillip Standing, sitting when he sees him wearing his mother with his mother down the fireplace, dressed in Santa's dress. She puts the gifts under the tree, she eats cookies and milk, then raises her chimney. Phillip goes to bed, but Harry goes down to his mother wearing his mother's mother, who is pleasing to his mother. Then Harry runs up the stairs, breaks a snow balloon, captures a piece of glass and breaks his head. <br /> <br /> Then you will pass now. You see Harry Santa is a solitary man who sleeps in a suit and sees a small child through a binocular pair. He has two books. A children's book and bad children. He writes everything he does in these books. The guy is exploding. She also works at the Jolly Dream toy factory. Phillip has his brother's family and two children and lives in a nice house. <br /> <br /> When Harry learns how to take profits from his bosses, he collects all the toys and sends them to some children. . He then travels to a church and killed 4 people. Then he goes to another house and places them under the presents. They catch the kids, but they go back to bed. So Harry enters the room and kills his father and leaves. <br /> <br /> While he is walking around the house, the bunch of children find him and run him. Parents urge and prevent their children from going back to them to avoid hurting them. How do they know that Harry is a killer? Surely, you should be suspicious you never know who it may be. Harry gives gifts to children and his father pulls a blade switch in front of the kids. They do not know that he is a murderer. When Harry arrived at his brother's house, his brother spoke with him and Phillip fled. It only loses consciousness. Phillip has introduced Harry into his vans. Harry comes out awake. <br /> <br /> It's something I could not finish. You need to believe again to see it. <br /> <br /> Santa was a black thing for me. It is true, they saw that Santa was a white man. So why did they bring a black man? <br /> <br /> Jump and watch Gau Zulo and Santa Hilena in Gau Silueta. You'll get the money you deserve to see these two movies. It's better than this garbage stack! This movie gives me a star on 10.a. I'd like to give 0 stars to this movie.
