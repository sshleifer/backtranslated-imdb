You spend your time in another way, even if your homework was better than this movie. The jokes are not fun, Dr. Seus is not a funny rhyme. One afternoon is wasting. At first, 4-16 children laughed a bit at the beginning; Young people got bored with it and left Barbies and older people to play ps2 and get out of the net. He left my wife and made plates. So I just finished it. I saw the worst "baby" movie. If you want to see a fun movie by Shrek 2, the movie is fun for kids and parents. YOU CAN KNOW HIDE It's not fun, it's not nice, it's a good thing about this makeup on the cat, and you can see it on the label disc.
