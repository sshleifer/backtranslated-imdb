Think of a darker version of one of these little shows like "Power Rangers", and since 1990 you have the "Robot Jox" movie. The movie you fight with giant robots, enters two men and everyone gets out of it. Robots are gigantic and they seem somewhat better in their shows, especially since the colors are less, although this movie is not good, it's not bad. I remember fighting with two robots, this ends up bad and the final showdown. There is a plot in the way a tractor appears, but eventually the image does not take a picture that will fit you all the time. Fights themselves appear like giant toys, but it's still pretty fun. This movie will start with other similar films, such as giant robots and championships. So it's worth seeing more than once, but probably more than that.
