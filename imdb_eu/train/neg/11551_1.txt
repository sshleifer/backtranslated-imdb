Seriously, there's no point in the party. Randolph Scott, who lived in love with her lover Cary Grant for twelve years, is a homosexual wardrobe with most of her wood and a boring paper at least. At 57, it was clearly too old for these romantic roles, although it does not matter so much here, because Gail Russell is much older than 31, and is so ugly because of his chronic alcoholism and sting. Lee Marvin plays his usual role, but it's not enough to save that garbage. Thank God that they do not put Westerners, old-fashioned old racist films glamorous and murderous, <br /> <br /> 0/10.
