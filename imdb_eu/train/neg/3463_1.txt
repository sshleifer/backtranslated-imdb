I saw the movie tonight and I can honestly say one of the worst films ever seen. The play is correct, but the plot is totally ridiculous. Does the murderer have been born as a result of "energy" for the movie and if the movie is burned he will die? How incredible is that? The characters were little developed to say at least ... for example, man refers to "Is not it because you can not get your movie because your mother can not?" So, should we go with that? We did not know the daughter's movie until half. The film did not take any responsibility, we did not know anything about Ringwald's character who was alive but about the survivors, but when he was dead, Raffy wanted to be a director like his mother. . It's not really scuba diving to find out who is. Because they were things, they were like killing. The whole plot was very weak to my liking and I was very disappointed. Those who have enjoyed this piece of cover, of course, have to learn about one or two things about cinema. I can not believe anyone would have liked to appear or work on this photo. It was not fun, it was not terrifying and the whole film was voted. I predicted what would happen to each scene, but I did not believe you with me. It's a shame and I feel sorry for an hour and a half lost. 1/10.
