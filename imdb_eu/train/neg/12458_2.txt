The premise of this film is very simple and obvious, a single millionaire Texas Texas oil smoker and whiskey would understand a problem if someone cried out in the proverbial car park. In short: if oil business is happening with Government (or Gummint prefers), Gummint is confronted with middle-aged despots, and the CIA is a stunning pool that makes children's (insert word) voluntarily prepared. to put their way to the next line. The only people that have been made are good, Mr. Like Clooney ("Bob"). Oh, and terrorism is the result of the poverty that globalization generates when the evil multinational seeks a tasty purchase of the world. This adapts to profiles that are really well-adapted to 9/11 authors. <br /> <br /> Système of semi-truths and simple Hollywood holograms of politics give rise to the rudeness of this story line. turn around and rush through the dark sketches of their vanities when the viewer is left alone: ​​<br /> <br /> 1. "the director" (good joke) never stopped having a camera <br /> <br /> 2. People like Clooney and Hurt will know how to play, but they surely do not know how to select a script. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie that is in charge of corruption and big business in 3, see Claude Chabrol's "L'ivresse du pouvoir", which is a wonderful, fun and superb view. <br /> <br /> Piffle senseless and crazy, extended to the afternoon's prolongation.
