In a few months, I was debating a poster with another IMDb about this movie (Hey, Kmadden). The poster stressed that if I'd let the 'Flushed Away', I'd like it. According to this argument, I agreed to watch the movie. 'Flushed Away' has good intentions (at least partly from Aardman), but it does not have the strength to get it together. His best asset is Rita's sewer / ship captain, Kate Winselt (IMO) must have been the star of Roddy's (Hugh Jackman) film. Rita is cool, tough, and interesting, while Roddy spends a lot of time on his screen while sniveling. <br /> <br /> The most worrying about the "FA" is one thing that is not fun to start joking. along with. When Roddy plays, he assures that the movie will hit five times immediately. "My name is Shocky," says Rita brothers, and then Roddy electrocutes at least three times. The pain that causes us is low-cost tolerance. <br/> <br /> I do not lose much time for Karenberg's clerical tendencies towards Pixar (a similar movie is a coincidence, it's five radios). but I'm going to say I'm disappointed with Aardman. They can (and have) made so much better. Try the next time, boys.
