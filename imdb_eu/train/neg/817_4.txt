"You will not shoot these little creatures. First of all, they do not harm you. Second, they can be radioactive." Oh, free budget fifty-five science fiction? However, despite such strange jewelry, Superman and Mole-Men is quite uninspiring even with a lean muscle duration of 58 minutes. It's more than cheap (Superman's flight image is very short for a few animated frames) and it's very sad with it, albeit a surprisingly altruistic post? Mole male dumbs, skulls and skinny skins from under-ground animal oil, and skins of skins, which look less than Mr. Mxyzptl's, are not evil, they just misunderstood and George Reeves's "Man of Steel tries" Jeff Corey- to avoid killing a local little town mafia. The current counterweight of paranoia is perhaps interesting, but it only recommends good intentions.
