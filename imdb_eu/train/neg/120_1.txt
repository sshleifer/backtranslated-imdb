When I first saw this movie, I quickly saw the actress performing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrait of Lucy is awesome. Lucille Ball was an amazing comic that was amazing. It's horrible to think about a movie like Lucille Ball. I can not believe that all the actors in the world that could have a better Lucy actress decided to go to Rachel York. In other roles, it can be a good actress, but the role of Lucille Ball is hard. It's hard to find someone who looks like Lucille Ball, but at least they can find something like a look and talent. Lucy's Portrait of York, if you realized that I love Lucy's chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, it's nothing like expression, voice or movement. <br /> <br /> To finish off, Danny Pino is playing Desi Arnaz. Pino is not playing Ricky. He is a little boy and a magician, his accent is real and again, his act is incredible. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar, they were not as bad as Lucy and Ricky's characters. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, it's really bad casting and story. If you want to understand real life in Lucille Ball, I recommend you visit Lucy and Desi's A & E Biography, reading Lucille Ball or PBS's American Masters: Finding Lucy's book. If you would like to see the Dokudrama, "Laughter before" would be a better option. Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz casting are much better than "laughter before". At least one similar aspect is nothing.
