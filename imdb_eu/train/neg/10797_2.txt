Shaq had a genius. His name was Kazaam, and his coins were crisp, bad lines were the stupid boy, his father stupid, bad actin, bad smelting, special effects bad next? This movie is Prolly living in a boombox that is not worth $ 20. A lamp does not act like a kramp like a pain ... <br /> <br /> Do you have the stupid pace that you can? Awesome movies with incredible effects. Oh, and his confused hell. I will not stay Let's say, what's in the "so bad, funny" category. Look once with friends and laugh. But do not expect anything spectacular.
