I rented this DVD and watched it for the first time on the DVD, without review. So, after 15 minutes I've seen something wrong in this movie; It's wonderful! I mean, it seemed terribly and frightening on the airstrips! <br /> <br /> I think Eli Roth (Mr. Director), all the characters in this movie are stupid, the movie would be fun ... (So stupid, it's fun ... BUT!) Seeing horror comedies better He should learn, for example: "Fear of night," "Lost children," and "The survival of the dead!" These are fun! <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is registered to www.IMDb.com, so I do not think of lies. <br /> <br /> I've decided to watch the movie for the second time> AAARGH! <and make notes for my "review" partial to show how stupid cinema. "Resident Evil" (fear) or "Dude, Where's My Car?" (comedy) I can see it again and still enjoy it! But that ... <br /> <br /> <br /> How bad can a script and director be ??? This is bad Here are the terrifying scenes in chronological order: <br /> <br /> At first, we will see the scene in Henry, his mouth hanging on the floor, in a tongue hanging on his mouth and staring at the dead. dead! <br /> <br /> The movie does not explain about long-haired hair that wants to get rid of people. <br /> <br /> And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question ("What's wrong) in the woods?") is "nothing". The script warns the bearded man about the "suspension" of forests. <br /> <br /> Then, the "intelligent" of the 5 packages, Bert, almost flares us on how to start a forest fire. . He now knows the infected Henry and asks for help and, from now on, he wants to break the record called "F-word". Harry begins to feel angry that Henry looks bad. Bert: "Do not shoot!" (He wants to forget: "... my BB gun!") <br /> <br /> Bert heads back to the cabin but what? Marcy and Jeff knew their sex, but now they suddenly decide to go for a walk! When Marcy initiated the untimely camp before the change (to make a clear change?) Bert does not talk about Henry, Henry, because he thinks he's murdered by BB with his gun. <br /> <br /> Later, when the Five Stupids sit down around their camp, another doggie will appear with their dog. (Perhaps, what is the warning about this? What is weird about ... and their dogs!). They let them sit down because it has a great bag with cannabis. (Your brains are completely poisoned! It's not surprising why they're so DUMB!) This is the last time we'll see this unforgettable character ... alive! <br /> <br /> Henry appears in his cabin ((NOTE: All the time he was lying down from their cabin a few meters), worse, almost like a zombie, covered with dread! He says he needs a doctor, but the young Einstein refuses to sell The poor man enters his unlocked truck and, of course, it also has an ignition key. Henry almost seems to have enough intelligence to get away from hell, but starts bleeding on the dashboard, in the seats and in the windows, five Fantastic running, armed BB Gun, knife, baseball One (did you ever try to play baseball in the middle of the woods), a poker and (insecticide?) spray can, ready to be solitary and completely patient. (Quick script!) Bert has been killed by automobiles in his BB Gun With just one shot, that is, Eli Roth's head is only possible. "What else do I need?" Bert praises his defense. Jeff and Paulek try to eliminate Henry's bat and poker but He and the truck windows fail. Henry walks into the dumbfoundations: "He will come to us!" (Thank you for this information, wide-ranging, I see that! But I do not think it would do any harm!) Marcy tosses her eyes, Henry runs away! And our "hero" Paul keeps the burning fire of the burning fire of Henry's arm, which burned them while they were in the cabin! (Where did all this wisdom go? I think that cannabis has begun to think about him! :-) Henry turns the human lantern and escapes, shouting. The next day, they're led by Bert and Jeff. mechanical And Marcy only decides "help", in the woods, Paul goes back with Karen ... Is not he saying it from the idiot? Marcy could have been with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert already "offered help"! <br /> <br /> Now, when I'm in my comments, I'd jump like Marcy could see how CANOE looks like a giant and winding fish! How did the canoe get? Does he know where he will go! However, he goes to the river bank and finds a seemingly abandoned booth that looks great and apparently, and as in most horror films, he walks through the cabin: "Hello? Someone there?" Bert suddenly appears behind a piece of furniture and in his opinion (and I am at the beginning). And Jeff is also. How did they arrive Did they swim across the river ??? Do you see the script is over-ridden !? <br /> <br /> Winston's deputy meets Paule in the cabin. Somehow, he does not notice blood in their truck. It's about 35 minutes to watch and I decided to stop torturing myself and the DVD appeared. (Before I get my eyes! ... Now, that's funny!) <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, do yourself your favor and see "Fear of night", "Lost children" or "Return of life to the dead ". Then you will see that things are more fun than that. Even though "Toxic Avenger 2" is also a bad movie, it's a more fun way than "Cabin Fever".
