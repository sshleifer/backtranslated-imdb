This is strictly a review of the rider shown in the DVD section. <br /> <br /> 1981's television came out of my life, so I never had a sequence or part of it - that is, I am in front of the nostalgic moon that appears for most of the Moon. <br /> <br /> (Possible disaster warning) <br /> <br /> The pilot of the moon is known as the basic "wildlife". There, a "man-made bloody" man manipulates a woman who manages herself. to realize what he really wants and what he needs. The premises based on the "nonsense" of the script should look like old around 1950. In addition, the writing is incorrectly written. Just like where Maddie wears up his furniture, instead of sharply shooting his nurse, he proved himself to be the help of men. <br /> <br /> I often feel that Susan Faludi is seeing abuse as an unexpected male conspiracy, but I am in this particular case with all of this. Moonlighting has sealed BACKLASH. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in any case, this DVD is needed for all the serious fans of the Bruce Willis series: apart from the pilot episode, Willis is a screen test that has won. Both features show how far Willis developed 'actor's ability between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country). Amazing! <br /> <br /> Rating (and I'm a Bruce Willis fan): 10 out of 10
