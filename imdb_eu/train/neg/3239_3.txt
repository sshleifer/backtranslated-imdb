Oh, the malicious series "Guinea Pig" ... I have to say honestly that I have been totally disappointed in the series ("It does not die anymore", "What is entering the little mermaid" and "Exceptions of" Blood and flesh of meat, "Blood" and they are not good at all ...), but "Devil's Experiment" is a mere blow. There's nothing really realistic about looking at the realistic look of a loop piercing (or maybe the opposite, as you might see), the victim does not really no matter what happens and barely blinks or makes rumors that "torture" is terribly (sometimes "hilarious"), "Flower of Flesh and Blood" is a violent and penetrating representation of the false material "snuff", but this film is realistically It also falls: Japanese people are fortunate enough to limit themselves, and in the last two decades they've been a long way in bringing the crown to "extreme" shooting, but "Devil's Experiment" does not mean it's worth a look, If there is no other reason to do it, but I can give it a very generous 3/10 movie, which is only through the needle through the eye. scene ...
