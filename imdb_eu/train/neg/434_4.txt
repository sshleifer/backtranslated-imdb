His first claim, his wishes are always artificial, is completely false. <br /> <br /> When he discarded Jehovah's Hope his documentary made films? or something like that: it is time for anyone to get on their own. Far away, even though it is much more intelligent than Paris Hilton (I know it's not very difficult) Cizek flushes to his mouth, just like another. He combines two of his professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Two well-known fields are designed to create the theory of b * lls *** with no real-world theories, to begin with, or to conclude, almost random concepts, using a semantic process in poorly used English. Mum can only love the table. For example: three Marx brothers are the main brothers, so that the ideas, the ego and the supersaturation link three "levels" to "great" ideas. I am surprised that the clip from "Snowhite" has not played an analogy between seven dwarves and Gahannah seven (Muslim hell). It's like the premise of "The Number 23" in Schumacher: you can play the numbers long enough, and you can cockamamy any theory you want, even if the ancient Greeks are bound by Princess Di's death. <br /> <br /> However, there is an entertainment element for TPGTC: sweat is a terrifying sweat as a pig. Why watch "Cuckoo's Nest" or any other madhouse drama Zizek over 2 hours? It's like watching railroad fun fun. Certainly, it's pretty funny one or two times. <br /> <br /> I have always been mystified to try to make films in a brilliant social science intellectual. This thought given by movie idiots such as "Birds", therefore, so much credit, is surely laughing at his grave fears. Is it true that most films have no intellectual value, and some of the minds do not have to have a philosopher to draw and understand a philosophy from a map? unless you are stupid. Ziza sees layers and layers of meaning in empty movies. Drugs have to be known and cheap in Slovenia these days ... <br /> <br /> When Zizek showed the showers of "Psycho" showers at the bathtubs I thought that he was saying something about galactic black holes; how the stars escape from their lives, as the bath hole hides Janet Leigh's blood. Or maybe he could tell the holes in Leigh's vagina, as he poured blood away (as in the menstruation), which indicates "irin light (Zizekian) irony". According to this word, if the true irony of Hitchcock put everything he thought about all the scenes (and the script), his films would not be often void or scarce. It is improvisation around the "deep and hidden meanings" of analog points of bathtubs. And when you add the original terminology of Philosophy and Philosophy of Zizek, if you add these terms to a similar analogy above the wedding ornaments, you will find a fascinating sweater that can surprise you, that is, easily impressionable and joking. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Do not laugh ... Hitchcock or the writer "Psycho" would not even be entertained in this dreadful way that Perkins was enjoying his work well, cleaning blood stains. scene Speak a word about putting oneself in their mouths, but in the wrong context for the director to "say". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I like the early thinkings of Tarkovsky's "Solaris", but then he washes his good and strange Impression by dragging "anti-feminism" and another nonsense theoretically <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br "I want to play it all day!" Logic has its own rules, and it should not be supposed to be raped, at least not publicly, by its favorites. It seems that logic, proof, common sense and reason seem to be an enemy or a gamble toy; The concepts to avoid, the concept of adapting to the end purpose or just the concepts to be annihilated. Zizek is a hippie LSD-tripped and all her favorite movies are her personal "2001". <br /> <br /> Zizek is one of the two main reasons that directs more than Direct, whose films often include something like LACK intelligence, Hitchcock and Lynch, if it reduces its credibility. I was surprised that De Pala did not notice it; He is another lame director who writes the right scripts. Zezek day speech is incomprehensible to Lynchen "Lost Highway." There are many interpretations of this film, but people who have seen it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < von von Trier's "Dogville" is a fascinating and "wonderful" physical image. I snicker <br /> <br /> However, Zizek does not only make things up, goes on "obvious". Like all "social scientists" (an oxymoron), it includes very trite "observations" in articulated lids (if any) and sometimes complex. In the end, sociology works in the same way: when we hear something new, we believe that everything is already known, but if we say it eloquently, it hears what he does not hear. <br /> <br /> I had to wait suddenly with the black women suddenly with the clothes that appeared from nowhere to the men and the hanging dress ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Slavoj You know: soon as a stalker next to a child. you <br /> <br /> http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
