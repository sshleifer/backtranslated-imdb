A NEW FRESH RETURN <br /> <br /> Why do people get disoriented or ill when they are cut down by a crowded crowd? <br /> <br /> Who should hide in his right hand when someone enters his room? <br /> <br /> How many times when you hit the door and when you did not answer immediately, you open the door, walk in, shout a few cries and then start to go over it? <br /> <br /> If you found someone who was a murderer, what would you do? Quietly hiding under a wooden platform or hiding among metal tools Run, calmly, of course, in an old barn or other limestone structure? <br /> <br /> I can talk about almost any thriller in recent years, but the "Return" page is obviously a "return". I've watched it free in a movie theater room and I'm making a point to project all "horrifying movies." I thought that this was sustainable ... as well as well-known topics. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really crazy and looks like "Huh?" Most of the movies. The details of the plot are gradually given as the film progresses and it is almost enough to make it interesting, except that there is not enough explanation as it progresses and, therefore, I lost almost 2/3. <br>> <br /> If you are an exciting thriller, you should watch it at least once. If there's nothing better in the theater and you want to watch the movie, do not think I'm worth a matin√©e card. If the trailer seemed like an interesting movie and you can not wait ... wait.
