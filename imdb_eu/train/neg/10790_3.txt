First of all, I am not a great fan of Turkish cinema contemporary, that is, the usual way of creating a box office hit by the bottom of the waist. This movie is not related to taboos, artistic masterpieces, directors and marketing ads. In my opinion, the only goal of this film is to obtain money when touching sensitive morality (especially if it was originally taboo in the country) cheap populism would mean a short definition of what I mean. <br /> </ p> However, the performance is perfect. In fact, most cast have backdrops and tried hard to counteract that Altioklar did not compensate; Talent! All Cast members fit their functions and good work training levels, albeit with less experience. (Like Janset) At least, Altioklar deserves a bit of a good word because he knows the cast's choice. In addition, he is a media monkey who believes he is a director of artistic talent. Let's go, art is not only to face naked / semi-naked women. The media, however, have no landmark in the history of the Turkish cinema. Close your ears and something real artistic, I'm waiting for your next job applause. Hopefully, this time you get an artistic vision. <br /> <br /> In short, Pros> Good days, hot women (jokingly!) :) Cons> Each one, other than cast
