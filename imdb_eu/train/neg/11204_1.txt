:: SPOILERS POWERS :: <br /> <br /> Men, the movie was terrifying. It overcomes the Catholic thriller / superstitious / suspense that goes well with the previous film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Sex and priests. Politics and religion. Church hypocrisy The conspiracy of the church. In the dawn of a nasty new age. Voodoo fights both dark and all kinds of fights between good and evil. <br /> <br /> Pretty stupid and bad will be disturbed by a weak story. The story is about two concepts: Absolution, known as the Sacrament of Integrity of the Patient, - the last rights that a person may demand for his sins on death; And excommunication, an action for cutting off a person from the Church. Basically, a media can not get Absolution. That way, Sin Manger comes and I'm going to leave. You have thrown all sorts of doping items already listed and you have the "Order". <br /> <br /> I found a sex scene, but the priest was murdered by the Virgin Mary, and offended the Catholics. He also ends with what Heath Ledger says ("paraphrasing") "I'm the savior of the sinner and I'm damned, I live without love blah blah blah." > <br /> I gave this film 1, not only trivial and original, but because it overwhelmed the whole faith throughout the process. If you want to see something better, I suggest Christopher Walken's "The Prophecy".
