Lots strange and calm. Young "Red" will wear full makeup, short socks and shorts. I got about 20 minutes and we thought that the dream of a pediatrician had become a reality. "Up-beat" is something like I heard in a music strip club. I really think this movie is a joke: it's not a family movie. Gross, I'm glad I was watching this with my daughter, I do not think that usually normal kiddie pornography is common in the family. Very bad, very sad family is sold as a movie, Joey Fatone would probably be embarrassed. And advertising is like "spectacular special effects"? Small budgets have a low budget.
