Except for an effort (this is not a good-looking review on the latest product), this film is poorly written, directed and misleading. The story, of course, had the potential, but that story is nowhere in this movie. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton was a man. We have had passions, desires, love, pain, shame, weakness and self-doubt as we have. You should never know this film's main feature film. In fact, apply to all the characters in the movie, but in the case of Barton: each sentence is a lecture. An epic discourse of that time like an inhuman robot. Indeed, the only scene in the committee meetings, which I realized was doing a lecture! In all its ideas, it is unbelievable in its context, and generates ideas that inspire the minds of the soul. For example, when he sees a wounded man, he begins to punish the needs of the battlefield and protect soldiers and flags to be dressed in white. As it plays a movie, there's no way it could be more accurate. Ideally designed idea in seconds. <br /> <br /> As a result, the movie robs Clara Barton in her battles. He robs his mankind, and he does everything he does because he writes the scripts in the topical. The writer does not know Clara Barton, and her script seems to be based on a Britannica encyclopedia. (Yes, they had them) But, Technicolor, nice! (to whom it is imported)
