It is unfortunate that my book has decided to go to the best horror movies of all time. Copy this inadequate save a lot of material from the first three films, as well as how people die and copy the characters that will happen to the future, and especially try to get into three films and fail. It is also possible to create a good atmosphere for a person (except for the exquisite exception of the choirs that old music reminds of films). <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be appreciated is that there is no Omen V.
