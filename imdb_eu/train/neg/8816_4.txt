I saw Mom ... well, it was not Santa clause kissing; His hand is on his thigh and he has evil thoughts. <br /> <br /> That was enough to be able to sneeze a young boy who wanted to believe it emotionally. The quality of the toys created and the lack of the Christmas spirit came to be a great man. <br /> <br /> I expected a Slasher Flick really thinking, I was very disappointed with fewer handcuffs. People die and there is no nudity. What was liked. <br /> <br /> I liked this color, but it was too slow and it was not really a good script. I did not expect much performance, but I'm sure I wanted some action. There was no one.
