This OMG has been the most painful experience of my life seeing this. Even though I would end up with everything that happened to Nick. The best thing about Nick Teen Drake and Josh is to get the air out. Children's songs are annoying and the kids too. My little sister wanted to see the show because she liked Disney's or the origin of the template, but after seeing this show, she said "one of the worst shows ever I've ever seen". My little brother slept envy. In short, the third year of the third year, without brain activity, if you enjoy this exhibition, otherwise you will change the channel now.
