When they are horror movies, I am willing to stop credibility, ignoring subproductive values ​​and not paying attention to a good agitation. This movie simply does not offer a good fear. Can not even enjoy the camp. Bad conversation, bad performance, bad direction, predictive killings and poorly staged, music was annoying, the camera's work was wretched, the clothes were too bad. I felt really bad when the actors tried, but they had to make dramatic and straightforward conversations and lack of direction. I did not get any trials. Watching is embarrassing and so boring that the ending "endless" is boring. It's one of the films I've ever seen pretty easily. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write comments, but this was so bad, I felt obliged to warn others. This movie is a waste of time. If you want to watch the movie, do not miss the "Making of" -featurette. The writer / director seems to be a murderous woman who was brave and courageous. (Viewed). He and his cronies spend half an hour demolishing this movie, as if it were the new age "Citizen Kane". Listening to a third group of students The parade of Christmas is like stopping behind art. They really believe they have created substance. It's sad, really The only reason I gave this movie "2" is that I think "1" should be reserved for real cruelty "Manos: Hands of Fate" and "Space Mutiny." So, "American Nightmare" has never been the biggest movie I have ever seen, but I should say that it is behind in the fifties.
