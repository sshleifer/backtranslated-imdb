When he talks about the combinations of excellent directors and actors of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson, he is not usually mentioned. Probably, the combination of the interaction between nine together produces a lot of entertainment from the gamut to entertainment. Unfortunately Kinjite: The Forbidden Subjects fall into the second. <br /> <br /> That's sad because Kinjitek could be a lot better. In my life, however, I do not understand why it was necessary to become a Japanese father, a habit of getting some cheap toys, because wedding love has run out. It may be very good for another movie, but it has not been any good here. <br /> <br /> With Charles Bronson, the police drama was a direct one, he saw too much in the bag and saw a policeman. strong pre-eastern prejudices That could also be a little explanation. But he will have to overcome Perry Lopez if he finds a Japanese girl caught by her partner and her partner. It is an elegant and murderous cartoon by Jaime Fernandez, and he and Bronson have a bit of history. In fact, in the best movie scene, Bronson rode Rolex watches and burned the car. <br /> <br /> For a moment, Fernandez puts Bronson and Lopez at a night delicatessen. With his Rolex swallow, he threw his place to kill Uzi, but Bronson and Lopez. I really think that the slightest incident has had more than the pair of victims of LAPD in Fernandez. However, the plot is huge. <br /> <br /> Still, with Fernandez, there is a very rude justice. Even if the whole movie was better. It was the latest film by Bronson-Thompson and J. Lee Thompson's latest director. It would come out with a better idea.
