Together with the Valley, I think it's one of the worst movie I have ever seen. Tarantino is just one of the longest outputs of Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere created by the movie is fun in the first five minutes, but filmmakers fail to overlook the unnecessary and grotesque violence of the "hip" coefficient. It's better for you to jump.
