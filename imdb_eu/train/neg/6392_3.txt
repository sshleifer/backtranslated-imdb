Goremeister Herschell's Gordon Lewis enthusiasts should look elsewhere if they collect ordinary cubes of ordinary blood, because they have little bloodlines in this film. Instead, Lewis decided to try to tell that weird story, which could be trusted in special effects in a bargain in special effects, it would surely have doubled the cast for some days if there were pockets of change. Strangely enough, while cheap and badly acting (especially as McCabe Mitchell), the whole sterility of the plot retains all the attention. Imagine what this movie could be a decent budget! In general, champagne is fond of beer budget.
