I have seen Fantorfest's first movie, and I hardly ever think of having anyone else watch. He told me his "horror movie of thought-mime", and I must say that if I think of pretending to think about how splatter / gore films are in the collection. I'm not wrong to write down the trash cartoon in this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot has wiped too much art for the sake of art. Camera effects and music are most often used and the characters are at least insignificant. Several characters and scenes are missing when they reveal some hooks called "The Hamiltons". I figured Lenny was about half an hour away when I got the movie. I was so confused by Lenny under the visually impaired Lenny and I made it clear that I felt it was completely broken. I got what I expected, but they could go much farther, indeed, all the rude fall flat. With films like "Hostel" and "Saw", you need to come up with the "movie for the general viewer or disturbing" movie.
