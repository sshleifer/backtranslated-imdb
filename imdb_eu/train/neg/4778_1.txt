This is the worst show I have ever seen. In my opinion, T.V is the removal due to its delay. I see him so dumb when he saw him. (although I never see SOOOOOO poor) <br /> <br /> Goofs: Mac can say he can not eat sugar, he eats sugar in another part. Almost everything in the world has sugar! In the "Eddie Monster" section Terdous shouts Terrance when he falls into the box twice with the secret PLUS after falling into the box, he falls aside. What a stupidity. I can not say the word Fosters Home. I also made a song with my band that this show was delayed. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
