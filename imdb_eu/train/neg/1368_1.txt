It is the highest score that this film can give, but zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pee Yew, a talented, twelve-year-old actress who wanders the book, wandering the book, smiles and listens to stupid puns and pieces and templates. . For example, when Gene Stapelton's (Ding-Bat, family member) character Marilu Henning's character "shakes in two different ways," humor was a cheap essay on the overall melancholy of the movie ... do you like it, shameless humor? Rent Animal House, American Pie (first part only), Old School or Office Space.
