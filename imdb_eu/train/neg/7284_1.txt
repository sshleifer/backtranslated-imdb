Wow I read about this movie, and I had to see that it was so horrible, and for me, I can smell it in St. Louis. Where do i start The National Lampoon tried 5 years to follow the success of Animal House, but lost its mark. I will go chronologically with these short films. <br /> <br /> # 1 Short Film <br /> <br /> Poor Peter Riegert (Boon from Animal Home). Apparently, then, there was no work, so the boys in the National Lampoons were probably called boys and said: "Yes, we're making a movie, right?" Like Peter, "I do not do much in these days, why not?" He was an excellent character of the Animal House party, but he could not feel a bad 5-minute flop. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILER The premise is very funny, as Jason Cooper (Riegert) has quit her, find herself. It is curious to have a happy marriage. So he goes after him, he goes there and Cooper is in charge of the kids. Without interrupting the course, he smokes the house, loses his childhood and sleeps with a buzz of New York (including a young Diane Lane). Then the wife is back, she wants children, and the movie ends with a final coin, which decides the child's zodiac. The idea was sensible, but the director frustrated him. All the people seem like they are sleeping. Sorry Boon, your heritage was bumped with this flop. <br /> <br /> BRIEF # 2 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> BACK MORE <br /> <br /> Enter Dominique Corsaire. A pretty girl, the university has just finished, I do not know what to do with her life. So it becomes a slut, it starts to sleep with some mega wealthy people, it takes its money when they die, and it does not stop until the most powerful man in the world goes to bed, Fred Willard (I mean, Ooops, the president of the United States of America). Once again, it could be very fun, and I was happy that Corsaire (Ann Dusenberry in real life) did not fear being naked, his activity was awful. Lose time <br /> <br /> Short Film # 3 <br /> <br /> I can not believe that I have done far. Here is the new police officer Brent Falcone (Robby Benson), veteran Stan Nagursky (Richard Widmark). Falcone is a young man, naive, that he thinks he can really help, though he will be cynical after shooting several thousand times. Nagurski really has taken care of him. Watch clocks, attacks, and never see it intervene. The world thinks it is illegal and will probably take it to court if it does anything. Even though Christopher Lloyd (at the end of the taxi race) began the action, the police demanded a crime but had the support of the lawyer. God bless America! <br /> <br /> Once again, it might have been fun, the performances were intentionally campy, but kind of good, no energy. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldie have to shame their names in this slave. I think the writing was not bad, it was ideas, but the execution was diverted, as well as hijacking the rescue attempt against the crisis. If it were a part of this movie, I would remove my name, it's horrible. Again, that's why I saw it. <br /> <br /> The good thing about that rubbish is that John Dr made a score of the film (repeatedly "Going to Movies") and the movie is in 'an hour and a half longer. Show this in "Films that you DO NOT make yourself" in film classes. You should leave this script on the shelf, yes, it's so bad.
