It seems curious that someone read this script and he thought: "This is fun! I mean, it's so horny to do it!" Who was this person? Who is this person really responsible? Are they under my responsibility, more than a director / writer? <br /> <br /> This movie is, in most cases, a bad smell. There is no good conversation, not a nice character. And the story ... <br /> <br /> Hulk Hogan's worst movie "No Hold's Barred" I prefer. It seems almost the opposite of Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> When it's finished, it's a few minutes, and it's only 80 minutes left. Members who pull off their games laugh at the "mockery" mistakes, and things that went wrong in the "comedy" set. I'm glad I saw someone laughing someday, with a "movie" link. <br /> <br /> There's nothing funny in this movie. Nothing He goes forward and goes on. It's really a killer. I like films that are very popular. This is so bad ... something, but I do not know what, and I never expected to know. <br /> <br /> Amanda Peet did not suck, and in fact she's half good. about this film. But that's really little. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
