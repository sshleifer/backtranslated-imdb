I have a high tolerance level for the card, so I was waiting for it. He did not disappoint Apparently based on the classic Carmilla of Sheridan Le Fanu, he continues to hunt his father and daughter vampires and, fortunately, he is traveling with them. Then we have more than just random zombies called Santa Claus (or General, which is called here). Did I say that there was a zombie explosion? The dead are alive, but no one worries too much. Building workers have zombies, soldiers zombies and St.Trinians schoolgirl zombies. Apparently Santa Claus is looking for a daughter who has become a vampire. Yes, do not wait, the vampire, the girl is in a dark asylum and is Carmilla her nurse or is it? The zombies are back and Santa is crazy. Lesbian sex, I like vampires and I like zombies, but I like mostly lesbian sex. A simulated cunnilingus does not allow anything to emit juices. When will we see the vampires fight against zombies? Is it a vampire or is it vain? Or both? Is Carmilla vampire lesbian sexy or hot? Cunnilingus, you can never do enough cunnilingus. Here comes the Trikintar zombies. Chainsaw time !! More sexually lesbian, then zombies kill and eat vampires. I think the zombies have won? Plot? Who needs a plot of lesbian vampires and school lands? And cunnilingus?
