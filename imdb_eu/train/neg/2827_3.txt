The initial story is interesting: from western Africa to western Africa and slavery to the Middle East. The problem is that the favorite enemies of Richard Fleisher's director are punishable by both Alava and German. He thinks that Arab men seem to be as liberal as they think it was easy to capture in Western Africa, as credible as those who are "rooted" in slavery. Obviously, both traders manage local people and (d) involve more sophisticated networks. While Arab countries are complicit in the trade of today's children and sex slaves, Israel is one of the worst attackers in Amnesty International. So why just say Arabs and then choose a German one only European buyer? People with a direct person are bias and hate. <br /> <br /> The impact is above the average, especially Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is always good.
