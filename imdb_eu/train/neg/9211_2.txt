This film reminds me of many anti-drug films of the 1950s and 60s, of course, due to the fact that they have not been affected by social woes that have never been heard. Tom Hanks and his friends are playing "roleplaying", but there's no dice, lots of candles, and then it's going to take you in a bad mime that shows how the hanks go. quite funny but correct. I wonder how many poor children destroyed D & D materials and told them that their use of imagination was a way to destroy them. As a film, basically, school is a succession, a bad performance (though Hanks shows his talent) and speaks of relationships, and no one goes through. It seems that these films have psychological care for teens who are starting to grow older, seemingly more serious, and do things that others do. Although 2 votes are worth seeing, it's a special genre, and horror movies seem very funny to me.
