Well ... ... in front of other previously written comments, I must say that this is a good thing about this film. Jason Donavon reminded me of my youth. I do not know how he won the awards, and I was sure that he was making a lot of effort, but the final results were cited by the 90's early TV series. The land does not exist, cinematography was promising and the performance was matched with a performance of one level. Unfortunately it was long and the subplots were not very unrealistic ... for example ... your best friend stayed with your old friend for only 6 years after breaking off after two years, you should not be the best. friends It was all fantasy. That's it! Yes, yes, and the jewelery indie of the 90s / individual indie were considered!
