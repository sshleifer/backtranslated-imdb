Even though their adaptations to game games are not bad, this crater is not much better. <br /> <br /> Boll does not seem to have accepted a good movie. One of these days will be left without money and the world will cause bombs. <br /> <br /> The effect was sub-par, as the dialog box was being read by TelePrompTers and Boll's "little touches". they were seen in everything. <br /> <br /> Like all Uwe Boll films, this would not have existed. <br /> <br /> Plain and simple. <br /> <br /> Just like Uwe Bollen mode should not exist. > _>
