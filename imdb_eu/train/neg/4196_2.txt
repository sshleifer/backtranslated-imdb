It's one of the worst films I have ever seen. Not only the story, but acting is amazing. Conversation is like someone who reads news. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy / drama / love, it's not one of them! It's a little action, that's it. There is no comedy or theater. On the contrary, if you go to the cinema, I feel this. I would not recommend it. Checking out is something else you choose. It's a crime of action / crime. The scene of the actions was absorbed and the crime story was very predictable. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in a good story or a good performance. And you just want to study a foreign film. Then this may be for you.
