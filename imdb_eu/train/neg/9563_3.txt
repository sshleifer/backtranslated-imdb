This is based on the ideas of the original 80's hit. It is set on the current day, as it sees Afghanistan's base as a UAV directly destroys it. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly where the movie jumps on the dash. UAVs are not armed. It's possible, but I do not think he's really trying. We will see a computer that has controlled this operation, R.I.P.L.E.Y. We will enter Will Farmer "hacker" (a computer hacker is not in chemistry and electronics) and his first interest in the love of Annie and Will's first hacking attempt has not only failed his IP address . He started the session and Annie was the one who invented it. Wills's father who works for a chemical company. <br /> <br /> The will to take money with your neighborhood bank account (Massude) is not a hack (it helped set up your account), then we get it. The original movie that decides to not find Global Thermonuclear War is going back and die. RIPLEY is running out of the office It's NOT in Will, but on Massude's computer, so all the evidence that was being gathered was not useless against Will. <br /> <br /> Why does not RIPLEY close Will's machine is not explained. an online game?) and why it was necessary to close the entire electricity block that had to exist. It would seem that the anti-terrorism agency would focus on why a viable target is very unclear. Regarding RIPLEY, his cell phone turned on? I do not think that it was not connected to the computer and the message would not play if it does not really answer the bad "hacking" science on the phone. <br /> <br /> RIPLEY's agent arrives at Massoud's house. Take it and have an envelope with a lot of money Will will be given. Searching for mass matched car registration is not a "hack", you never saw the DMV come into the computer. The agents that Dennis takes on the airport at the airport will not be arrested or detained. Willen's mother did not "steal chemicals and bio-agents." And yet he did not have the right to arrest or arrest Dennis. Patriot Act or not. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Will is worried about being arrested for crimes in Canada to the U.S. with different laws and in different countries. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The Will will do that is the first show of any hacking skill in the movie. We also get a hack for RIPLEY, so simple because it was easy to find. At the airport we were watching Annie and the streets, it was not related to RIPLEY, and RIPLEY was just as stupid as a computer's stupid idea of ​​reading the lips as it was underground. <br /> <br /> Another reference to the original film was Stephen Falken's RIPLEY as a system designer, Joshua Project. Annie's "Falken (who is not the one who plays the original actor unfortunately) is aware of his fake death. <br /> <br /> We also see WOPR's" what will help ". RIPLEY wins and then they used the same voice. Falken & WOPR are rapidly being destroyed and hardly ever used (the explosion itself would have to kill Will, Annie and Russians, and create a computer system with a chemical weapon that could drop them. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Will not do it, contacting one of his friends who suggests and implements this idea, it is very nice that Wille would increase RIPLEY's operation temperature: Josue RIPLEY's back background (especially after throwing it in the trash) the scream of a desperate writer is incredible, with no idea whatsoever, and getting that movie. /> <br /> RIPLE Y plays Dead Code and we will see a countdown (about 17 minutes) and RIPLEY says "Decontamination in 30 minutes." Why, can not they continue with their timer? RIPLEY's attack on Philadelphia has stopped (it's very easy for me to believe) and Joshua decides to attack him on his own internal circuits and he led Philadelphia to Washington at the RIPLEY station. The Nuclear Replacement idea that RIPLEY realizes what he does will not work (he probably knew that he already learned in the original film he had learned from Joshua inside his own)? original movie <br /> <br /> When RIPLEY plays the same words as Joshua, RIPLEY shows his original movie shows how many original ideas they could not show. > <br /> If you want to point out oral and stolen ideas, guilty men are Randall Badat and Rob Kerchner. The movie is horrible and must be avoided.
