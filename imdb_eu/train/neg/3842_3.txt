Our teachers showed us this first movie. Since then I have not seen. I saw the trailer. Do you like the first grade movie? I do not think so. I was terrified of this movie, I hardly saw him. Shirley McClain was a scene in the middle of the little girl, and then the boy was ketchup! I was terrified of this movie. Nowadays, for 20 years, I probably would not feel like that. I want to share my experiences and opinions, maybe little children should not watch the movie, even if it's a PG. Consider the results for children that show this. I do not even remember what it was, once it was enough!
