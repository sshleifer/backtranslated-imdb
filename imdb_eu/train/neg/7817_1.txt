At first I was glad about a superman movie, though it was great, but it was not. <br /> <br /> Richard Donner's copy is bad, Lex is again bad. It does anything else, even if Kevin spicek played it. <br /> <br /> The bad plan is the same as Donner's first movie. <br /> <br /> It's easy to preview and script. (Which is found in a Luthor museum or an old lady). <br /> <br /> The story is wrong, it must be Kevin Smith Script and it may be better. <br /> <br /> I expect a sequel with Brian Singer and a new talent manager to do something new and not make a copy. <br /> <br /> It all reads you later
