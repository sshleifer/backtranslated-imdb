The only reason I saw Shakedown is Erika Elena. It's always sexy, but Wolf Larson plays a second violin. It's a pity, because it has more power capabilities than you have to show here. The shootings that are mostly monotonous are endless; Especially when you are watching melancholic soldiers armed with Larson and his revolver (this will never be taken offhand). quite easy Earthquake effects are decent, but there are many blurry movements and CGI explosions. As a psychotic "spiritual leader," Ron Perlman tries, but the monster-religious-mumbo jumble to be boring is boring. Ellenia, Perlman, or Larson (if they have it) want to take a look at this whole, others are not worth the rental. (* 1/2)
