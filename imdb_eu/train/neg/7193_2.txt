Last weekend I did nothing, and I painted with my friends to see the movie ... any movie. And we did not see that the only movie was Inspector Gadget. We decided to do that. It is a movie that is only for children. Oh, and I do not like films targeted at young audiences. But I did not have any doubt about this movie. If you do not have to do anything at home, go to sleep. Fortunately, it's better than losing money. Go to a movie if you are a child or a parent with a boy.
