This movie has just sucked. I'm in the army and the soldiers represented in this movie are awesome. If you are a military and watch this movie, you will laugh at the whole movie, because they play as a team. It was ridiculous. They acted like ordinary people with uniforms of the army, who did not know what to do. At least I would have said the movie was pretty cute. There were two scenes where you jumped. I would recommend if you are bored and want to see a violent gory movie. It will be a better film, even if you do not have the military. In addition, I liked it better than this one.
