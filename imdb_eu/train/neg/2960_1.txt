This is undoubtedly the worst film ever created. There are no discussions here. This is. End of story The story is young and sub-moronic, it seems to have been created by the three-year-old young dinosaur. The whole concept is pure change. It is unthinkable to think that someone thought something stupid and fun. The jokes are also bad. If you have not seen the movie yet, consider lucky. If this movie is curious about what's wrong, do not describe it. The word can not say absolutely horrible movie. This is not a bad movie. They also have cohesion, if not the entertainment value. This . . This is. . . Ugh! Think about the worst story ever and the level of its evil level 5,000 and you're still not approaching this movie is awesome. Pok√©mon is a movie that gives a point and gives a point to this movie, it seems to be a charity. That's a bad thing. Producers and directors also took film schools? It's an excellent example of not making a movie. It seems that this amateur film is like a few more amateur painters. If you have rented this, come back and ask for a refund. And do not think about renting again.
