It's the first problem with TV replication: it changes the color tone of the story. Additionally, recording a television movie reduces the creditor's focus and focus. As a result, we lose the dramatic collision that occurs in the second part of the original film (police interview, trial, imprisonment and execution). In the small screen, it is just another version of the Law and Order spin-offs. <br /> <br /> Hollywood's scripts have been constantly being searched for to other successful films of the past.

It will help you understand the effort you have made about the material, as well as in the book as well as in the movie. <br /> <br /> I really gave it 4 because they saved the bottom 3. real bombs in the ranking - what you're upset by annoyance
