"Dracula II: Ascension" is a story about a group of doctors who meet Dracula's body. When a mysterious stranger appears and gives students $ 30 million in bargaining and blood robbery at the auction. hardly refuses The students are also continuously following a murderer in the Vatican banishment. "Dracula II: Ascension" is a horror movie that is a bit entertaining, it has many bugs. There are some good effects like swirling effects like heads, but there is not enough violence to my liking. The movie becomes boring and unforgettable and there is no suspense. So if you look like a new vampire. The atmospheric colds of the early 60s and 70s, such as "Blood Lips", "Dracula's Wives" or "Lemora: The Supernatural Children's Story", are worth less than 10.
