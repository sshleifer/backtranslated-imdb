Sorry, I have already written the opinion of this movie, but I have seen some other reviews for the first time. There are many people who agree with me, but it is terrifying that there are people who like this movie very much. I do not like reviewing reviews or other opinions of others, but I think that seeing or watching this movie would not be visible to anyone. This is not a good movie. I really like movies and I see almost anything, but I saw that movie was a very short list of movies and I was happy to leave it halfway. If you are really tempted, watch the trailer ... I made a mistake because the entire movie is basically a trailer ... so there are no surprises, a bad conversation that loses time. I love Michael Vartan alias and I hate criticizing him, but I think it's my duty to lose other people's lives in such a movie!
