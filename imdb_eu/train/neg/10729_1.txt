First of all, I said that I am among the broader opinions (most!) Opinion ... Cinema is my passion, and I'm a traditional challenge for my film culture. ... I also ask for an increase asking for advice on movies that I usually get, and it seems that I do not have to leave places, discuss discussions or exchange ideas. the worship movie area ... I want to rent rare things, which is why this movie was recommended by one of the worship film guides. He told me that I should see it. , and because the cover tells me that something like Jodorowsky (my favorite!) is a movie that has a movie, I have rented it. <br /> <br /> The vote given here is not really reasonable because I did not. I think it was horrible, I do not know how to rate it otherwise. A question mark would be more appropriate ... <br /> <br /> This is literally the first single movie I've ever suffered in my stomach: I really felt the physical illness! Are I the only literally activated stomach? I still did not want to deactivate it, or maybe I was fascinated in a bad way ... <br /> <br /> I have never wanted to see this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not horrible, as I said. It's not my tea cup (or wodka for that) ...
