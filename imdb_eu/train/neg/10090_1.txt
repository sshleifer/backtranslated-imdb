This movie is a joke. I mean "ha ha" funny joke. Why? The only thing to recover around it was the senseless, ridiculous and horrific lurks that made me laugh. Wow! <br /> <br /> There are many unanswered questions in this movie ... for example; why do these women become zombies and how? Why are four black women "caring" zombies and what is their purpose? Since 6 people make up "national" Zombies? And is it a black, black eye mask that is "terrifying" on anyone else and anywhere? Even a 2 year old? <br /> <br /> And, finally,; Why has this movie been? Why? why? why? No answer? That's what I thought. <br /> <br /> In the order channel, this comment was published after the synopsis of the movie: We apologized to this movie in advance, "LOL. At least they made the decision!
