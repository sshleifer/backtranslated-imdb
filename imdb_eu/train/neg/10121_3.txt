The London citizens who are bored by Henry Kendall and John Barry (London and Emily Hill) are getting an inheritance. They travel money. With Betty Amann (Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (Mrs. Barry) they give a lively relationship. They are still boring. The director Alfred Hitchcock will be bored with the title live (Shakespeare's "The Tempest"), sorting the camera scams. The inauguration of the "Crowd" in King Vidor stands out. The low point can be a pair of Chinese cooked cats. <br /> <br /> *** Strange and strange (31/12/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
