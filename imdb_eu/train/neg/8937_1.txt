In general, I like horror films, but unfortunately my book pound came out of my friends. We looked to sit down, to be afraid, and we ended our food while we were so much laughing. The concept is not so bad, but why did they decide that the series ten would be lucky? The worst thing about the movie is the actors. The camera's work is poor, the special effects are not bad if you're generous, but in general, the story does not connect to any level as the actors were as effective as a small, high-efficiency needle. They were beyond measure, especially fifteen years old, a young young actress, as serious as a government agent. In fact, he seemed like a public school boy. There was a very entertaining sex scene in which an apple seemed to come as a busty basket came over it, and later its sneakers were hysterical, but I thought it was a comedy that I remembered later. I want my brain to say something positive about that movie, from time to time to avoid having dark breasts, but it's not just. Let's be fortunate to be lucky and do not make another, I do not know how to take my ribs.
