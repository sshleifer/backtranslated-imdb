"Problem Child" is one of the most beautiful films ever made. It's not the worst (although some people do not agree with me), but it's not the best. 7-year-old demonic boy who sinks a pair of comic-devastating children (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck). This movie is incredibly nonsensical and disbelief because there is no second I buy as the child can swear, as it does in this movie. It is a sign and absurd, although I have been laughing several times (I do not really know why). But I can not recommend this film. I know it is very nice. If there is a positive thing about "Problem Child", it's just that it's better than a great battle. <br /> <br /> ** (4)
