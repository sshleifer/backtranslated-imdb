Please note: this movie, despite being a bad storyline, has been one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen ... EVER. Remember to enjoy the movie before enjoying your sofa. <br /> <br /> So begins with a party officially. Just your average party, but some types there. There's a nice chain ... I know what I'm saying. Remember face; it will help later. <br /> <br /> However, however, Kat will find George Clooney (did not the ground be bad?) and so it takes the tube. At night, London is underground, but just like that. Therefore, the schedule is the next and last, within 7 minutes. Now, Kate, the boy's girlfriend, decides he can take parts for a spare 7 minutes. Normally, he is missing a train and is blocked by the London subway. Alone. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the movie continues. Blood, guts, limbs, though I do not mention them, are amputated from the body. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is a terrible fear; a pretty but bold girl, a shy women and a psychiatric psychiatrist who is ill and curious. Or, if appropriate, Creep. <br /> <br /> I told Saw, the hostel or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but for the others, we're sorry. He fears a lot of fear.
