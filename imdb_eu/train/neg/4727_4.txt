This movie is an egg of a kitten, in some good part. Unlike other reviewers, I have not found the main blame for the interest of the audience and the plot. I sat down on the way to rock'n'roll and I was interested in the dynamics of the teams, but I would consider it as a film as merit if I evaluate it, I should give it up. A few warnings: Jason Behr is good at John Livien, and quite rewarding as a rock singer; The narrative about childhood traumatism is unclear, although the relationship with Livia's parents works well, its behavior is very curious to the viewer (that is, not what it is). However, it is an interesting idea for the use of performing abilities to solve internal conflicts, although it is not innovative, or is fully explored in this film. John Lennon's comments were angry, but I must admit I'm not a fan of the Beatles. In any case, Livien and his team reminded me of Oasis more than the Beatles, because it was something about them. Another frustrating feature of the movie was opened, though some of the most interesting characters - though middle and senior - were the philosophical reflections of the main character, but left the thought threads there, to pick them up again. When it's a very short movie, when Livien says, "It was music in the face of God" (he never saw the ad in Tia Maria's decade of the 1990s, "It's time before, it was Tia Maria", it seems like a stupid consequence and the viewer has no idea how to get there But he has the right to do so. Fortunately, his bassists and friends, Dominic Monaghan, behave ably when he confesses the lies of this thought when he answers "You do not know that." <br /> <br /> In the end, the limited strength of direction and the plot in future projects either in vain trivialities or in an interesting and more mature perspective.
