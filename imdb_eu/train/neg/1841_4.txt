This can be looked at in different ways. This movie sucks it, it's good or it's strange. Thirdly, surely, we will explain this movie. It has rare themes and has a strange plot. That's why Christopher Walken would only play somebody else's bad, average or even good, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ben Steffle was awaiting you. Jack Black has always liked to find out what it is about, but that's not bad. Christopher Walken's wall is always there. It's always nice to see the movie is bad. Wise comedy is really fun. This is, of course, its moments (although very little), but the movie is fun to laugh, but of course, it's not in a good way. <br /> Direction was also the average. Barry Levinson has been a bit overtaken and he has not really done a good job here. This movie seemed to have a lot more potential and did not get much. It's very average and does not seem to make much effort to make this movie. <br /> <br /> Writing is the key to a good comedy. Of course, he means writing here. Mostly below the average. Its moment is not horrible. This is never a good idea about a movie. <br /> <br /> If it was not Christopher Walken, I would give a shameless rumor to a lower score. He is always a character in his films. This style is just a strange movie whacked strange characters that did not go anywhere. It's not quite horrible, but I would not really recommend it, though it's a very unforgettable movie.
