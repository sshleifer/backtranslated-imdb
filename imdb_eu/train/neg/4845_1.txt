In this movie there is no artistic value worthy of the prize. Well, it's not worth the audience too. Ironically, a prize is for cinematography, but, of course, camera movements are at least confusing. You think that each frame is getting "full image", like "someone cutting your focus" on the edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I'm honest, I could not see the whole movie. The most sucked soldiers when I saw soldiers who participated in their barracks and fed a soldier to drink liquor. These other similar scenes reminded me a lot about Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> Take my advice, deceive yourself.
