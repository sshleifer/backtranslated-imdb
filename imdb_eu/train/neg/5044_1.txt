I expected this movie after reading the positive review of the New York Times. In addition, I am from Shanghai, so there was only a lot of interest in this area. However, after seeing it, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie was very slow and monotonous. The director was too lengthy in some scenes. There was no passion or chemistry among lovers. There was no conversation. No dialogue required for dialogue. At the end of the movie, you have no sense of compassion. This movie was missing all. The script was weak, the performance was inadequate, and the edition did not exist. The director tried to emulate the black film style, but he failed. A good movie is one that attracts your attention, keeps it and it succeeds without overtime. This movie felt like it was never ending. Do not waste your money in this movie.
