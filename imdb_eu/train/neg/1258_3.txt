Warning: Spoilers Galore! <br /> <br /> Regarding the restoration of his film genius of Tim Burton, he is as skeptical as to recover psyche. Oh, that's it, idiot has already done that - I'm going to rest on my case. <br /> <br /> Opens the movie with a simulation with chimpnaut, from the beginning it proves not very intelligent. Marky Mark shows herself without showing her underwear and then throws a woman who prefers chimpanzees. <br /> <br /> The narrow sheet of the Saturn station without apparent reason. speed of the boats with monkeys experiments. We need 1,300 million kilometers to perform Saturn experiments? The team of special effects decides. <br /> <br /> Marky's butterflies in the 60's include this science fiction film: Time Warp. Marky, then, shows that the spatial station is a huge security of security because it robs a pod that does not notice. At the same time, his stupidity reveals that a deep space mission is immersed in a hole in the hole for use with test butterflies. limited fuel and oxygen supply. <br /> <br /> Anyone can say 'Remake Pointless' before saying' Marky surfatu worm-hole that has crashed on an alien planet, and removes the helmet without thinking about letalitateari atmosphere. If it were not the backlight of the plastic lights, it continues to follow a sound stage that resembles a rich forest. <br /> <br /> Surprise! APES is doing it, or at least * it would be amazed * If you had never seen Planet Of The Apes thirty-one years ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> Marky Mark did not get her to be born. He pulled out his pants, or dumped his lame whiteboy rap, character. When Michael Clarke's Duncan's gorilla teeth went into the screw, they greatly helped him lack his character. Helena Bonham-Carter (a rich, chimpanzee as an activist), as a result of the loss of a script by Shakespeare, made Marky and Clarke a great cardboard cut-out. Paul Giamatti, an orangutan slave trader, comic security and internal clutter ensured. Pelikula horrekin erlazionatutako ilustrazioak entzuteko bilakaera izan badut ere, berrikuspen baten izenburuak Planet Of The Apes-en esentziaren esanahia bildu zuen: "berriro imajinatu": "The Apes Of Roth". One Roth Thousands of years or others like Greystoke's extraction, Tim Roth, as a thug chimpanzee, cheats on the massive landscapes and throws the cocks out. Since his origin was so funny as the portrait of the psychotic Thade, his character was not a conductive arch: Thade is angry when we know him ... and he is quite stupid at the end of the film. Nice twist <br /> <br /> The original POTA (1968) was the protagonist of Charlton Heston in Taylor, when he was inadequately hidden from humanity, the land left without space without regret. He was locked in a fight to prove himself worthy of humanity - his only champion! The original movie was, in the end, a story of an insult, not a salvation: when Taylor discovered the status of freedom, he had to realize that his species did not prevail. Is not something irrelevant or ironic for Leo's Marky Mark? Or Roth's Thade? No, but there are a lot of running. <br /> <br /> The slogans cite: Take Back The Planet. But APES is the planet. In this movie, humans and monkeys have fallen here, humans have degenerated into cave-dwellers, because monkeys have acquired sensual speech and body armor. monkeys were inherited from the planet's heritage! Marky Mark will also come to the point that, as a matter of fact, as an anthropocentric arrogance, he believes that human beings must be predatory, because they are there. "Eraman atzera" 2001ean izugarriak diren tximinoak bezain lirikoak dira, "gizonak APES ?? !! eta gero arazoak eragin zizkieten anusio iletsuak eta iletsuak. <br /> <br /> Heston 1968ko POTA-n bota zuten, benetako ospea ezarri zuelako: Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! Muturreko gizarte arrotz batean jartzeko moduko hura bota zezaten, ikusleen itxaropenak ergelkeria zen: nola behar den mundu bat gure gizonak Charlton-ek ezin duen errespetua? Marky Markek unean berdintasunez estutu duela adierazi du. <br /> <br /> Hestonek tximino-kontseiluak etengabe desegin zuen arren, pantailan nagusi zuen karisma eta bere karaktere harrigarria. Marky Mark mongoloideko gizakietan ardura saihesten saiatzen denean, eskolan ikaskide ezagun horren antzekoa da, bat-batean ikasgelan jarraipena egiten duena, esaten zaitu arbelak marraztzeari You leave a trace and throw a shoe. Burton tries to raise Marky's human icon, but it is deviant. In the original film, lightning Taylor des But they are considered to be a symbol of humanity, an icon of the people. That irony again. <br /> <br /> It was a good thing to fall for the chewing scene to fall into a performance technique - Heston - the first breadth of this movie, which was the father of Thaddeus Roth. As a monkey in Roth, Charlton publishes his immortal lines, this time he turned against humans, Damn them! Damn them all hell! '<br /> <br /> The movie gets mute to the bottom. While Thaddeus steals the beaver as he goes to Marky, the plinth drops over into Marky's Chinese. Tximinoak bere hebetua frogatzen dute izaki ezagun horri beherantz makurtuz, Marky-k bere hebetuda frogatzen duela murmuratzen duela, "Eman dezagun tximino hauek eboluzioari buruz". First of all, there are monkeys, monkey! Secondly, genetic manipulation and strange plot were the monkeys that were brought to this point and not the evolution. And if you want to throw it away with a hidden solution, it's called misanthropy, not evolution. <br /> <br /> At the end of the card, the viewer would really understand the true role of Estella Warren's niche. Integrated plot (I still have my pants.) <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, it was the same as the last experiment of mankind; In the end, the monkeys took the Marky Plot Point Prison, eventually ululating, "It's a madhouse! MADHOUSE A! ..."
