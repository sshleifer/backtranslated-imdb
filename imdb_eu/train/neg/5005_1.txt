A cheesy, compelling horrible (and not a fun way) C Grade. Everything cries out in an "amateur" voice from the crumby script (unusual locales, limited consistency and outlook, strong lighting, sounds and hand-scaled camera angle, sexual appetite and passion, and ratings, I watched the DVD and I expected Edward Wood to come out , everything will be forgiven - your worst film is artwork, and this is more consistent, but more consistent than that. <br /> <br /> But it's better. Warbling "Every night I hear you in my dreams" - Surely the Titanic team does not was there around it?
