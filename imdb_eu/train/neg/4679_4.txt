Film awesome. Do not go wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but not only do some interesting pieces, but the film attacks mostly on the rage, crying, crying, sweating and, in general, doing something wrong. /> <br /> Make it more ingenious to make sure the audience still understands what it is (Denzel Washington will explain to a radio dealer how much Scotty should have in Stary Trek), it's just a joke. a thriller dumb that is not worth the actress. <br /> <br /> Let's hope the US nuclear army is not the script! <br /> <br /> <br />
