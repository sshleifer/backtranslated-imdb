I have not seen the first two - what is called the first species in England. I do not think I'll be disturbed. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie. Awesome impact, bad conversation, cheap rubber monsters. Everything is wrong Loving characters quickly die and leave you annoying, especially called Polchak, jerk is incredible. No one will last for 5 minutes. The year lasted, but I was glad I got rid of it, I had a nightmare that survived. The colonel was also dirty: his lips curled up and shouted. And the doctor looked curiously and acted out as if it were pornographic. I waited for her to take off her glasses, shake her hair and become a vampire, but she did not. This mercy, because he made the movie, was not over. <br /> <br /> Roger Corman did not do it half-hearted?
