In the 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. Small NBC series (later a long feature film featured) about the traitor of the 1960s, as seen by the white family and the eyes of a black family. The first part of the film is driven by the excellent performance of Willton Taylor, and it extends the story of the family evenly. However, Dutton's character has died halfway and the black family is completely forgotten in the second half, dull, unconsistent and horrible. VALUATION: 10 to 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 video / DVD release).
