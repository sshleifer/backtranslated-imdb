Irene Dunne completed his famous career with this film. He had to speak, but this film was not unknown and almost unknown. <br /> <br /> This lightweight comedy is fine, but it's not special. It's a lot better in the first half because the second half is totally stupid. Maybe Irene could see it and just leave it on the wall. Even the honest voice shook his anger. Rumors say he was not happy with this movie. You can see why. The story reminded me of a TV sitcom in the 1950s. Speaking about it, I thought David Nelson was a television series of Ozzie and Harriet, but Richard Crenna was very young. He made the sound and sound of Nelson. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, so good, and a subtle part for the good actress.
