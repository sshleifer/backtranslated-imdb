Anthony Steffen (Alan Cunningham) is a sadomasochistic lover who is a rich widowed widow and Lord of Britain. She brings red-haired black women to her castle, where she sucks and kills them. Erika Blanc (black-booted stripper) stripper (like Susie) comes out temporarily. Mrs. Steffen's wife wonders "Evelyn"'s wife when she died in childbirth. As a therapist, she decides to marry again after finding a pretty girl from Marina Malfatti (Gladys). When the movie is over, they will have to rip other graves. "The Night Evelyn Cove Out of the Grave" is a great title at least. <br /> <br /> ** The night you Evelyn gave me the grave (1971) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen, Marina Malfatti, Erika Blanc
