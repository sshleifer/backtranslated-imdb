The film story is bad enough, and this will happen in real life. I can not understand when they show us a bad movie. Because I was wrong, I say that there are some reasons. 1. If Madonna is rich and can do everything he wants, then why did this bad man fall. 2. How can the story's script so weak? She was so rich, she could do everything she wanted, but her husband's divorce was not unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I love you words, it does not mean in this movie.
