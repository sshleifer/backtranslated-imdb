Each new show in every new fall deserves my "3 strike and away" policy. A comedy 3 allows me to laugh, this is a whole episode of 3. After section 1, I actually told TV: "Leave tomorrow." It was bad I've seen the first episodes of "Cavemen" and I still do not get there. It's not titter, guffaw, chortle, no facial movement at all. Seeing all the episodes, I will continue to punish myself, I am sure that there is something missing in this show. I just can not "get", but I think that the comedy of a major television network is an early time that it should be fun; But there's no laugh for me. There's no way ABC will put the funniest comedy of all time. I know that there is no joke that he wants to play with my brain. I have read the previous comments, I have a "social aspect", but where are the games? I will continue to suffer for at least 30 minutes per week until the bulb moment and until I hit "Eureka" when I cried.
