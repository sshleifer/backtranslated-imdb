Its a stereotypical mtv generation dance movie, and I do not see why this "not bad" is all about. The play is awful, and so they draw like all "dance" movies. It's shameful! The name should scream. "How is it moving?" When can the title of the movie forget about grammar? Some dance films have at least half a dance scene. These do not deserve a watch. I give 10 to 10 because there is no zero. Anyone with an IQ over 60 years can seriously ignore and do not lose your money. All 1.6 / 10 should say. This movie is not required.
