When I say "Doctor Who", you could create a picture of Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee or maybe Peter Davison. When I say "James Bond," surely, you will create an image of Sean Connery to think of a few people with Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan. But when I say "Sgt Bilko", everyone will think of Phil Silvers. Unlike Doctor Who or James Bond, the only role is for an actor. And with this movie version you would like to see the problem constantly watching the black-and-white show. Actually, the BILKO movie version is next to the sacrilinege of the role of the movie called Silvers
