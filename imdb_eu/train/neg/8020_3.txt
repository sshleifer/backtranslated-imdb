They had some beautiful poetic bits, but really nonsense, together or without resolution. How do these people get in the film school? Who gives them the money to make this crap? The actress could have been much better, and I always like Fairuza Bal, but come on, find that she's so tired to find something that is not an empty metaphor of an amazing surprise, and she's sure it's not doing well. movies The director needs to walk away for a long time and do not have to go back to the camera to say something. That is to say, art-making is similar to the school-walled wall, it just hopes to wear a series of pictures and serious hopes that the poetry that emerges creates a hope. It can work, if the manager has a vision of any kind, or if there is a potential, he knows he has a brain, but here there is nothing more than a space filling. It was exciting to come up with a few moments before I got there, and "you're happy" shouting when the credits appeared on the screen.
