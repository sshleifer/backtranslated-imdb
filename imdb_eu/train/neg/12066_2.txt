OK, how is the original, that is, a rich and wealthy old man, his children, who are not losers, and leaves two terrible officials in their homes for adults, if they spend their huge old house a week. Only those who did not see the movie or television show that night will be amazed. After a murder chain that kills the victims of the ketchup in the restaurant, we finish the tour. The actor has to be respectable actors for his soldiers. There are some secondary actors who also rose at that time but have long since been forgotten. As a result, the film creates all the drama and mystery of a section called "Matlock". I'll give credit to where it comes from: closing the scene is quick and fun, if it's still awake.
