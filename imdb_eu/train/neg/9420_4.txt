The "Cleopatra Jones" 1973 is much better, with Tamara Dobson's acting black actress and a stylish and strong personality agent capturing a Hong Kong heroine ring. The Blaxploitation action movie and the cross-pollination of the Kung-Fu B film are initially fun, but eventually they are flags. The final film ends at the assembly line, and Dobson seems less energetic than himself (he's still sexy and he spin on his comic-versatile conversation, but these environments may be just one thing - he's jaded). This time Stella Stevens plays criminals; It's good, but Shelley Winters can not match up front. ** ****
