This movie was like "Disney Channel after Dark". Move the "we are not evil" language and issues and dialogue and plot devices are left with the intelligence they suggest anyone who does not describe "Bell by the Bell" as a quality television. Conversation so calm and stingy, it might be thought that the script was blocked by Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas, creating a badge for all screenwriting rooms. If it was intended by Roger Kumble, the mission was fulfilled.
