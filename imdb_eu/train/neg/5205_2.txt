Minimum screenplay, minimal character development, minimal stable camera. The maximum stretched scene, the headaches max jerky zooms, causes the maximum characters around the woods to do nothing. At 12:01 p.m. until it flashes on the screen, you can move forward and do not miss anything, we know nothing about three hunters. To be fair, the movie has an interesting music, so maybe this video clip would go one way. Unfortunately, that was not the case, and we believed that we should be twenty minutes short. Forget "Man trigger", but I'm trying. - MERK
