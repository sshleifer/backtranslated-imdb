See at the Gay and Lesbian Film Fest in Philadelphia. <br /> <br /> What can I say? In my opinion, I liked it better, but it seemed to me that this play was a bit ... weak (especially when I noticed the teenage family). I mean, the script was not a star from the beginning, but the actors did not believe me. <br /> <br /> Land is predictable. <br /> <br /> Nonethels, I liked it. Characters are fun and plots do not challenge or bend. It's sweet, the characters look after each other and I'm not wrong for fifty minutes. <br /> <br /> But I do not recommend it.
