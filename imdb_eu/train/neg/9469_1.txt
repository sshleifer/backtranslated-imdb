Audrey, I know that you love your husband's Teden memory, but make his legacy worthy of justice and his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his life, while he was very good at all. We urge you to charge your stories, images, fantasies and characters. They get the power of Hollywood and Broadway. Tomorrow's children will connect them with intense and histrionistic interpretations, which will permanently burn their love of books and innocence. <br /> <br /> Make your property as you like. The advice of others I would like to hear a little bit of time. Save what remains of Dr. Seuss. Thank you.
