In addition to nonsense, there are people and religious nuts there. <br /> <br /> Characters do not make sense for most of the time. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a home, a central or a real movie. The end will not appear much. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a young man, unknown to Hazel Motes and, apparently, has returned from an army era. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He enters the house, walks around and finally writes a note that appears there. This scene is not coming out and we do not learn more about the home or its history. <br /> <br /> It has never been determined where the house is, or where people went, but we give them an impression. He probably lived there at the same time. <br /> <br /> Hazel decides to go to a city. Why we do not know After arriving in this city, he writes the name and address he sees on the bathroom wall, and this woman, surprisingly, is a thick toy, to visit. It looks a bit and apparently no longer sees. Like anything else in this movie, it's worthless and has no purpose. <br /> <br /> <br /> A young man named Enoch tries to work with his friend, but Hazel is not interested in thinking about it, even if he continues crossing the road. br /> <br /> Eno has nonsense. One of his habits is to go to a zoo and put it in front of the cages in the fireplaces, and he speaks insulting. <br /> <br /> We never know why he plays, or why Hazel does. Unlike Hazel's grandfather who overcame the overwhelming fundamentalist religion. <br /> <br /> Then he gets caught with a man dressed in Gorokila and gets gorillas. Dress her up and then work around. <br /> <br /> Hazel, who has a fairly narrow wound and seems to have a constant rage that predicts on the street. I thought he wanted to get rid of the falsehood of religion. <br /> <br /> There are several encounters with a preacher and his daughter, although their interactions do not make any special feature. point out and there are no plots. <br /> <br /> In the end, Hazel is in charge of religion and harms himself. <br /> <br /> It's a very curious film. It's interesting that it likes to do but it does nothing. <br /> <br /> It has a great booty job, but this movie fails to give a perspective or script. <Br /> <br /> The movie will occasionally cast characters around N, without any other connection to the conversation. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
