It's ridiculous. I have seen a bunch of Fassbinder movies and I found some very creative and interesting films, such as the bad and the folly. For me, it is from wealth and wealth - much less in the middle. I know that there are many fans among "the most sophisticated", but I can not think anything, but his opinion is a hype. From my point of view (and I know that I will receive a lot of negative reviews), too many films have been too fast and very self-directed. His gay or gender bending films (like this) has been a really bad trend - sloppily done, sometimes quite boring (sometimes QUERELLE and THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VANT KANT) and sometimes only gross (like this film). Could it not be better to manage a person's message of gender-based discomfort than to appear around her or cough her daughters? Show some sensitive issues and make your characters human and dignified. Then maybe I would take care of cinema. <br /> <br /> I am honest with the fact that I have not had any problems with this fassbinder movie, it looks like it looks bad.
