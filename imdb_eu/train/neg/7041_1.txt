What can you say about this movie, except for terrible shame. Tina Louise and Adam West are right to see this reason, but that's it, but their talent is wasted. I think I'm using Double as some Adamen scenes, just like I can not see. If Adam was embarrassed to be in Nightmare, think about what he should feel when he appears? If it happened before or after, I'm not sure, but yet, it's a classic Zombie Nightmare (look at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version first and last). Some groups are very annoying and overly influential by some actors. The Wild One is a rip-off featuring Marlon Brando, of course. It looks amazing. I'd rather and Adam got a good checkout! Go!
