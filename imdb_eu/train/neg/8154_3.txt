The long list of "big names" named in this flick (including the ubiquitous John Mills) did not allow me to ship the movie with real merit. It is made up of stereotypes, cartoons and aesthetic standards, humorous and rumble of the air-humored hero. The music track was a point, about an hour later, I thought the movie was finished: loud, crescendo, great growth and silence after the end, but then the movie went on! I did not find a real story, a foreign writing, but a deeply pressed uniform and a beautiful template by Jean Simmons (pre-work). I can not say that this photo makes a great film. I found maudlin, mawkish and little ones.
