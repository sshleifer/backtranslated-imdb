Oh brother ... After fourteen years of listening to this unfortunate movie, after listening to this old Peggy Lee song ... <br /> <br /> "Everything is that?" ... When I was young, when smoked fish was hit by the United States, I was young to enter the theater (although I got into the "Goodbye Columbus"). He then told us about a local movie museum - I could finally see this movie, now I was just as old as I could see my parents. <br /> <br /> This film was not the only reason. It was condemned to the anonymous residuals of the time due to the illusion of the US premiere. Thousands of millions attended this stinker, thinking about going to see a sex film ... Instead, gnarly, snake repulsive, they got a lot of nearby squares, nice shopping ... and weaker shopping centers. Who cares for simulated sex scenes with pale and rough actors. <br /> <br /> The cultural icon, the holy grail, the historical archive ... whatever it is, in a box of burning, burning and burning ash! <br /> <br /> Elite esthetics are still valid in pseudo-revolutionary pseudo revolutionaries. But if it were not a censure scandal, he would not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> Instead, the rhythmic title "I Am Blank, Blank" was repeated for many years as a pornographic qualification (Curious, Lavender - gay films, I Am Curious, Black - blaxploitation films, etc.) and ten It's about a year or roughly dead things, "R" will see a new generation of suckling "sex twisted". The evolution of the film industry "... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Please, avoid the plague ... Or you should see - lease the video and move forward simply to" dirty ". . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
