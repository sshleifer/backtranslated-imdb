Oi a condescending movie! In Los Angeles, in the center of the universe, from the Hollywood movie POV, this movie tries to focus on social triumph over the American era. <br /> <br /> Stereotyped and proud characters from different socio-economic backgrounds. Tracks go through everyday life. The land is disconnected and disadvantaged. They watch a lot of non-terrestrial arguments, such as shooting on the disk, an abandoned herb, a group that scares a lawyer, a night sky over a city over the sky, a summer camp child. <br /> <br /> And through all of these events, it is a constant dedicated to the sociological "views" given through the dialogue, as the characters realize the experiences of their lives. One character tells one another: "Sitting on the edge of this thing (Grand Canyon), you realize what a joke is about people ... The rocks make me laugh and my worries, this gigantic giant's humorous." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Another character punishes us all over the meaning: "In this country there is ruin, people with many things and people who give it up. It's not ... this huge hole is just like it's on the ground ... Gigantic As big as canoe, and what happens ... it's an eruption of rage and anger rages on violence ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The conversation is incredibly natural and forced aside In addition to the bass and proud character, apart from the dumb line, the rhythm of the story is terribly slow, the performance is well inspired and fun. The film tone is polite and self-satisfied, the contempt for the audience's letter. <br /> <br /> Hollywood They had a movie project that accepted the Hollywood outfits that pity their costumes It was, from the top. They believe that the movie will be a surprising revelation to discover the true meaning of American social change, which we do not enjoy, for those who do not know it.
