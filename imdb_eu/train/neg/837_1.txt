I saw the first two and they really liked me. Especially that the second is not good as another one. And there is only one story. You do not need to know the first movie. I also liked the movie "Free Willy". <br /> <br /> But ... the third, here is no use! I tried with a friend, both of us liked the first two. We decided to stop after a long half hour. The movie is okay, the fun pieces are fine. But what? Timon and Pumba were fun creatures in the first two films. Lion King 1 1/2 is what it is for me: the first movie has been a great deal more fun to spend, and it tells the story from its point of view. But what? I'd really like to know. You know, seeing the first idea of ​​being sitting in the cinema is nice. But the following is not necessary. Many people like to like Timon and Pumba, and so really. However, they built a lot of sections for me to be fun. There is no chance, most of all it was not fun, at least for me. By that. What was the movie anyway? A) Was Timon and Pumba or b) the first effort to make the first movie? I choose the B option and I am very disappointed about it. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch the stories: you would see "xy's story" "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" Tom should see Tom with Stoppard Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. That is really fun and there is no attempt to get more "Hamlet" out.
