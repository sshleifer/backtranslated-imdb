It is disgusting. 'Minds' are almost forecast, if you have seen any movie in the last ten years, and the fragments are low in interest (some one can make sense of the context), it's a secret because it is secret. 'It has already been shown before explaining these clues - <br /> <br /> (spoilers, bundles) <br /> <br /> The effect is decent. The story is just very interesting. The whole "premonition" scenario is not bored by projection things (it does not joke). <br /> <br /> The scene of the surgery is at the beginning more tense, slightly disturbed but then becomes trivial. <br /> <br /> It's not horrible, but it's not memorable. Terrence Howard's most interesting measure I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Boring, generally.
