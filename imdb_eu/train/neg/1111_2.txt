Johnny Rivers's closing song was the only great thing about this movie. Unfortunately, I can say about this western movie, positive. I have to write 8 more lines to publish my comments, but there are more than 8 lines in the west. I do not know that the movie is a tribute to the Hopa Along, or just a mistake. The heroine and the evil in this movie were very plastic. It is not realistic. Many of the supporting actors in this film were real, but filming took a joke. A previous commentary thought that the movie was great, and the comments were shot by President Bush. This was not a Western Democratic or Republican. It was only a bad western movie sold in commerce. I wonder if it's not money. Sometimes I saw a movie made by college students. If that happened, the movie was excellent.
