A factory in China begins with a seemingly end-to-end production line of assembly lines, Manufactured Landscapes shows the destructive effect of industrialization on the environment and traditional societies. His narrative droning assumes that in China and elsewhere, industrial development is unprecedented, as if it were not an American industrial revolution, and Karl Marx had never visited the British Museum. The fact that there is a link between the Asian unit of today's industrialization and wealth, never mentioned starving experiences and horror. <br /> <br /> We will also present the pictures of Edward Burtynsky. industrial waste "somehow" beautiful. A large part of the film is a slide for these images. They are well-produced in size from the museum, and apparently exhibited in several exhibitions. For me, however, they prove that almost any beautiful photo can appear, if it is well presented. Industrial waste is still waste in industry. The relationship between photos and the word of the film is not clear. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that there is a real problem in some industrialized countries and sometimes it is disappointed. However, the manufactured landscape offers bizarre and bitter hope. Noam Chomsky's two-hour talk. It may well be the proof of the wrongdoing left in America (and Canada).
