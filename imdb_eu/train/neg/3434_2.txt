I'm a terrifying / horrified enthusiast. I also enjoy horror movies. I like Gore. The more you have the more point and the more points. <br /> <br /> After reading the other opinions on the site, I was sure that the movie would be a bit weird. But I saw a lot of my desperation as an unmade movie. <br /> <br /> Efficiency was awful, conversations were stupid, plots were not around, special effects were useless and someone else probably died during the last 2 years. All of these features usually produce a horror movie. But not in this case. <br /> <br /> I stayed at 11 euros for this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you do not enjoy empty tricks (for example, "double sh * t"), avoid any way!
