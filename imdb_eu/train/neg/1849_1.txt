He liked to see the movement he thought was a diamond, but the only thing I found was writing maliciously, immensely executed (sequential shots are not emitted), or the director can say so. without going too far, it seems highly inspired and immature - they can be editable with 2 video players and the balance was a low budget video. I would like to say that it was not as easy as a small video game digital. <br /> <br /> There are some easy ways to solve film with the director, edit it, etc. for example But it's obvious he did not look after him. The effort for this movie is a lot of ham sandwich. It might be better, but it would be more work.
