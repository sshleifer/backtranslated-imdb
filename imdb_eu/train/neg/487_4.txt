What did the director think? Everyone who reads the biography of Artemisia is surprised to face the rape of the Renaissance in public and torture to prove that Tassi was guilty. Indeed, he shows real independence and emancipation: there is at that very momentous man his man. Why are the Renaissance films to be clinically beautiful and romantic? Are we afraid of seeing the most rugged aspect of life or Hollywood's humor is delighted? I would always defend the freedom of a director to create a reality in his film. I can not imagine putting the story of Artimisi's life in his head. The authors of this film are very unfavorable.
