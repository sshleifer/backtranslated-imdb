(aka: The Bloodsucker Dance Driving) <br /> <br /> With this bare babes you throw yourself in a lesbian scene. This movie is supposed to take place in Ireland, but it seems more to Rome and Adriatic for me. <br /> <br /> Gothic lesbians are invited to the Castle of the Count's Island at the weekend. One in one without headless women's heads seems to be missing one by one. <br /> <br /> It is not very scary or bloody, and the rooms look like light, even if candles are lit. Go to image ... (sic) <br /> <br /> The duplication is worse than usual and the plot serves as an excuse for eroticism and nudity. Directed by Euro Reno Horror Actor, this is a snoozer. <br /> <br /> Quite boring 10 out of 10
