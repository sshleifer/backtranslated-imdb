This series is very interesting to watch MST3K as a function, but it is all that is for the current public. I was surprised to see the year that it was made in 1954. In fact, given that only, is this my book solid (low?) 2. Used cars do not have a contemporary look, they look like the 30s. It's basically Cody (solitary salvation? Sheesh's eagerness talks about others like the military), however, Cody's nipple ring flew against Graber and Daley against two dumbs * ss henchman sports wrists and is a rainy pistol from time to time. pretty lame on their own, enjoy it. If you want to see a very good series, watch Flash Gordan, rockets that attack each other and a nasty Nemesis and even good women. That does not have it. And Flash was 15 or so before this crap, so you can give it a little. Something done in 1952, this is a bad thing, it's worth 2. Nuff said. If you see 6 as a MST3K episode, these guys can enjoy it; Here I'm thinking about nipples, thinking about there and I am! And now as an additional bonus, Joel and his two characters, Tom Servo and Crow, will bring you Commander Cody Theme, on The Enemy Planet's love satellite. <br /> <br /> What was being sung in the initial credits? <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVO SINGING) THE TOLL OF COMMUNICATION'S TELL OF THE COMMUNICATE IS A NEW FEATURE OF THE REPUBLIC <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> SELL YOU FIRST PREVIOUS ...
