I heard so much about this movie, it was a wonderful slasher and I only had to watch one of those early 80s that slammed hard slots for most movie enthusiasts. Well, I rented it and it is important to say that most of the suspensives are slasher ("April Fools Day", "13th Friday" and "Prom Night" and "Prom Night". Only with those mentioned above was the real illusion and potential of the characters, as well as the constant story. I found the unfortunate characters to be in this movie; In fact, her hair was noisy, her hair was loud and, of course, she reached the end with her real climatic function with the murderer. Another one would be a dirty jean jacket, who could make the movie more interesting as the movie rolled out while he called the guy while he called the lie. With the girlfriend and then kicking off his part and until the end of the waste, I was finally disappointed in his part. Regarding the real identity of the murderer, when the identity was released, I laughed, but it was obvious and told himself the truth of his attack, as well as its annoying nature. real intentions were revealed. This movie should be a minimum of observation for all fans of Slasher, but you do not have to spend money earned by the strange and difficult discovery of collectors.
