"Creepshow 2" is slightly more than the pale imitation of the original, designed with a little purpose in the name of the previous film. He also foresees the greatest defects of his previous one and is often generous. However, for the first time around, there were not enough emotions to make changes regularly-lulls, due to unbalanced but generally quite entertaining effort. The sequel has some interesting moments, so the transparency of stories is also evident. Occasionally, but there is a lot of time left. <br /> <br /> As with the original, all the stories are revenge and just desserts. It lives on a wooden Indian, bringing revenge to the killers of its owner. Teens swallow an aquatic monster. The autostatcher returns between the dead to continue the careless motor. None of these premises is inherently bad, but they are totally inspired. There are few surprises and no fear. This is an example of non-motivated books. It does not help the cheap film and the appearance that the director suffers from a four-style style, although, to be honest, it does not work much. In the end, the second story is best, but not much. <br /> <br /> In most cases, the performances are fine. George Kennedy, as the owner of the wrong store, is a good job, though not particularly inspired. Dorothy Lamour, on the other hand, is pretty good at guilty as a motorist, though he recalls his condemnation pardon though they are planned and redundant. However, most of the characters are very fine. <br /> <br /> It might be thought that "Creepshow 2" is better. George Romero, the original director, returned the script, taking into account Stephen King's stories. Makeup effects make artist Tom Savini an excellent and dull work. So why is a movie letdown? Romero was not wanted to make the second movie, but for economic reasons. A decade of horror sequel, clones, trash and others, this is undoubtedly essential. I can imagine what the writer is writing in a hurry, getting his ticket and running away. I think that he needed to finance his projects; We can not blame. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (outside ****) <br /> <br /> New photos from the New World
