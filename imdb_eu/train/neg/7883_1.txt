The Pray of Power of Prayer cover, the title and the little hidden forms trick me to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> It started very well and I went in. I really liked it. It's between 1/3 and 3/4, movies were set up and things began to be unproductive. My first thought was: "This is not someone who tells a story". I ended up watching the parts of the movie again, thinking that something was lost. <br /> <br /> When I arrived at the last 1/5 of the film, BORING, ANNOYING, RELIGION, DIALOGUE OF THE DAYTIME. He had no sense, he did not say anything, and it was annoying to listen; I turned the sound off and I went quickly. <br /> <br /> Do not waste this time with this film. Watch Whitelow Movies and Level Path Productions DVDs. . <br /> <br /> And I practice Catholic.
