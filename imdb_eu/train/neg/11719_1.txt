The character of Charles Dance's "Bollocks!" No plot, no development of characters and absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> It just does not happen in the real world (since the police inspectors were shaded shoulders in the armed spider?). Bugs (Bulgarian trains in London?). A dull and artificial conversation. Management / editing is horrible; The shots with manual cameras that add anything to the movie, are nothing but a blurry of sea sensation; mix jump cuts; no structure <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes's character is completely sympathetic: why did he care what happened to him? Direct video? Directly trash!
