I saw the trailer for this movie and I thought it was great, so I bought it and bought it. What a mistake, the performance is a shambles, the special effects (if they can be called), this would not be something to play at school. Some of the characters are so absurd in this movie, you will overcome the moments on the screen, which is unfortunately very common. Forget about a story, forget it. This is a warning, do not waste any money in this movie, it must be one of the worst things I've ever seen. Why do you like the movie with Troll 2, you will surely enjoy it too.
