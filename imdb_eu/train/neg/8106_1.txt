Seriously, why American and Frech actors speak English with the perfect English-speaking Russian accent? I am a man, so I liked a naked nudity - but a soft movie would have more of them, and at least it would not be artistic. <br /> <br /> In it, all the political expressions of tremendously educational - the director has heard the nuances? The play was wood and melodramatic, and the comic relief was never fun. The characters were very deep and I could not identify with them. <br /> <br /> The places I laughed were the actors when they cut the footage of the demonstrations in Prague. black and white, then sepia, with a wonderful foil. <br /> <br /> I have read lots of storytelling (not undeniable), and there are good things about her style of writing (although her subjects are a great fantasy of men) - and I must say, accept the movie NO EZ Kunderas .
