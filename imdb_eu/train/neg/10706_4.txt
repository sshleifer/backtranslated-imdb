Wow and Steven Segal thought it was a bad movie. Every time I thought it was worse, he showed me it was wrong. The story is good, but the actor could not move forward. Likewise, they made many mistakes about how to make archaeological senses. For example, you're not managed by artifacts unless you manage them. Castingen was the biggest crime girl in the archeologist. The actress is weak and I am realizing that her performance was less realistic than already. Over the years, the whole concept of underground knights seemed to me quite bad. I like ideas and things that disappeared, so it seemed almost disappointing. I thought the characters did not work quite well. It was difficult to find and connect with many backgrounds you did not have.
