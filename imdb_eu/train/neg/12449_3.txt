Sondra Locke gets into this movie, but she was "a horrible actress." Unfortunately, everyone else drags it (and then joins Clint Eastwood's true husband-wife, but what did Clint Eastwood think of when he agreed to a star? It was a rumored reader saying that he was going to be a real snorer, the story is a poor exception , basically no story or plot, add bored, poor, though usually good Eastwood. There is no action except in the case of arguments, except in regards to myself, this film is located at the top of natural impaired hobbies. Wow! Movies or boring Can I think it could be quite fun to grow dry paint or grass?
