In the 70's, when I first saw it, I was a secondary school. Then it was cool. Now I look back at an adult and I said ... is it? What was so funny? It has only a few moments. That's why the jokes are no longer relevant. Show this for young people and they will be totally lost. If you like this kind of humor, you want to paste it with Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon Women From The Moon. The tunnel view and Groove pipes are still visible today.
