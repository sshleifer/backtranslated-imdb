The really movie I've seen is the worst. Then Deadline I really paid Â£ 3.50 in cinemas to see this steam in a movie. An immensely dull, misunderstood, direct script, often inconsistent and overwhelmingly unimportant film genres (when Heath Ledger's sealant was sealed by a phantom priest ... what was the point in that scene? Please postcard replies ...) <br /> <br /> I should have a medal all the time that this movie lasts. I'd rather take a solid shot than sitting in front of the film. <br /> <br /> This should be thrown at the bottom of the 100th IMDb. Fortunately, the vote of 1/10 will help them in a good way.
