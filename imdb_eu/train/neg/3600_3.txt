It's a question for you, it's a question for all girls: if you have not met a man because you have intentionally called and if you continue in the most honest moments, the police will delight you or call the police. ? Yes, that's what I thought, so I could not swallow the idea of ​​putting Marti Gerrard in the care of Connor Hill. <br /> <br /> ***** MILD SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> This is a stupid story. Connor Hill's wife has died and the plot is a question that Connor calls Marti on a phone call for a co-alibi alibi? But there is a huge gap in the logic here, could not Connor attack a man? The prosecution seems something that is excluded. And was not a forensic murder in that scene? So why's the whole trial when Connor Marti dies on the phone? Mutual. Mutual. Mutual. And it's as predatory as a headless one. <br /> <br /> My permanent memory is the memory of my winter, someone who has made the winter Olympics Marti Gerrard is a truly melancholic skier.
