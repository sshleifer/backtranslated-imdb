This movie has one of the most popular films you've watched. However, this is not a headache or a headache. It seems that you are almost challenged to determine whether you want to get the movie and pay only for the money you want to give. If you do not sit through this awesome movie, you will develop a real sense of actors, they have seen better days, but you realize that they have paid a bit of money. To do this, you will feel guilty as you swore for them. I can not say that this film is horrible, in which case Ed Wood would have almost everything that would be his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> To start, you need to sit by another. Open a dialogue between you ever seen or heard, this should be five minutes. In addition, it is told that the viewer can not read as it suggests. Then we will meet Mr Slater and the incredible lines begin on the slopes as if they were only used to make lines of the line of the film line. We will soon find ourselves with Stephen Dorff, who usually enjoys it, and it does his best to drown, but it does end up. Then the last insult, Tara Reid playing an intelligent role, oh helped us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and, in a way, she's working on film continuously, although she thinks she should be tied to American film films. <br /> <br /> You can watch it all when you get the video out. I know I got a shot, I mean honest here, sometimes convenient. the lack of others.
