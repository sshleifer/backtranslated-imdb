Eyes of the Werewolf (1999) is a really bad movie. The premise was really good, but in general, the execution was awful. I wanted filmmakers to take time with this project to enter the production. Some blind eye picks up new eyes, it's bad for an old young man. Bad things happen when it becomes a creature that looks like evil. Can not find cure to find out about her hot girlfriend? Who is this weird little sailor that helps the police? If you really want to know, check Ohart's eyes! <br /> <br /> It's not a bad idea for the movies. The filmmaker could spend a lot of time on pre-production before deciding to shoot the movie.
