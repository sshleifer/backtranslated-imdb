It's believed to be Freddy's latest movie (it's been over 10 years). I think it would try to get a short film. But they gave us the worst of the series (and this is said a lot). The plot does not make sense (I do not remember remembering it), the main characters were all stupid (I really wanted those dead) and Freddy was worse than usual. Johnny Depp (that is, the first movie "Nightmare" was the first remote ") was remotely very good. <br /> <br /> I was the last episode I saw originally in the theater (considering Freddy's childhood) It was 3-D - Well - 3-D were damaging - blurred colors and no focus on the picture. It was terribly frightening that I had three flying skulls (I think) reacting to my audiences, everything broke up laughing. It seems worse on TV 2 -Non foolish and stupid - very sad. Skip this and watch again "Freddy vs Jason."
