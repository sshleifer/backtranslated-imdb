Everyone who has written "Redline" has had to pay a great car movie by Daniel Sadek to promote this bizarre and peculiar pepper of amateur amusement streets. Easily the worst movie automobile or any movie ever made. This Showgirls looks like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Each one of the clause that comes out of the 80s action series is set, with special effects and difficult characters that you can use and Daniel Sadek's proof of it. Do not write scripts and produce movies, but they should be in the real estate business. <br /> <br /> This is a lame movie and lame plot, and never invented action sequences. I do not think that the makers of this film are stupid, but they think they are a public movie as idiots that fall from this criminal.
