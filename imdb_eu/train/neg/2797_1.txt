I am a fan of the horror genre! I love all kinds of fears / slasher / gore. Some of my favorite horror films are "good". But this film has no doubt! I will not give too much time about what's wrong with that. <br /> <br /> The script is awesome. The play is horrible. FX is not a worthwhile argument too. "Set" is an absolute JOKE! It's sad that I think the actors can have a real potential in a couple, but this vehicle does not work for anything !!! <br /> <br /> It's enough to say that I've seen "free". and I feel stolen !! You would have a better time to watch this cat flossing.
