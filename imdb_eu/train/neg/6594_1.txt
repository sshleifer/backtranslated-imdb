I've seen all the classic Laurel and Hardy movies. I've always enjoyed the comic sting, after seeing it again and again. This new film tries to recover the classical new Laurel & Hardy, which looks like new actors but fails for different reasons. One of them is how dressed places (at the beginning of the 20th century) were, however, imagined in the 90s. They brought back some first conversations. However, it is not unfortunately going to the classic series. This movie has always been the worst and most humble movie ever I've ever seen and should block it permanently. They're dying to kill real Laurel and Hardy imitations.
