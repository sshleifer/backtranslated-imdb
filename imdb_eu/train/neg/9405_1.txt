I've seen this on TV and what I can say, but I've never seen the worst movie! I was embarrassed in the Melbourne movie. Diabolical play, amateur makeup effects and really bad soundtrack. As for the plot, yes, even more stupid! Some scenes surprised me, as it was bad. For some reason, these types of films have been set up on night-time television - because they are silly! Avoid at all costs.
