The latest rumor around Vh1 has begun calls with I Love New York in 2008. Does that mean that Budah or Tailor made out into New York or does that mean that New York has won? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> I've heard some rumors that I'll love to return to New York for the 3rd season! I have also heard rumors that New York will be featured in the Love of the Flavor section. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it's not that I had a great spoiler at the I Love New York 2 ... I 'Last rumor.
