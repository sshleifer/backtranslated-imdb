This is the strangest piece of litter that I have ever missed. I can only say that thanks to God was just one hour. More than half of "Film" is the original footage of "Criminal madness". At least, I saw the remarkable classic of exploitation, because my video store was able to see "Criminally Insane II" (such as "Crazy Fat Ethel II") a great challenge for some reasons. But the rest of this movie will be the backyard for playing home video games and never seeing it. Why is my video store not the original? Why do these things work in video stores? Why do they rent people and do not copy them immediately after watching the horror stream they copy? Why - SUCCESSFUL - Why, God, why? <br /> <br /> If you do not like eating fruit that is annoying to enjoy the whole bar slow down in slow scene or if you like fruit that flows from the stairs stairs. or a character who turns sideways (do not ask) back, or the brain cells to monologue wife to poison their wives and then talk about a person who has complained or complained about everything. You have to watch the food soup overdue, or just Crazy Fat Ethel to dance with a bloody knife in the garden: Do not watch this movie. Repeat: NOT watch the movie. Do not rent this movie. As much as possible, do not go to a video game store with a copy of the setting of this movie. You can still save it, but now it's too late for me. . .
