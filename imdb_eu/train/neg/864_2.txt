Even though there is a repertoire of more than 180 movie titles, this "Succubus" often names the best movie Jess Franco. Fish, though the mythological filmmaker Fritz Lang tells Succubus among his favorites. So maybe it's for me, but I thought film was boring and very confusing. The inauguration is very good, and Janine Reynaud plays SM on the stage. Unfortunately, it's down here, unfortunately. Reynaud is a man of character who eventually kills lovers. Franco works well and works well in beautiful locations, brilliant photography and brilliant music. This could not be his biggest movie, if not in the case of funny and interesting stories. It is supposed to be a psychedelic, but I would say that sophomoric is a better term for the description of what appears here. Half a half of time, you do not think what's going on or what it means, so 80-minute short-ending seems to be too agile. Without a doubt, this is not the best Franco film that has been with me. I would not recommend it for exploitation as well. If you want to search for a great movie by Jess Franco, try to get out of the hands of "Las Vampiras", "Orloff, the scary Dr." or "Vampire female."
