I was encouraged to see previous comments on TCM when it appeared, but it was a serious disappointment. Lupe Valdez is great, but does not have enough screen time. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette are well-known characters, but they are hopeful, but the scripts are stranded. jerk "Citizen" reactions are misguided and unbelievable, as the "shenanigans" seem to be influential writers. And Lupe Velez believes that he can fall into the same nature. <br /> <br /> The "pillow liners" referred to in the revision should be dependent on the observer, because I did not even realize it was trying.
