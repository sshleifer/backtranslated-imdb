I am a great brand of Neil Young's music, and with it, I found the first show of Greendale, thanks to the incredible praise of high-indie press presentations. My enthusiasm persisted, because this filthy tale and weak lyrical moments were filthy asleep or disappointed. <br /> <br /> Neil says the movie started as a soundtrack and the characters created so much life. he shot the soundtrack. It's not the best way to make a story. The character does not have an arc, and when events are "significant", the viewer does not care, because the technical imbalance levels of the film are so high. The movie is a song that ends up singing the characters while the songs are sung ... the first stanza is performed by the technique and then rounds it off. It does not feel real or false, it feels good. <br /> <br /> The tremendous impact, the character finds only one mood and plays it all. In a few lightings. The only movies that can be used as a movie set include several scenes recorded as a new image, but this technique is being used so much in the cinema as today, as this film does not go a bit further. A good soundtrack, but I'm not buying fast. Bad movie
