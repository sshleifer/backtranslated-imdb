Actually, I did not really expect this movie out of America. Sexual abuse of the child is just a matter of becoming a "thriller". Auteuil (which I had previously admired) was a kind of saving on the children because Rambo was ignoring and insulting all the exploits exploited throughout the world. <br /> <br /> What a surprising heart is on the ground and the film "Happiness" is a year after this film came out. Menges and his associates must be ashamed of themselves. It's amazing reading some of the most intelligent viewers. They could see the bad and ridiculous management of this matter. If you think it's a great movie, they show great ignorance and you have to see "happiness" to open your minds to the real horrors of pedophilia. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hmm ... I wonder. They have to make a movie about international slavery for any type, they owe all realistic and emotionally, instead of push-button boosts. 1/10
