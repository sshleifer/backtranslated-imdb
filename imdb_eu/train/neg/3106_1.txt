Ever since I create a list of the worst absolutist movies I've ever seen, it's always a movie. It does not have any kind of salvation. He had to take a voluntary act to cross the whole thing, and I would rather spill my blood instead of sitting down again. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with that? You told me to see the story of my trip to the theater. <br /> <br /> I went to a show on Saturday night. I was the only theater myself, and loud, noisy, unpleasant teenagers, and sitting behind me. Of course, they got a good night on Saturday night and they came to this "comedy" to laugh. Before starting the movie, they started preaching, laughter and joking and commented on the old era. The boundary was annoying; They kept real real enthusiasm for the real movie, maybe I could say something, but I felt enthusiastic and enthusiastic about their lively fun, so I left him. And they settled when the movie started. <br /> <br /> Why do I tell you all this? I think this "supposed comedy" did not only affect myself, but this range does not work. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, a single theater person laughed. Not once Not myself, not wrong children. Absolute silence, apart from the soundtrack. And when the movie was over and when the lights were lit, all of us, all of us, got a theater in a slow, dark, and absolute silence. It could be a funeral. <br /> <br /> This was an effect created by this "comedy". Do not laugh or enjoy, but absolute DEPRESSION. The movie was depressing and depressing, and it is not the most curious. Preachy, self-indulgent, depressing, but not funny. <br /> <br /> I think Mel Brooks's most fun movie "Blazing Saddles" for Funniest Movie Ever. I still feel that the same gentleman might surely be the least responsible of the film. <br /> <br /> In short: if you feel happy, give this film a whirlwind; otherwise, do not say that you did not warn.
