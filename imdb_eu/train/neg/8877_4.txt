'Major Payne' refers to a sailor who lives a small group of his boys. This movie does not offer a lot of offers, but offers fun moments that deserve a watch. Do not expect a memorable movie. I hope to scatter it in the movie and at the expense of others. The conflicts between Payne and the boy were ridiculous, and I remember that movie except those who want to revenge all of Main Payne. Again, it's not an excellent movie, and surely it's best to see it on rainy days when you need some laughter.
