I pulled my girlfriend out of the theater I created my reality and went to a mother. (G-friend and I) have been here for about an hour. At what age is a pseudo-scientific scientific argument. <br /> <br /> Atomic underlying particles are thoughts? Writing labels of water bottles and blessing a Buddhist monk, beautiful crystals rose? A 25% drop in mortality occurred when DC occurred when there was a lot of meditation. Wow, what a rigorous scientific study. I'm sure someone eats happily four days in a row. Did we conclude that eating happily has decreased the rate of murder? <br /> <br /> Hogwash, hooey, bull pucky! <br /> <br /> BTW- Ramtha was worshiped, and one of the leaders of the filmmakers was "experts". There are no other reasons here, right?
