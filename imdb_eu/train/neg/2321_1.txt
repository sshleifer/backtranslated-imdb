I can not believe that this show is still 10 out of 10 points. Whether it was a vote in the first two seasons or not, but what would be the consequence of continuing to be such a level? Season 1 was a great fan. I am passionate about - mystery, suspense, all unexplained events. You never knew what would happen next. During season 2, I honestly watched, but I was a little frustrated without explaining some basic things. And instead of giving more answers, it seemed more questions. I AM LOVE, but people have to throw a bone once and for all to keep them going. <br /> <br /> Now, I can not remember what eventually turned me on, but 2 season somewhere, I was just enough. I do not see a lot of glances at the point, and you can not clearly pass a passage about what happens. So, it's not worth the effort for me. <br /> <br /> It's pity to be the smartest and most intelligent among loyal fans. I want to point out that ABC has shown a few photos, and that's how it's time to see how long it can take. They do not know that they will lose more pastness than theirs.
