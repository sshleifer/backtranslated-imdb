I searched for a copy of The Forest as I was watching a special VH1, I think "Where Are They Now" and I saw the video box on the Corky Pigeon segment of the actor. This terrifying mind was playing with a horrible child, but I remember Freddy from his show of silver cookery. This flick is a big letdown. There's nothing here. In fact, they took me four months from the beginning to the end. I kept getting bored, left and forgot about it, and then I went back and tried again. Of course, the opposite angle of this film was to distinguish between its parties as a supernatural element, appearances. And, of course, here's not that. I can not keep male carriers. I had seated the long conversations among the long conversations to read cheat lines. In pairs, initially, the couple is a difficult and ordinary situation that decides to go abroad. I think the only positive thing to say about this thing is that the guy falls and breaks his leg, and you can see that the bone is out of the flesh. This make-up is pretty good. Man, I'm really getting positive now, huh. This is another unofficial horror movie, Home Sweet Home.
