After looking for a high and small film, I actually found the least I expected, one day I played in the Sundance Channel very early in the morning. Because I've searched for a small vanity project in the last years of the Chuck Barris series, I have no idea. The movie is horrible. This is about a week in a week. Of course, the importance of the movie is to see real actors who "dismissed the heat of television" or undeniable reason. That part is still horrible, but it was a pretty fashionable one. Now, I've been looking for so much time when I've seen it again I see it in my life again? Horrible NO !! Please do yourself a favor and see "Confessions of a dangerous world" much better, or find the old copies of the show itself. The young girls just had fun at the dockwalkers, but when they saw Jay P. Morgon, they had to be exposed to the audience. From the point of view, I am very pleased that this flop was massive, because, if it had been a success, it could be "$ 1.98 Beauty Show Movie" and my friends would bring the Apocalypse. <Br /> <br /> My grade: D
