This movie says a lot of people, it's one of the most brutal of all time. When I see it, I can say that there is no such claim. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie, of course, is dirty. But, in general, the execution was no doubt. Even the last scene (eye balloon) is not really bad. I expected something mad, lower quality, low budget Violent Sh! The lower quality given in films like T. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to watch the real movie will be disappointed because it is not there. It's not a story (though probably most people know it). Gore enthusiasts will be disappointed, against belief, blood and guts are very few. The actress who plays the victim might be the worst in history. <br /> <br /> Whatever people say, the movie is not moving. Avoid.
