I agree with the last reviewer that this movie had a great performance. Yes, there were many nudes and bumps. But the slow and absurd and endless line was obscured. How could this be shot: Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? The hostel is a movie much better and I would recommend it instead. If you have turned off subtitling Spanish subtitles with the technical bundle that you have with DVD, it is advisable to go back to the main menu and translate it back afterwards. Also, do not delete your time in the deleted scenes, because there is no audio and it seems to be a tourist.
