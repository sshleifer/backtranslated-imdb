Perhaps when I saw that I was so young, innocent, and BRAINWASHED, this film made me feel sunk for me. I have not seen it on the seventh level since I was in a preschool school, so I do not know what the effect would be right now. However, I would say - and most of my friends. It serves the purpose, until we know at least age and age, to analyze and create our opinions. Particularly transformed by the Christian post-rapture I was afraid of those who did not receive the trademark of the beast. I do not want anybody who does not want to watch the movie, so I do not mention the scene details, but it still seems to me ... and it's been 19 years.
