When I first watched this movie, I thought it would come from the children's section - it's very funny and sometimes humorous, and a story is really good, but actors like Meg Ryan and Tim are missing "romantic chemistry." Robbins are able to deliver it. I have to bear in mind that Walter Matthau is a perfect match for Albert Einstein, and his performance is extraordinary, but there is only one exception. This movie seems to force a little, there is no directional substance, and yes ... the music is terribly terrifying, it's not very good humor. But if you do not expect the intelligent and comic story of comedy / love, then this might be fun, as I said ... it should be in the children's section. Einstein and his friends are a good relief because Tim Robbins gets bored in the pursuit of robbing the heart of Meg Ryan. A very conflicting movie, but not serious, can be a wonderful movie.
