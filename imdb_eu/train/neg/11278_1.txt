This film is just one of the worst movies ever made, and not only is the British film industry, but also a very talented hack in today's work. The film has got its main distribution and has a good cast of British actors. What happened wrong? I do not know, and I just do not like the compromise with the debate, because the movie is so scary. You can be warned and away from that dirty. but apparently I have to write ten lines of text in this review, so I will describe it in detail on the plot. A friend of a man places himself out of his father's company with his bad friend and colleagues and, therefore, with the Russian mafia and stupid and stupid accents he finds himself very stupid with land / devices. I should ask for my money, but, nevertheless, excitement as a result of experience. If you want a good movie of crime, watch traditional suspicions or godfathers, what happened, blockage, merchandise ... is the climax of today's British crime film ...
