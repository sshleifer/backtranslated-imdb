This movie seemed to me embarrassing to see. I felt that when I got in my necklace, I did not receive any nuances, I needed a voice to write them constantly. <br /> <br /> A father is still alcoholic, I did not really feel a movie about alcoholism. In my opinion, alcoholics, real alcoholic be very lonely people. It's hard to communicate; The problem of the main character was not really there, but he said that he had a problem saying that he loved you, that is, the effort to establish his cold nature. He was constantly surrounded by people! <br /> <br /> I felt sorry that we were not in any way alone with the character to achieve a sense of inner solitude and agitation. I could not connect with the character and felt no connection with my father. When I was done I did not feel it, it was just a relief. <br /> <br /> Kevin McKidd is a good actress, but it's not a nonsense protagonist! The orange watch was as subtle as the brick thing. McKidd was too old for the adolescent, he should get three characters or avoid the stage of teens and he got more in McKidd. <br /> <br /> In a good note, I thought the actor was really good at the beginning of the film !!
