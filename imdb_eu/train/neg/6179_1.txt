This movie is the second worst thing I've ever seen (the first being the Ghost Rider). There is no need for any unnecessary detail in portraying any story, no weather, no conflicts. This film is simply an excuse to show Toby Keith by his man, and it's "really hard." I was completely wasting my time watching the movie. The best part should be the final credits. When I was Ebert or Roper, I would cut it with my fingers and I would throw it to the producers. Goodbye to whom gave Toby Keith a great feature, which is, of course, the mental level he has. As a result, do not miss this time to watch the movie, and maybe you'll regret it.
