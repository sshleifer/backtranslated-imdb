This is one of the most depressing film experiences in my life. Beautiful title, excellent director (before I saw "For For" and "Drugstore Cowboy"), and - Uma Thurman cast. How are you wrong? This is the turkey that I saw after a few hours, the question that accelerates my temple. at all costs. The critical market was well-deserved. Here is one of those strange movies that is not just a recovery quality. Zero ****
