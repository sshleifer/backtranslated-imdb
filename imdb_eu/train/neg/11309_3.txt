Bad plot (even suitable for a B-movie), good fast running scenes, maximum 10 to 10. But something has always bothered me about this movie: of course, Mariska Hargitay never speaks? In the television version, he shares a special intimate with Jeff Speakman and a kiss in the garden. However, in the traditional (video) version, most of the scenes are cuts and never speaks. This hurt her because she is not just a female (though paying attention) physicist for physical film, but she also feels incredible. This movie would be better if the scene is maintained, at least in those scenes it emphasizes, according to what Speakman says.
