Well, what can I say about this movie? I have spoken. In my opinion, this movie is definitely stupid, although the only thing that was going out of me was music. And to overcome all that, he commented on someone who liked it. All of them have to say that all the time Bruce Lee was the main character of the era of martial arts that had destroyed one of the best films. He was alive and if he ever found this movie, he would be terrified. The rest of the films are absolutely ridiculous and the loss of the tape. I'm telling the tape because such movies could not be filmed. Now I feel stupid because I've lost 30 minutes of my life. The only reason I saw it because it was because I downloaded my curiosity from my illness. What is this world?
