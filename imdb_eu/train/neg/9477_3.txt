It must be one of the most divine wrestlings of that time and will be saved only for 2 games. Edge and Mick Foley, the hardcore match between Vince Mcmahon Shaun Michaels. The main event between Cena and Triple H was a complete cleansing and, to be honest, I was asleep, it was so depleted, it was worth noting that undertaker was a match that was worthy of appearing and it was a match between Boogie Man and Booker. full joke If you are a great fan of WWE and if you missed the first days of WWF and Wrestlemanias 17 and 19, you will probably love it. But I found that Wrestlemania wanted a lot.
