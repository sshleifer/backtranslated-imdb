What ?! ?? Why are people saying that they "get out of their minds"? Face to face is one of the worst endings in the history of cinematography! Leave 4 and the whole world is over! 9 people were stupid while everyone was killed. It was all the time right, if it had not been sacrificed by 9, it might have happened. People gave her stupid life and what? ... to make rain? I accept that the movie has parts, and the whole concept was wonderful. But many of them were clich√©s after each other. And did someone else feel this feeling like "Lord of the Rings"? The characters died for stupid reasons, there was hardly any character development, and honestly ask yourself it's good to be leaving four men in the world; nonsense and fool. It was one of the shortest films I've ever seen and thank God! How will the robots affect human creativity? It's been done a hundred times! This movie is stupid, watch movies like Star Trek, The Hangover, or Inglorious Basterds, they've seen good movies!
