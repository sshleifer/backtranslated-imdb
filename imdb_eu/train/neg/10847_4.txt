The directed cut version, which I saw, was very long for this type of movie. It's almost two hours too long. If you choose, you will be cut off for non-directors. <br /> <br /> The main plot is almost unimaginable, the film is involved in some murder scenes, but the feeling connected to the film is only shown to be violent. The connection was not revealed until the end of the section and I was scared when I was there. <br /> <br /> It does not work as a horror film. You never get feelings about the characters with similar actions and general attitude (the character is presented, 15 minutes later the character is dead). This image has strong sides on the sides.
