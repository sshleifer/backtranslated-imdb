Agree, aside from the psychedelic background images, the information presented here was good. It could not make music (there was no bad music, it was not just for this movie). <br /> <br /> Regarding the content of the film, the director often explains. - The pagan perspective on the being of Christ and the amazing comparison of the acts and events of Christ's life before the mythological characters and gods of Mithra and Dionysese. Then he explains the chronology of Christianity and shows a good case, but it did not make me wandering. <br /> <br /> If the director is joining with the events and if they continue with them, this film would have been good. However, at the time of the film, Mel Gibson's "Passion of Christ" and its director of youth came into the group of delusional attacks against private Christian schools. In an interview with his old director (that is, when the director explained that he had made false arguments), I thought the director was a kind of childhood. He was doing good questions but, like the same film, this conversation was attacked by rules of this particular private school, not Christianity. <br /> <br /> However, if you are interested in some information, see it for 30 minutes or more afterwards.
