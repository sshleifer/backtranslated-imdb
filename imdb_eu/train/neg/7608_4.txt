I confess that I do not expect much from Roger Corman's film. In general, I expect a lot of wrong walking and scripting. However, in this case I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Gunslinger is a story of a woman made by Beverly Garland, who takes her husband as a sheriff who dies brutally. Mrs. Garland shot herself quite well, the next day she murdered a killer from her husband's funeral. The first bar of the town is breaking down the local bar. The owner of the bar is making an effort to buy land for the (expected) purchase of the railroad. However, Mrs. Garland is a thorn in her plans, and a bar matron is hired by a man to kill Garland. <br /> <br /> With Garland doing his job honestly and realistically, he is not completely tempted. With Suzanne Somers, "Sheriff is" jokingly. Except for a couple of faux passages (the door of the apartment inside, the jeep tracks, and the two knights wait on the corner to corner their corner), the movie is pretty good as a movie fee. However, Corman could not keep the film in line with the scenes of the horses, just like in other films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
