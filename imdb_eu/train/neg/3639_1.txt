This movie is dissipated from the beginning (especially) until the end. You may not be worse off, such as theater, photography, camera work, etc. It's not bad, very, very bad. <br /> <br /> But that's why it's "great", we'll give you more than good luck. Worse, better! <br /> <br /> I really do not think what these people were doing to make such a movie. Viking movie serious? The story is ridiculous, like a disguised comedy, as nice as a mafia, useless but funny curse. <br /> <br /> And look at the end of the movie ... uhum.
