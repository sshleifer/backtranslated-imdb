This play, before the BBC showed that 30 years ago, would be something different from that time. That's why they would find some pretty scary people and could be surprised by special effects? <br /> <br /> Looking at today's play, it does not seem scary. Since, though, special effects may well be desired. <br /> <br /> Should a train be clear to a dark tunnel RED LIGHT? I do not think ... but if you re-play it, you will see that the first train entering the tunnel will be done through RED LIGHT! (maybe this was the time of the dickens)? <br /> <br /> You will also notice that the path that goes down the box to the signal is very rugged and in poor condition. Surely Signalman would have a hand-held, easy-to-handle handwheel, cut-in or down. (I can not detect such things) <br /> <br /> I do not take any action, Denholm Elliott (signal) and Bernard Lloyd (passengers) have given great performances. <br /> <br /> I do not know what happens ... Yes, the ghost was a traveler, or what was ... Does anyone really understand the abominable story? (maybe I'm not the only one)? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This play has a wonderful atmosphere. nature It has not been terrifying these days, it has a few confusing places in some places and has unusual signage practices ... <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading my review.
