If you've seen Dukes at risk, you know, you should never worry about raw behaviors seen by children or young people. If you have seen the movie, are you no longer doing this! This movie was HORRIBLE! Thinking about the main characters that are doing drugs and having fun and fun is not what I call entertainment. They took the wonderful show and turned it into a trash. Daisy, who was a little bit like a show at the show, now looks like she looks in the corner of her paid service. Seeing this movie I was so excited to leave before I left in the movie for 15 minutes. I thought I needed to be better, but it turned out worse for a minute. I have never seen this movie. She let trashed a good show and left nothing but a huge taste in my mouth. Get yourself aside, go see your money worth noting, not only because of the loss of money, but the loss of 2 hours of your life will never return!
