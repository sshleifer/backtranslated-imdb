This movie is rewritten by the 1978 Warren Beatty movie "Heaven Can Wait", but it's written for Mr Rock's comedy style. The same premise remains: Lance Barton (Rock) takes place before her life and the Deputy Viceroy, Mr. King, agrees to return to someone else's land. Like Beatty; Charles Wellington, who chooses a wealthy white man, thinks that while he is dying at Wellington's home in Wellington, Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) seems to be. Mrs. Wellington and her lovers' duties are backed by this remake and it does not work out in favor of a black suit that is looking for Sera. Also, the interveners that were used to show the true whites of Rock Wellington and then Wellington fail. Improvements in the original plot of Hobty could be done. By default, they did not portray their life after they died, but they were certainly not found "Down to the Ground."
