I rarely leave the movie without seeing the whole show. This is especially true when I rent a DVD. I refused Syria. I turned off in the middle of the roads. <br /> <br /> This movie is disconnected, boring, confusing and obscure. The play was dry and without a credible portrait. The plot was good overall, but it was boring and boring because it failed to understand my attention or interest. Underwater plots often failed to connect to each other and random stories seemed like a real connected plot. Badly a serious subject and so great actors could be bad. I can not imagine that this movie has not been nominated for a prize.
