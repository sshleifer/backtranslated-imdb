What a horrible movie. I can not believe that I'm seeing this rewrite in my life for 90 minutes. Tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer were the stars of this movie? Mehki Pfifer is great, E.R and Ving Rhames probably did not know what he was doing. That's why I feel. I have to say that the music scene has not had a story with AT ALLLLL, and it is amazing how to find these directors who create a correct and balanced film that is not correct. I hope that in the future it might have been such as not to be a director, to destroy an excellent classic film. This movie was not first done. To give advice to all those who have seen it, please, I would not have been able to see me as well for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> !!!!!!!! -10 to 10
