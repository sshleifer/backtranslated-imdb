Here's nothing new. All romantic and standard comedy scenes, even at the airport taxi down the road to stop the woman far away. The only thing that keeps it up is that Alison Eastwood and some of the smaller characters (blink and miss Gabrielle Anwar) will be, of course, fun. <br /> <br /> Turn on the pair if you're lucky and you do not have to overcome the mandatory pain.
