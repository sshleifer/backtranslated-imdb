I only saw this movie, because Olivier Martinez was shocked by SWAT. But this is not SWAT. SWAT had a plot and nice character and it made sense. The bulls did not have one of them. <br /> <br /> I realized that it could not be in any way, after all, Michelle Forbes was always a great player. <br /> <br /> Here's an inconsistent film called movie. Another has called the worst movie. Both films gave too much credit. I am very happy for the library, but I am still extracting it. <br /> <br /> The film's "0" must include the "rated" vote in the movie, a movie like this.
