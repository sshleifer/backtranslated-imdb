Harry Alan Towers looks like another piece of cinematic tape. According to H. Rider Haggard, the somewhat similarity of Haggard's writings is made in Africa (even if it is a dinosaur African, our brave adventurers who use raptors to extract pirogue)! Some characters of the same name. <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) looked for treasures, only armed with a medal and the treasure where it is just ends. choice On the way they gather huge monsters, they get a French chef and they have a relationship with McCallum Queen Phenicia. <br /> <br /> It's so horny. That's right I did not give a single reason.
