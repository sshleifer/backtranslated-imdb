Michael Caine has always claimed that Ashanti was "the only movie he made money" and that he "never played the worst movie". Hold on, Michael Strogoff, would not Swarm and Hurry Sundown? And were not these two movies worse than Ashanti? Perhaps Cain remembers physically punishing a film of 130 degrees Fahrenheit action film (director Richard Fleischer was hospitalized in the sunshine film). What really creates Ashanti is not a low career for Michael Caine. Instead, the chase thriller is very average, with a talented cast, exotic locations, a boring space and a very formulaic story. <br /> <br /> Dr. David Linderby (Caine) is a doctor at W.H.O., Anansa is being destroyed when his black wife (Beverly Johnson) is missing out on an assistant help from a African tribe. Linderby gradually realizes that his wife has been captured by the slave trader - led by Suleiman (Peter Ustinov) - and continues to pursue the continent's pursuit of the Middle East. <br /> <br /> On the way, the invisible stars are the most effective and useless roles. William Holden has a riot champion; Omar Sharif shows his usual charm or grace as a million unbelievable prayers; Rex Harrison looks bored as a helpful contact, as Cain helps her to find her. This famous author, Alberto VÃ¡squez-Figueroa, is based on the movie based on the best Ebano movie, but the suspense that made the book so popular does not take part in this adaptation. Ustinov is as charismatic as slavery (it seems that his performance in all his films does not seem to be bad), and Caine creates a compelling gravity for men who have never seen his wife ever. From time to time, the action is shining, but all Ashanti is very slow. After all, the act of action is a permanent hokum - it does not cain often suggest a truly horrible thing, but it's not inspiring film and away from all the involved talents.
