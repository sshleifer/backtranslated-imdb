I saw the convent for the second time. I enjoyed it beforehand and I thought it would be a good drunk movie on Friday night, some gore, some style, humor and the like. I was sad that I did not find it much appreciated. Someone seems to have guessed it as a modern spectator like a demon night like a cheerleader theater, but he lost his worth of the original value. I'm not a record fan of Night of the Demons, but there were a few things I've been punishing around. Convent makes cheese, but not so much goodness. Not only was the girl (not a nice actress Joanna Kanton) but the sweet atmosphere of Adrienne Barbeau was not very hard on all the characters. The film has serious difficulties with nude nudity, that is to say, it is difficult to see the characters and see the good points of the hard-hitting movie. The wicked worms have an original design and they get good scenes, but they are not terrifying, they are definitely very enjoyable, and the movies have sharp gores. At the end, when he becomes credible in the film Adrienne Barbeau, the evil people are killing everyone and the evil sunshine is being innocent. Stylized guidance also sometimes yields good results, although sometimes the camera is moving faster. After all, this was a movie for me, because the brightness of the best points could not hurt things I hated. Those who like these movies are much more enjoyable, but it was not good for me.
