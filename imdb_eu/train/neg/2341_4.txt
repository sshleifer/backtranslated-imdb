Well ... until now, Barman fans have only commented on this movie to get a counterpoint. Warning, this writing is * LONG *. <br /> <br /> Non-known people (most of them non-Belgians): Tom Barman, the director of this film, is a pioneer of the dEUS, one of the most popular. End of the 90's band in Belgium. Basically, they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative collections and quickly appeared on a national level. Afterwards, the egos took off and the band fell basically, Barman and others, continuing to make discs under dEUS-monicker. In these cases it always happens, the post-fault dEUS was much less and less interesting than the original. In 1999, the label "The Ideal Crash" strived for an international breakthrough, greatly reducing their style of songwriting. They did not quite do it. However, it seems that egos are quite large: Barman will have enough for an artist to have the artist enough to test the movies. <br /> <br /> Unlike most, it's a very bad thing, and that's because the movie does not have an exception. Barman made clear about * art, but rather a mistake. For some reason, it is a musician, not a film director. For others, dEUS makes your favorite and efficient music, but a close proximity to what you would think of art. Show it <br /> <br /> So what's this? In essence, he tells a story about people who are totally uninterested, on Friday in Antwerp, who tells stories unrelated to Fridays most interestally, because things that are of no interest are even more ineffective. The characters are shallow, the plot does not make sense, and the movie only has other exceptions to get some shortcomings. Humor The whole movie smiled three times regularly (and a little bit), and it really could cause a single second laughter (not the highest one). Mood The film does not show emotion or feelings. Mystery Well, (* MINOR SPOILER *), the idea of ​​"wind-man", inspired by the name of the movie, is just as fiery as the banana pepper pizza, and it's been done a thousand times before (Johny Destiny remembers). - One of the worst appearances of Tarantino's film (* END MINOR SPOILER *). And, therefore, his * art *, therefore, does not expect any kind of real action for the above. In other words, except for a few smiles, my shorts got bored. <br /> <br /> So what's left? Well, the soundtrack is pretty good, although it has the same problems as the other OST has shown lately: first of all, the movie seems to be just a commercial CD. Secondly, Barman tries to hide the content and emotional content of songs, leaving behind the quality of song content. In the end, the movie only makes an illustration of the songs. Unfortunately, Barman is paying more attention to the soundtrack, although I am the weakest part of the soundtrack. In the end, he clearly shows that Barman knew more than just movies. The camera's work is fine, but you're not glad to cry. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this movie that watched me was watching. Since I was from Antwerp, it was fun to play a similar game of guessing. I would hardly believe in quality. <br /> <br /> In the end, another option has been lost due to the rugged movie. In the end I realize that the best Belgian films have been coming out of the French country lately. This is, above all, at least something telling and managing both a sharp and emotional account (the Daerden brothers have come to mind). It is possible that even the provinces should also be the architects of the province.
