Being prohibited as a "Video Nasty" in the UK, Unhinged has naturally gained a significant impact. However, the most amazing thing I found about the film was in its departments in its departments. I was able to get the blood killer: dramatic play, editing incorrect, dramatic direction, poor script and red soundtrack were much more difficult. <br /> <br /> Three girls in the music festival enter a cliff in a cliff. storm. It saves a stranger from a neighboring house. The owner of the house, an awesome old lady and a widowed daughter, welcomes the girls, allowing them to recover a few days. However, someone does not want to leave the girls anymore! Suddenly they strike each other as an attack. <br /> <br /> For a long time and some of the worst performances ever made in the horror film (which some do), Unhinged is really a horrible movie. Music is a total mess (it seems that a boy in a synthesizer is released from a three-year-old boy), which is why he will complete the movie perfectly. The ending scene is just a couple of bloody and saves unlimited nudity to achieve the lowest possible Unhinged score. <br /> <br /> You are unfamiliar (and unfortunately), you will want. See this, to dial off the video trash list. But notice, really, it's really bad.
