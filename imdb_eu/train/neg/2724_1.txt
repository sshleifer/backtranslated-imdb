I would like to say that I understood that this filmmaker did not like to understand that many people did not understand and that it was impossible to fully understand ... A very unusual attempt at a land line. <br /> <br /> I do not like to throw this word out, but in this case it is very well suited. The director first makes the material "arrogant" and worse. Inconsistent material is presented in an inadequate material request, when the director remembers the first scene, and reminds the viewer arrives at CARE when they wait for us 2 hours. about it. <br /> <br /> I respect the surreal film, what is it? (creating a story that creates more than one real world that is related to real life) But there is nothing surrealistic in a modern-day story set in modern times, and the current land setting, which is not the most important thing to be able to engage in, but also, it's just issuing. The most accurate way to describe the experience to watch this movie is to watch the story; Perhaps a very good story was based on a book, but this camera does not capture the necessary moments and connects all forms of coherence to be frustrated. <br /> <br /> Let's compare. stylistic cinema Compare Gaspar No√© to "Seul contre tous". A coherent story, very attractive and intellectually profound. This film does not offer intellectual analysis and is very stylish in a fragmentary presentation, but at the end of the day the director has abandoned the essential art of the story, and we are almost mixing events that are intertwined. <br /> <br /> Yes, in truth, things can be meaningful ... in a POINT. But as I said before, the audience will come to the stage that says "Who cares". It's a story about a man who enters a supermarket and does not buy food without buying fault. The killers are also not very interesting and unloving. There are too many people who understand these things that are going to make big brands these days or who are not senseless, fearing being foolish, and so to speak, this movie makes the viewer look stupid. <br /> <br /> You have too much time in your hands, and then watch this film, as I have already told you. A story based on a book that could be presented in a more free way, and this is my reasoning below.
