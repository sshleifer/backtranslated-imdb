Apparently people who wrote in the background of the box did not see a movie called "movie." "Choreographic intrigue and blind violence" were described. I did not see "intrigue". I saw a conversation in conversation, thought kung fu. I have not seen "violence". At least, I have not seen that it is likely that it is "impossible" for the skin, but perhaps I will be "too much" on the plot. Additionally, many films (sometimes, sometimes kung fu movies) as the viewer, I can say that this piece of celluloid is not one. Whatever you do, I will always be <br /> <br /> correct, <br /> <br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /> <br /> <br /> P.S. I was not blinded by choreography.
