Sadly, IMDB does not allow 1 judge to value less than 1. What a shame This terrible movie is so bad, I really finished the damn thing. The script had some brilliant moments, but the judges were so overwhelming that the direction, edition, theater, audio quality and especially the distribution of the line was so bad. <br /> <br /> The daytime comic style that was announced by the Jury was that it was modern in the West, but there was nothing in truth. What you like is the dog's shit at the bottom of your shoe. You try to make ends meet, but it continues to smell. <br /> <br /> Why do videoconferences consider this kind of ruin to be made by audio voids constantly and high school drama classes. Acting is not for me. We rent movies for better viewing on TV. But the judges are worse than the pathetic original of SciFi Channel. I want to ask for my money from Hollywood videos.
