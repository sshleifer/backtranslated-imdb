The sun should be permanently set for this movie. <br /> <br /> It always continues (it's usually not a bad thing - Bad English, Schindler's list) but it's very boring. The aging of the actors is incredible and, therefore, there is no story line that will end up being drawn. <br /> <br /> In short, talent and film waste.
