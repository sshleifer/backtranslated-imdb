God ... where did you start? I could only excite myself for the first 10 minutes before declining myself. Apart from the actress playing Robin Hood, the rest were all terrifying. Until now, I can not prolong the severity of my credibility. From the beginning of the first part, I lost sight of the many mistakes, plots and great outfits. At first some peasants started looking for a deer to feed their family. It's okay. However, blighter patients must have a cap, with few soldiers, armors, riding, about 10 meters in length. <br /> <br /> Then, while running away, leaving 10 feet behind, you can not even see all of them, and immediately follow it with about 20 meters behind it. Then he enters some bushes, and immediately two soldiers ... they only specified two seconds horseback riding and dozens of foot behind him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < They seemed to look like maille, and they failed. Not to mention, the "armor" of the soldier is roughly 5 deficient. Seriously, he is a little child, wearing his father's armor! In the end, Robin gets an archery of about 5 soldiers, the hand of a soldier who is completely focused, about 2 seconds, seems to be a round arch. No one has survived any of these planes in a short time, with a manual rifle, much less with an arc. <br /> <br /> Then they flee to the soldiers and they will help you wear a well-dressed outfit. and a clean "farmer" dug a leg ... all the noblemen wanted to do all the time, right? In my opinion, I feel like an excuse for a series that has won a second season. Production costs (at least when I saw it) had to increase thousands of dollars (or euros) ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Seriously - I think that a school drama class may give a better interpretation . This was so bad, Robin Hood's superb version of Kevin Costner was also better. <br /> <br /> I recommend skipping this monster and renting or buying "Robin of Sherwood" in the mid-80s. Much written, dramatized, cut and produced. <br /> <br /> Shame, BBC ... shame ...
