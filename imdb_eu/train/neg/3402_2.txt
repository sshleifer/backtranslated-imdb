Here's why it will not work for Jane Show. Once again, Canadian wing producers and writers can not create a sitcom without putting any rotation on it. I think these people do not see the US state T.V.a much like a sitcom model. No, we need to do something different here, we have to make a story completely absurd and then try to solve a significant story B. The characters are two-dimensional and the story lines are at the top: Trolley drawings ??? break me Here's a little tip for the show's writers. Do not enter fun situations, find funny situations. And remember, you must be born with humor to be really entertaining, not just an impression monkey.
