Watching the DVD that we saw so many years ago. The main problem for me is a different script. <br /> <br /> While some are attentive and spiritual, it's a bit boring, shaky, and boring. Many gag sat down without any spark or energy. <br /> <br /> Next to the throw, Mae West and Rachel Welch. Roger Herren Rusty's role shines (he did not do much movies in a bad way). To get my money, there is not too much John Huston, and poor Rex Reed is not nearly an opportunity for a fight. His character varies because he refuses himself, asks him what he does in this film. <br /> <br /> A low user rating should give an idea of ​​people's opinion. Vidal's original was much wasted. Not even a lot of classical films. Fully active parity and will not get much better time.
