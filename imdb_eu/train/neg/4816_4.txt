I think that young people like "Necromancy" ("The Witching" plus some other titles) have a bit of curiosity about a horror movie: he was involved with John Houseman. proletarian production ("The Cradle Will Rock"); fearing people invading foreigners ("The Worlds of War"); and directed and featured in the biggest film of all time ("Citizen Kane"). Now Orson Welles was a satanic third-level film about a Satan cult. <br /> <br /> Essentially there is no creative about this movie. It has many minds, but background music is always proving distracting. Even though the film is not particularly predictable, it has not yet been seen. Welles was sunk when he was short. Luckily, in the last thirteen years of his life, he told the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (Warner Bros., cartoons from the 1940s) and "The Man that Saw Tomorrow" (Nostradamus). I recommend these two, but not this one. Just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Also featuring Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkey.
