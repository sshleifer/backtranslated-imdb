I liked the initial premise of this film, that is, what I wanted to capture, but I quickly discovered the problem, I know quite well what will happen in the first 20-30 minutes (duplicates will come behind the mirror and take them all). <br /> <br /> There is no real triumph (that is, well), but the final appearance does not make much sense (how can you be satisfied with uncertainty and fear, if the whole movie, if it's a bad part of the mirror?). <br /> <br /> It should be acknowledged that when the scene was "out of the mirror" for the first time, and the murder of the blonde is terribly terrible, but, after all, this is it! It seems that a movie is looking for a story or exciting script, the atmosphere's atmospheric confrontation and the design of a terrifying sound over 80-90 minutes does not really cut it, it really gets dull.
