I watched "Shiner" on the DVD. While I was watching, I thought: "This porn is a very bad porn movie." I also thought: "Those who wrote this have some real problems." Then, Carlson director and writer described his process as a special feature. Yes, it was very special. <br /> <br /> The attention of the film is aimed at alcoholic losers who hit each other. At least they are attractive. There are fore and nudity. These factors may be viewed as completely visible films. <br /> <br /> The biggest feature of the movie is gay bashing and the next attack is the same victim who tries to revenge his attackers. two losers. It's a badly-manipulated topic from the point of view of the subject, but the play is incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> Then there is a boxer stalker theme. This is really insane, not just absurd. This Hunky boxer mentions, in some way, the care of the boy's boyfriend in the parking lot of his mother's gym. This is LA. The boxer is so traumatized that he stalkers at home, draws on his face and becomes an illusion of the process. <br /> <br /> Well, I can say it all, why would a boxer be heartfelt. Is the attention of a stalker so traumatized by a showmaker? It does not make sense And, I'm afraid, some psycho-dynamics really make sense, if you take time to read about them. However, the bad guides rarely make sense. <br /> <br /> The director / writer seems to have thought that this film is a minority in the gay community. Well, maybe it might be correct, I suppose. We may never know that as this minority would be so functional, they could hardly be able to organize any movie theater or movie store in the movies, the only two places that can be found on this turkey. Thank you for that.
