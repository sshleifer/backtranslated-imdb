Some fun moods, some that fall, some light plays, very atrocious. This film is just a hit and a miss, guaranteed by 12 year old boys to have more than any other niche. When you're making a family comedy, it's a problem. Beverly D'Angelo rises above the material to make fun, and I venture to say that man's performance in the midst of that Spanish.
