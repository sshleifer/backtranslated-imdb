If the footage of this movie is half of what is half-known, it means you too see the Italian worship dog! Those who see you, the famous demeanor Lucio Fulci did not only produce this film, but decided to use it again "Cat in the Brain" (but it's easier to trace it). The opening-stage scene, where the prostitute is unfairly decapitated with an ax, appears in Fulci's subsequent film, and thus puts on other murders and bad times. Andrea Bianchi's "Masssacre" fails to sound like a giant, a sadistic film that is filming a horror movie, a sad and suspensible amongst the sadistic killer but still a good entertainment cartoon horror. The inconsistent script introduces many characters with potential maniacs, but one of the red Biachi bears is not credible, and you can point out the killer almost immediately. The most amazing mischievous make-up effects and the amazing enthusiasm of the theater group are to be enjoyed. Every time there is no blood flow on the screen, between the first and second killings, its "Massacre" is slow and almost unbearable, with its fast dialogues and a completely unexciting picture. Fortunately in the second half, women are tightened with fences and men repeatedly, cutting their hair repeatedly. The music shit and the use of shooting locations is very unthinkable. My recommendation to skip this puppy and the aforementioned "Brain in the Brain" would be direct. This is all the great moments of "Massacre", and then some.
