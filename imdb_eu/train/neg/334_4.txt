Sure of the wrong movie It has many unique effects and a lot of fantasy scenes (such as the airport) and fantastic time. (Charles Dance) is horrible and much better (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) is making comic junk and I heard that he was sinking, a great success! !! I never understand why or how? I heard in a television interview (Eddie Murphy) himself, when Oscar was nominated for 2007, he regretted it comically! <br /> <br /> One of the commentators (Hey ... It's 1980's!). Well not my friend. RAZZIE made many movies every year in the 1980s or 1950s season! <br /> <br /> There are two reasons to write about this movie. The first one I will never forget Charlotte Lewis's fascinating legs, who went to bed in bed before the house attacked, wearing a blue T-shirt and OH BOY buzzing the camera as bare his legs. it should be. But what a curious thing! When I saw the following films, was not it beautiful again? !! However, the second reason I've found the titles of this movie in the list of the 100 worst movies in recent times! <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Bad movie, Greeeeeat legs.
