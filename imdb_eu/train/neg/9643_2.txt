Under the average movie, considering a movie based music that is inadequate music? Plain script and direction, full of lies. Salman Khan was in his usual game. Ajay's performance deteriorated with time, especially for her appearance, especially the pathetic styles of Rock Star. Asin was just the only piece. Overall, I liked the loss of money on the screen. Salman Khan continues to be 10 years ago with Aamir Khan. There are many boring songs in "Man Ko Ati". It has been the most important song in the United Kingdom's Music Sponsor. The English musician "Khanabadosh" is very easy to understand. The other movie that I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid", with a slow love story and good acting and no music.
