This movie laughed more than I ever missed. Really, if you're a Tolkien enthusiast, rent out with your friends. I'm not going to be millions of people to get rid of their mistakes ... I'll only say that the movie (for me) has lost important points to my favorite character, Sam, to become a dirty idiot. Pity, shame ... 3/10
