Combining animation and computer graphics with Dreamworks, it's a story of a mustang, later named Spirit (Matt Damon, a first-person narration) and his journey through Western Western borders. Basically, he is born in a beautiful landscape amongst the horsemen, and then he is kidnapped as a horse-horse, and he tosses all those who try to ride with him. However, when he escapes in his cage, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), they make up friendship, and, of course, he has a horse for Little Creek's horse. In the end, after fleeing, after the colonel (James Cromwell) and his men fled, and a large jump across the canyon, Little Creek will go to Spirit and release her female horse and run. a friend of their country and horses. With Chopper Bernet Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau Murphy / Railroad Foreman, Soldier, Richard McGonagle Bill and Joe Levin Joe. I was hoping to talk to the horses at the Festival, but Dumbo is all about it, and Bryan Adams's songs are not very attractive, but it's not a horrible movie. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for a Golden Globe for the best song "Here I Am" by Bryan Adams. Okay
