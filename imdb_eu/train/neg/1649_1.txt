Each Sunday, a new trio joins a NYC dinner to be proud of the previous night's sexual conquests. Sometimes a former camaraderie and a young hunter make a connection. Broken dogs / corn dogs and Mia, who are prowl witnesses, decided to teach a lesson, dammit. So what's up and dumped - why not? Three <br /> <br /> Gasp. What a wild idea is What is radical, naughty, gal? Women have the right to the day and want to sleep. As men do as well! <br /> <br /> There is a lonely and stupid element called "whipped", that is, it's not once when people are analyzing specific talents about their body functions and their bedding partners, they're going to go to other clients. Come back to dinner and say "I'm trying to eat here." In fact, heh-heh gag has an elderly woman, who weighs before the sexual properties of certain beverages. A great fat for Kermit the Frash "Sheesh" for that. <br /> <br /> It's really unfortunate that a friendly movie has a great setting, smart, cute heroine and three possible couples to end the end of such cop-out. <br /> <br /> <br /> PS - Screenwriter 30 "whip-oosh" sound effects to use the phrase "You go, girl". Tired of 2000 and now tired. <br /> <br /> Save time and see reviewing "Sex and city" ...
