Slashers ... well, if you like fears if you want to see it permanently, otherwise, do not worry. It is obvious that this film has a very small budget, for example, it seems that the whole movie has been filmed. somewhere in the warehouse, and often you will see the shadow of the mike boom and you will see camera shadows, they should not look for confidence. However, you want to ignore the cheesy actresses! A few people decide to play the show, they need to survive one night in a large maze, enriching the lives of 3 killers and ending lives. Now you see something about that movie and you rarely find a cheap budget horror these days, for example, I saw myself I thought I would not mind in this game! above $ 12,000,000. so I would recommend it anyway to see and complete yourself.
