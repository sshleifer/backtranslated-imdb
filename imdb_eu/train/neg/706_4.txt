The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate fun movies. Ri'Chard is great. She really did a high performance, and the girl who played her sister was very wonderful and beautiful. Seriously, until Carmen I saw Electra profile. I did not say anything about Peter Galleghar. It's one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm reading in Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book. This is a bit "real" for me. I prefer Lestat and Louis to be the clashes of slaves. Eartha Kitt was so horrible and after the character she made, the movie was spoiled; There was barely enough to see the rest of the show. (Sorry for ambiguity, but I do not want to give anything) Excuse me, but it's not my show type.
