The film looks after Michael's elderly man. One day he decided to kill some of his relatives. At the same time, after the 60th Zodiac Killer, he decided to kill him. He is in contact with the author of a book about the killer of the Zodiac. Michael has a gun (apparently a single gun, it seems to be the only one who portrays the same gun at other actors) and dies. Original <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie if you like B movies. I thought it was a good idea for the movie, but the edition and the theater really drowned the ground. "I thought the" blood "was false, in some places where lighting was great, and the conversation was normal. The movie was filmed, this is fine, but the film's edition was made for some of the curious "Plan 9" scenes. It's not a bad movie for fans of the B-movie genre, but if you want something more polished, go something else.
