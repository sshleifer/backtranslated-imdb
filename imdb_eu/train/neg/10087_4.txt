This is probably the first entry in the "Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat" detective series; O'Leary's subsequent films featured younger actors, Guy Kibbee. <br /> <br /> A family group (all played by well-known actors) is gathered in an old house (in a rainy, of course!) to talk with a wealthy comma that goes into commas. <br /> <br /> While waiting for recovery, several mysterious things happen, including a couple of murders. <br /> An awesome movie; it's worth seeing!
