We recently participated in TV in GEORGE 2, but I could not see myself until the end. Wonderful! I can not remember the drawing. I know George and Ursula were not enough for George's film and Ursula's first movie. He is getting around a lot, but management and editing were so demanding and demanding; It was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes. Ape the Ape's original voice was not nearly enough to warm myself up. GEORGE 2 is probably the one I've ever seen and that's what I'm saying. Then, in line with the 10 Online Rule of the IMDb, I have to continue writing to say more about this crapulastic television series. Disney, hang your head.
