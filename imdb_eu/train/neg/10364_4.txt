The book is so good, at least it will be the opening of this film for television, but then, as the book is moving more and more away, it is full of religion, love and mathematics, and featuring cotton candy. It becomes boring. However, since I have heard the comments, I like those who do not read the book, and if the child even reads A Wrinkle in Time, it will have the purpose. Shameless change Happy Mid's grandmother Mary Poppins is making Albert's clone (Laughter loves me). Nothing happens, so the characters on the screen are frighteningly fuzzy.
