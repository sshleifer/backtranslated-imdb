There is no reason to rent this movie. I had trouble starting from the initial credits. <br /> <br /> It's shot like a short film, but there's nothing erotic. It's an interesting look at the world of sexual addiction, but only one point. <br /> <br /> Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette's bad sexes, bad lands and cameos are not enough to save this movie. .
