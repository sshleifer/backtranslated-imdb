Tatie Danielle talks about an old misfortune that torments her loving and unforgettable family. There is a small text beneath the colonial past of France, but above all, Danielle does some things (for example, a small child is abandoned in the park), a man soon picks up his teeth and breaks his fingers. Unfortunately, this is not happening here. It looks good and the performance is fine and it is not bad for the concept, but it's so bad. God loves the movie itself. Pity is not as clear or funny as it is. The only impetus in the exhibition - I'm sorry, the movie - Danielle is more fascinated and sharpened, and she is only surprised by the increasingly unknown ways she is doing. It's true: just like in a sitcom, that is, adding greatness and excessive 110-minute running of the bulls.
