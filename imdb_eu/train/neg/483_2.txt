I do not think the Frenchman could do a bad movie, but I was very wrong. As previously mentioned, this film uses its title as a solution; His portrait of life and person has nothing to do with the true Artemisia Gentileschi. <br /> <br /> The script is horrible - it is unforgiving, whirlwind and mere - and it is an abusive rewriting of events, it's also offensive in a genre that often causes less history than life. . Together with a rather decent design, the physical charm of Valentina Cervi is the main asset of this film, and it is obvious, at first glance, that filmmakers were also aware of it; They will not lose time with those "erotic" sequences that are much more demanding than plot or character development. Unfortunately, an appeal to show a beautiful young girl in a sexually-deceptive situation can not be kept in that movie either. The play does not stand out, and the score is very generous even though there are two or more interesting deals. Cinematography is fine and there are some beautiful colors, but there are also some beautiful sequences that are more effective than a 60s movie with the best effects of distorted sequences. In any case, the scripts often walk in the body of Artemisia, and rarely leaves it in his paintings. <br /> <br /> Everything is very wrong. It is not smart enough to be a serious movie, and it's too slow and courageous to work as a soft-core pornography. So, the French can fail, after all!
