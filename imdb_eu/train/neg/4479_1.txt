I will be honest, this is the worst film ever. Otherwise, it's very close. I've never seen a bad TV show. Well, it's like one of them. Except for the worse For example: (POSIBIBLY SPOILER) girl: I want to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Tip: Everything we need is here. <br /> <br /> Little girl: but I'm somewhere I want to take myself. <br /> Boy: I'll take you somewhere else. Bad music bad and bad punk rock. If you have read the book, avoid this movie like plague. They change the nature of the characters and their events. Also, they are just about to get rid of things. In addition, the movie will end before the book ends. AWFUL is a movie. So if you have not read the book, do not see it. If you have read the book, record (movie). You are so stupid of soap opera with low quality low quality low quality. Again, do we expect to have a different MTV?
