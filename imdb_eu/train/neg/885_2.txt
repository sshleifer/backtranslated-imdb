Anthology is always dangerous and I think that this effort must be praised. Here is a great talent. Many talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I could not enjoy this movie when I had three issues. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the segments change their tone and quality. And unfortunately some of them collide with others. <br /> <br /> Second, several segments have been developed for me. Like the seeds of good stories that are not previously performed. Here I am not talking about happy endings (or the end of the term), but they do not lack basic development or strong configurations. <br /> <br /> In the end, I did not feel it. New York and its inhabitants are well represented. <br /> <br /> The short films that remain, some of which may be of interest, but the average audience does not meet.
