I watched this movie for 45 minutes and counted 9 spoons. Every 5 miles. Actually, this film is proof of this formula. If it does not break it, it is not necessary. The street hero is still vulnerable, former police officer with a martial arts master and a heart of gold and a series of 'problems' killer. Pure magic
