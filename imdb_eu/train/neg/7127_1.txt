This movie was the worst thing to say! Many great cars are greatly applauded by LAME in this film. From LA to Las Vegas starts with a race that ends at 1hR 45min ... on a Ferrari F430. I spent 1HR 50min, a 4Cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord. Seriously ... this movie does not direct with those cars. Of course, these are just the writers, and probably drive under the limit of speed 10 and 2. I remember Eddie Griffin's news that I saw the Ferrari Enzo 1.5 million dollars dropped. SELLOUT the greatest! He brings a shame to his own race. I wonder how happy a person was getting into Hollywood a bit happy. He participated in a film portraying Asian-Americans in a negative and fake manner. Asian women >> cheap money spicy bitch. Asian men are losing their gamblers and thugs that stole all the time. What the hell is the fear of Asians? Why should she always portray her connotation so negatively? However, Hollywood always depicts it as an excuse for negative and fake Asian.
