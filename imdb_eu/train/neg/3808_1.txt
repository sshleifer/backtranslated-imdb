WARNING! This review will end the movie "Scoop". If you do not want to know how to finish the movie, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is so bad that you think it was "Annie Hall" fluke. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman's naked breasts get a star. That's the only thing that's "Scoop". I was at any time. <br /> <br /> Plots seem promising: Ian McShane's ghost, Scarlett Johansson directs a shrewd head, an English Hugh Jackman, to investigate whether or not the Tarot is obvious. Card kills prostitute. Woody Allen's magician helps her. <br /> <br /> However, the promise of plot, movie charm, humor or atmosphere is completely lacking. He has also made a good effort for someone who has made a previous film, but does not matter for dozens of times. Maybe Allen did not report that he was in a hurry. <br /> <br /> Unlike in previous films, Woody Allen, now the septuagenarian, has finally brought a young man. get the girl <br /> <br /> It's not like that. In fact, the plot has been built in such a way that the girl does not carry anyone. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, it's a scene where Johansson, who can not drink it in the middle of the movie without reason. An old and powerful director has fascinated him. It's a euphemism of what is "seduced". Moment "slam, bam, I have to go". He has no connection with the plot, and Johansson balances the viewer's eye. Why did Allen add to the unforgettable scene in the film? It shows how powerful a director - like Allen - has sex with the female head. Allen takes his cake and eats it. <br /> <br /> Still no Johansson actress. He does not know how to cut the power on the screen, wearing tight upper and lower edges. Allen imitates it in a couple of scenes, and that's just strange and sad. <br /> <br /> It does not help her character without writing ghost without a ghost, or less than an elder and an unlimited magician, what is said in each round. <br/> <br /> <br/> Approximately Jackman's age is half, and on the screen his scene is very evident. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <p> Hugh Jackman also takes away the scripts. Allen, apparently, can not peal Jackman so good and young, so Jackman does not need to say or do anything. Like Johansson, he uses only his good looks. This is embarrassing, as Jackman has shown in several productions, from "Oklahoma" by "X Men", CAN CAN do it. <br /> <br /> Here is a great plot: Jackman, gentle. Lord, a charming Englishman, he's really a murderer. Therefore, the film is a good idea for someone else, except Allen, to stop being a young girl. Jackman, who loves, is a man who has been a prostitute. Nice, Woody. A great way to punish your unpleasant whiteness heroine. <br /> <br /> Touching aggressive and passive, Allen takes away his presence from his heroines, leaving his character, the mage, all of Scarlett Johansson. only at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Last note: in my projection, not a single single-person singer laughed at the movie. It's always a bad sign when a movie is announced as a comedy.
