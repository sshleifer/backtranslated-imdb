This movie has a lot of disadvantages and I can see all this. It's long and painful. I expected the whole audience to be patient and finish. Execution time could be less than 3 hours and it could be edited for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The transitional story is the average. Most people are expecting something that they expect to be seated. <br /> <br /> It's just fun in the pockets. ambitious project and lower execution. Govinda works fine, Capoor disappointed me, as we expected from rest. If you expect to be close to Babel or if you do not really love it, it will close.
