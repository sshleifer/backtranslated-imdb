In 2002, "I Love the 80", the most popular, pop-cultural disorder is rude, stupid, offensive and horrible, which has been the first television program. At the same time, he left one of the most authentic channels of music on television! I lived almost VH1 in spring or winter; In 2002 I forgot that such litter was not a reason. Rarity from the simple point of view (I think I would call it that) I came for the first time I decided to give it a look at the future, although the advertisement seemed to be empty. At least, I can say that I am not disappointed, my expectations, initially, were at the bottom of the basement. The show I met in the first 5 minutes was less in the 1980s, and it was not culturally significant or popular (that is, what I wanted to see), but it was an impromptu platform. which contains a lot of comic books that are not real divine names, surely, to show what they think their comic abilities * eye rolls * ... they're missing out on asking! It's pretty easy to see now why no one heard this idiot appearing in this show because they are so incredibly inappropriate and they think that attempts called "humor" can feel my intestines. each knocked out with every one who fights each other! In total, I do not have the problem with the trash for the smallest name "I love the 80's" and I hardly ever see the main reason I can see VH1.
