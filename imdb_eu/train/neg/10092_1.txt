Seriously crappy movie. <br /> <br /> First, the movie begins with a police officer and is parked with his partner in a warehouse / furniture store. Police pick up a "wicked" girl in the warehouse attic, and a new cop sits outside and thinks something happening there. The "bad" policeman will eventually return with a heavy bag, and the police does not think about creating any problems, but he still asks what his purse was, and so he asks, responds and thinks everything. okay (now) <br /> <br /> Repeats this "bad" police, and once again with a scene (it's a bit better). But in the end, people start catching it, which was a little obvious when it was obvious. A girl gets a voodoo curse, if she puts it in the case of dying. Now, the "bad" policeman eventually kills this protected magical whore and then removes his body bags. <br /> <br /> The magic of Oogey-boogey was put in, it will come back again that it is considered by many eyes, that it can be a zombie ... magical curse also makes other girls "eye shadow monsters". Some girls seem to be a currency specialist and offer a ride (apparently it seems normal). But when girls see other people, such as the husband's girl, it's terribly terrifying, they are awful (some people are terrific, but others do not realize it) ... a massive plot. <br /> <br /> So, to kill him, the eye-shadow killing monsters "bad" kill the police making the last scene into zombies. As they tried to prepare for a watch! As anyone wanted to see the second part of this cow.
