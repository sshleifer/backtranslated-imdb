"Look, I know that it can be sucked right now, but the pain is temporary, the movies are forever. Everything you do now is always burning in the celluloid and it's going to be thousands of years." ?? Robert De Niro <br /> <br /> It was initially a film directed by Steven Spielberg. The director recruited several screenwriters to adapt the script to suit their themes. So, Robert De Niro has a family under threat of a terrible monster out of jail. Like "Jurassic Park", "Poltergeist" and "World of War", dysfunctional families come together to defeat the beast, because the beast was a father, a lawyer in De Niro's defense trial. <br /> <br /> In Spielbergen's typical fashion, his father dies the monster that disturbed his family and immediately sins his sins. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise, and Spielberg's "almost" father, his father regains the duty of his father in the sour code that Spielberg enjoys. <br /> <br /> But Spielberg eventually left the project and offered the project to Martin Scorses, trying to test more commercial rates at that time. The result is undoubtedly the worst film of the Scores filmography and, ironically, its clearest light. When the story does not work, the characters are not connected or the images are not the same, we have an internal core type. This ?? The other channels are the director's cinema. <br /> <br /> Now, the film "Cape Fear" is impersonal, so we can not find any other thematic link to the rest of the Scores filmography ("Now you have sacrificed me!" De Niro cries out, but Catholic affair movie themes are a cookie cutter. The film explains the type of language of its filmography, see the scroll camera desperately back and forth, how sharp it increases the doorways and windows, and strain the characters and how they scream. But more importantly, watch movies It does not have a spatial sense. At the end of the film, a show of a boat takes place on a stage of sound, a street show is claustrophobic and in a much more contextual context, and the family house does not exist anywhere, nothing scarcely exists in the picture, Scorses can not shoot space or create spatial environments. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is that the Scorsese camera always has its main character or it is very hard to sleep it must be overcast. To make the world a sense of character, its camera must focus on the character. Resnais will take you to a French hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance on a street and a building, Cameron will give you a tour of Titanic, Scott can rebuild the future urban landscape. and other directors can create space for the "close-up shooter" combinations for the textbook, but Scors can not do that. There is no poetry, it is not the sense of tangible space in his films. It's a character. It breaks the connection, you leave that boxing ring, you see that tax, De Niro and everything breaks down. It simply can not shoot it with that documentary style, as a condition for action film. <br /> <br /> <br /> Scorsens tried to correct this problem through the "New York vaults". Where space and sets become the main character, but even though the self-conscious space experiment Daniel Day Lewis's sabotage magnetizes, the actor scores the camera inexorably as a flower bulb. <br /> <br />> 5/10 ?? In a B-movie genre, the movie looks ugly and plain. Check matte paint, try to prevent strain, eliminate radical effects and swirling challenge. However, Robert De Niro has stopped him. De Niro, who gives his body Scorseri Christ as a tattooed figure, gives the scene an excellent scene. In a romantic sequence improvised with Juliette Lewis, he tosses his head into his mouth and kisses him. A sort of symbolic rape escapes the little girl who encourages and drives the interests of this man. <br /> <br /> But De Nirus's interpretation, so early on, can not be imitated by Scorses. To do this, someone like De Palma needs a Baroque and intuitive vision. But Scorsese? No <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
