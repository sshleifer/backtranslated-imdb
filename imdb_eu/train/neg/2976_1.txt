It's sensible that this is really a clock. I mean, it's bad. It's very bad. But the original one was so bad that my life was wrong, this is so bad, the bad thing is entertaining. It's true, enough weak praise. The production values ​​are corrupted throughout the table, the play is stupid and Romero-wababe satira can not leave the ecological barrier. Internal logic rear seats take heads away from refrigerators, requiring a change of virus incubation time on the "plot", whether they work against bullet zombies, whether they have power of speech or not. Gore is a draw, of course, but the frames are so annoying. The interview reflects the same computer as the instructions manuals, and the scale of infestation in the area only affects Romero's films. Everything is complete with a great synthesizer. Absolute rubbish
