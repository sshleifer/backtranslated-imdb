Paint a story with numbers and a moody performance, saved by real colors - and moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt. The tricky transition of a girl catches her into adulthood, and the main family experiment is sensibly and guessing cultural conflicts. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the germ of a good movie is improperly imprisoned. Religious conflict, road construction project, sexual life of the secondary and / or third-person characters, mysterious man who lives in the woods, racist hooligan, three different carnival, minimum three carnivals, at least three carnivals. local church policy, and on and on. Not all of these things take into account both the expectations of girls (and their entire family), dreams and frustrations, the real main plot. I was really surprised to see that everything happened during a summer (and when I realized that the movie was about 1.5 hours long!) <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie is melodramatic, each plot is predictable, major changes in life happen and then they forget about 10 minutes ... and some of them are very pleased. It is most surprising that a character participates in a horrible crime (a fully planned "turn") and then it is completely untidy and has been neglected since then. Similarly, a secondary character enters only two minutes after killing and gives a different "rotation". It's totally mechanical, which ends with all the extreme solutions that connects to the finish line (not all, because you watch movies).
