Viewed 26/1/1/26/26 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): Corny comedy murder mystery is very lazy. The film is based on previous Italian films, according to credits, but the famous American comedian novelists wrote again. But Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers do not compare them to the efforts of others. The story is a story about a couple of Americans traveling, Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who are facing a lost dog and are planning to win money after earning money on their paper. When trying to return, the cover of a door of the purity of a lady is seen as a hand and they think they are tied to the rest of the woman's body. They are terrified, and instead of contacting the police, they are like escape scenes that are intended to kill themselves. The other characters of the film began to trap before they arrived and they hang around a Monte-Carlo play station in order to get things done in the story. Other members are John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and other characters. Once the police have learned about death, the main characters have begun to question and, of course, they have to work their false lies to find out what happened. One of the aforementioned featured characters is not leaving this movie out of the miniscule situation, despite the amusing moments of the Belushi / Shepherd. This is not a horrible film, it's just not good. There are a lot of average movies and this is just another for stacking. Try, maybe you like it, you probably do not.
