Sometimes you have to watch bad movies to see what's good. Well, that's my opinion. This will always be in the bad film category, just because Shu Qi's performance has been terrific. <br /> <br /> She tells Martial Angel Cat (Shu Qi), after leaving the bandmate's direct lover. Lam (Julian Cheung), two years earlier. But he returns to his past to pay for it because Chi Chi is paid for the software that works for the Cat company. To rescue him, his old friend in his orphan's days calls six other entertaining women to save the day ... <br /> <br /> Maybe I could say a little synopsis, but that's a cheesy one. story Indeed, the entire script and direction did not have any quality. A large part of the conversation was nonsensical and in water it was tied to a plot of fine paper as rice. In summary, take a bad movie by Jackie Chan, remove comedy, choreography, throw a quote, and Martial Angels: an imaginary work formula. <br /> <br /> Note that I have to give credit, due to credit, and Shu Qi was probably the only one that appeared to be imminent due to the horrific action, because its performance was shining. Okay, you can not say it was excellent. Eventually he did not have to do any work, but he managed to get a character out of his job. In addition, Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin only made other impressions. However, they were mostly shining and very short. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the movie failed. The scenes and the conversation were completely unnatural and unbelievable; Of course, the special effects were cheap, the attempt to clean the mask and the mask of the blue screen, which was not necessary in battle scenes, in the camera angles were basic and unpleasant. , and a better way to see a lost dog. <br /> <br /> This movie was too much chef. Surely, the budget was a great excitement for seven children on the silver screen. This did not leave much else. <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie was like porn porn without porn. Charlie's Angels, it's not. In fact, while the sisters themselves can do it, there is no doubt about it here. <br /> <br /> Certainly to be forgotten.
