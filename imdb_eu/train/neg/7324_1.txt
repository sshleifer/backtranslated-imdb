I would like to have a bachelor's degree in film studies. Let's say I've seen a lot of movies, good and bad, but I would say 'Summer Rain' is a far off movie that I've never seen before! I chose the movie as we expected to be a classic British classic, such as 'Secrets and Lies' or 'Lockstock', but I was not so bad that my lovely friends and I laughed and danced around the hilarious stage. and scriptwriting (the schoolmate reminded me of "bad educational theater"). Michelle and Gary's main characters began to faint. The main character who lives with Michelle's two friends did not have to face her face and Gary was so wet (5th once he broke the tears) at the end of the movie I really finished the movie, it did not do any harm. I thought everything "I paid Â£ 3 for this pile." I never wrote a review before, but after watching this movie, he warned me of this annoying production. So please avoid at all costs. Thank you for reading.
