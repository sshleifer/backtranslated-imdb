Stilted, stagy, strange and opaque, visually striking ... wannabe-erotic fantasy. Really boring, too much nudity of men (including infused parent-child), and just a shameless stranger. I confess, however, that some episodes of interviews, in their own terms, have a high quality and incredible quality.
