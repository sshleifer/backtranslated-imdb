Since the universe of film-loving George A. Romero has known himself as a man, the word "zombie" is automatically linked to horror horror images and to avoiding unstoppable sequences. It is safe to say that we know that his "Dead Living Dead" is a zombie movie. However, in the oldest movies, the premise of corrupted bodies was only used in relatively few non-accidental psychological emotions. Jacques Tourneur is an excellent example of "Zombie Zombie" and "White Zombie", along with Bela Lugosi. This "rebellion" of Zombies could be another example, but unfortunately it is a failure of the whole line and one of the hardest films I have ever seen. An overwhelming repertoire, very scanty script and lack of atmosphere and tension. The film lasts 65 minutes and still half an empty hour has completely ruined the stupid strokes of love stories and the unethical monologue. The establishment of the mythical city of Cambodia in Angkor may surely be a more believable story, but what we have ever seen is the internal plans. The main actress (Dorothy Stone, Curly Hair and Ugly Nose) made me feel terribly hard and I kept waiting for her to swallow that she could not kill her. Lucky again If you intend to fight for 60 minutes full, the last time will be quite decent. However, this is very little to give this film a positive rating, leave it still a recommendation. Avoid! This is the only thing that you should see if you only watch the movie type.
