<br /> <br /> Although the main actor is beautifully beautiful, the plot has little admission, excessive warning details in the face of the audience in the development of the story. <br /> <br /> It might be thought that's it. Mid-teenage school girls of the 1950s were easily recognized by their 30-year-old wedding, they hardly know, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> We can think of this high school youth. Teens are very self-confident and self-assured that their elderly interact in complex social situations, but my experience has been that, unlike often, they feel very clumsy and clumsy teenagers experience in the adult world. <br /> <br /> An unlikely physician should not know the poor odor of Stroptomycin, the bad fermentation of occupied microbial land, and not detect a powdered insulin powder, but I do not think so. <br /> <br /> We can conclude that a 30-year-old something that is disturbing has come into being and hanging around the public school room in a social school and creating problems, but I think that the social school is traditionally a protected environment and that parents, chaparones and school personnel should be around. <br /> <br /> A last championship, throughout Hey Babu Riba, was nominated by four teenage friends four. Surely there is an explanation why CINTA was four, but because it was never determined, each reference goes unnoticed to each scene. <br /> <br /> This movie was not true for me.
