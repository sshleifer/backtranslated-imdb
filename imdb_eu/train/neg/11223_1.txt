I watched the movie and was afraid that at least the movie would be communicating with me as there was no viewer. The language would go crazy. <br /> <br /> Plot; A father who is forced to marry his son seems very little. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​applying for a mess to her grandmother with grandmother would only be of great help. <br /> <br /> ... and the whole movie was awaiting me laughing and I laughed my stupidity I wanted to wasted 3 hours to convince myself that the movie is not worth the first look. <br /> <br /> Let's hope your time!
