This movie is very bad, so bad, although Christopher Lee can not save it. The poor story, the scanty script and the bad director also make a horror movie really outstanding, I can not inevitably be a horror movie. Honestly I never said never seen again. This garbage resembles Plane's nine-way appearance.
