Final Justice runs Joe Don Baker around Texas and shoots people who shoot people. Then he goes to Malta and shoots more people. It's been blocked for several times to shoot people. Then, a gun came in, a bad guy, dressed as a monk. There is a harassment of boats and Joe Don retires again. In the end, Joe Don, "Seinfeld", with the help of Elaine, casts the bad boy into one or two boats and someone gets awake. All this is similar to Mitchell!
