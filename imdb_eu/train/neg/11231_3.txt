I love independent low-budget films and I've had a great deal of hope. But this is a static movie. It does not matter the value of production, which is very noble for the budget, but the steps are deadly. Without a doubt, people get much less, but the movie fails at a basic level. It's boring. The edition is glacier and it is the table to stop. It should be 65 minutes. The best thing about Doctor Jekyll is Mr. Hyde, it's not enough to see. He had a dramatic potential. Instead, we have to endorse Baltimore-Brit with stammer through endless and laborious exhibits. It feels like a play theater game that is committed to the video. <br /> <br /> The great efforts made by all the production, but they were tired of a story, they needed trousers and the new low-cost funky technology needed to be cool. voice. Instead of just being restored.
