It's not hard to say that KAZAAM's review and bad film. In the end, when he left, the criticism refused to deprive himself of this movie, saying he was one of the worst movie of the decade! So, it's a bad thing to say, and it's a bad thing for anyone to say, it's certainly not surprising. It's like someone who talks about World War II - hardly anyone says good, right? I can not answer the question and the place in the IMDb: "why did they do it first?" After all, it's clear to anyone who is perfectly clear that this movie will be awesome. However, movies such as ED (lightning baseball), COOL AS ICE (always a leading Vanilla Ice character), TROLL 2 (which does not have trollik), BABY GENIUSES (Einstain-like superhero babies) and PINOCCHIO outside space huh!?!) Prove any idea, how mutually it may be, it can reach the big screen! So, the idea of ​​basketball for the best player of the season is such a thing as bad toys, but it's normal! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a little girl that lets the locksmiths enter a school hallway. Like FREE WILLY's punk, this guy understands it in a way (that's, completely chorizo) and if you know it's so awesome, it'll learn to grow and grow at the end of the movie. . Only once, I want to see such young punk in jail or dead when the movie is over! Eventually, while bullies in the neighborhood are in the middle of attack, the genre of Kazaam (Shaquille O'Neal) has suddenly been released and can be reminded of three wishes. The baby, however, does not believe it. And magic of genius seems to be rusty. <br /> <br /> In the end, this joker is aware that Kazaam is genuine. However, unlike most children, she refuses herself, meanwhile, Kazaam must continue everywhere - as her personal servant. According to Klix, you know that at the end of the film Max and Kazaam will become constant friends and tears. Oh, and Max will make an agreement with his darling father and his mother's acquaintances (I'll throw him away). Apparently, this genie is a social worker, apart from being a desire to be. <br /> <br /> With regards to Kazaam, Shaquille speaks rhyme with most of the movie, and even breaks a rap ... very badly. I am a white white middle-aged and I'm sure I'll be less rap! He's a great basketball player and I've heard that he was a nice man - but a rapper ... does not matter! Regarding his performance, he was not very good, but the fact that he had such a pleasant personality in the film was hard to hate, though he made stupid things. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So it is likely that the movie is terribly terrifying? I would not say anything about the first two-thirds of the movie. Shaquille wanted to try her best with an unknown child and a bad script. However, later in the film, the bad ones become awful - as Kazaam is also worried about when he really needs help with the child. And, nowhere, it's really curious about the plot, that Kazaam makes a rap star (?!?) Become a bad thing! And, oddly enough, this guy seems to admit that Kazaam certainly does. <br /> <br /> In addition, the final part of the film is made up of people trying to kill Max and his father. I know the baby was annoying, but this is a movie for kids! What kind of episode would you 'kill me', writers did not understand ?! Then, as a result of history, the ending of the worst movie for kids, Kazaam becomes god or something and allusion to all the drugs was like hallucination! This conclusion was weaker and lesser than the BLACK HOLE ... and the boy, it hurts my brain! Uggghh - It was a must! <br /> <br /> In general, it's a horrible film, especially for writers who were insane foolish. Yes, people who have bad messages, unlucky children, and horrible characters, this is a shameful movie. Unfortunately, thanks to ideas and actors, it's hard to imagine that the final product is much worse! <br /> <br /> Sometimes, if you want to see a Genie with a modern world-wide movie, try it. The British made films for "Bernard and the Genie": a charming and exceptionally short film from the beginning to the end.
