Honestly, I'm impressed with the positive votes they received. The movie is dragged with a duration of 81 minutes and must be exposed to the entire spectrum. There are really some positive moments in the moment; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. The interview is pretty pathetic and well managed. Scott Valentine (the boyfriend of Merrideth's Family Ties), the clock is quite rough. I think it's emphasizing its performance on the beach being guy wearing a tiger-patterned chummies ... give me a break. In addition, Valentine offers us a rich and pathetic portrait of suffering that is lacking in the day (see a much more spectacular interpretation of vampire suffering in Denice Duff "Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4"). The movie is so slow and Charlie Spradling's dance scene is very positively rated, and in truth. This movie is recommended for fans of Charlie Spradling (that is, for me, and I'm still watching it for some time now).
