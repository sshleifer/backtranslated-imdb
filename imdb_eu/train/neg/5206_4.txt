The adaptation of theater to cinema is often a bad idea, because they are two different media. Do you think ZULU is a great theater theater? Imagine where two strong red ones are sitting in a tent "There are thousands of these Blimey" An excellent movie and a bad theater. <br /> <br /> Two key scenarios necessary for making a big movie <br /> <br /> 1) Fine chemical generated on the screen. 2) Excellent conversation <br /> <br /> Casting on the paper Cher and Chazz Palminter would be a good choice. not in roles. The story is based on the success of a man who dies by his wife, Palminterrik Cher, which is the most important part of the house. I have not been able to take these two characters seriously, but maybe the guilty of the script can not decide whether or not to be serious or funny. Since the story is very static, it is very important that, due to the brilliant conversation, it is again a shame for the script, and embarrassed much of the conversation about sexual acts. If you want to see a great translation of a screen transferred to the silver screen, give FAITHFUL lost and see 12 ANGRY MEN instead
