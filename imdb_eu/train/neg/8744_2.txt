I accidentally finished watching this movie. I still do not know whether I will regret it. I felt like a group of film school students did not see. It depicts Hollywood clauses, but the latest "quarrels with corporations" is a mess. This movie is unknown. However, he manages to also offer his disasters. <br /> <br /> The story seems to turn into a fantasy world of nerdy computers. The protagonist is the attractive teenage girlfriend, but she's a programming genius and an apparently hacker (I think), among other fantasy nerd fantasies that you can see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Also, I would have to know if I saw N-Bellamy as a z-movie ... it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend it, I'm afraid.
