I have never seen a movie worse. <br /> <br /> Shooting is possible to make a video game and become a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Error 1: No connection between characters. In this movie, you do not have any personality links ... you do not have the chance. <br /> <br /> The only character or interesting character Deck Hand: played as a Salish. With Clint Howard. Unique character, the result of the film is senseless, since all the characters were troubled from the beginning. <br /> <br /> 2 mistake: the worst scene in the track ever happened. I love shooting. I love herded rocks and clean the house. I really like to sometimes clean the house. But that shot was strange. I think that the best way to describe this is "apathetic", as I see people shoot more emotionally and emotionally at BIDEOGAMA. In this movie they felt like "Actors" seemed to shoot everything that moved without emotion. <br /> <br /> Why? Where is trash spoken? Where are the heads of anger fired? These should be trapped children ... these are also true soldiers who work professionally and silently to show their humanity. <br /> <br /> I recommend the monsters of a horror movie full of isolated houses, the Sam Ramiren Evil Dead series. DO NOT see the ruin of the house of the dead. I hope the master of this movie and burn all copies.
