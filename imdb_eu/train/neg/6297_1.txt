I'm a Martin Amis fan and his book is a movie. Unfortunately, the director could not return the book to the screen. The novel is a very modern and very artificial post with its incredibly violent characters and inadequate development of traditional plot and character development. Human greed, abuse and grief are being investigated, a morale of British contemporary writers. The film's director has completely lost the novel. In the hands, he shouts the movie with incredible speed, allowing every tricks known and "odd" angle camera. It's like acid, like Ken Russel, and suffers from the old self-indulgence that drives more than a hundred tissues. Christian Solimeno, an illustrious illustrator of the beautiful illustrations, was enough for me to keep the chorizo ​​film. Abysmal!
