Along with the movie couple, a man and a woman begin the film together. They walk alone in the wilderness. Surely, the man listens to something and goes on to study so much. Our murderer squeezed the skin. Afterwards, the girl walks her back and cuts her throat. It comes from the killer camera in the open scene. <br /> <br /> We will meet the next four main characters, two pairs, in the rocks. Men would not have been able to handle twice a day in the field when they could not handle it, with the intention of leaving it a week before. Unexpectedly, man leaves the same day and breaks the cars. They arrive in the afternoon. When men arrive, they are warned by a crazy Ralph doppleganger in the woods. Warning is ignored, and in the dark, in the eighties, a song is played in the background, with letters that die in the dark forest. Men are lost. <br /> <br /> We see the next scene that this is not another Burn clone, but a ghost story! Women, fears and solitaires meet together with fire. Both children appear in the shadows and decide to play with Tom. Well, of course, like ghosts make their voices! Their mother's blood will populate from the forehead through the hole, and their two children ask their children to see, before they disappear. <br /> <br /> Children bring their father home and tell them about two beautiful women near the river. This makes a great deal of mixing and rises, taking his knife over the fireplace. "She's looking for her father," the little girl tells her a bad performance. It is clear that my father is not a ghost like his children. <br /> <br /> In the woods something is silent, the blonde token splits, blinds in the night, has a knife. He finds out about the father who says he's hungry and they'll be quick. This does not make sense that we had heard that panthers (perhaps it was allergic! Panthers honestly in California anyway). It hurts the pain before it squeezes the head. The storm storm and the man seek shelter, that is, wherever his father lives. Obviously, someone is living here because there is a fire and something strange is burning on it. Children appear and warn about their father, and they will appear later. As soon as they arrive, they disappear. <br /> <br /> For any reason, our killer only goes after the women. He invites the man to have something to eat and his story about his ex-wife. He is not allowed to deceive his wife. The old man does not say, however, that he dies after his lover, but who dreams about it. We do not give cause for the disappearance of children. Men are sleeping and they are left with enemies. The next day, men find a pure camping of their brides. After a short talk they split up. He is in the campsite, the other goes and he gets help. He who returns his car breaks his leg. Then we meet with children, telling the surviving woman that they are ghosts that are dying of being sad about their mother. Women help their friends meet <br /> <br /> The next scene defines the logic of the movie when a man dies at the waitress's house. Likewise, he was married or married to the blonde. In some way, children die and say to the woman about it. He looks at himself and finds himself murdering. Fortunately, children threaten to stop constantly. You know where you are going. <br /> <br /> Generally, the movie is worth ten stars out of ten, which is generous. For all its doubts, the music score is well-done. Still seen. There are some angle faces that look like a professional, and some sets work well. The plot is incredible. There is no such thing as a delusional belief, but eleven miles of aphids; I can not imagine that the token blonde would come out in the middle of the night. I mean, come on! <br /> <br /> - Alan "Skip" Bannacheck
