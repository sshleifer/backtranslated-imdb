In Italy, the cult worship is a particularly nasty start-up with a nonsense title (though there is less in THE MARK OF Satan's substitute plot), the Gothic Horror and Giallo (with a large dose of Erotica) that hybrid. Does it create flat spots? It matches the really marvelous manipulation! Here, we get the usual group of people (a theater group) damaged on an island (because it had been invited by a Count County, because it was in love with the well-known woman, a spouse)! There are many stereotypes in the characters: the middle-aged but the brave hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and his family's history is more than his quintessential tragedy), a sensible hero, a rude friend (remembering Mae West and annoying!), a hands-on director, but more generous (one forever and for all chided!), a couple of lesbians, a mysterious gardener (everywhere Luciano Pigozzi who, once, gets an action, if you know what I mean), the lover of the house (Femi Benussi star nominal, however, what it deserves, this is a set of pieces), a fanatic, religious fanatic, impressionable rooms ... while not in the movie. It means unwatchable, duplication of atrocity, snail's rhythm, poor production (scenes depicting white sea and white-and-white films) and only half an hour after the end of murder is not contributing to matters. On the other hand, the scores of Marcello Giombini, though in itself, are always pleasant, are always in line with the modern one; Having said that, the revelation proves surprisingly well-meaning (there is probably no suspect here).
