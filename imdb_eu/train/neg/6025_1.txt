Left Behind is the kind of "we know what we know what we know", it is necessary to help the Christians (and most of the innocent people) feel like they need "THINK" and "BELIEVE" (not "know"). to the right. But at the same time I feel bad for young boys, this is not a good movie. It does not help any message. I work in a video store, and I know how to see this movie because people were religious and that was their opinion. There is a wrong person who thinks about what will happen in the future in this country, if they think they do not know it. I had enough people to run around my nose (but I was too much alone), I think they want to say that I have a movie with a semi-talented television actor. <br /> <br /> Please, if you love yourself, you will stay away. I refuse to enter into details about this movie (I do not see AI because I did it), B-it's been bad for managing my door (because I was not there), or I really do not have something bad (because I'm). Reason (I do not want to understand anyone who helped make this movie) I want this movie from my mind, that is, I want to do it myself. I want to see that I've seen an OPEN NUMBER, I want a message that Kirk is proud of and finishes at the end of the movie. I'd like to see all the things I want before I see this movie in my mind, everything that is linked to the movie that floats in my mind GET OUT! My peaceful rage ends. I feel that someone in the world could go to the theater to see what would happen to the movie in the future (but not in the future) they would give them $ 7 more in front of the number of charities of Human, Animal or Solar Forest, and then they would not be able to believe "true" for being authentic. back (****)
