I read the comments when I watched the movie, and I did not believe them. I love bad films and I expect this to be average. It was not. This film makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look good. The movie has a bad performance, poor sound, a bad mess, a bad make-up and so much that I got bored. even though nudity was nasty! Do I have a quote for this movie? I do not think they did. You'll like this film in the first or 5 minutes. If you want a good cheeseburger, check the toxicity of the 4 or even outer blood. Avoid the trash: I saw it on TV, and I felt rot, so I did not spend anything. The best part probably ends.
