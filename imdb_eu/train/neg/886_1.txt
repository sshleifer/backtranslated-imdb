A few years before Paris, J'TAIME. People created, perfect but very friendly (my rating was 7), this piece of garbage was created in New York. <br /> <br /> In Paris, I Love You (J'taime) created the feeling for Paris and it was performed in different parts of Paris. <br /> <br /> I did not know about New York at this current movie, I did not feel it. I was in the city of my birth. <br /> <br /> New York has 5 burgos, I do not see scenes in the Bronx, or in Queens, There's a scene in Brooklyn (Brighton Beach). Times Square or the Greenwich Village scene there is no beautiful hotel or theater scene. It has a great deal, most of the performers are not stereotypes, but they are the most caricatured ones. <br /> <br /> There are very few humorous people, of course, who are sexually or severely offended. We all know New Yorkers and we love them. <br /> <br /> Some of the films selected to be 'Razzie' were much better. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (out of 4)) 20 points (from 100 onwards) IMDb 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> In my thoughts, I think it should be a title <br /> < br /> NEW YORK.
