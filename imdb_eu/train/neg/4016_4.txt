In 2002, a DVD published in the UK Code HRGD002 cover, no ASIN, on the VFC 19796 disk, the IFPI code is not on the inside edge. <br /> <br /> Probably, direct transfer from VHS. <br /> <br /> There is not much point to comment on a movie for adults. But this has a minimal plot, and the characters are credible. It was shown in the United States of America in the normal cinemas. <br /> <br /> I have seen Pennsylvania in 1975. <br /> <br /> So, it's worth a place in the Encyclopaedia movies. . The DVD does not have any special features and subtitles, and it was probably done using a VHS tape as a source
