I have noticed that all other reviews in this film are "healthy" and "entertaining". People need more time to get out. I do not know why they're sucking this fluff, insipid, brainless piece. Pat Boone does not have any talents any talent, and only surpasses his ineptness in his first notebook (Pamela Austin, the old model) (a talented model that goes beyond the prohibition of public outreach to the wicked practice that justifies it, unfortunately today the custom that follows today). A good help job (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortyon, among other things) tries to make sense efforts, but in vain. I noticed that two directors were sharing credits, although the word "credit" I could not use (not even the "director"). As for "entertaining leisure", many of these types of films are available without torturing your loved ones, forcing them to sit. Search for one of these films and jump.
