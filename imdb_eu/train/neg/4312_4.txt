During this time of women's rights movements there is a satire. Of course, this does not mean that COACH (movie) is a wonderful experience. FASTBREAK (which was better, but still deep), is basically a standard fare. It's important for me to say something understandable. Anyone who drives away from a normal job on the way to sudden victory leads to waste. This is the same feeling that you get when you see it. A good attempt to send the opposite sex to a pleasing man, but I expected better things.
