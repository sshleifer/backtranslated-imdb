I have to say that there is no bad budget movie, so that was not my problem. My problem is that I was watching my neighbor next to me. As soon as a man who seemed to have everything about the IMO wrote a fast story, he started capturing and shooting a camera. I understand how to do this effectively, but when I pay for a movie I feel like I'm seeing a professionally-made movie. It is an excellent actress and it was well on this movie. There were no other people there. I understand how it should be fun and cheaper to use as friends with friends and relatives, but it does not work to persuade them. It seemed like a shot, it tried to make a scene much more interesting, but when writing, argumentation and acting begin, this type of style is not necessary, and that's it. a distraction <br /> <br /> At the same time, at the technical level, there were digital archives at all. The first scene of these fine cars, when they slowed down the scan, bent a bit back and forth. The problem is not in my show instruments (Benq PE-8700 84 "diagonally) but somewhere in production, I have never seen any artifact before I've made the film professionally. They did not make any voicemail, unless they look like a track in the movies, it seems like a camera microphone.
