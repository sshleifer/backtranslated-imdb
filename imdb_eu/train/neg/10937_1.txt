For a long time, there will be a movie, so huge, I feel obliged to warn people. If I work all day and can only save one soul when I watch this movie, it will be good for me. <br /> <br /> Where did my talk begin? For beginners, music editing was about five minutes. There was no character development. Each character was a stereotype. I was very smart, he ate donuts, a stranger boy, etc. It seemed to him that the script was being shot by films. The value of the production was very low, as I was seeing a small video presentation. Directors, producers, etc. Have you ever watched the movie? The shortcut is worse and worse with each new entry. The concept of this movie was so funny. How could he go with Gary Coleman and the actors were somewhat legitimate? But believe me when I say this, things went wrong, very badly.
