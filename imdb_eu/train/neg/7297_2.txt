Opening interviews and scenes, I knew I needed to destroy a train. I did not want to look, but I could not leave. There was no candy for this movie, I'd give it a star. The interaction between characters and relationships has been found so far away that the bad news and the incredible story that has been added is that this is a low-budget disaster.

But this film has not been so terrifying. <br /> <br /> It was stuck in the trees, your best childhood friend is not only stranger, but other friends are dying around you, strangely. place, what would you do? <br /> <br /> A.) Escape everyone and try yours on your own. B.) Make sex with your friend with your friend. C.) Take a hot bath to relax your discomfort and shave your legs. D.)

Stay away. Stay away
