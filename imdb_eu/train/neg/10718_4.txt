Come to Tina Fey, you can do it better. As soon as I started the movie, I knew how it was over. Certainly it was fun. Even ridiculous laughing loudly. But it's not enough laugh to save this movie. I do not recommend buying this. I highly recommend renting, but all of this. Baby Mama has some fun scenes, but it is predictable and does not end with the ending heart. <br /> <br /> Tina Fey and Amy Poalher did a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher did this very well, they do it well. But that is not the best. Baby Mama had a great help. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add magnification to them. <br /> <br /> Another pregnancy film has hit the world of cinema. After Knocked Up and Juno, Baby Mama is a very average average. Knocked Up and Juno ridiculous, Heartwarming and end up giving you a smile on the face. Baby Mama was over and it was dull. <br /> <br /> Baby Mama was not the best annual comedy and is not trying. I recommend it, but do not expect to be completely hilarious. The average comedy of a great emotional ending is expected. I give my baby a mother ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
