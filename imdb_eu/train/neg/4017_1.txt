Yes, this film takes a lot of attention and is considered as a genre of the adult film genre. However, I did not like it. A woman who is suicide on a scene that is more suited to horror films, will soon be able to return to Earth to live a life of lust. Unhappy sex scene to follow. Why are they miserable, because they try to be artists who take away from real sexual activity. I mean, we do not see the sex porn movie. Little Girls Blue also makes things artistically, but it's still very erotic and nice to look at. Of course, the girls are very nice. We're going to have a non-appealing actor that does not help things. If you find yourself unlabelled in your adult movie, I do not have the visual art to enjoy the movie. The scene of the sexes extends to the curious Yucatan ... I mean one of them is a snake. So, for me, the movie fails because you do not know me anymore, but do not miss it.
