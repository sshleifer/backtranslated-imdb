Now, this film will not frighten anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons - two big and smaller reasons ... well, for three reasons, it's not. <br /> <br /> The first reason this is interesting is the special effects. It seemed very interesting and spectacular to me. To see her hair grow on Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning, especially when they participated in ménage à trois. <br /> <br /> It's interesting that Marsha Hunt is famous as "Brown." The "Sugar" Rolling Stones song, and the nude nude scene in London's rock music scene. <br /> <br /> In addition to special effects, there were two more points in this film. , and they were repeatedly posted close to credit. I changed it, but I swear that Sybil Danning had given us the points in the lower credits at least a dozen times and maybe many more. These were the main features of the film.
