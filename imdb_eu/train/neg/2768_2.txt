This movie was awesome. <br /> <br /> They did not develop any personality and the story was terribly frightened. The hitchhiking was accurate. The scene of such films' action was expected to be strong, but D-Wars was surprised at that department. <br /> <br /> In addition, the play was above the low-budget pornographic level. And I mean seriously. <br /> <br /> I was really happy to see the end credits, it was bad !!! Please, whatever you do, do not waste your time and money in a fictional movie like D-Wars.
