One year a young boy tells his mother that he is not his son and wants to return to his mother's real home. <br /> <br /> In any case, De L'Innocence is a different comedy. The time to make movies, maybe the 60s or 70s. Without a doubt, I reminded Losey's Secret Ceremony (1968) and Richard Loncraine's Full Circle (1977), as well as the loss of parents and "losing" children, pain and relationships (Mia Farrow's starring star). > <br /> There are three characters that play characters with strangers and unexplained characters. Three films have a cold feeling, emotionally and literally. Three films address relationships between mother and child and, after all, the three films ask: "What is real, what is imagined?" <br /> <br /> Beautiful, but mistake, it does not offer easy answers, and hangs a lot, silently and strangely.
