It is incredible that all the great crimes that have been revealed at the entrance to Marxism and all the different crimes that have been established, still admire the Hollywood Wall and communist totalitarianism, including the Gulag Archipelago and the Khmer Khmer art of the Cultural Revolution. They're still making propaganda. It's just a Hollywood moral outline. <br /> <br /> In this film, a psychotic killer is glorified. Needless to say that he does not have to commit crimes or even psychotic records. The director and the actor hope that the viewers will see sequel to propagandistic films that are apparently constantly sitting on the tunnel view of worship objects.
