Jared Diamond did not have animals in other parts of the world, but the first part of the Europeans made a point, which is why we considered steel and complex machines. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But in the third part, when South Africans moved away from the north, with Zulu and other tribes They gathered * cattle to gather and plant crops *. So what shows the lack of technological, economic and artistic achievement, if the keypads necessary to proclaim the author? <br /> <br /> Diamonds, also called the "black slaves", are the main weapon of the virus (which leads to North America). Well, 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 original warriors and 400 non-military South Africans with 10,000 Zulus * in both cases * in both cases, and then consider that germs do not matter. Without or without germs, we were successful. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Malaria prevented the colonization of northern Europe, caused by Europeans "killing" thousands of Africans. (I would like to know real numbers but it does not mean). After all, he eventually killed Malaria thousands of Africans and that is why they can not catch us. So what is Jared? Did he help the Malaria to the Africans, stop Eurpeans or hurt them? And how did Europe experience pests during our history? <br /> <br /> It seems that the reason for the Europeans seems to be lucky. Sometimes he thinks he has a risky routine theory of evidence, but he does not accept that Europeans have succeeded in working for their work. It's sad to see this clear neo-Marxist reality, to prove its point.
