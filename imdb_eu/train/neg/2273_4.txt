This was not the main disaster I expected, but this is very positive in the description of the movie. I do not know what fun about that movie, but I think he likes everything. Personally, it's not fun to watch the life of imitations or to watch the madman on TV, but I'm no longer a fan of Jerry Spring's horrific debate. I did not see it too much bored, but I never enjoyed it. If you want to see a bad movie, but it's not painful to sit down, this is a good thing.
