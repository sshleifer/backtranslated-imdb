The slow pace of this movie was probably a direct intention of the director to show what he could have grown up as a teenage girl in China. However, I have found a combination of the slow glacial "plot" and the general style of shooting, especially to Western audiences. Sometimes I had trouble distinguishing some characters from being shot from that distance. Over the course of two hours, I took care of myself. Not only in music, but also in China's history and culture (and not as strange as Chinese cinema), I can not engage with a single character and I have not found anything to fit my teeth. . The question is: if I did not like it, who would land? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of any other Chinese director I have ever seen. This bad effort is not measured at all. I'm sorry I think China was considered against that movie reference.
