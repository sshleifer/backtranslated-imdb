He will receive the character of Martin Kosleck with a curious character that is credible. His dialogue gives a strange sense of realism, making Marcel the sculptor a persuasive person. The character finds himself as a true person and not so much a typical criminals of the B movie. <br /> <br /> The story line is not written at home, and many scenes are sad. This work is a strange chemical between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton. Kosleck's speaker and philosophical character is Hatton's low key and monosyllabic. Creeper's character does not develop much more than the basic monster level, but Hatton does not develop options and explains the story about himself. <br /> <br /> This movie was a great girl at Shock Theater, so I'm fond of nostalgia. It is still worth the wait for those who enjoy the horror films of Fortune.
