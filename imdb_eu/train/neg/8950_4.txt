For some time, I've heard about this novel, many of my friends recommend reading me. I searched everywhere and found it at last. It is a book that every man should read, because he is genius and vision. I enjoyed every page. <br /> <br /> I met the movie and I could not see it. When I was very disappointed at the end, many things in the book are not in the movie (I do not think this is a spoiler) the movie is not logical ... Michael Radford could be a good director. but a bad writer. Above all, the book adopter. The movie is not dark, writing is very bad, it's good, though great, it's acting. John Hurt is an amazing actress and Winston Smith's only face. <br /> <br /> They make me harder not to read the "best adaptation" of the IMDb without reading this book! Or do you know anything about screen writing! <br /> <br /> You can understand the brilliance of the story by reading the book, do not you consider this as an alternative? As a book hobby, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The points that I gave for this movie are played.
