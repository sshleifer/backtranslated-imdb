I think that this would be much better, if they were portrayed in Cajuns's most believable light. My family comes from the south-eastern Louisiana region and lives in south-eastern Texas (about 20km from Lake Charles). I have never heard people like me about growing up, as they did. Cajun turned around. Most of the cachens I know are very proud and proud and do not make any training about how people talked about it. In general, it was a good movie, with great landscapes and music. I understand that the writers were in Lake Charles, and they have knowledge of the environment, but for all Cajun love, read the actors' language analysis, how they are portraying people and how they understand it. You will go before you try to play like them. In my opinion, when the actor thinks this is a much better movie!
