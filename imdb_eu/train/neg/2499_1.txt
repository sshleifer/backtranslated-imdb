The cast of this movie includes some of New Zealand's best actors, many of whom I have seen, but yet this film fills a lot of shame to be in the same country as the nation itself. False accented Americans are the first rush to go through the wrong stuff. Like another review, in a sneak-peeking way, a luxury cruise ship is an old car ferry, decorated with many stolen colored banners. Shortland Street (New Zealand) is the most watched director. In Shortland Street, a Christmas party means that this movie has dreamed that anyone who is too much and maybe a bit of salmonella. Imagine the "Under Siege", known by "Love Love Boat", organized by your first primary school and directed by autism and you will get the idea. <br /> <br /> If you're an actor, I suggest you watch this movie. to analyze how to destroy the caregiver.
