The quality of the video is horrible. The sound quality is pathetic. The play is horrible. The conversation is painful. The lighting is bold. The edition is not dark. I could keep it, but it would not make sense. Snitch'd is a third-party video as a feature film. This is best to collect dust in the store vault bin.
