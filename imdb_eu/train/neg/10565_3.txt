You can give JMS and boys to their series early and in a small budget, but the movie is still a sub-par. I do not realize it badly. The B5 series is never the best series, but when watching the movie, I would not order the series. As an actor I do not like O'Hare, the clothes are stupid and there are many shades. The same thing can be said in the first season (except Babylon Squared and survivor); Bruce immediately set a fire and was an amazing spectacle. If you are a B5 fan and you have not watched this movie, see. If you are not a fan of B5, no ... you do not want to watch the series.
