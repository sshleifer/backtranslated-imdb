I watched this movie in the theater. As soon as I gave the cashier money, he told me the two words I had never heard in the theater: "There is no refund!" As soon as I heard these words, I would say I would like my money and go home. But no, I went stupidly and I saw the movie. This movie did not laugh at the theater. Not at all. Not even unnoticed! Most of all, we sat in a stunning silence. Ten minutes or so, someone would shout "This movie!" The enthusiasts applauded each other and then sat silent for ten minutes and slept.
