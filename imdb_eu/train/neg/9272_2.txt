I decided to review the Omen trilogy again (here is the demon music here) is fourth. I did not expect anymore, and, therefore, he had my hopes. If you're laughing at bad movies, it's just a movie for you. Oh, where do we start? <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the movie "TV made" is obvious. Music was often wrong with what was happening in the film and, therefore, (in good health). The script had an entire 8-year suspended fiction work. But one thing to say is that the script does not fit perfectly with the bad performance. Many scenes let me take into account the screenplay or script that was the source of the script. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite thin, based on all the daughters of Damien Thorn's daughter. playing badly and playing badly in religion. He has developed a mysterious and confusing untrue death, personally developed the "drama", and the usual third-rate investigator on the whole reality. Later, through some medical phenomena, Damien Thorn was born Jnr. And that is quite a plot. It is a very bad thing to do since the beginning, because the suspense was missing a monotonous and / or ridiculous scene after another. <br /> <br /> There were many WTFs?!? even moments of unwanted comedy relief. For example, at the beginning of the film, the main reaction occurs when the baby's mother's body scratches? Almost 360 degree head. I also dispersed too much of the Baptism reaction. The baby is crying and everyone looks very worried. Mum worried about escaping from the church, and the priest is very scared to cross himself. Eh? Then, it is the new nanny of the nanny, to show the age of 8 years of all kind of spiritualization. When I was laughed, I proposed bringing Delia confusing to a psychic fair with the nanny hippie friends and the mother only lifted her shoulders and allowed her. "Yes, that's why I filled my 8-year-old daughter with a mystique mental confrontation, well, I do not have to be there." Of course, that is to say, his daughter allows Rottweiler to take a full adult, of course, girls who can scam people on the street. The whole scene of the psyche fair is quite comical in slapstick mode, from the horrible reactionary psychic stars to Delia, and from later to hell. <br /> <br /> He also laughed at the boy's death. "terrible accident". Here we have a religious field (which is described as being part of a worship), which fanatizes a hole full of crustulules, to prove the glory of God. Snakes antagonize them by handling them and sometimes bite them several times. Almost an awful accident. More than one successful suicide. <br /> <br /> The snake vs. nun scene was not the only comic of death. Slow speed goes into a car park in the car accident. Then, the detector's direct damping ball stops. I think maybe I went there and when I had coffee, I only started to stop demurating the demolition of the demolished ball directly to the "worried" detector. After all, who is shooting a gun-cliche death, a gun goes out and they both shot a few seconds, while exchanging a horrible look. Then, someone who was revealing the victim, someone goes down. Also, at the beginning of the film, the priest's death seemed strange and weird. Surrounded by the church's architecture. Of course, this is quite worrying, he eventually collapsed, slipped into his chest and died. Apparently, something demonic was happening, that is, what music was suggesting. Ummm. ADOS. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that others have studied the film well and, in particular, "as a sequel worthy". It's hard-press-curious to guess, realistic performances and bad musical scores. The movie does not have any suspicion, and Delia's "demonic look" has a great confidence in offering a horror feeling that makes it a bit annoying. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This movie is a bad thing, but the unwanted potential of being a comedy.
