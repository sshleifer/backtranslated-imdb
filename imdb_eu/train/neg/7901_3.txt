. . . It's a bad thing, if it's a Troma movie, at least it would lead to a breakdown of violence and anarchic release would bring a bit of my opinion. <br /> <br /> So, what is a low budget and modest (with an unknown director that he produced by Roger Corman, he later became an unknown). Gremlins (1984) / Critters (1986) - almost flat humor, few. According to the logic of Gremlins so well - fantasy-logic or not, no suspense, sense of adventure, and no violence or nudity. <br /> <br /> Although some screenwriting problems are the script's own - let's see, no one can deliver jokes to make fun - most of the guilt seems to have fallen into the lap of Bettina Hirsch. In the larger hands, Munchies might be entertaining. <br /> <br /> In the end, it starts like a lot of adventure movies. Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are Peru in archaeological excavation. Simon is a wonderful archaeologist, who always moves theories about the links between ancient sites and foreign civilizations. For example, he thinks he proves laser operation in ancient stone. So, when Machu Picchuren is looking for newer theories of Simon when they are in a secret chamber. After discovering inside, they will double "Arnold" an animal that duplicates a munchies. <br /> <br /> They will take Arnold home to a small desert town in California. Simon, who thinks Arnold is an alien being unexpectedly, has to go to the talk of a colleague, and means that colleagues finally have an alien copy. Paul and Cindy (Nadine Van der Velde) are very pretty girls in charge of Arnold, but they have not seen each other for a long time, as Arnold has not let them know when they enter. </ B> <br /> Meanwhile, Simon's brother Cecil (Korman also plays in a double role), is the owner of a succulent food business, who wants to buy Simon's land and land. Simon does not want to sell, so Cecil Arnold has robbed him. Things are gradually taken away under control, and munchies, with their desire to go along with a junk food, begin to invade the town. <br /> <br /> The screen plays better than in a read-only summary. The best shots of the film are in the background with natural landscapes, such as driving the characters in the desert village. Inside, except Cecil's house, they look like decorated and cheaper, and more importantly, Hirsch does not show great skill in blocking and setting up plans. Oddly enough, in overall production design, Cecil's house is quite a treasure, filled with over-80s style styles, and to the smallest detail, Cecils Dude (Jon Stafford) was a fun counterpoint. It's bad, then, that the movie is coming out so fast. <br /> <br /> In any case, Korman is a fun actress, but finds himself much better than Simon as Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon ends up in most movies. Cecil, a dangerous body physicist who separates physically, is not just the "evil capitalist" of the movie, as Korman's brave and simple character. That was one of his specialties, he was often activated in the chapter on "Carol". Burnett Show "(1967), unlike" The Carol Burnett Show, "because Clark Jones and Dave Powers were looking at ways to boost skits, Hirsch pushed him into Korman too much, and Cecil's character did not just work as it should be. <br /> <br /> There are many problems related to other directors, at least periodically and edibly, which dramatically dissipate any suspicion or the dramatic influence of the movie, as well as scenes that were to be used to improve drama. At the beginning of the morning, when a woman is on the way, old women on the way, they get together much harder, so much to have an impact. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Machu Picchuren's chef? It seems that the movie trailer shows the answer, but it was released from the last board. The worst thing is that, unlike the gremlin, munchy does not have any reason to go. From monster threats to wonderful monsters. It happens. Additionally, because Munchies PG is stored and it continues to be a bit of violence, when these creatures are in their monster phase, they are never very threatening. They can also be easily sent, at least temporarily. <br /> <br /> Actually, the meaning of the movie is not suspense, horror, compelling drama or any other thing, but humor. Gremlinsen is a mistake and many of his races. So, the movie is not fun, though they made me laugh a couple of times. They are a surprisingly high percentage topical chips of Txantxeta. The rest of the material is not too sequential. With a bad season with Hirsch, everything is empty. It was a potential movie, finishing, funny and terrifying, hilarious and disturbing, cheesy and suspensful at the same time as Killer Klowns Outer Space (1988). Bad, then, Munchies does not get anywhere.
