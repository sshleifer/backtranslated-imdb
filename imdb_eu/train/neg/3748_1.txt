... but that does not work and I'm surprised how many people think it's good. What causes? Here and there are some tips that are loose, but the whole material is self-indulgent and not convincing. Lynch's films are, in general, fascinating because they create confusion and yet they are very playful. There is a visual sense, sub-planes, characters, ideas, etc. But this is sad and yes, it does not make any sense. It's because they're going to be "small," too small, or just they'll be told sooner. Lynch DV is exploring, this is not the case. 1/10
