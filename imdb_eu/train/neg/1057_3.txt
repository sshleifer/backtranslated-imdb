Sorry, I was really excited about this movie. Unfortunately, it was long, thin and very weak to pay my attention. When I realized that the whole movie was only about an old man who revived the dream, I was cheated. Surely, it could be a device to become deeper, something that is more meaningful. <br /> <br /> So do not buy a lot of drinks or go to the room. My children also did not enjoy it. Oh well.
