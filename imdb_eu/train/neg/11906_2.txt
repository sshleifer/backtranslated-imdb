At the end of the 80's, "Der himmel über Berlin" was a profound experience for me: "So this movie can be." "Paris, Texas" and "Until the end of the world" has a special place in my heart and mind - the will of the Wim Wenders genius. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in recent years the quality of "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Land of Plenty" has been steadily declining. There are fascinating images or music. No search or display was found. Everything that remains us is the expression of characters and political sunsets, because they are merely clichés, and, in truth, they make the intelligence of a mature public. <br /> <br /> Is it dry well? Whatever the reason, Mr. Wenders' time is stepping up or stopping.
