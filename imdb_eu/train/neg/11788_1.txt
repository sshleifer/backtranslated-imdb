That was the worst film ever! !!!!!!!! It was so bad, I laughed at the whole movie! The earth was cheesy; above all, the end. This movie becomes the end of the world as a catastrophe. I mean! And I swear ... I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for the anchor! And the two main characters that were divorced in the middle was this emotional scene of kisses. What is predictable! My mother and my sister were very horrible, and we could not finish it, and when we finished it, it was a year later! We saw it for the second time and when we finished this, we made similar comments to MST3K throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Summary: watch that you are a movie basher! Make fun of comments, watch this sleep in the nightmare, and I mean laughter enormous. See also mockery. The metaphor that explains this film: This movie is a field full of teens and socks.
