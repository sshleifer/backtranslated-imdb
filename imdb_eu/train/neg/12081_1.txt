Release of George Litman and others: Mystery Science Theater 3000 riff "I do not think, breeder". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What is your favorite "riff"? Why was you "liked" his own? Because it was a nonsense. that and "no!" At all times, I would say that we have to give MST3K crew to try this tough movie. You really can not have much fun in the conversation; Bill S was a good playwright. On the other hand, this production is so bad, although it would have rejected it. junior high school drama club can do better. <br /> <br /> I'd recommend reading a book and reading 'Hamlet'.
