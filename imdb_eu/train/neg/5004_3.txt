Wow it's ironic that I've taken some time for this movie, I think someone else just reviewed two days ago. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw the movie Nick Stahl, for the record. br /> <br /> The movie was ridiculous. The characters that took me to INSANE, were SO Clause and STEREOTYPED. This movie was the worst case I've ever heard. There was too much ground space. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the movie, however, saying the scene: "Hot heart, cold gun" where Nick Stahl dies the evil little girl. (Well, they were all really evil). But it was great to play in that scene. His look on the face reminded me of American Psycho (a good movie). It's worth watching the scene, but it's not worth the movie to watch for the rest, do it aside and ignore it.
