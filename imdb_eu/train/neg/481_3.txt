When movies are myopic, when you want to put an end to a special vision, it does not cause problems with a real story. Here is the type of film that generates the first or the focus of the first film, and the story is only tight. That's why we talk about the story of "leap through hoops", logically progressing at the same time by pre-ordering. <br /> <br /> The story of "Comet Over Broadway" is not leap through hoops, it's three ring circus. It's very playful, so misunderstood, so false, if you tend to talk loudly on the screen, you'll do it sooner than anything. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this script. The pond is the female who chooses between the family and the profession. It's totally terrifying because it will be offensive to people who give opinion. So, in the end, there is no point in the story, it becomes an irrelevant topic and, as often happens, it is not a thing to do with acting as a writer.
