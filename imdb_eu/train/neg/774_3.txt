It seems that this film has made someone with good ideas, but never before made the movie, nor did they even make a script, or even think it was more fun. When I saw this movie I saw it for John Candy and I said it would be hilarious. Instead, there was a stupid line of account control and it was in different and blurred moments. And finally, Candy heard some raw lines that I heard at that time. Therefore, despite being potentially fun and even though it's the theater's idea, we will be left with a giant and entertaining event for an average adult stupid. However, teens can find some laughter. Pity really - it could be much better. I mean, Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy should be wonderful.
