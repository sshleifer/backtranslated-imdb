Although not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised by his name when I saw Joshua's inaugural credits. Hailing, I did not realize until I started the movie 'Josue'. Needless to say, I was watching the movie, not the director. A kind of "Rosemary's Baby", "Omen" or "Joshua", was billed in any other demonic film bill. Unfortunately, the flat one fell. Slow, very slow and flat. However, I continued to see how this was resolved, waiting for the longest wait for belief, this would end. Okay, I accepted (slightly), but what was closed. And what is the bottom-low budget movie, or at least how they were designed. Does a person fall? You do not see a drop, you see someone who is lying in the blood. Does a person hit a taxi? You do not see, you see someone complaining, keeping a bike. I do not know if this is called "style" or laziness or simply lack of funds for special effects. Is "a wealthy family" with a crazy mother, everything that is working father is trying to balance? Joshua may / may not be the baby who is new to the Antichrist and a lot of baby. How much is he who dreams of how much he lives? and what was it about that? Is there any rats or Joshua? His mother is nuts? Joshua is crazy? Is the origin of the new family just jealous? Will he be Michael Myers? Or does he drive his family? I do not think so. The predicted nuts were, and there was no "other" performance. Unfortunately, there was no question asked, the doors closed. I'm sure this could be the idea, but for Pete, give me something. Nothing There are also movies to be explored as much as possible. Joshua is like the Mini-Me of the Antichrist.
