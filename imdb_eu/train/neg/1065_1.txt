A friend's recommendation, my wife and I invited a couple of other people to this movie. They really asked me, we all hated and our watches came all the time waiting for the movie to wait. The tiny little videos are strange, with little entertainment. There was little scene in Paris - for example, I expected to see some of the photos of Aro Latina, but I can not know anything about it. Most of the scenes were inside a bar. No one has ever laughed at the theater or reacted in any way. If you want pseudo-intellectual, pretentious and pseudo-intellectual pseudo-intellectual films, do not miss it. If you're on earth like me, you'll feel that you've seen it.
