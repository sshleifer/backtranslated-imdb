Nick Stahl, the young boot and the VHS's attractive coverings, told me I bought and saw this movie, a good movie for teens. A dog! The entire screenplay of Klixas, interviews and performances is horrible, horrible, very bad, horrible, incredibly? Summing up, the whole loss of time. There is no fear, no black humor, a terribly boring story with shameful plots. The film begins with six characters, namely, three pairs, together as a group of friends, but the fact that very bad people seem to be enemies, they play a "foolish" game called "Taboo", writing each one of them or not. some taboo topics. That is to say, it is not the predecessor of the characters, the audience does not know who they are, their causes and their relationships. Then there is an ellipsis one year later, and the same groups meet together in a New Year's party, insulting each other. However, the plot and bends are so hilarious, predictable, unbelievable, and unbelievable, they do not deserve any extra line of criticism. The only advice: do not waste your time or money on this waste, you will definitely regret it. My vote is (it's horrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Taboo Jogando Com o Asesino" ("Playing with Tabuea Killer")
