I do not know where to start. This movie is like a baby on the morning of Saturday morning, which shows what was done at the end of the 80's at the beginning of the 90's. Similar to Captain Power or Power Rangers. It seems to overwhelm bad digital and "secret agencies" and "criminals". <br /> <br /> Playing is so bad, though it's not fun. The direction is horrible and there is little tracking. Someone seems to have thrown a bunch of scenes and forgot it was supposed to be a plot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most hilarious scenes in the movie will come early when planted by criminals. Explosive device in an auto car. For some reason, despite the fact that the device is clearly "detonated", the boy decides to go after motorcycles while away. This chase continues. Meanwhile, the bad boy performs short and totally insignificant behaviors. Bicycles, wheels, etc. One moment, the accident happened and the attackers threw it out of their bicycle, the bicycle was thrown over the agent car (clearly CGI), but the rider disappeared. Then, a few seconds later, the rider and the bicycle are back ... damaged by the incident. At this point, even though they were an explosive device that planted the car, they choose to steer attackers before shooting them, then blowing their car. That made it clear with CGI. Mixed sound And it's also the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> When I say Cgi we can not mention that we are doing here with Lord of The Rings. We're talking about the CGI type of Power Rangers, I really think he has made better Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> Savini and Todd why I never met the movie, I can only assume that we have made money because they favored or made blackmail ... probably the last.
