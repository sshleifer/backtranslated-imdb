This movie is one of the worst movie comedy I have ever seen. I hate Napoleon Dynamite leaks. It's just a matter of dealing with people. Do something new once. All these new comedies are awesome. And leaving Andy Samberg out of SNL is not yet preparing the main role. I hope you can bounce it from this awesome movie. And Will Arnetts is a bad character. Did you read the script Hey Will? The plot really written is the worst. Now you tell me this is strange. (This is a movie) Rod Kimble's dad is killing Frank and his family needs $ 50,000 to pay for heart surgery, so Rod plans to jump up with Frank to raise money. Rod solved Frank to prove himself in a fight and prove his manliness. Yes, that's the movie, you tell me, I'd spend $ 7.00 to see that piece of crap! <br /> <br /> Only 3/10 is awesome <br /> <br /> -adam
