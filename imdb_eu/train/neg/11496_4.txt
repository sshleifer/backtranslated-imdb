plan / manipulate a documentary on Guatemala's most obscure place. a fun, safe place ... but depicted as dull, a bunch of sex workers started playing football, it seemed like less than a week! The documentary is the main focus on demonstrating that society discourages this type of "employee", although poor women have not been able to solve them, except those who have never been documented, they were "stars" (as the title). he says) to make a real documentary exchange for real exploitation. However, he has a documented reality ... but, unfortunately, he has nothing to do with the storyline. I would not accept it again; but I would recommend it only for cultural purposes.
