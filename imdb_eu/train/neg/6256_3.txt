Hmm ?? In the opinion of the experts, "the curious person with generous tastes reviews this movie," he said. Watching the movie was pretty interesting. I think this was Marsden and Speedman, not the plot. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie is psychologically cumbersome and, on the other hand, very homophobic. It creates secondary and secondary fingers. I do not know if the movie is intended to promote dialogue or to foster fear and propaganda. <br /> <br /> I thought it was fake to play. There were many interviews about 90 degrees in reality. I wanted to get the meaning on the ground, but in the end, it's just a conversation with a mad man (Speedman). I'm sorry for him (Speedman), but not really. Its loss is no bigger and undoubtedly lower than the losses suffered by the most significant newspapers around the world. <br /> <br /> Does the film explain the naivete about HIV / AIDS? Yes: Target audience. Is HIV a mysterious and evil murderer? What is the victim The answer to two questions is NOT. HIV and victims do not pretend to be bad or melancholy of lupus, multiple sclerosis, TB, hepatitis, cancer or their victims, to God. As a disease is communicative, it does not deliberately or indifferent - or it's only evil. <br /> <br /> Is this pretext ignorance or foolish? - NO. All people should practice safe sex? - YES. Safe sex will save the world? - NO. Is safe sex realistic in all the love and lusts of passionate and emotional men? ?? NOSKI EZETZ Which world would we live, everyone followed the rules, would not anyone ever risk, and sex was never spontaneous and passionate ??? Did I discard that the film deals with sex specifically? ?? YES HIV spread is infected between blood and body fluids and infected. Sex is not required for transmission, gay or otherwise. <br /> <br /> I'm always disturbed by a person's violent ravages on another. I think that the movie has done a good job, portrays the nonsense of Tom's kidnapping, captives and Dan, and every day this type of violence is madness. movie: Tom crazy da. <br /> <br /> Why does not you ask Dan why you feel like that, what do you do? Implication: Men with sex with men get "AIDS" implication: HIV = AIDS. Where was Tom responsible for sexual activity? Why was the responsibility to use the Dan condom? "You may have slammed forward before pasting?" What are we talking about? Was one of the parties unconscious? "Maybe he did not want to hear the truth," you're joking "Is it right and right now I do not know what's going on?" Why is Dan living with HIV? No doubt NO! Why is the whole world so homophobic ???? Gay men think they are the cause of HIV, they will be given to the rest of the world and will we die? Are you kidding? People are completely stupid to think about homosexuality as the cause ... Is the problem? Do we feel about the tuberculosis victims? malaria? As a result of his wife's death, I see Tom wounded and guilty of AIDS, but seriously? Who is the fault here? Victims or viruses? Is illness really the responsibility of illness? (they do not want to spread the disease and they do not suppose). <br /> <br /> Surely safe sex is essential for a safe life, but it is not a driver, not a flight, do not leave the house, or a non-life. Do we really want to condemn the disease? Does safe sex between Tom and Dan prevent the disappearance of Tom's wife? Maybe, but Dan is not the only responsibility. <br /> <br /> Tom is crazy. I have said <br /> <br /> Tom to Dan: "maybe you deserve what you get" ?? BE IT! 24 days: violent, naive and homophobic. <br /> <br /> I have too much reaction? Maybe However, this film captures a gay man judging the "direct world" towards a rigorous and malicious intention to practice with private sex rather than the equivalent or better heterosexual rates that homosexuals make to safe sex. We all have to wake up and get worse about HIV / AIDS. HIV STRAIGHT is dying hundreds of Africans every year.
