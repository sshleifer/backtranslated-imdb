"Hak Hap" or "Black Mask" (English) was disappointing. They told me it was a kind of "Japanese version" of the Matrix. Imagine my desperation. The bad movie was dubbed or the soundtrack was not in the movie well. Another thing is that the conversation was pretty bad. There was little thought in the English version of this movie and the "nonsense action" is only called for the genre. No movie I want to see again.
