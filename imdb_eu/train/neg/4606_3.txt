This movie was an attempt to enter the most unlikely places, and maybe it would not be a warning. A similar trial in front of a curious case in the Cell Cell, although deeply and closely retracted is not near. The plot matches the initial camp. Then, the film is considered to be a "dramatic" turn, in addition to the plot it falls, the legs must be upright, first of all. <br /> <br /> It's basically an idea (Chris McKenna) that a child needs money. It takes on the role of a moving and has killed a city accountant. He does not pay for his work, but he is tortured for several days, because he dreamed that he had a "smart" idea of ​​trying to use a backup file. When he tried to prevent the removal of this stupid move, he carried out abusive and constant abuse. It starts to crash (very disturbing stories). He then thinks about paying and thinking about his sins, he dies and wins the wife of his affected wife (Kari Wuhrer). Shortly afterwards he sees who he is, he hits the tragedy, and the revenge over the air follows his torturers (Daniel Baldwin, George Wendt, Vernon Wells) due to the "previous" kindness. <br /> <br /> What should I ask, what is it with Kari Wuhrer and horror / gore-type movies? Lately, however, it has been in this genre. As it came out, I liked the "Eighth-legged Unhappy" and "Anaconda". However, although it tastes clearly (it is hot, hot), it can perform much better and choose better roles. Or maybe I'm wrong and that's wrong. For someone of you, you will see "fully assembled" in this movie, but it's pretty curious and short. I almost felt a bit of a movie after watching this movie (something with Kari's strange career). For example, sexual simulation will ask how things are going to be filming. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can say that there's a good performance. Just do not expect much from Daniel Balwin, whose career is steadfast for his brother Alex's second grade. The film made some famous celebrities, George Wendt (Norm from Cheers) and Vernon Wells (Commando, Weird Science). Chris McKenna is the best performer on the role of Sean Crawley. His low-performing experience and, however, his credulous nature as a young invaders, brings some substance elements to the movie. <br /> <br /> I would not go outside. If you get bored and you're tired of the old "The Hitchhiker" sections, then I recommend this. <br /> <br /> And Kari, please, get started better at some movies!
