A film about Harlem Renaissance and especially an author. He contrasts with a story about a young, black and young artist. <br /> <br /> If that is cracked, it's the same movie. Correctly correct, well written and (mostly) well-done. Also, past scenes are filmed by black and white Moody. Also, the offspring of a sex scene is one of the few non-unrelenting male films (it's not explicit and it's not the front). However, I especially hate that. <br /> <br /> The film snaps across the place, it is full of strangers (including the main protagonist) and (it's a killer) it moves in snails. I thought about three times leaving the theater and being very bored. The manager but I stayed there. <br /> <br /> This love affair shows the following words for 6 years. I would like this to be more like this (black films are very different, with black people), but I can not. If you are not interested in the Harlem Renaissance, there is no reason to see this.
