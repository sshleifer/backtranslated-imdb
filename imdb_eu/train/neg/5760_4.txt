Well ... I had to wait for the video to watch, and I wanted to, I actually caught the horror movie with the cable 2 on the other day, which is why I was more inclined. AIRPLANE was on CRACK ... I mean if you like any other airplane or Leslie Nielsen vehicle, you would probably be in the sky, but if you use WAYANS COMEDY normally, then you will undo it, there was a lot more. Eye candy is: Youngsters will be happy with young hormones, which is probably why they came up at the box office the first week. I enjoyed a horror movie 2 ten times more this fodder, and partly 5 times more. Insects 3 better than Part 2, but again I always liked the Halloween 2 original and yes. Maybe only for me. The most fun part of the movie should be Goodbye to Aliens. But this was not worth 11 dollars, so much to catch a former matinee. Save yourself money and capture part 2 again until the cable hangs on the video, and then rent it or buy it.
