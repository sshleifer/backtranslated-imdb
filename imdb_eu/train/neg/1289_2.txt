This was all low in western time. It's a very bad writing, it's impossible to emphasize the characters, they are unfeasible or soft, the violence is horrible and technically not very persuasive. And Tobey Maguire shows us the changing aspect of his talent, as he walks through his part, with such eye-catching expressions and his rude voice, which only manierism reveals here. 'Ride with the Devil' is one of the worst experiences in my five films, the western one has never to overcome it in negative respect.
