The blue monkey really mentions the movie, but it does not make any sense. At some point, some children are slowly exploring, exploring. <br /> <br /> They will find out what they are going to discuss, and one of them (a girl) tries to find that they will find a blue monkey. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's it. . The story is totally irrelevant, the only sad link to the title, and I do not know why it would lead to a blue monkey in the cellar basement. <br /> <br /> I am confused because I remember it, but I suppose someone needs to remember, I suppose!
