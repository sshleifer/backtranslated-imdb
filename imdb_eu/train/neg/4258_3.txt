I would give this movie a minimum of 5 to 3, it would be time-consuming ... When I first saw it, it seemed like a work that was not based on the artist's artistic skills. But I would prefer to say the idealist or the Kazakhstan government's stupid customs ... It's a shame, because they were shooting wonderful films 'Qazaqfil'm' because it was not well-known for Shaken Aimanov, but that was it. he really ran. 'Konec Atamana', 'Kyz Zhibek' or 'Aldar Kose'. But after killing Aimanov, he started producing quality movies for nearly 10 years. However, at the end of the 1980s, it was filmed "Assa", a film about the first organized crime groups in the country. A year later, Mr. Rashid Nugmanov shot another film by actor V.Tsoy himself. At that time, rock was a Soviet-style or "Russian" - the film "Igla" was completely new, that someone had revived a new wave of resurrection or Kazakh. Unfortunately, nowadays, we do not have quality films, directors who shoot financial aid from French and Japanese, and therefore the films are not public, but the authors are critical for some professional critics, some of which take a price at international film festivals, but there are just a few of them They become active ... And again to our nomads. Such movies are not very popular due to great aspects. Russian Czar Nikita Mikhalkov's "Cyrilnik Sibirski" was the same effect. They shot along with foreign partners, either French or British. Nobdy liked it, though in the Russian public, comics and comedies became the main subject of the show, such as 'KVN'. IMHO
