Ted V. Mikelsen's "Corpse Grinders 2" is a 103-minute, crispy cycle. Landlords are quite a fake business relationship that captures cats among those that eats cats, foreign cats, because they lose war with foreigners of dogs, to get some cat food. Looking at this movie, I started looking for any type of distraction, thinking that I was doing something else to calm myself away from the inside. <br /> <br /> The scene is too long. Characters make things easy for ever. I have heard that Mr. Mikels does not like to use jump cuts because they are afraid of being confused by the audience. I do not know that this attitude is "avant-garde" or "stupid". As I tried, I could not care for the character without an unnecessary party, except the old men who are well-knocked at the factory. Most casts are not huge talents. They will have to sing the cameras with the camera "Amazing Grace". Although the fault should be poor quality of sound, I only saw about 80% of the conversation watching the DVD. <br /> <br /> This is the worst film in the film. I've heard the episodes of the comment, and Mr. Mikels comes out as an amazing boy, what was he doing hell like this litter? I needed to hear the explanations of old men I would like to buy, waiting for you to land on a metallic carrier belt. I hate the long-awaited movies I find much better. Excalibur is in search of no good music and is looking for the year's dead lighting. I have to do something. Ignore this movie.
