In rare cases, the part of x files does not generate excitement or is something that is quite boring to see sections. The viewer and his former partners are not dying of circumstances. the presence of a little girl who died. The deceased is the theory that the dead killed their colleagues who had returned to the police as a little girl, and has begun revenge. Twenty-two times. It is not at all related and seems like a random person selected as reincarnation. I think it was somewhat lazy for writers, and this is the worst in the history of x files.
