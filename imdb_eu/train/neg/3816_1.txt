It has a bad performance. Bad stories Bad characters You should never see this show. Shut off Or you will bend for the next 30 minutes. He was never sent. It's not great. You should never see. NEVER ever. So now you want to see this concept. Turn THE CW to Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place, or for Nick Drake and Josh. So, believe me, I've seen. Honestly, and I have said honestly, the worst show I've ever seen and I've watched a lot of TV. So, make a favor and do not miss this show.
