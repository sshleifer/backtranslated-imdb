This movie was a bad train, it was incredibly terrible, you should still see it. We rented my boyfriend and I and we lost two hours of our day. Now I'm not writing bad, it's a good thing. In the film, in general, we both worsened. There was nothing positive or good about that scenario. After this movie, I had to rent a smaller car park. The usual actress Jennifer Tilly is very common. It seems its manic and not all its character. Darryl Hannah, though she is playing, makes a wonderful job considering the situation she is playing. More than once, I cried to the TV, told me to go back or be violent. In the end, a very violent film ... not for low hearts.
