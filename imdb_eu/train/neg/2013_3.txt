This movie is roughly similar to the futuristic version of Cinderella's legend, but with songs (quite often) with sex scenes! The movie is not sure what it wants and it ends quite badly. It seems to be more expensive than most Adamson movie directors, but it is not the same level of budget as the audience expects from the science fiction film. The actors are quite bad and, unlike most Adamson films, there is no great name or a big B actor. There are some good music, but it's easy to see why Cinderella was forgotten in 2000.
