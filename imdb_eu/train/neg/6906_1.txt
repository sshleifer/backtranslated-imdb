This movie has a bad plot, a bad direction and a great performance. Opens new meaning of racism. <br /> <br /> In this movie, "white whites" are sluts, "White" boys are Wana-be gangsters, and success (again) "White" businessmen are revolutionary shitters in the bathtub. <br /> <br /> I just wondering what would happen to the exact same film as the exact story line I did and the script, I did just about the Caucasus. "It's scary that you've finally seen that your black chicks have been closed." <br /> <br /> No one notices, but you will see again this film and the news. Zealand "white boys". Suddenly, his white groups are sucked into the main cause of aggression. The Samoan girls only have heart, there is no stranger girl. <br /> <br /> I do not like to do that film without giving it back to the community of New Zealand in the Caucasus community. If you think it's too generalized, watch this movie and see what you're doing "white guys." Samoa can call us "white guys" in real life, it does not mean fun. I said no black boy, I will lose my teeth. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie. Do not waste your money. Do not be racist.
