I made a mistake when I saw the whole movie a few nights ago. I am trying to recover God yet. This movie does not even worth 1.4 average. The IMDb has to be rated as 0 votes for the film that deserves such films. 1.4 It's TOO HIGH. <br /> <br /> I had heard this awesome movie, but I did not think the movie could be really bad, especially at the time and at the time. I thought all the crisp movie movies were nothing more than the 1950s and 1960s. My god was wrong. In my opinion, the movie is really bad. It's horrible; It's beyond pathetic; It is beyond any type of thinking. BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like the best Picture of the Year. SNAKE ISLAND (the worst movie I've ever seen before) Some Oscars deserve this pathetic effort. This was an effort to produce a Hollywood movie. This does not make a movie called business. In the first 25 seconds of the movie, I seriously thought I was trying to make a short movie theater class. Or better yet, the real thing I thought on Saturday night. I mean, it seems like that. The operation is horrible; The whole movie seems to have shot almost 20 years ago with a VHS video camera. special effects ... good after night after Mr. Bewitched had more special effects than this film. The scene thrown in the doorway is stunning and beyond. I seriously say that joining the university 4 years ago in college, everyone could have a better film than this. And the worst piece of the whole movie Arthur is naked in the bathroom. Oh, my god, it's almost that. I have a strong stomach, but it was horrible. Some people do not have to be naked, and it's one of them. The plot of this movie seems just nowhere. They talk about legal issues that we do not hear again; He never says never again to enter into music; Arthur says he is looking for work and money for the university, and the next time we see it, he is directing porn shops. Everything in the movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> This is not really my critique, but everyone knows, I'm not a gay man. However, I protect gay rights and I think we should all be the same. I would help any person in my church gay, like the cruel priest of this movie, by all means seeing all the words. (Where is F * (# * ing white?) Hahaha But I did not think anybody that hated this movie was about two men. It does not matter: this would be Ben & Jill instead of Ben & Jill was a great movie It was just as scary. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie to see if it was really bad or not. Yes, it was even worse than I said. Let me warn you all: ONLY, see here sitting and laughing If you want to make films in the XXI Century still be pathetic. If you watch this movie and you are waiting for a good movie or some entertainment, I do not have any betting. <br /> <br /> In the last thought: how in the world 7 of these films Is it over the top of the IMDb? There's no way 7 movies are worse than this!
