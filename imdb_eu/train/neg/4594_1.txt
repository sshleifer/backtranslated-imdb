I have had a lot of trouble with this movie. <br /> <br /> There are basic basic information about quantum mechanics, well. Although quantum physics has been in excess of 50 years, the film presents this information, it seems terrifying: "Did not you throw that way!" Well, not really. These are no longer broken ground for revelation. In any case, I already knew with quantum theory, and because of the equations of the waves, etc., it is not new. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie, however, is that these people use quantum theory to provide a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism. I do not have the most serious problems with mysticism and spirituality, but quantum mechanics do not have to do with these things, and it must be kept separate. They start with the ideas of quantum theory that have been interviewed for this film and then jump around thinking about thinking around you, so we should think positively for the world to have a positive impact. and improve our lives. Reason is completely ridiculous, and the consequences are not logically following quantum theories. For all "experts" who have been interviewed for this movie, theoretically physicists will not be able to agree. The underlying world view that should be underlined does not support mystical ideas about our spiritual relationship. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid that people watch this movie and eat it all. they leave a positive positive feeling. The main part of the film is based on the misinterpretation of quantum theory and as an argument that is just as bad as an attempt to justify pseudo-scientific arguments similar to organized religion. <br /> <br /> Do not get this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes. At some point, one "expert" says that false hypotheses about the world have been fake throughout history, so nowadays assumptions about the world can be fake. Eh? This is not entirely followed. And yet I do not know how his argument helps. I mean, if his ideas have become common assumptions, I believe that we should think that they are false, based on their own reasoning.
