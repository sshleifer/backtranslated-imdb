I got a DVD "Bogeyman" and this stuntman was an extra feature. I thought that "Boogeyman II" was similar to the original. But what they say about what they "assume" is: "u" and "yo" "donkey". I read that BII has a lot of original plays and that the reader is Love Love. While watching "returning Boogeyman", I crossed the original footage to see the scenic manuscript scene based on death. Before I know it, the movie was over. Extract I think that this was BII, because it has a similar title to another in the BII. Well, at least this was just a special function, right? <br /> <br /> Let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about movie mistakes. Lots of bugs, lots Who is Ulli the guy? Do you really think that the movie itself will be sold in different forms. III. There is nothing in the part originally. Basically, a flashback of the original happens through a psychic eye, which gives us a heavy and boring recreation game like everything happens. That's the movie Oh, and by death you can read a stereo scene, but you can read off someone else's review. The interest in "Boogeyman II" is lost forever. <br /> <br /> Last note: this is not a movie to look back.
