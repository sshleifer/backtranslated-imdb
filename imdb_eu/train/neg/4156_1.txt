Yes, this movie is bad. The worst thing is to take advantage of its title! Throughout the movie, zombies and vampires fight together ONCE OR THE FINGER. On top of that, we are never surely the main hero of the movie is a vampire. They may say that it's "tone down" or "realistic," but it's boring. More than half of this movie takes place at CAR CAR. The scene that happens elsewhere is not much like it. Also, there is no clear antagonist, and in the end you do not have the true 30 minutes of the true movie. <br /> <br /> However, I can say that a movie is a productive low value, a soundtrack that was surprisingly appropriate and instrumental (with original score or sampling music elsewhere). <br /> <br /> I'm all independent films, but it's not aimed at such apparent audiences (if applicable). <br /> <br /> "Worse than the Scarecrow killer."
