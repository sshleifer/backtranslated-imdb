In the 1950s there are music types. First of all, you have brilliant productions called MGM with great names and great music. And then you have the lowest league with the less famous cast, the less famous music and the second level directors. 'The Girl Can not Help It' is included in the last category. Tom Ewell or Edmond O'Brien did not become famous and Jayne Mansfield's reputation was famous ... well, it does not matter. It seems to be Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons every ten years. On the plot, the pen is thin, and it is not possible to suspect Fats Domino, Little Richard or the 50s trying to sell rocket action. If you are attracted to this music, it is worth watching. Otherwise, do not worry.
