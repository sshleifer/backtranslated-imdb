A funny studio thinks that a classic Christmas story could be a succession with a totally new cast and expects it to float. Surely Batman used different actors, but in this case Batman was a classic character before the actress wore her doll. In this case, there was a classic character with stunning glasses full of soft head horns, that Ralphy wanted a Christmas gun and we should have forgotten it and accept another boy who does not have a similar origin. I never thought it safe to believe that I would not have guessed it from cast ... Although Charles Grodin tried to imitate Darrin McGavin, it reminded us that the original is much better ... <br /> <br /> The movie might have been better off if the movie was finished. They had to look for a look or to discard the original and they did not copy their feelings and feelings. This is just a cheap imitation. Ralphy does not create sympathy, who wants to shoot or die from her eyes.
