The first interesting change. It was more mysterious in the first hour of this movie. Even though the killer will end up asking himself. There are good pieces in the whole film, it starts to slow down in the first half and the last half is chosen at a pace. Every movie is nice. After the 22-year-old incident of the first movie, Norman Bates returns to the Bates monster, but when a woman arrives to become a real mother, things go wrong. Perkins Norman plays well again, and eventually it was a great scene, one of them was terribly keen.
