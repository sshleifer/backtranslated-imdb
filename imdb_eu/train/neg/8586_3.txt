What a disappointment ... of course, the best books, but the story is weak, the line runs and the final result is a collection that is poorly understood and well-organized. There are mistakes with the original movies, and the creation of Darth Vader was so dramatic that it would be marvelous at the time of modern cinema, but it is a goofy garlic that will be ridiculous for many years. I do not complain about the worst conversations, Star Wars ... that is, the original three films have styled style, worship and stories, and the extravagant charm sparked. The prelucks were superficial attempts at more money, and love was not lying. Very depressing
