I think that the show has a fairly good concept to work. But the execution was inadequate. The script is inadequate and the acting is bad. There were many issues that could be portrayed in a better way, as a protest against gay marriage or finding a cemetery. The show can not be called as a comedy show when the humor is over. I would have to say, however, that he had succeeded in bringing a secret community of Muslims into life. <br /> <br /> The second season is worse than the first one. I had a lot of hope in regards to this show, but I was disappointed. However, CBC appreciates the fact that this concept has been put before the audience. In any case, it is due to the future.
