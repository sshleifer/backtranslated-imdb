FLIGHT OF FURY's PHOTOGRAPHY of Steven Seagal's film is what I've never seen before ... Until now. <br /> <br /> No one is terrifying scene without any interest. Seagal is not really trying: fat and his voice is doubling again. <br /> <br /> Co-star does not get any better, it seems that there are only 3 opinions. <br /> <br /> Direction Keusch is very poor and it is not surprising that he is also responsible for other Seagal couples (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE). The script written by Seagal himself is laughably inept. The $ 12MD score was spent on Tosh's boring charge - These figures are correct if I feel a heavy tax, because that amount has not been spent anymore. <br /> <br /> FURY OF FLIGHT is a replay for shooting. BLACK THUNDER of Michael Dudikoff's film, which must be better than this. <br /> <br /> This has no recovery quality, give it up! 1/2 * away
