I am Puerto Rico, and this is one of the worst documents I have ever seen. You see people are wrong. They do not know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They are Puerto Rican, because they are Puerto Rican descendants, but surely they know less. While you're watching it, they're contradicting. If you want to see a real one and I mean Puerto Rico is a true documentary, you should see "Mi Puerto Rico". The documentary is serious and real. It's not like that part of garbage. Rosie Perez's documentary is about herself. I thought it was about thinking about Puerto Rican. I do not know, they keep repeating. Well, this is the only thing that has been obtained directly from this document. I like to see a garbage using the name of the island. Decreases regulations.
