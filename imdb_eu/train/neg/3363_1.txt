The original movie (dated, 19 ??) did not show "monsters", scary "things" to LAST. <br /> <br /> This version shows all aspects of "phantom patient intelligence", including non-essential ones. special effects <br /> <br /> "Mystery", as it was presented in the original film, was a horrible part: nobody knew what happened, it was strange. When the "old man" shows his face, this Mister disappeared completely. Even worse: special effects (crying on the faces of wooden children) is ridiculous. This is a stupid remake, of course impressive as well as the fear of the original
