As a result of budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (again reproduced by Priscilla Alden) is released from a mental institution (although he killed six people) and was taken to Hope Bartholomew. In it, he instantly inflicts himself criminally madly and kills anyone who gets his or her food. <br /> <br /> MOLY! Does this movie suck? You know when you're in trouble when the open credits are up and the credits of the first movie are just shot from the TV screen. Nick Millard (under Nick Phillips's pseudonym) has decided to return to the world of Crazy Fat Ethel ten years later and probably a budget line that covers the cost of renting an empty tape and a video camera for this weekend. Let's say that Millarden's unique style does not translate well. Seriously, home movies have made me more productive values. And Millard tries to shoot SILENT NIGHT and NIGHTLY 2 half the half of the first half of the film (a look like a VHS copy). Alden is again as good as Ethel, but the film is so unimaginable that it feels like the protagonist of this litter. I mean, at least, he tried the first movie. Here we have no music, weaker effects (if possible), a vibrant camera, a huge audience and a look made with two video players. Avoid this coast!
