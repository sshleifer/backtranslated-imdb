That for me, it's like a telenobia. It is considered a "social comment" of any representation of exiled people. But, at the end, I did not like how you characterized this movie. No one character is very nice or nice. I had no chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. There is a love story here, there is no wickedness. And in spite of the complete and immediate (and therefore incomprehensible) version of Dorothy Maguire's reminder, Dorothy Maguire, the story is not enough to keep my interest. No matter how much Freudian symbolism and psychology boosts, this story is bold, melodramatic, and cynical. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson does not have wood. This is the worst work on Lauren Bacall and her worst performance. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack offer more inspired shows, but his character is arrogant and pathetic. Robert Keith, as a child of both adults and children, is a loving character. Interesting, however, is Robert Wilke's serious appearance due to the owner of the bar. He reminds us of many of the West as a bad mess, but here he is a good and honest fellow. <br /> <br /> I take my social comments with an interesting and entertaining story and with some funny characters, thank you.
