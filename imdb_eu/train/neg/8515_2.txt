So I was disappointed with this show. After hearing and reading all the hoopla about it, how was the "show below" and the wild promise of all kinds of quality, I tried to see it. <br /> <br /> What is left! The play was in a way that was rather inefficient. The story was very wise. As a suggestion that looks like "looking at youth life," I saw a modest attempt that could be as realistic as reality. <br /> <br /> Some ask why there are so many negative comments about this show. The reason is that it really is not that very good and high-quality drums on this show serves only to attract attention.
