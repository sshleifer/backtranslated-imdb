Raymond Burre has a proxy for his best friend (Dick Foran) slaughter for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury). Every year before the start of Perry Mason, the film could be especially interesting to his fans if he had an inspiration for his quiz. <br /> <br /> There's nothing else that's interesting here. Lansbury is always good, but here his character is very dimensional and in mystery the reasons for his crime are clear. Lamont Johnson has an interesting interpretation as a painter who is in love with the dead woman, but Burr is a pretty character. It's a strange fact that an actor like Burr is watching this romantic scene with Lansbury, and his break does not see his character just like most of the movies I've watched here. There is no real mystery, and the whole suspense in the title of the film and the character of Burren is thought to involve itself as the Lansbury character (it prevents double risk to try again for original slaughter). This is done when I do not record it unnoticed when I do not record it. I think maybe <br /> <br /> Sometimes some unwanted fun events and basically the rest of things could be done. TV.
