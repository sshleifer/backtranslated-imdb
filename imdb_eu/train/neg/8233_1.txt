This was probably the worst movie, seriously. Actually, I could make myself better, it was not set correctly. This movie has a budget of $ 5 and it's like leaving the edits. Ignore I did not even get through this movie, I had to shut down. I gave it a 1/10 one, because it was ridiculous that the producer of this movie wanted to be a horror movie, but it was really a bad comedy. Basically, a bunch of girls got into a car, lighted up and the owner of that car followed them. I saw a little girl I saw that a girl was a woman who had taken away her clothes, what a hell? It must also be a movie too.
