I was ready to go to _Cruel Intentions._ I went to the plot and it was true to my characters who liked my story. However, in my opinion, this movie was an invaluable review of the same story and character options. I did not honestly take care of any of them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) is the characters and their interactions, not incidents themselves. I did not clearly read the IMDB movie that was the previous one, especially since it included a title "2", I expected a sequel, but I decided to be a part of it. In all, I must say that this movie was, at least, read to me, just like a soft version of Les Liasons. I was not impressed.
