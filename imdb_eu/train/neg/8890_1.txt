Shakespeare's first taste on the stage, I can not believe that it was a great theater for the public. <br /> <br /> -Do you go back a bit, right? - <br /> <br /> Alan Rickman is well, even though his conversation is more sensitive. The rest of the cast were to be thrown together. <br /> <br /> Romeo, Romeo, why you are not dead yet, Romeo? The actor, while not full of wood, could not read the lines. There was no doubt that Juliet had difficulties in his face and had difficulties with the lines he had given him. Throwing is worth the penalty. Julieta goes to bed, but does not give his character to the depths, and the play seems to be out of reach. Mercutio was terribly and completely out of conversation. Benvolio was feeling and compassionate with her lines. <br /> <br /> Romeo and Juliet have been exposed to half-baked production. The play was wrinkled and the clothes did not pay much attention. I have seen puppet shows in kindergarten. I can not give zero value to this movie.
