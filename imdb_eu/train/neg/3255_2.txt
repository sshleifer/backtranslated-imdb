I watched this movie in 1975 in its first week. I was 13 years old and at that time it seemed good and pretty fun. I came to the WORLD of Doc Savage, through the novel Bantam magazines in short stories. I did not know any idea about Doc's domain, but I became quickly one of the busiest fans of Doc Savage. I have read all the Bantam books (and I still know them). I went to comic book tournaments (along with Star Trek and Doctor Who and all the geeky fatty events for children) and I had a great time with Doc and I made every adventure Philip 5. Farmer's book - Doc Savage's apocalyptic life with little bible It became one of them for me and now I have very good feelings in my PhD phase. In my opinion, I have to admit that a few years later the movie really missed the ship. It was a movie that he did not want to know when he grew up. The script was a little baby and it seemed a little like that. The 30's stories were short and if you're studying Lester Dent's (AKTH Kenneth Robeson) schemes, they screamed at the screen treatment in 3 perfect plays. They thought that it was better with the line with George Pal and Michael Anderson. The elements of the progress fail, and the worst moments are almost reached, but then they are short. It is interesting, however, that when they were hired by second-level character actors (they were just extravagant players and supporter players before this movie), they all came out well. Paul Gleason has, of course, become a good recreational player and Bill Lucking is a permanent television channel. All other people are unfortunately dropped from the map. I want to have a copy of this movie, which is the only version of my heroine movie, but I'm afraid I do not see it as much painful. I would say 0, but I give it 2 out of 2 to senior art management (Doc's voicemail was finally nice) and a three-stinger cast in the sun.
