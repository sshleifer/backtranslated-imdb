I should admit this title, when I think about it now. Checkout is not fully appreciated. I had a chance to see twice, and for the second time I got a big laugh at the movie. So I think it's worth something. and it is also worth the pain that caused me in my first inspection. As another reviewer stressed, this film is included in every way. In this movie, there was no original thought (that is, I commented on the comment I threatened completely at the origin of the comment). The movie is just a long line of topicals linked together, as the movie is paradise. Not the next secretary is definitely not the original, and it's not entirely "funny and clean." The movie is not a great agony for beginners (after seeing it for the first time, the second time it can be quite fun in a predicted way). As I was looking at the theater, almost all of them were obvious, perhaps forbidding the elderly, to be totally bored or hurt by that movie. In some emotional scenes, such as Nick's mother sleeve, the audience really got worse, because it was so badly done. I heard someone crying in the theater, I had never seen before. I do not like to watch this movie in a movie theater or theater, or anywhere. do yourself one side, skip this movie with a vengeance. Unlike similar to me, they can never face what they can do to see the worst movie.
