This is one of the worst films I have ever encountered, but some of the criticisms that I heard I came to be unjustified. <br /> <br /> With regard to the purifying film, the Director is competent. It is maintained as a result of a limited budget and VHS camera, but the real edition, camera angles, camera movements and scene staging is quite professional. I've seen a lot more movies with "directing". At least the scenes are emitted in a non-confusing manner and have clear planes here and there. In addition, the scenes of forests had a decent atmosphere. You can only do it with a VHS camera, and it works well for technicians. There is no artistic merit. The scene that crumbles the camera in a 15-second scene to awaken in a wild, depicts the artistic style of the whole movie. Lump is empty ... Total garbage. <br /> <br /> Money is decent for a movie in this budget. , of course, it is false, but there is a lot to it, and it's very curious. <br /> <br /> I saw the American version dubbed necessarily. It was a good idea (and the only thing I had to do with the film) ... Unfortunately, it's too much, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> A movie is really great, but I must recommend it for the champion's value. It is very difficult to find a movie that is worse than this, and put them in a special category.
