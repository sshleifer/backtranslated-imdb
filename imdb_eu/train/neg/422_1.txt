Death happens a lot. You do not need to figure out how to be a rocket scientist! But should it be the focus of a documentary nature? What is this sacrifice with evil death? Actually, do we have to see an adult elephant divided by one of the hungry lions? Or, taking a cheekbone in a throat, less! I thought it would be a natural family movie! <br /> <br /> And, why do not you show a terrific violence on the back of the movie? The filmmakers were afraid of losing money? <br /> <br /> Then, in the way of ordinary comic relief, we see Paradise Paradise as magnificent as possible to combine the confusing and stupid narrative. It was surreal! Just like filmmakers thought they would put them on a journey through a room for First and Secondary classmates! Wow! From intermediate moron to heart! <br /> <br /> If you're looking for future filmmakers who are watching for this reviewer of this filmmaker, why not focus: Copy the animals really; childbirth; putting eggs; bathing; lo; to wash each other; Coexistence; playing; other emotional screens of fear and anger; unusual behavior; migration; Troubleshooting capabilities; culture (yes, many species of animals call human beings); communication skills; parents, healing skills, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or slow down beauty, why not get so much rounded up, and enjoy and enjoy inspiration?
