"Spielberg loves the smell of feeling in the morning. But feeling as a result of narrative honesty, nobody would love that." - Lucius Shepard <br /> <br /> "Purple color" is made in the southern depths of the 1900s, and it tells the story of Celie and Nettie, the American-American siblings. Films play the girls with more flowers, with the idyllic refuge that breaks the appearance of their father classmates. Motive men without innocence? It pushes the whole film. <br /> <br /> The movie is included in short sequences. Celie, who has been impregnated with her two children, is born in a dirty pile, has been born with her child and has been forced to marry a local widow named Albert Johnson, forcing him to force himself to cook. Wash and take care of her children. <br /> <br /> All these horrible scenes show little screen time, instead they are surrounded by some moments of cinematic melodies, a symphonic mixed score, an unknown comedy and a lot of camera work. The impact of methane is like making Disney cartoons and rape in a movie, Stanley Kubrick said "The Color Purple" felt ill, stating that Stanley Kubrick had to point out after ten minutes. Ten minutes? It lasted for a long time. <br /> <br /> The movie can often be said to be "racism", "sexism" and "black culture", but this is not true. The author of the novel on the film, Alice Walker, has said that she is a bisexual, but it is actually a lesbian wardrobe. The book is fantasy, a lesbian, a woman's liberation and self-discovery, because women are painting violent women violently. For Walker, the only way out of this labyrinth is to link women to women's lesbian utopia, black sister and female independence. American mythology lens erosion. This is a film that surpasses the credible power of Christianity over the natural cruelty of men. Albert, a movie that is ridiculous in different situations, so that the moments of comedy will be like a stupid insert. All the characters are a film derived from a show of racist minstrel, a group of flirty men (always smiling and smiling), stereotyped mammals, jazz groups and gospel choirs. <br /> <br /> This is a black movie that is naturally pleasing to children, easily and easily accepting their social conditions. The films are supernatural sexual sensualists, dominated by violent passions. Poverty and class issues are a completely invisible movie (Albert lives in a big house) and black men are completely ineptic. This is not South American, that is, Old South with "Wind", MGM Muscals, "Southern Song", Warner Cartoons "Halleluha!" and banned from Disney movies. In other words, in the 50's a south of the world is watching the television. All this is a cartoon and so racist way as humans reduce dimensional ethnic stereotypes. The black novelist Ishmael Reed is famous for a Nazi conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Obviously, in Spielbergen's typical fashion, family bundles are healed. This reconciliation was Walker's novel, but Spielberg continues to unite all the characters in the story with their relatives. <br /> <br /> In addition to the cartoonist Walker's hatred to the black man and the black life of Spielbergen, we do not show anything. black community One of these characters is how we interact and how to interact and interact with others in their community with little ideas. Instead, Spielberg's camera leaps to get desperately desperate for our attention (one of Celie's kitchen strikes seems to be "in the house only"), all the emotional emotions allow the director to observe something or to stop it. just spent life. Match this with the hilarious "white" music of Quincy Jones, and you'll have one of the most curious movies in film history: an angry feminist betrayal shot by white Jews Disney and Griffith, a man who tries to emulate John. Williams. <br /> <br /> Difficult difficulty also has white characters. Let's say: the men in this movie are not represented by rough men, nor dominate women, because they are driven by a racist society that diminishes mankind. No, the nature is cruel. And women, as silent as Celie, or as rebellious as sisters and sisters, persevere and will survive only to destroy the stupid men. A better film would not focus on women as oppressed, but it would appear that social abuse is being abused by the victim, black slave women had to do the same tasks. their male counterparts (as they still fulfill traditional female roles) and African-American domestic violence occur largely due to economic factors. Only women can not protect themselves and their children. <br /> <br /> So it's a hidden ideology. work here A movie later, one character tells another about his wife who had not respected her and sucked her white. As a result, blacks must return to their African roots to restore their dignity, and their blame for the whites to step down. that is to say, respect each other in the poor community of minorities and do not overwhelm you with cultured culture. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - Fight against sex and lesbianism, inappropriate music numbers, sequential voiceless sequences, inappropriate comic business, fertile music and a huge hybrid emotion. Purple color "is not valid.
