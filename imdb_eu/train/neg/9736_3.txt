Tobe Hooper is often said to have been a terrifying horror movie of "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" and every time I see a movie "Hooper", this approach is only strengthened. It seems that Hooper wanted to make his own version of films like Scanners and Firestarter in 1990, so that we will end up with Spontaneous Breathing; A movie that has been borrowed from a couple of good ideas and many other films. Put everything together and you get a boring and boring movie that would get you all the better! The films are considered by the audience to be decent, in the mid-1950s, with a strange story based on two experiments performed by both young people. The couple has a child and shortly after it burns to death as a result of their experiments. Over the years, and now the baby is Sam's adult name; But, of course, he is not an ordinary person, and finds him soon finds himself unwilling to set things up. <br /> <br /> The movie is Brad Dourif, that is, he must be a good questionnaire. He had been successful with Child's Play two years earlier; but it was a really inspired decision because the main performance is really awful; And it does not help to contribute to tremendous shows. Improper spells and dull scripts do not make the favors of the film a lot of help, and the tenderness of fate favors special effects, that is to say, they are very unrealistic and do not take anything out of these films; It was a few years before. The plot is very slow and it's almost just an hour before the notice has occurred, and I did not even take care of it. Soon it will be seen which films will go and what will happen as expected. The last conflict is dismayed and nothing is explained during the film. There would not be any interesting revelation. In general, it's a garbage movie and it's far from being an excellent Tobe Hooper horror director. See Firestarter again.
