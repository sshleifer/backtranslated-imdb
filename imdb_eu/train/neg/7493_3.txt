I could not believe my eyes when I saw Nuremberg in Dutch television. Starting slowly, they become clear in the Nuremberen probationary origins, the Germans have a funny English accent, but suddenly, in the first part of the series, they can see the audience in the final minutes. The great footage I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's important to see people's footage (although I totally agree with people who have a minimum age for children). this type of material), but this film was quite ridiculous. It was intended to improve the impact of an ordinary TV show. He wanted to surprise the audience with a very cheap and disbelieving audience. With the aim of moving scenes, inspiring conversations or interesting insights, viewers are torturing horrible images of skin and bone outside. He does not show respect for victims of holocaust. <br /> <br /> I'm very angry.
