Undoubtedly, Jigsaw was in its era, the mysterious mystery of LSD's total murder, clearly, was a huge attempt to take on a young audience of the time, undoubtedly to understand the anti-seventies culture in the sixties. Alongside the closed party, Jigsaw is suffering from many problems, such as similarity, including stupid and whirlwinds, which last for LSD flashbacks, even in the first 60 seconds of landing at the point. On the plot, on paper, it is a great vehicle to do just that, and the end and end result (which reminds us of bad television shows) is the ultimate end that ultimately is an anti-climate. If it were a better film, we might interrupt some of the things that would be happy, but the weaknesses are so bright and, moreover, they stand out from the audience. I watched Jigsaw on TV and, finally, the price of nightly television prices is time to fill the air space and kill somebody's insomnia, rather than trying to find someone else. At best, 10 to 10.
