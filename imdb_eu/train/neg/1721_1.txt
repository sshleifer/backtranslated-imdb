A meteorite crashed a Cryptor Plain (so our title), which makes the dog's population bitten (in California, this hick-and-dusky capital of the world) <br /> <br /> There are bad movies after it. "The Crater Lake Monster", somehow escaped to MST3K. Acting on the grid, a decent beast for staging, and more, that is, a low-budget low-budget / monster movie dreck in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> While the movie is the culprit of many crimes, it's the biggest. Arnie and Mitch, two bad reliefs, our comical relief. In the Bumble area, "banjo music", the fight against women's wages and the excuses of humanity act like pathetic. The characters are so bad, they should be told as crimes against humanity.
