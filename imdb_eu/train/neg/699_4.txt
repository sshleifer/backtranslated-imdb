Probably one of the fastest slasher films ever written and written. <br /> <br /> During the holiday season, there are five students left when a holiday is closed, but someone has designs and one of them dies. One by one, the main suspect, John Hemmitt, the Woody Roll theater, or one of the five suspects. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad, Daphne Zungia, who was to die too fast and was the main hero, and the rest is very sad, although the main heroine of Laura Lapinski sometimes has her own charm and, finally, you feel at the end. <br /> <br /> KILLS It is not possible to see why they were banned, especially if the dead look like a fake, a boy's hands are half-cut in pieces that it's really false, but others are pretty bad because a girl carries a head car, the girl One gets the life cooked and the other is burned alive. <br /> <br /> RULES It's not really slasher cou great It's been a lot better
