I thought it was a New York movie: wrong! It's a small British rural environment. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama ... Well, until the last third, after the story, it becomes "abracadabrantesque", the symbolic word of the French presidential authority. This means that, next to nonsense, the cause wants to bring a sincere feeling. <br /> <br /> What have I left? Perhaps, actor pair: Yes, I know, they are 3 people, but the police woman is pretty invisible to me. High drummers puncture it, and McDowell acts as usual, because everything is soft and almost silent. This confrontation is confusing me, as in other beautiful artists or directors, the same pattern repeats itself repeatedly. In his case, whatever the movie is, it is always the same character that feels, its values, and infinite stories. I still do not know the assembly (or merger) between artists and works. <br /> <br /> The most positive aspect of this film is the feminine touch and an interesting perspective. Women have their own way of life, even if they all have one. It gives a great deal of tolerance and we see the same and unique reality that can be perceived in different ways. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie is pretty spectacular, but the final is the next view of desires.
