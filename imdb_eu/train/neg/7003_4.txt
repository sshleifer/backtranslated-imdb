(aka: TRINITY is still my NAME) This sequel looked like the successful European Box Office was capitalizing on how to successfully capitalize THEY CALL ME TRINITY, this time Joseph E. Levine and Avco-Embassy wanted to capitalize on. In America too. As it was very bad, Hill / Spencer was very far from being a marvelous success in the US, and in this film, especially boring, there was no help. <br /> <br /> Trinity and Bambino killing their husbands (Harry Carey Jr.) swear that they will be successful legalities and caring for each other. They then take part in the arms-traffickers that are evicted from a monastery and believe they are a couple of federal agents. Everything is scorching, even though some fun scenes, especially in an elegant French restaurant in Trinity and Bambino, and they do not know how to take it. And scenes with shark cards were also good moods. Gene Roman's songwriting is similar to Bobby Goldsboro in the early 70's. quite well I do not know if I wanted to buy a CD soundtrack but maybe others. <br /> <br /> The film could have half an hour to remove it and it would not drag it so long. . The landscape seems to chew a lot. In fact, I lost interest in the way I was. The DVD is awesome, it's a steady soundtrack and it's a bad print that was sent to the big city in the sky. <br /> <br /> A great step forward with the previous films. . <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10
