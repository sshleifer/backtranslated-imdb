The initial sequence is supposed to be shown at the Legion in Paris on November 13, 1918. The soldiers stack up on the train - the French Navy, including the legion, wounded in 1914. This is surely one of the signs you are watching is the war movie being a turkey. (The French Navy realized in 1915 that the red trousers had been lost and the dark blue coats were not working. The French metropolitan troops entered the "blue horizon" and the colonial troops went into the khaki.) Claude Van-Damme (sp?) Remakes were even more uniform. It is really bad when managers make mistakes when they try to correct other things.
