Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground) and author of the legendary Italian horror player Lucio Fulci. Now with this talented mix, you think the movie would be a real gore party. This can not be further from that. I have seen Massacre fall into his face, one of the most boring films I have ever seen in film cinema. I was struggling to keep awake in the movie and I never had so much trouble with Italian horror movies. <br /> <br /> The massacre is dying of one side of the road with an ax. This scene was used by Fulci's Nightmare Concert. This is not a bad scene and the movie's hope is like an ax that is dying. Unfortunately, the next movie is SO boring. The movie continues in a series of horror films that are being filmed, and a lot of characters are being developed in these scenes, but the characters of the film are so sad and their interest is bad. The last 30 minutes of the film are not so bad, but it's still much better. It was a pathetic gore of the film, and since Fulcik Nightmare Concert has used the gore scene, nothing new. He left the end of the movie nice little, but there was still no response and the continuity went down the ground. <br /> <br /> This film was not very good, but the horror of Italian horror was horrible. like me) this movie is essential because it is very rare. 4/10 stars
