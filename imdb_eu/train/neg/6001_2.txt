This may be a great idea for people who remember this show ... But I remembered it was a straightforward action. I do not think I've seen cartoons. but the movie? maybe I remember very much. The guy in a room that was in a building. She also had a red jacket. It was dark in the dark and turned red and the second guy was looking for a guy. The car / boy turned around and knocked through the big showroom type window and left the street. And then we started driving. I remember all this. I hope someone remembers that distance too. If not, maybe I'm mad. But I do not expect.
