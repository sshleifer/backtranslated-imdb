I am a 11 year old student at my high school. At My World Affairs, a classroom boy saw this video and we suggested. So we did it. I'm sure when we went to the moon, my father works for NASA. Although I think this movie has been the biggest litter ever I've ever seen, the guy who creates it has serious drivers. First, did JFK have to show what he had to shoot? And how do you dare to use all of these vibrations? The only thing about this film is the controversy, that is, in my classroom there are weekly discussions. This movie has nothing to do with it. I think Michael Moore and working together to make another movie. Michael Moore's next movie "Spectron on 11 happened A Funny Thing" or "Funny thing happened to the White House."
