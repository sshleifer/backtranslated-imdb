Karl Jr. and his father are running an army on a remote island. They capture the trio of boys who ride across the island. After a while, go back. (well-kept) This is a strain of blood, gore, and massacres, if it was good, one of them seemed to be remotely real, or if it did not look like the production, it was kept for a week. money (this will be worse and worse, it was only a couple of days ago). The dramatic duplication did not make me worried so much and I think I was really drunk, maybe some of them might be humorous ... perhaps. However, it's just 78 minutes long. Oh, I do not know ... 78 minutes. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> My Rating: F <br /> <br /> DVD More: Bonus film: "Zombie '90: Pestilence Extreme"; Shock-o-Rama's other trailer trailers were released
