<br /> <br /> When I saw the first movie in Cinemax, I was surprised at what I did. The Cruel Intent was one of the best films for teens in my opinion. This prequel had some things that fit in with the original. (Father's father got married with wealth, then why does he have a long-aunt aunt?) <br /> <br /> Then I noticed that it was not a new movie, but television series. , Manchester Prep. After listening to it, it made sense that I was not like the same movie, like Buffy the Vampire Slayer in a different way of television. <br /> <br /> I think that Roger Kumble added the end of this movie, surely, that Fox did not receive it. It looks like it's really happening (becoming a male version of Sebastian Katharyn) and I do not know where to go next to the next episode, until the end of 1999 (What's newest). <br /> <br /> I liked one thing, Sebastian and he suggested that his father was married in enrichment, and it is not usually good in this area of ​​New York. , and Katharyn's mother was just a version of her adult, it does not look like something something female would do for her and not marry her social class. <br /> <br /> As a prey, that's pretty lama. But I wanted to see what happened in the series.
