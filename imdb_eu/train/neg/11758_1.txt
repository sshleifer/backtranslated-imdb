I had little hope of seeing this movie and I was not disappointed. It's very bad, it's really fun in a very wonderful way. <br /> <br /> Gael is totally horrible, means that he can not play, the period. Now he should give up, because acting was not his character. Its star stars are the same caliber, I am sure that all my 5 year old cousins ​​can do a better job! The director should be embarrassed to name his name so ridiculous. In any case, I do not think it's a card for this Oscar. <br /> <br /> I did not write a comment on the IMDb, but I felt that the movie was so bad I was forced to do it. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, 0/10 is not 0
