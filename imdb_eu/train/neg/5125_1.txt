As a young shepherd, I heard good things about this film. Then I saw it. The performance was not the best. That's forgiving. This message is not: Give Jesus your life and everything will change - you will face better, make amazing catches, stop, start touching cards, and even playoffs. All Jesus becomes magical because all of the weaknesses are American. I laughed loudly when a coach quoted the Scripture, explaining the goals of the field. But wait, that's not all. You will get a new truck, raise $ 6,000, and your child's anti-sterility fight will suddenly end during pregnancy - twice. Then you win the championship of the state, God weakens a scorer before 12 meters and helps the wind, and the wind, no less ... because everything is "God wanted to do". Then you will win the State championship next year. None of these good things happened, if the team does not want to follow all his heart. <br /> <br /> Here I have a movie from these films: God wants to do everything he can, he always wants to do it, and our lives are better, easier and more enjoyable. Selects his favorite team and can win games. Which bible is this base? I would say that he knew the keys to getting a safe life that Saint-Stephen could do. Someone had to do this movie after 10 of the 11 apostles after Jesus died. He would save a lot of problems.
