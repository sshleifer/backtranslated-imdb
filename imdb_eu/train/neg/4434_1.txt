I rented this movie, looking like wonderful historical pieces. I just got the garbage. This movie was most confusing in most bad places, almost everywhere in the rough and in every place. On the other hand, the portraiture of a male teacher who was similar to Queen Mira Sorvino. Ben Kingsley was forced to quit his cavalry because he considered playing the movie as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should continue playing Petunia Dursley; Harry Potter is more entertaining than a movie called a movie movie. <br /> <br /> A cinematographic college student seems to have taken Cinematography 101 and failed. Almost all the scenes in the movie create an impact; In the end, it is the most curious edition I have ever seen. Jay Rodan was as good as Agis; It was a very bad work for the bad script. Rachael Stirling is doing just as pretty as a woman who looks forward to her best efforts. In the end, I want to give Blockbuster Video refunds. I'm glad I did not spend 10 dollars in the theater watching this fiasco. Since Marivaux plays since then, he asks me how many years have been the best people. If they were there, they would not hear the rumor's theater. Thanks for the modern comfort of DVD players; You can overcome a boring or awesome scene. He guessed it means that I've only seen the beginning and the end!
