I do not think that the movie is the worst movie ever I've ever seen. I've worked on a list of my favorite war movies: "Longest Day", "Inferno and Back", "Kwai River Bridge" (all in black and white), all with good lands, rich characters and great performance. I have seen a better conversation and I play a high school education. On the plot, however, it is not a bad premise - poorly implemented. It's like a traffic accident, but I can not deactivate it! The films do not require much money or great sets to be "Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifeboat" ... so there's no excuse for a quote. What did they think?
