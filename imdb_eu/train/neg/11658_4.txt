Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst in 4 movies, because there is no plot, bad performance, it's boring and really bad. But. And this is great, but a good actress, a good joke, and a good start. The good actress Tim Curry, the only recurring joke, is a curious and curious lover, always generous with a generous hand, but she disseminates good things. And the good start is the Excorsist's opinion. <br /> <br /> The plots of Scary Movie 2 are the main characters of the original, and on the way there are many new characters who are invited to sleep in the night. Old palace, but will they survive tonight? This movie is not very good, but you can see it if it's boring!
