This stupid story, an unbreakable, is only exchanged by a scene that opens up some lines that show a great fear of a hard-core detective, dead. Perhaps the director could save the movies if A. Martinez had forgotten the power of his fascinating star, with an unhappy and anonymous actress who briefly filled the screen. An unnamed pyramid with which to get rid of the street thinks he can retrieve a movie like this, he is less likely to die a damn in a quarry than dropped a stone. Its a short moment; it is a huge promise. Maybe we will treat more screen time for this dark dark, if there is always a persuasive movie tracking.
