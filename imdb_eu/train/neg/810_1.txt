By "Jim," you are a people who finds a great television comedy, this will rock your world. And I can add, good credit, good writing and debt recognition to a charismatic star, whatever you need on any other non-ABC network, Jim Belushi's show would be like year after year. <br /> <br /> The "K-911" is a German shepherdess, brown, and flavourful, who "loved all" loved the first movie. The fans of this film and Belushi are worth less. Jim's comedy chops and selection projects are never behind the ability to kidnap a standard blues. Look at it as a zoo chimpanzee that puts the public in all the projects that are trying to make the most of their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Jim's work, this movie is your prize.
