Well ... this was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I heard a lot about it and I was very disappointed. They watched filmmakers from where they came from, and in this conflict, the two parties wanted to signify that it was different from one another, that individuals were losing out, and so on. (Well, that's my opinion, anyway = ^ _ ^ =) <br /> <br /> However, the type of movie has bored me. I've really seen a lot of feature films, but it seemed to just drag and move on ... I could not really bring myself to look after a character. I kept thinking ... who cares for? In addition, I found the play worried about the dead and the conversation. I understand that in the 1800s it was all that, but most conversations were more natural than natural. Nobody knew in most slots he had no excitement, except melodramatic events. The story "love" was not "I'm a guy and I do not accept". you are a girl ", I do not think much love, and yet I was guessed that I was in love with those people. Well ... I think we're very" terribly frightened around us, we're together "kind of thing, or whatever. Bi I also expected the dynamics of the best friends (at first, the interest of the little girl), but that was just a fall. Maybe avoiding a common love triangle. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Well ... I really liked Daniel Holt She was just a character, and Sue Lee was right, Jake did not like me, but it seemed a bit ... I'm boring, I think Jack Bull had no cares. And I'm sure you're supposed to hate others, usually left and right but it was a very graphic one, and all of the "horror of war" was down, but I've seen a lot more films with the same subject, better done. (I liked Patriot, for example, Although it was emotionally manipulative) But, as I have already said, I am cynical. What can I say? :)
