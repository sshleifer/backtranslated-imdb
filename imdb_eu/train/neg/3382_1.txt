This is one of the worst adaptations of the ever-made musician. A Chorus Line's scenic version is wonderful. This movie almost fails in every way. Although the questionnaire is also amazing. Take Audrey Landers Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is a song by Val. Val's story is that it's a great dancer, but in 3 looks. Yes, he finds a solution, but in the end he is a great dancer. What do the great filmmakers do? They hire an actress who can not dance and is very famous in appearance. The way to lose the boat. <br /> <br /> Then there's choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett turned around in his grave. Why did not they use their choreography? It can not really improve.
