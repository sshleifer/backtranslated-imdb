Everyone who has successfully demonstrated this movie is what everybody knows, professional basketball players suck it all out and play in basketball. Especially rapping and acting. I can not describe this film as being really bad. First, is it just me, is it the brightest boy you ever saw? I mean that your teeth can be used as a generator. Secondly, why did the genius who wanted to make a career in the music world, despite its magical powers, has a great music? Thirdly, I read the Bible. In no way does the shape or form tell Jesus to make genies. Fourth, what happened to all the special effects? I am sure that a teenager acne-noble drinker with a computer may have a better effect. Fifth, why sucked the end so badly? And what the hell is a djin? And finally, anyone who has created a nightmare known as Kazaam must throw away the plane and the Eiffel tower. This movie gives a new "sucking" word.
