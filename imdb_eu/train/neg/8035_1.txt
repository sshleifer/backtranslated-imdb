This is one of the worst horror movies that I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I am a fan of horror movies and I will rent any horror movie. When looking at the box, in regards to R, he says "gore and some languages ​​..." Where was it rough? Did you really see the only scene of their death? I could not forget a short nudity or a good conversation. There was also a fun and entertaining line in the dark film remotely. Sometimes horror films are awful, because they are stupid, but it was sad.
