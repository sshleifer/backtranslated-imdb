War, Inc. - Corporations take up a war in the future and Brand Hauser (John Cusack) uses a solitary murderer to make his wet job against senior managers. Dark comedy is satirized by military and corporations. It was often difficult to know what was happening. I was waiting for sensible things. There is no cause or method of insanity. Cusack plays the "spiritual descendant" of Grosse Point Blank. For example, War is more or less a blow. Cusack once again finds out the killing of the murderer * that kills his or her conscience. To be honest, John Cusack looks credibly for a dozen girls half-hearted. Short matches look good. No other movie. It's very curious, it's often limited to War Inc, it's not as funny as a parody, and anyone can imagine what the movie's message might be like, and I think corporations may be ways that can not be competing and scrambled with warfare factions. how do they affect the average citizen? It's interesting, but the satire just works, because it's not fun and the heart of heart does not have the heart. The impact of the war on the influence of Cusack's character is a supposed lie that might have an effect on the war. <br /> <br /> John Cusack gives a decent performance. Its character tosses the hot sauce and drives the smallest private aircraft, but quirks to replace character characters. Marisa Tomei is a romantic journalist. There really is not much chemistry among them. Hilary Duff makes a Russian accent and does not make a fool. Joan Cusack shouts, weeping and weakening. Blech. Ben Kingsley would have to give Oscar back if he does not get decent performance again and again. Pathetic <br /> <br /> It's not a horrible film, but eventually ask "War, what's good?" It's nothing.
