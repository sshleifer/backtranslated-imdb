ADOS. It's not a bad movie from a native screenplay. BUT IS NOT! <br /> <br /> In what parts, "In this story there are no women, except Foulata and Gagoola", producers, directors and writers who presented the entry to Haggard did not understand? I mean, English is quite ordinary. I understood that it was 10 years old! The beauty of KSM has an impressive description of three different worlds: African colonial, courageous desert and Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. That should be more than enough to work with producers. But, nooo, they have to throw away "romance". Pathetic This suggestion was thought to all the poor souls who would be next to the book. Leave When you arrive with Peter Jackson and "well done", you may still read it again. MY, there is a book called Allan's wife (actually a predecessor). Quatermain's story. It's a little bit awful but good.
