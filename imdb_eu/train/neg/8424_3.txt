This film can be judged from three perspectives: like history, as Amin's profile, as a fictional thriller. <br /> <br /> History fails, it overcomes the coup d'Ã©tat coupled with the Obot forces, and also has Entebbe hi-jack background, but it is not time chronologically consistent. <br /> <br /> Amin's profile may be interesting, because Forest Whitaker is very good, and if he gets a better movie, he would get an Oscar. (He got it - Oscar proves what he does not see on voters' votes). The history of the Amin and Uganda mythology has been rejected by important historical novels. Instead, he tells the story of the Scottish doctor's fiction and the unforgettable love story of Amin's life. However, Amin was probably the innocent accident. <br /> <br /> In a fictional thriller mode, there is no plot to keep together. At first it is a strain: the novel covers film freedoms, but it sets the story. The doctor's character is well-defined, but will be lost in the second half of the film he is suffering. <br /> <br /> Why do you decide that the doctor is in the wrong place in Kampala - the seduction of power? Why is it that no one is strangers? The character of the novel's novel has been lost because Dr. Scotsman only has blacks; That's why it's a wonderful sight that's incredible, but the writer of the film will be available to Amin's hands. . Horse bit called the end of the man is risible. <br /> <br /> Finally, in Uganda, in 1971, he moved to the left, not to the right, the numerical boxes had three letters and two or three numbers - and where are Equator Stems? <br /> <br /> In short, if you have never heard of Amin, maybe two hours later you will see this movie to watch the performance of the Forest Whitaker, but it will be upset at the end of the day. If you know Uganda or read the book - do not see the movie - it will only lower it. And the reason for the doctor is so absurd that you know why - it was not.
