We have an average family. Father rapper is a celebrity, we are the daughter of "rebellious daughter," adopted by the boys and little children. And the negligence is a housewife, what was the point of such men? Do we have a bunch of Brady Bunch? Yes! When he first came out, it seemed very cool to me, especially when I was young. It was bad music. The rapes were so bad and they valued too much. All his Raps were his family, friends and problems. Father's "Danny from Full House" was a kind father. Always give advice. But he was not minded. For that they had a housewife. Remember? The plots are basically Lil. Romeo was in some kind of trouble ... or that's not it. Oh, and maybe some preteen drama. Yes, it's a good thing. It's not really. But it's still a good show for kids. Nikelodean, however, can do better.
