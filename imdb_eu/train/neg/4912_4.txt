It's not like reading the novel, I can not tell how loyal this movie is. The mysterious story is typical: the killer for the young; The researcher falls in love with her partner and diagnoses a serious illness. Yes, it's like a soap opera and it plays exactly. The first 2/3 is boring to save the murder and the last 1/3 part will resume while taking its wrong conclusion at speed. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> During the last 1/3 year you will notice that the movie becomes really interesting, but it's just 1/3 last. The director Russell Mulcahy is very much in his element but only with television quotes and network censors. It only limits thrills and distorted lenses, although it has been subjected to a couple of "underground" shots in the club's toilet killings. Unfortunately, as the television does, the fresh detail of the composition that uses the broader image is nowhere. Note to Producers: This man will give you a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you hire him. <br /> <br /> In short: the standard movie is wrong and according to television standards (see CSI). After a few moods like these, I have a lot of suggestions: receive a copy of "Deep Red" by Dario Argento (my top recommendation, excellent film, "Opera" or "Tenebre"). They are all stronger in every category.
