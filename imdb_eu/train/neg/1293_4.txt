I am probably one of the few viewers who do not recommend this movie. Like all Ang Leere's works, we thought it was an amazing sight (still each frame is worth the print), I was disappointed with the unpolished movie. It was long. <br /> <br /> The story was set during the Civil War in Missouri, and a young man (Roedel) is related to wild forces of savage shrubs, a sort of confederate confederate confrontation. Writing battle Jayhawkers, with their counterparts in the Union. Skeet Ulrich plays Jack Bull Chiles and his closest team together with the Chilean father's failure to burn the house, allegedly with Jayhawkers. The story follows the adventures against Roedel and Chiles and other inter-war casualties. Among them, Bushwhacker (Daniel Holt, made by Jeffery Wright, Daniel), and the widow of War called Jewel. /> When the movie developed a story to an interesting point, he turned to another subtype and did not stop developing things. For example, the reluctance between the Roedel team, which is being triggered by the former slave who was taking part in the confiscated Holt, appears briefly through suitability and protocol conflict, and then later falls. A young Bushwhacker village hates Roedel and is why he addresses many anguish and violence, but we do not know why. Some characters never emerge; I think the movies add a lot of them and it takes a lot of history. <br /> <br /> Historical detail was very good. Housing, furniture, clothing, etc. I liked watching, and I thought the main actors did a great job of humanizing the characters, although they all got together in the conversation a bit. However, if you do not enjoy the story or if you do not take Ang Lee as a fan, this is over.
