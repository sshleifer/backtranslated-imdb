"The fungus" is probably the worst "movie" I've ever seen, it's shameful. Playing is a criminal case that is hardly a point of looking for a monkey that attacks the monkey that attacks the monkey that attacks the monstrous attacks that are not practically the case and the supposed special effects. <br /> <br /> I think that I am overwhelmed with creativity but I think that things like this do not have to be done. I am sure that the authors of "films" say that the "little" budget (nothing) of the "movies" was prevented - but in that case, they did not really have any problems. As of now, they have offered something so insane to the world, that the only imbeciles could get the cheapest shadow of delight. <br /> <br /> I was not going to start a "movie" or wait "Citizen Kane" like me. I expected a little budget a little bit afraid, maybe with a little invention, a fun suggestion, as well as some energy. I've got the cinematic equivalent of a used cloth. <br /> <br /> Plot? Well, our gentle antihero scientist who works in our parents' basement has shaken a cow in a cup. It seems that this higher level is the result of years of research. The parents then go to a strange place in a rural hotel to relax. There are too many people to write in there too. However, the scientist takes his test tube to some mushrooms and soon grows mushrooms and kills several people. (I'm writing a summary of Wow, suicide trace). Our heroes keep the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar (adding "fuse" - a really good part of the chain). The barrel explodes in a different way with the force of a small nuclear weapon that destroys all the mushrooms. End (Thanks to God.) <br /> <br /> The summary is as good as "movies" (and it makes it much more interesting than what he does). It would not really happen through this stage of development (by which an envelope is placed behind the back of an envelope). Someone should really shake and give someone a shake and say "No". <br /> <br /> And these "special" effects. Well, they are "special". This CGI is crazy crazy. And the bicycle pumps that a person who can believe is a peak of modern technology. And if the monsters of the mushrooms are not in the style of the 1984 home computer graphic package, they are replaced by a cover on a sheet of paper (I do not love you). <br /> <br /> An inexcusable thing. The film is his laziness. This is when the hero resumed the scene that rotates his pistols (La Clint Eastwood) and then unluckles to take it in his pockets. I mean, I'll take it twice and throw it away, but it'll be upset - very weak. <br /> <br /> I can not believe the money was spent on the camera trash. "Films" should be embarrassed and should be banned for fifty meters of film equipment anywhere in the world. <br /> <br /> I also think it's wrong that the people and family of the managers arrive at the IMDb. and send out the wrong comments and give the stupid appraisal of users that make the "movie" image completely wrong. It's an absolute movie of "Fungizida". Mr. Wascavage is very, very stupid or very cynical.
