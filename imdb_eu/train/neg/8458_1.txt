Last weekend I bought the movie in my local Movie Gallery. I bought 2 was 2 free and I needed one more, I chose this one. Awful mistake The box reads like it would be a very good movie. Well, this wonderful movie begins. About 5 minutes, that is. The film is about a young woman, Laila, who tries to save her twin, Jack, the bull. Laila's father, Cordobes, is a citizen who feels afraid. Jack thinks he is dead by Laila, because he was afraid of the bull and that he is still hunting. This was the first 5 minutes. Then it will be 100 times worse. Anyone who writes the script, I think, should have had a nice, acidic journey, because it never had any sense. Jack is running and finds a radio DJ who walks on Mary. Mary thinks Mary is a kind of virgin nature. You know, the mother of Jesus. But who knows, I can not make heads or tail. As they are running ... we'll see bad guys, magical visions, spectral encounters, flashbacks ... And all these things come to mind because your brain determines what is happening. Needless to say, I returned the movie and exchanged something else. It's horrible to be horrible. And there is no bullfight on the movie. Unless counting the first minute of the movie. I hope other people have lost some time in this movie.
