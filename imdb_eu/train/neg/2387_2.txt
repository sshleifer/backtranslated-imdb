I could not believe it and that was absurd. There's basically no laugh at the movie, it's hardly a scene that interests you in the movie. This movie brought huge stars, but in my opinion they were wasted. I think Keanu Reeves has had to give up a few years after this movie before joining Matrix. Uma Thurman was very easy and modest. Fortunately, this movie has a very low price because, definitely, it's not a movie because of some good reasons. I do not write anything about the movie story, but you should know that America was forced to be the most famous self-styled player on his huge finger. I would give this movie 2/10. Before seeing this movie, I wondered why this film got only 4.0 / 10 and now I know why. Very disappointing movies. Do not buy it even if you see less than $ 5.
