Dear my dear dear beloved ... me! I wanted to see the strength ... But why? <br /> <br /> The first two films are fun and really good. But we were so bad to see all this. It was a kind of rumor for children. I can not believe this whole movie ... something similar to those that were taken from the western bad series (kids), and only they can do with it. <br /> <br /> What is the audience movie? I can only think 12-14 years. If you are over 14 years of age, you will be very frustrated with this movie. It's not only slow but very boring. Characters are excessive (not just a bit), so stereotypical is a bit fun ... but it's not long enough to keep tomatoes on the screen. You know what's going to happen, yes ... you've seen a million times in a series of heroes for television. I gathered all the survivors and all the tremors when the latter entered the characters. It's so bad ... it's wrong ... it's ... <br /> <br /> But well, we laughed occasionally. It's not just scenes of nonsense, but some scenes worthy of playback or two scenes ... or this is a scene where one of the boys shaking in the shaking of two kids ... Its true is a great scene. repeat it repeatedly and laugh. He still smiles when I think about it. But that only happened once again with sadness ... and that's what happened to the "badass" gunman and overwhelmed his part ... that and commented one another "They're on the ground like some DEMONIC TROUT!" At that moment we are almost crying out laughing. But ... from that moment on, that could never be overcome .. (?) .. So that's a downside down. <br /> <br /> So, the legs are demonic ravens and excessive. If anyone tells you that this is a good movie ... either a "plant", a plant or a very bad person. This movie has been one of the worst tremors. Looking forward to seeing Tremors 3, this is a box-office billing ... this ... * goosebumps * no..I will be careful.
