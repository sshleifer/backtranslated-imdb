As a Turkish citizen in Sweden, I often admit seeing Scandinavian films. Most of all I never understood. I think Scandinavian actors work best in Hollywood. Last week I watched a movie called "The Polish Wedding" with my Polish friend, and we both said that we never saw the movie worse. Sadly, I was wrong, this "Angels House" movie is even worse. There is no actor, absolutely not the so-called Helen Bergstrom star. The plots are so absurd that nobody can believe it. I think the whole thing is messy from the beginning. Many bad behaviors except Selldal and Wollter. Ahmed Sellam
