This is a wonderful movie. It is very wise to begin to create a strange logic of his own. Well, if it were not coming out of the streets of the sides, it would still get bored under the weight of its indecisiveness. The film can not be directed directly to 'Man Turns Into Monster' (In the 1950s, 'THE INCREDIBLE insert ING MAN'), or as a giant and mystical business conspiracy theory. story of life contacts, or ... or what? Choose. It's just a mess. Overhead, up and down in all directions, it looses all over the place. Tobe Hooper was just like David Lynch's pills. Unfortunately he did not take enough.
