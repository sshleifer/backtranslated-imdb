As I saw the preview of this movie, it seemed very scary and I was very excited about the band I saw. In America, especially when we live during the elections, I see some deceptive things, but these predictions should be directed to the top of the list. I do not know how many people may be afraid of this movie. I only saw two jumping scenes and I just jumped a single. The whole movie was very predictable and maybe I skipped some scenes. The sound effects are so much afraid that I think so many were comic. Oh, and why did that come from? The worst noise of the whole movie was horrible. How does someone scare? I can easily make that noise. Now do not get it wrong. I love all the horrifying movies I've always loved, but you're laughing all the time but I did not think it was that it was all bad.
