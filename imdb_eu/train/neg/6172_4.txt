I'll get a movie for a minute. First, someone wanted the "proof" of comments made by Clinton in Georgetown, where the United States called 9-11 "was worth it." Here's what Clinton said: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the first cruciate, when the Christian soldiers took Jerusalem, first of all a snake with the synagogue had 300 Jews and all Muslim Muslims began to die. I tell the Middle East story and we're still paying. "We still pay? Whaddya means "we", paleface? The sailors did not attack the temple in the mountains. <br /> <br /> But, actually, Clinton never really quits and says "merit" 9-11. Like all the statements made about the presidency, it has been taken as it was worth 9-11. A, B, C, and maybe D "act" and conclude that listeners must conclude X. Actually, Clinton's "Facts" have been added to guacamole. <br /> <BR> But that's not it. We are here to talk about movies, not politics. Unfortunately, when Oliver makes a "Captain Conspiracy" Stone movie, you can not escape from his own politics. It was only time before his paranoia and bitterness focused on Reagan's era, and what Stone's time was when dreams became virtually true, when Reagan bought almost a farm. As Hinckley's assassination attempt could not find any kind of plot, he invented Al Haig. Due to the misunderstanding of the chain of the constitutional authority, Haig really had to transform his civil servant into a witchcraft megalomania. I almost expect Haig to rub Montgomery Burnse's hands and say Cap Weinberger to "Release dogs". Stone also picks up the most amazing Hollywood person to play former Richard Dreyfuss secretary of state. A guy who loves sight. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is OK. Average, below the average. Do not worry about renting or buying. Try to catch the cable. 10 to 4
