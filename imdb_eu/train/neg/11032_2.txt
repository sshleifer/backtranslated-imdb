"I Love New York" is another entry in the VH-1 (MTV Networks) that shows a fascinating, fun-loving and brutal woman. Speaking to Ebonics, the most ordinary competitor and mother must have a simple decision, and her mother - and give her a show on this network. Many will argue, "it's a show". It's true, the previous show, "Bad taste", is not so bad. But it's just as bad. <br /> <br /> In the 90's, "In Living Color" reminded me of Keenan Ivory Wayans. The boxer Mike Tyson was imitating the show "The Love Connection" and received the "Robin Givens". Mike talked that the date was good, but how he kept his mother awkward. This exhibition reminds me. <br /> <br /> Men are chosen and names are given to themselves and women that are degrading and being. more - (A smart man who seeks a smart woman does NOT permit, and his mother, I think, might be ghetto, ashamed whenever you appear on television.) Actors of professional reality, so why worry about it. <br /> <br /> I know all this. In fact, that is, as false as the recently established attachments? 15 minutes to entertain hundreds and thousands of dollars? (Well, you can not hate to try to make some money). Maybe it's amazing: who would like to spend an hour with the woman? Or the next show of his mother at the WWF! In any way you divide it, it is a sinking of the train you have seen several times before, so now the shock value has dropped. <br /> <br /> It will not make a more interesting twist or turn of rail, or something different from others. The common designation for the smallest commercial type and the "endings" appeals, that is, just another needle of the coffin, why should they end up soon.
