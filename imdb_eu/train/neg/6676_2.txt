The Blair Witch may not be the greatest fan, but I have tried harder, so I looked back to Altered, especially after reading some superlative comments on the IMDb. "Special", "intelligent", "Classical worship of the future" and so on ... It is surprising to describe the poor effort to describe the people they come up with. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it is Altered The movie is weak and weak and does not respect it. Silliness is not fun. Horror and gore is not terrifying. And in this movie they saw that some thoughts were "deceptive" parties, and certainly there is nothing deep or intelligent about this mess. <br /> <br /> Ok, so we know there is nothing to stand out. Is it, at least, sustainable? Is it worth the experience? Unfortunately, no. For beginners, a very bad performance. It's not a good stretch to better interpret B-movies these days. On the plot? Boring and confusing. Dialogs? The fans really improve a lot. <br /> <br /> It really is the direction that puzzles. I did not expect much better Blair Witch, but at least a small step forward. Instead, our manager seems to have worsened as he progresses over time, if he does not have the minds of previous experiences. A large part of the plot is made in a single location, where the main characters are limited, but SÃ¡nchez could not give it any personality. In Blair Witch, you play a large part in the forest and consider that a character with three students (antagonist, if you like) would think that the director would realize the same thing that he needed here. But no ... this place has no personality, no wonder, and attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Here's nothing worth saving. Better fans of "Blair Witch" are better off after Daniel Myrick. Although his production is very far away, he shows a better structure than Sanchez and Blair Witch's lessons are applied (unfortunately, in weak but still stories).
