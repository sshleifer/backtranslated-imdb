Something that was never something was a classic case. Glory was, nowadays, a single mother, her husband left, because she was not living in some towns (she was a fool that was elected to Reagan and wanted to turn her back to society). Right now and there I have problems with the series - are you going to say it myself, is Michael Stivic the same nobleman, linked to Archie Bunker's right philosophy? The series progressed, but it did not have any excitement. Sally Struthers left for a long time for the whole family. Perhaps, if they gave a different name to the series and they were presented as being completely independent in All In The Family, this might work. Well, that's the business.
