Is not it really good or a really stupid movie for teenagers to end up with, it's useless, is movie getting more sex than teens? In a perfect world, yes. However, this is even worse. This is not humiliating the stars, humiliating the distributor. All jokes, especially college students, people probably do not see interest, but it's "fun". Devon Sawa, the final destination was good, this movie is very sad. You are wondering why it's been bad. Rating: F
