I did not enjoy this movie. I thought the play was very good and the story was boring. 20-year-old computer saves one day? I thought that it was quite far away, even for a movie. I do not know why they could not turn off, why not take a sledgehammer. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, but after the original 80's, much more was expected than what was actually delivered. This movie is XXI. It could be an old movie of the century. If you want to see this, do not watch the movie! <br /> <br /> Even if the old computer did not save the day, I think they would still be very enjoyable.
