Tobe Hopper inadequate. Texas Chaimsaw Massacre directed classical horror. Since then all that has been done has been horrible. This is probably the worst ... and this is said a lot. The thing (and people) that has the ability to fire (Brad Dourif) or something like that. It's hardly an original idea (does anyone remember the "Firestarter"?) It's a real mess ... literally, ALL goes wrong! Pathetic operation (even Dourif!), Asinine script, loust production values, crappy special effects ... everything is BAD !!!!! What to ask ... so much less to laugh.
