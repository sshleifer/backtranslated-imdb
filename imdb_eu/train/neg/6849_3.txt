A J-Horror movie almost keeps a young woman going to sell her family house while she is returning to Shikoku Island's childhood village to meet with her old friends. A few years earlier he found the daughter of the priest's village. Afterwards, Fumika (another childhood friend) learned that Sayori is trying to speed up his mother's mother. The links between the dead and the living are getting dying and friends and villages are seeing ghosts. Nothing is apart or very good about this movie. Unlike the horrors of J-horror films, the suspense does not really build; The result does not reveal too much threats and it creates endless endings of nonsense. <br /> <br /> Film is also preparing a white rice line. It's long, so it's mushy on the border. Sometimes you get it in poor Asian restaurants or you prepare white rice too long. At last you eat, because we need lunch, because Japanese or Japanese food does not have any rice, but almost everything disrupts the meal, as it is wrinkled and buzzing. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
