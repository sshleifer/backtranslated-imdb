When I was a kid and I lived with her sister, she bought all the horror movies she could find and she was one of them. The VCR became a household element and we did not see it in more than 150 films and we saw them all. <br /> <br /> Another day I was at the yard and I saw this VHS. I bought a copy of BLOOD LEGACY and no horror movie I do not know and know that I know the movies. I thought for the second time and I realized that I bought my sisters. Sold years ago in a yard sale, I guess - who knows. <br /> <br /> I did not remember anything about it and I bought it tonight and I refreshed my memory. Some scenes. I do not know how I felt a child, but I'm sure I would like it to be new to me and I saw it and I would enjoy it later. <br /> <br /> I am horroring horror. But there are some conditions to play "good" and this is very short. The debate was one of those discussions and gave me the kind of death. You see the death scenes on the wall using shadow and blood splatter. If you're lucky, <br /> <br /> the story is good and I've seen some similar plots. That's why I think I'm buried and overlooked. Do not watch unless people are hard.
