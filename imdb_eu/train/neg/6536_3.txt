This DVD will be installed immediately and it will be directed by someone who plays an endless loop on the back. It is organized as a series of music videos of Grand Canyon, with several pieces of Mandarina Dream music. <br /> <br /> Sadly, TD music is dull and DVD transfer is fuzzy and dark. It is expensive to have a DVD.
