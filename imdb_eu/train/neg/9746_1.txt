I remember that this movie was shown in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, for a week. Although it seems incredible, and I can not explain it, this movie ... was shown in art and high-quality theater (Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Bu√±uel and ... Projects). A few people saw (thankfully people, no doubt) and there is no reference to a very boring SF film in the Peter Nichols Science Fiction Encyclopidie or the author of the original novel. Very significant I remember, in these years, a story, a ridiculous effect, and no more, the story. It seems that in some countries it is 90 mm long. and another 77 min. Well, it means a bit more pain.
