When Dolph Lundgren comes to New York, the key that comes from an anthristian is found by an archaeologist, the devil is only one thousand miles behind Dolph and is not so easily killed as he transfers from his body. body. (Like Fallen without suspense) Lundg's course is known for its elements and the film is completely unwatchable. In addition to being a fan of Dolph Lundgren, I accept being fans like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, when I watch her movies on TV. I was caught by minions and boys. This movie is very horrible. With sequential actions of plays and poorly edited, you can have a consistent meaning in the fight. Worst is the hard priest (!) Of Lundgren's perfect perfection. All this made the movie worse in Fallen (That Was Good) and End Of Days (That's what's bad but better). This movie is the worst film I've ever seen in Dolph Lundgren. He literally does not recommend. It is shameful and it's the lowest point in Lundgren's career. And I saw Cover-Up, The Last Warrior and Masters of The Universe. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * Out of 4- (Awful)
