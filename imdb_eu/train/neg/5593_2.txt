I love Dracula, but this movie has been very blank! I remember Lee as young as Dracula's movie was younger and I thought it was great, but the movie was very bad. I do not know if my young man captivated me because he believed that Drakula was the last way, with style, appearance, attraction and underlying evil. Or maybe this movie resigned to me. <br /> <br /> But have you imagined imagining Dracula in English accent and body language? Is the plot the characters' choices are unrealistic and boring and any voltage is missing? Then this is a movie for you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not see it! I just gave 2 because I was somehow awake during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry but if you liked this movie, then you should sleep and you should stay home alone in a dark room. the space that escapes your chase. Maybe only in your parents' home or in the home of strangers. The characters in this movie do not seem to be scared, and I think that he summarizes all this! <br /> <br /> Or maybe you liked this movie because it's a place in the Drakula's history, maybe I'm fascinated. Dracula's story is from Nosferatu today. As a film, it's not very attractive, it does not suggest you a mysterious suggestion to Vampy's myth that is fascinating to me. <br /> <br /> And it also feels a lot about this 70s. Landscape Theater is cheap. And I did not say that everything was done in the 70s. They love old movies and new movies.
