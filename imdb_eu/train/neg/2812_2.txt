I watched this film lately at the film festival. A great depression of an unholy unemployed man and a middle-aged woman is a love affair at a workplace office (INEM). I found the story very easy and very topical, to take the movie "social" and take it to a romantic comedy. The actor made a good job, definitely, as an alcoholist, but Ana Belen is not an incredible female worker class, she looks, acts, and speaks like a "tall woman". I mean Ana Belen herself. However, he does it in all his films. The staging of the film is very poor. The picture is ugly, it does not look good on all the panoramic relationships. Conversations are mostly scripts and sad. The comic situations are typical of GÃ³mez Pereira, but in this case they are not fun and they are wrong. In my opinion, this film is not worth seeing. If you really love previous movies in Pereira, you can enjoy it a bit. However, because I thought I was losing time in the theater. The filmmaker was in the doorway. I certainly do not see what one of the film's director shows, for one of those who really liked it.
