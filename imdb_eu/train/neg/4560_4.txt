Men In Black 2 was really disappointing to me. While the actors made a pretty good job, especially Smith, it's not a cure for a bad script in production anytime soon. The movie was really a "sequel", taking part in the first episode of the film. The story was in a word ... bad, at best. He was not well thought out and sometimes seemed very confusing and incoherent. <br /> <br /> In the first film, the MIB Organization felt an "elite" type of force. He had some special agents and he felt "clandestine." In the procession, the MIB has a JROTC summer camp. <br /> <br /> The movie was nothing terrible or nothing ... the first was "freshness" (for a better phrase). movie The same mood of the first and second editions was largely recycled and it did not add originality to the MIB universe. <br /> <br /> The first 3 films would be the perfect analogy Section 1. Was it decent? Yes Is the title worth it? It's not really.
