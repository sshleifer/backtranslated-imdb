It's a complete and absolute garbage, an excellent example of a BAD movie, this can not be attracted to anyone, nor even b-movie lovers. I do not repeat, do not waste precious time of your life in the trash. A bad performance, bad management, a great script (but it's really horrible), and what's the idea of ​​what (for any type of) entertainment. I bought the DVD for $ 3, I swear to bring it to someone. There was not enough recording to do this movie. I like B-movies, killer toys, the quaint monster of the lake, but that's not at all. Do you know this movie is so funny? Not even Only old pathetic.
