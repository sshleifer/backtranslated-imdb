Writers are cynical, though. It may be an American citizen, but I do not have to watch other Americans one after another, to enjoy a movie behind an hour and a half. I am surprised that there has been so much comment on the fact that the interview in this film is completely jingoistic, sentimental and vicious. The historical details of the film are not so harsh and offensive in the movie "U-571" (the British ships change the American ones), but still strolls a bit. Actually, the Germans in this movie do not admire Americans in the battle scene! How sad, unnecessary! They would like to say to writers: many of us are obvious that there are not any real problems, real pressures or some really proven shortcuts. Fortunately, you will always be grateful for your sugar-coated trio with nationalist trades.
