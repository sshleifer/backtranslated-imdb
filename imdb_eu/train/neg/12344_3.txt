Comedian, originally a vehicle to show a radio star in Jack Pearl, is now remembered as the introduction of The Three Stooges in America. Actually, Larry, Curly and Moe comic Ted Healy are billed next to the comic with Ted Healy and Three Stooges. Even Jimmy Durant's cast (totally wasted material) and ZaSu Pitts, in the current film, are the contributors who appear to be Stooges-Toxicomans, and even more do not applaud here. It's terribly loud and shameless to see how far reaching a sophistication slapstick he should get from Hollywood. * 1/2 ****
