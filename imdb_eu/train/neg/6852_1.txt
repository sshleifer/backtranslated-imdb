This movie is really incredible. I've seen so many cheap trash movies, especially 'Full Moon'-Pictures, but 'Dollman' is really hard. It comes with lots of laughable stories, the edge of the parody of the actors and special effects! How much time can I talk about it? It's really a bad movie, but one of the fun ones too. If you are a fan of worst movie, you should see it. And do not miss 'Dollman vs Demonic Toys'. It's very funny and worse.
