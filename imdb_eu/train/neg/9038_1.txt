Bartleby is a terrific production, but not as other reviewers say "unfilmable", but this version does not keep the spirit of the book. It tells the story, it's almost painful. Look, I've been able to turn on my book's pages and track it, because tackling one's adaptation is not so fun. Instead, see the 2001 Bartleby version with Crispin Glover. While this version is very entertaining, the film brings new details to the novel's spirit. It's important to know the details of things like spirit, not setting, names, and costumes. The difference between these versions of film is like a night and a day, boring and ridiculous. This adaptation is a good idea of ​​what is wrong with adaptation.
