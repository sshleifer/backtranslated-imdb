I was a little apprehensive about being a fan of Corman's horror films, a bit more than I expected from the West. Well, I felt well. I laughed Mel Brooks Saddles as much as I could see. <br /> <br /> See the tires mobile routes in the ancient pasturelands. Time may be killed if counted, otherwise a boring scene occurs. And horses also seem to have some gimmicks because of the progress made. Also see the western western salon, a number that reminds you of a decade of the 1920s, before inventing the style here. The expected version will not be broken. <br /> <br /> In the midst of the main strength, the main actors perform a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are very well. We thank them for making the best possible material from Johnny Guitar. However, there is nothing like West West. It's like a horror movie of ancient horror, it can fail in a way, but it may still be a joy. That's because of the work done by Corman and that's why you dare dare to experiment with my movie.
