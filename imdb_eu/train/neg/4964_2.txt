This movie is farce! The name becomes poorly written and becomes literate and literary fans become something they do not know. And Beowulf will give them a hilarious gun / ballpoint. Beowulf does not need such a weapon! In the poem, Grendel's arm escapes his bare hands! And I can not believe the scriptwriters did such things. Grendel's portrait is spectacular. These and cast are only positive points of the function. My English teacher would be insane when he saw this abomination. Unless Beowulf is a fan of the epic poem, avoid this movie at all costs. And I would not recommend it at any time.
