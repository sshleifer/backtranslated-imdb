There are some bad movies. Most are fun. "Penalki madness 1" was one of those films. It was so bad that it was nice and he saw the value again. "Criminal madness 2" must have been one of the worst movies ever made, and for me it's a lot to say that I'm not the worst person to say is the worst thing. But believe me, this was absolutely horrible and it lasts longer than 1 hour. <br /> <br /> The movie has a relatively unusual story, but it looks after the story very carefully. A fat woman is killing people because they do not feed. Well, you do not see this movie except the first flashback sequences. The new story could be very fun to get Ethel home and kill everyone, but nothing happens until the movie lasts 20 minutes and at that moment you're asleep. <br /> <br /> The cameras in this movie are incredibly scary. This literally reminds me of something I shot in my fifties with my friends. Sound quality is another thing that other people can not understand the word they say. To give an example of what's wrong, go to the New York subway and try to understand what the saying is in front of the headset, this is the movie. However, they do not take into account what they are talking about, because the actors are as dry as leaves. <br /> <br /> I now know that saying it's a bit worse is to say it's a bit worse, but the words can not not describe this bad movie. If you do not believe it, see yourself. 1/10
