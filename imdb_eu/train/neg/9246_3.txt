When I saw it I was originally transmitted, keeping the memory of the last series of the 1960s, with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I can not face a challenge anymore. I'd better know it. It's not a remake, and more than a homage to a tribute, this show is not pretty playable, and plumped by children's comedies and cartoons and plots. The three main characters were slightly more than the caricature of the actors, and only Emilia Fox could act (Bob Mortimer's role is correct). Supporting Vic's only comedians and acquaintances, Bob wanted to take part, and he was so much aware of it. And CGI, although the effects could not be improved by 30 years ago, just fascinated the viewer's lights and cameras, hiding scripts and bad quality of conversations. All styles and no substances. (And in the 1960s, while the show is scattered throughout its time, this "update" is dated today, with "Matrix" style, a "girl's power" scene, which leads to less than two voltage levels.)
