This film has several mistakes. The first and most significant, there is a lack of good land! This film does not look after him, but asks the spectator to send some feelings of hope, as if he were losing valuable time for short life. This means that the movie can not fascinate the audience, but rather encourages the viewer to contempt for the film and all that is at stake! In short, it is very very very very very bad! Make yourself a favor and chew a large rubber shoe, it will be much more interesting and enjoyable than seeing Terminator Woman.
