(Mis) I was lucky to show this movie in the United States. Unfortunately I was full of lies, I was shocked to see so many good reviews in the IMDB. <br /> <br /> The original movie was a turkey, but interesting. It was integrated in the early seventies after the 1969 revolution. this movie is just ....... yes, nothing really is. It's wrong. <br /> <br /> Imagine a bad smell commercial: do I see what I mean? <br /> <br /> Madonna will never play, and the screen has been embarrassed for many years. It seems worse and worse in those years, which resembles a seemingly strained growing man. <br /> <br /> Lock Rok, who has built his "reputation", can never direct it. superficial, poorly cut, fashion shows. He's not disappointed here; he sensibly cast his wife as the protagonist of this debacle. <br /> <br /> Please, consider people with the best opinions given by other posters below. Of course they are business plants. <br /> <br /> Do not encourage Ritchie to humiliate himself by giving money. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
