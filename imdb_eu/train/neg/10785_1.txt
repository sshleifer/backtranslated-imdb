Wow, what a great cast! Julia Roberts, John Cusack, Christopher Walken, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Hank Azaria ... what's that? A script, you say? Now you're just hungry! Certainly, the bumps of their charism will lead to rumors of cinema strangers that a script is not necessary? You think so, but not. American lovers have lost one chance after each other. Everyone who participates writes / shoots / publishes every day is awesome, although "You know what? I've worked hard ago and this is guaranteed to be successful with those great names, it will not crash and someone else will take the power" . So much potential, but so painful. There is no single aspect of this thing that does not suck. Even Julia dresses is a fat boat.
