An idea as good as an "invisible man" would work better and the special effects should be handled at fantastic times, but this is not the case. The story, the characters, and finally, the last 20 minutes of the movie are just as fresh as the original scientists of the early 1950s. There are some great moments, especially when the special effects are amazing and the idea of ​​an invisible man who walks through the streets. But, of course, we have soon stopped in the underground laboratory's incommunication, that is to say, not just the rest of the films, but it is schematic. <br /> <br /> The elders have been rebuilding many. The latest 10-year movies or TV shows, some of which have their own charm. But each film is becoming clearer and clearer, because the idea of ​​placing classics in the nose of mad madmen such as Verhoeven (its moments) is. It's clear that money is key here: the time and energy that is put in the script is not approaching anymore, and as a result, "Hollow Man" seriously worsens clichés, sappy characters, predictions, and lack of depth. . <br /> <br /> However, in spite of special effects, I swore a thing that really impressed. When they are making this kind of film, modern producers are very fond of watching the kids. So language (and sometimes violence and sex) is very tone. Whenever the whole world is blows, good will go "Oh darn!" and "Oh my God". "The Dark Man" expresses his gratitude for this hypocrisy, and the characters have a greater freedom to get their natural out. I do not say that swearing is the most natural answer to something that went wrong, but it is more believable if BUZTERTAN really swears. That is why we can thank Verhoeven.
