I was looking for the bottom 100 of Imdbs, I saw something like I did not see anything beyond the 9th or something I saw as a Roller Ball remake, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur both won. <br /> <br /> I have never seen the worst movie I have ever seen. Bad management, bad people, bad theater, a terrible story. No one is right, but Sam never says anything positive about this movie. Sam was a huge annoying actress, but it was so bad that he could destroy Ed Wood's directorate. <br /> <br /> The director should shame his work, unfortunately, I need to give a star at least, but it's worth it ... keep up the stars.
