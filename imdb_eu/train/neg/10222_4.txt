The scene of the battle of James Wong Howe, as well as the excellent cinematography of filmmaking, is a real stinker. <br /> <br /> This is the second movie directed by Alexander Korda. The first was the "Rembrandt" by Charles Laughton. It was so bad it was shut up. I'm afraid this is not much better. <br /> <br /> Flora Robson is just as ugly as Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps the performance of the virgin queen was good for 1937, but when compared to Helen Mirren, it is not unparalleled. In Robotic mode, Robson explains his lines. The English troupe troop message has little spirit. <br /> <br /> Although a bustling Laurence Olivier could not save upset. <br /> <br /> Future wife Vivien Leigh is an assistant here and she does not really transmit anything here. I think Scarlett was two years later! <br /> <br /> The story of the Spanish army is so unique that it has been so boring in this film.
