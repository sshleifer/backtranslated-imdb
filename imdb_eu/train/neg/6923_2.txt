A really terrifying Mexican film, based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe, about a story about how to get into the backyard of an asylum hidden in the woods, how it works, to write a story ... Gaston is our hero. with the great spectacle given by Dr. Maillard asylum, we can see all sorts of things, such as men and comedians in a dungeon, a hero who acts as a soldier. There was a stairs hanging on the side of a building. Then, there is one possible sight: a chicken man, that's it, chicken, chicken flour. The scene was the star of the movie, but at least, for me, it was the lowest point of the movie and it really was very confusing for older men and women to think that this was far from entertaining. Oh! This is precisely the legion that transforms Dr. Tarr and his name. And this is the most important film with many of the title-length films that have serious problems. Yes, this is obvious, but some have a distribution problem and others, one of them, has many title changes, sometimes one person can buy spam even more than once. This is definitely a rubbish. Very little. The only performer to watch is Claudio Brook's support. It's a giant ham, while laughed at the manish, slow orders, sashay sword in his hand, and praises the chicken. I was so hard to speak of a "calming system" as a means of healing the headaches. What a range of playfulness (Hey, such a movie deserves such a script.) Knowing what will happen about asylum will not be longer, or even more interesting. Cinematic chicken!
