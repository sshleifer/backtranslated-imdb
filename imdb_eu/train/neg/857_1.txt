Many fans of the King hate it because they have fired from that book, but the movie is another medium and they need to change when the books jump. However, the movie completely fails, but the film completely fails. They would like people to tell me, the most curious film ever made. I always follow "really ... what scene I was afraid of" every fan I asked was silent. Occasionally, someone, as a result of losing their fearful (not at all ...), calls it "The exterior of the graffiti throwers". If you're afraid of it, I do not know what to say, maybe you're not afraid. These movie-horror ideas of horror film schlocky, I only play these incoherent ones. <br /> <br /> It's a place that is diverted from a book and it's really stuffy. Halloran Only to kill people; The strangest audience member finds out waiting for one of Jack's backbones to move on to Halloran more than once. It's really one of the most stupid sequences in the movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and a good chance Mr Halloran is Stanley of the work of art! Nymphomaniah lights add the nature and character of a horror movie. Have you ever made a "shot" without shots in a never-ending place? <br /> <br /> It's a miracle I think I was finally able to forget it and I agree with Kubricks 2001. The huge "bad will" of the stupid and stupid movie created by the stupid and stupid movie Kubrick is an important movie given by the worshipers of the Kubrick, who could not describe an idea of ​​all the resources of the films. Library of Congress in front of them. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson's abusive grotesque exaggeration, entering into silent moments in tense moments, and Razzie's nomination as Shelly Duvall and a very crappy movie.
