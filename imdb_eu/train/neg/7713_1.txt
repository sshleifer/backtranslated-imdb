I know the movie was so bad that it was fun, that's why I came in with that hope. It seemed so bad to me it was boring. The funny rumor of the song is about 10 seconds, there's nothing clear about it, except deliberate quality. When you see things, tomatoes splashed in the old 30 seconds. About the film nothing is clear or funny, except for the premise. Perhaps it may have a 3-4 minute comedy starring, but it's not part of the imagination for a feature film.
