I got a great instinct 2 value, but the movie got less than 4 points. This movie has earned me only 4, but it has more than 600 people with 7.3. I do not know why they like the movie so much. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring, because there is never a big broken house in these rooms. This film has only 5 people. It lasts almost two hours, that is, it is completely useless. Many conversations are slow and meaningless. The tone of the movie is dark blue and it looks disappointing. The movies are shortened just a few sentences. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me that "Hiru times" directed by Hou Hsiao hsien is equally boring. Conversations are also boring. It also has a high score! I had to stop having the first story stopped. <br /> <br /> This movie is lacking passion and excitement.
