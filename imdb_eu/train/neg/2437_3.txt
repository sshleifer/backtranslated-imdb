Well, I admit that I'm not a fan of John Ford. (I saw "Informant" because I'm trying to work through a "big list"). So if you are, you just move, because I do not agree with me. <Br> /> <br /> This is a nasty and dumb one! I'm going to say that it's a good idea for a movie (I was thinking about a few Irish films about the Irish Revolution), but, as usual, Ford has decided that more and more cheatful feelings are cheaper. I think it's a bit more interesting to watch for a moment to see it easier than the transition from silence to "talk", one of the principle styles seems to be an endemic top quality, as early as the film and the film feels like playing better with the title cards than an oral interview. (Of course, the title card would prevent Ford from replicating all the emotions six times.) What conversation is "always a joyful charm for me!" This quality seems to allow every actor to use the personal version of an Irish accent. Obviously, they are just as bad as they are, because they remind us that we are in Ireland, most of all because they look like a German expressionist engraved on the next soundtrack. (With an eagle, it seems that you can see some people behind behind Dr. Frankenstein). <br /> <br /> Techniques change. Likes changes So I did not see that the film was acclaimed at that time. Ford is similar to the simplified malarkey that will bring him to his career, but he does not have classics.
