This is not the fault of Michael Madsen, he was almost there. This movie was horrible. If you want to get bored and bored, watch this movie. The word can not describe how idiotic it is. Sorry Michael. Cinematography was dark. All other actors are unknown. When you look, it feels like a soft one, but it's not nudity or scene. This movie had sexual explanations, about an underground S & M killer. The performance was bad, except Michael Madsen's pieces. She seems to want to laugh. I look forward to this well paid movie. I would be proud of it. It's not a B movie for a cable, it's like a F and it never has to be shown anymore.
