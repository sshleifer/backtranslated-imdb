No, I will not get here. I refuse to join this program. Do not you suppose, maybe, that this movie has been rated somewhat? Check reader comments and star ratings: most are 6/10, 7/10 or better. In my opinion, this is, for example, to say more about people who only give the grade to the movie. Other fantastic fantasies of horse-riding couplings have become the main hits as a DVD title for the catalog? I watched this movie with a nonsense budget, I expected fireworks, and instead Gucci bought a shopping bag. It looked great, but after the thrill, the end of the tour was not much to save. <br /> <br /> The back story of the film says: the film's director plays hardcore fake about 25 minutes. The sex for another movie is not reported as a good footage, aside from waiting for two or three years to build a successful critic success, and then builds a feature film of 25 minutes, otherwise it's about a matter of about 70 minutes . imitate the footage imitating and 25 minutes as a dream sequence. Undoubtedly, this 25-minute movie is incredibly curious, original and moving. But we are not evaluated here for only 25 minutes, we have to take full account of the whole movie and ask ourselves why people are so enthusiastic about this film? Or they just love the story and story of a foreigner because they were bogged down because they were stupid? <br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps an anti-clerical anti-media agenda is against them. The hate of Western religions in Catholicism and Christianity is one of socially acceptable intolerance societies. Nowadays, the BBC maintains traditions that promote Christianity and Western feelings for political justice. You can talk about the Bible, pedophile priests, institutionalized cruelty of the church, and how many white men and their cruel religions burn on a golf ball carved out of the skin ... But talk about Western religions that are not negatives. and you are toast. This film made a personalized feeling, with a priestly and priestly priest who had a very poorly-consumed screen, with 14-year-old French youngsters, with improper touches, polite, noisy, confusing, terrifying and lying. backsides Ewww. <br /> <br /> And then there are horse couplings, fictitious fictional aesthetics, parts of the film can be used as a visual aid for biology classes of wealth. Yes, I understand the thematic capacity of images - the great falus of animals with the wealth of reproductive fluid that open fire extinguishers - but if you want to see horses, you know, I would like it. a farmhouse It's as entertaining as having genital faces to see someone use a bathroom. <br /> <br /> Is this movie just an artistic deviation for social deviations? Probably, most of them will give me an artistic execution, even though it is shot in details of the art room with dirty forest taken from a pintxo Monet, consisting of a large arch bridge. And the end (though I was surprised) is packed with personality. But we must remember that there are certain things that can not be dissolved in the design elements, and many artists are guilty of blaming themselves for their exploitation for their exploitation. That is not correct, and even more, Clint Eastwood has attacked the challenge of the new Iwo Jima movie. Whether his movie is good or not, whether this battle is a noble cause against heroine men. The problem is that people will not be able to distinguish between the two aspects of the film, and will award the Oscar for noble message, because it is not particularly good or original. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, it looks like THE BEAST: How does anyone see the basic beauty of nature, seeing the horse's coat? And who can not see a beautiful set of explosive movies that ends the sexuality of the repeated sexuality where Beauty and the Beast are finally wicked? Somehow, I lost two points and I'm glad to see what I've seen this movie to really miss out on it: about 25 minutes or an open eye surrounded by 70-minute skull over the topographic tale of adults. The litter bin of Euro is bored and boring, a haircut and an excellent finish. It's probably art, but it's hard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3/10
