I really did not expect much from this movie in Parkersburg WV, that is, I was living and acting. This town is sad and this is the movie. There were different scenes from the movie, but I was paying attention to all the wonderful points that made a point of showing. This movie may not be as good as it was, but it was not there. If you're not from Parkersburg and you're interested in everyday life, follow this movie. You will sleep in the conversation, the performances will tear you tears and Steven Soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting such a trash. It's an unexpectedly forgotten movie. What you see is what you get and Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio are a 73-minute career without narrators.
