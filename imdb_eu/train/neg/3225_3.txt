Children love dinosaurs. It's part of their culture. But before the Earth Hour. Original He had at least one movie in his heart. This This movie is very pathetic. Because children love dinosaurs, it does not mean that old stories come together and show them to children. This movie has no plot, the whole premise is stupid, and there are more numbers. It's not like sucking soul like Theodore Rex, but it's been Earthquake for many years.
