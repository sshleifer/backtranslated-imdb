When I heard the line for this movie, I just had to see it, I mean, the killers of tomatoes will erase all the cities! Unfortunately, the title is very funny. <br /> <br /> Dick Mason is a unique team of military detectives and scientists (including Greg Colburn, SCUBA, and Lett. behind the parachute behind the back ("Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes") is a parody of B-Movies, especially the horror of the 1950s. The film begins with a standard sized tomato that is described in the machine as a kitchen, because it seems that tomatoes have found dead in the middle of a scene of crime, and let them say that they did not eat it. as the movie progresses! There are some fun moments to be reasonably good; For example, a PhD in Japan says a Nokitofa scientist dubbed his voice as an American accent or, when Sam Smith, when disguised expert enters the tomato, "does someone please ketchup?" . Also, this film was much more fun in 1978, in general, because it was a very good concept. Unfortunately, "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes" films, such as "Airplane" and "Naked Gun", have been released and featured a much better comedy. <br /> <br /> The play is awesome; There is no continuity in the edition and it feels very slow energy and energy. To work on a parody movie, you need a lot of things that happen simultaneously, one after another. The song of the movie is senseless and the ads on the screen are not very curious, even for this film. After all, see why this is a cult movie; I can not see many people indifferent. Unfortunately this would be a way to shorten this terrible.
