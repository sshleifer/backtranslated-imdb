This movie offers only the worst conversations. For surely, I could not imagine a movie without cinema, how synthetic interviews could last up to an hour, but I saw the video again. In a movie that is under a strong script, at least one good performance and fabulous conversation would be seen, and maybe even humor, but all the movies are lacking. Everything I heard was lacking. I do not like a single point about this movie, none. I hate. I'm sure that nobody will do it. He wants to give the name of the publicity he wants to do nudity and things, but he also fails to nudity. I do not know how to pay for this thing about an hour, and I recommend that you do not do that. the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. If someone offers to see you, watch over your lie
