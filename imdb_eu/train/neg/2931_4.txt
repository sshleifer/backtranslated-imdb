"Gentlemen league" sitcom continues the lives of some of the popular fictional people Royston Vasey. Different scenes are linked together. <br /> <br /> In the first series, the main sketch show focuses on a new road to be built through Royston Vasey. As a result, there are more foreigners in the small town. But Edward and Tubbs, the owner of a local store far from the village, do not like foreigners. Visitors die every time they enter their store. In my opinion, some scenes are fun and not fun, for example, when the pair is absorbed by two engineers who want to build a new road. Edward Drum, while Tubbs's victims are half-naked around. <br /> <br /> Also, Paulin lives in Royston Vasey. She works at the Local Employment Center. Although Pauline hates people who work, women do not want to miss their jobs. So, a man in unemployment is interviewing a firefighter, he does not allow him to do the job as he already has no permission. <br /> <br /> Afterwards, Barbara Dixton is a transsexual taxi driver. Details about his "sexual" conversion. <br /> <br /> In addition, Chinnery always kills veterinarians instead of curing their animals. In one case, he comes to a farmhouse and takes a dog to the basket in the seat. The farmer goes out. Assuming that the dog is a sick animal, Mr. Chinnery himself euthanizes. The second later, the farmer opens the door, the "true" animal sick, leaving a sheep in his hand. <br /> <br /> Some neighbors visit their husbands and their wives. A friend kills the store owner. The pair is very tidy. For example, towels are in different colors. Each color represents a part of the body. They also have thousands of keys, marked with different colors and classified. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the actors act very well. By playing women, the scenes become comical. The costumes are also adapted to the actors. Tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy people, such as Edward, have little black teeth. The show is a dark mood, British typical. The set design reflects the serial environment. All the villages and houses are gray and shaped. In the local store, it is often a fog that strengthens the threat effect. Country signal is disturbing: "Welcome to Royston Vasey. You will never leave." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
