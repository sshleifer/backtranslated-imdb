Although it's good jokes, humor is pretty dry when panel members often face faces or buzzwords and waiting for the crowd to await applause for joking crowds. <br /> <br /> Unlike other comments, I do not think this is the best RTE ever, really dry and sarcastic. It's the lowest sense of sarcasm, there are really few intelligent gag, forcing you to laugh really. People seem to believe that popular names of comics are really good ones. In general, they should be good choices, but they can often be middle-aged. It's not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens. Benny Hill looks more fun.
