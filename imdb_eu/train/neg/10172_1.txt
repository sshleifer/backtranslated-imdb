When I saw that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie, I scored! I accept, I was looking forward to watching the movie. And I must say the first fifteen minutes in a nostalgic way. Then all the hill fell. I did not expect any landfill of civil rights corrections. They took all the controversial subjects and threw stupid stories. I was surprised that Noah participated in something like that, especially his role. Anybody with a totally functional brain would not really admit about the Vietnam war. If you want to know what communism is, sit back and read a book. And this is not exalted or opposed, but rather cold facts. <br /> <br /> I only saw some scenes here and there I just wanted to see Ricky's body, but that was what I was interested in. . In addition to this movie, everything else was annoyed by me.
