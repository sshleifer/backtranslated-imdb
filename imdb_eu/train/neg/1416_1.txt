Strange ... I like this movie group and humor; but I did not like it in any way! It's wonderful, horrible and surely not fun. Pity can not make the whole line of the movie, either dishonorable. And it was very boring. The empty moment fills the movie; it could be removed. Surely, it should be in a shorter format. Maybe I expected too much crew - just like saving the lol movie -. There is also an excessive topic of characters and situations ... I do not know why people liked it ... "Poetry", "hope"; I did not see anything like that! ^^ They are purely pure and raw, wonderful and hopeful. Oh this damn ........
