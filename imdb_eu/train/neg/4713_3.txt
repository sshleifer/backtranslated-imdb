My rating and my title, as I guess according to this review, I do not like Johnny Test. Now I know how to tell people what they are saying: "How do you know what is bad, have you ever seen?" I watched this view twice, because I'm studying cinema and animation, and that's just "having a candle to my standards. <br /> <br /> I want to talk about animation because it's one of the most confusing things I've seen. In the first two seasons, or only in the first season, I had only one hand-drawn animation, I thought it was a hand-drawn show, but then it changed to flash animations and dropped a lot of quality, look at the story of the show, trying to make it as hard as the Dexter laboratory, but there are differences. , there are two red scientists and two women, there is a dog talking (why?), And their parents change their attitude a bit. I have others, but I do not think they can write here (I do not say the curse, but not I know if there is a word for a limit.) All else DeeDee character Johnny himself. It's just trying to pick it up, but I do not like it, it's a shameful fall. <br /> <br /> Finally I want to talk about the txistu. Remember some of the jokes that shook the Dexters lab? Yes, the echo can be a good joke or two, but the Dexter Laboratory also had unnoticed remarks to get back and check the joke. Johnny Test forgets all this and says 50% of the time and music stops when a foolish joke or cover appears. It's not a comedy, a stupid comedy (I know what they think. Is there three stupid comedies? Look and Johnny Test laughing and laughing at the first option.) Sometimes jokes are based on strange situations, like crazy Chowder. I have all the cartoons and comedy rules: the most strange comedies are not the same "what do I see?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So, think about all the issues. Do not miss this show if you have respect for comedy, shape or shape.
