The bad image of professional police on television appears in the observation of the alleged reality show. It is only possible to "stop" the effects of the circumstances arising from the reasonable suspect and then "Outside the costume" outer garment, then why it can be articulated. the officer recovered his own pockets and smuggling, the scene was cut off, if it were not, he would be arrested in most places, if they had to overcome one oversight. The report by radiocommiters is not the person who sends the real existence of the order to the right order. If the sender reads from a computer print, it is enough to carry out the arrest but does not mean that the warranties are still in force. Since CBS has not seen the Dis claimant (maybe I may be lost), CBS has problems.
