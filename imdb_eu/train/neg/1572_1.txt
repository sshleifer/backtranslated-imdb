One of the worst movie I've ever seen. An overwhelming spectacle, a 'action' that is shaky (it's clear that cars are slowly traveling), stunning screenplay, stinking endings, and inadequate film hash. We know that Reinhold's judge is a good actress, but it should be ashamed of such debris. There is not much voltage within the car and when the characters encounter moments of hope, for some reason, laughing laughs when they see the "high five" bridge go down. Likewise, the chain of events that people have shared with the same cars is credible. It seems that it is based on real events? If that happens, truth is more than fiction! Hopefully, then, it was depicted so ineptly.
