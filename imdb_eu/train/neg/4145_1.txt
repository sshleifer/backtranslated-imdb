Okay, I've watched the movie twice now, I've been researching on the web, I have asked some of these opinions. Although I went to a book that assumes that I have continued to read this book by the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic 'Carmilla'. The best way to review this movie is to describe a game that is playing. The line of the movie does not make any sense, here's the book's argument. <br /> <br /> Laura, together with Lafontainer, lives in a castle in Syria. They continue in a happy and peaceful life. One day, they get a letter from the "General" because the mission of their daughters has avenged the death of their daughters. He works on claims of supernatural powers and will soon explain. Meanwhile, Lafontein causes her daughter, Carmilla, to encounter a strange woman for several months. Laura soon begins to dream of jewelry and begins to go down with a strange illness. Who is Carmilla mysterious? And what is Laura's condition and what General has done? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I guess this game and I would like to play as many people as possible and find out what are the results? Although I have a tough name, and I would be a jingle, but I do not have any problems. "This movie does not make sense". <br /> <br /> Whatever you do while watching the movie, it tries to explain the whole story that is happening. I mean the answer to all the questions, everything is sensible, completely complete. <br /> <br /> He will have to answer these questions ... <br /> <br /> * Why can I see the vampires walking on a clear day? <br /> <br /> * Why are all lesbians? <br /> <br /> * Why is a girl named Bob? and why draws himself? <br /> <br /> * When is a movie a dream and when is it real? <br /> <br /> * Why is it that dead zombies are an acceptable part of life? Does anyone hide an eyelid? <br /> <br /> * Why does Travis Fontain put a zombie down and slows down when driving a car, but is it still a woman with a backward retreat to accept her car as a zombie? <br /> <br /> * And why does a little girl leave her, as she shows herself later, knows she's a vampire, guiding her in her car? <br /> <br /> * And let's get away with a stolen car on her daughter? <br /> <br /> What is the fish in all the asylum scene? <br /> <br /> What the hell is everything? <br /> <br /> * Why is it distributed to dress a vampire as a nurse? <br /> <br /> * Why are zombies never fighting vampires? <br /> <br /> * What is the importance of necklace? what is it doing why do vampires die? and how does Jenn know? <br /> <br /> In fact, it's so much fun to try to ask a lot of questions about this movie. <br /> <br /> I have my plot, and I do not have to accept it, but the effort is pretty good. <br /> <br /> As a result <br /> <br /> 'Vampires vs Zombies' is no longer there. Vampires are really fighting for Zombies. Everyone in the movie knows exactly what's going on, but it seems to be very hard for the audience to stop talking about it. And somehow, nineteenth. It is based on a classic horror novel of the century. How Why? What's hell doing?
