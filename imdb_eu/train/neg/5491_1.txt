We should be suspicious when it was discovered that we had no more than two minutes to get the lights out. Only five other members entered the movie before the start. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to free this movie. The play is awful (especially Mrs. Hurley). The script is trivial. Thousands of times we've seen. We have seen the worst film director. Meandering and imbalance. No one laughed at laughing at children too. <br /> <br /> We left after 25 minutes. My wife would not look for a little dog! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money in this movie. If you do not want to see in your cinema, buy some drinks, popcorn and dogs and do some observers. You'll have a much more enjoyable time! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
