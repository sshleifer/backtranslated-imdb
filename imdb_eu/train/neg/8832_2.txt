This movement has been very difficult. It was very slow and sometimes it was asked that the drawing of the movie would be alive. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed slow and finally when I asked him. Normally I am normally a person with an independent file, but that's not what I was looking for. <br /> <br /> It seems that they want to get a lot out of this movie. It seems like a political moment, I'm not a fan of cinemas. If you are looking for a non-terrestrial movie, if you do not have a small plot, this is the right one for you. As for me, I felt like I was losing 2 hours doing something else.
