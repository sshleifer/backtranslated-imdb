"Darkness" was somewhat entertaining, but it never seemed like a plot, when it was missing out on other films that accused him of a harm; That is, "bad taste". It started very well, a man started from something. This first minute was very awful, but after some time, the movie was entertained at gore level, it was somewhat difficult to get a good lighting and recording quality. The movie was a difficult task for the youngsters' beliefs, because most of them talked with a video camera and started to line up. There was no plot in it, the movie looked like it did without any script and it ended without finishing it. As previously mentioned, this gore film was a unique drawing point, which was all the time difficult.
