Ouch! It is much worse than the dramatic adaptation of the beloved novel by C. S. Lewis. Although the adaptation is a very real novel, the play is horrible, and sets and special effects are similar to a school game. I have read the quote for this miniseries that the BBC has done at the time, but it could surely have been filmed more than $ 2 a month. All is the result of Mr Beaver. The computer effects I knew were not at the time that were necessary or even more efficient, but the clothing-like boutique was a terrible man. You have only made the character of the film better than paper. Avoid at all costs.
