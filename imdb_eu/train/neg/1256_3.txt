This film is another well-known director of Tim Burton to bring his "view" screen. "Batman", "Sleepy Hollow", and now this. This is not a remake. The only thing that is original is that it is the only one who thinks that there are similes who speak (and Charleton Heston makes a lantern). Burton has revitalized the whole story, which has been watered by today's massive spectator. <br /> <br /> Originally from the origin of the Planet Earth. The 1960s was struggling to redefine civilization in America. The time of the soul was confusing, which sought and rethought social norms. The age of civil rights was that the least considered players demanded the same treatment. In this context, POTA was an allegorical reflection of the philosophical disorders that confronted the spectators of the day. POTA was an intelligent and intelligent film faced with difficult questions, and he looked at the oppressed of American society, when he justified a species that white whispered under his mind. Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) were thoughtful and intelligent, irony, subtle and obvious. <br /> <br /> Burton's version is so much that POTA is a product of the current sixties. This is Apes for Dummies. It is superficial and jejune, replacing the politically correct scintigraphs with intelligent dialogue and more than just shaping the form of substance. The 'Surprise' end is absolutely awesome and helps to bring something to the movie, except for a rocket that creates the battle. While the end of the original POTA is beautifully bound up with a single strong scene, Burton's end is simply scattering the audience, seeing that "I know something I do not know and wait for the fight." <br /> <br /> Vision From a technician, as always with Burton's movie, it's an excellent movie, make-up is wonderful, and Burton's camera work is remarkable (although it's a bit like a dark look.) However, advances in the thirty-three years of prosthetic makeup can not be compensated with mere scripts. <br /> <br /> The story has become a monster movie, which manages the captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) to fight Apes monsters, accompanied and accompanied by some boats (especially Helena Bonham Carter). She is a formulaic and simplistic presentation of violence It's a great deal to have a fast mental food today. <br /> <br /> The play is mixed Mark Wah Lberg is a good actress because he fails. Walberg is superb to make dark and shameful caricatures, but strong characters. This part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in Wahlbergen's repertoire. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actress, whose character is so far away from the abilities of unexpected disconnection. He constantly tries to do something with a horrible character, but his interpretation is presented as a poem for a university peace and a cross between a teenage love affair. <br /> <br /> Then, Tim Roth is there. His performance is a virtuoso, when he is totally in ruin of the movie. Roth is diabolically hateful as a bad general Thade. The wicked who thinks sometimes can create the most evil and bad ones. In addition, his physical behavior is superlative, which makes him a man-made man who can think of that species. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great despair. Entertainment is decent, if you see your brain at the door. I was worth 3/10. From a technical point of view, it is much better, maybe 9/10. However, the story is to be insulted at the original franchise. It's just another attempt by Burton in self-applause, appealing to captivating at the box office, a lot of people can see who is genius. Of course, it is true, but it would be ideal for using this tale to produce a lot of films, formulated for mass consumption.
