Oliver Gruner is completely unknown to me. My friend showed me this movie because I saw it in Gruner, a science-fiction movie quite good, called Nemesis. When we saw this, we started fast BS drama fragments to get incredible action sequences. Gruner likes and kicks. And kick! haha <br /> <br /> She learned a graduate from Gruner who was forced by a ghetto who grew up. The boy who lives with him is watching because he wants to really participate. a Mexican group that tormented his family. Instead of joining in, Gruner tells him to face the boy (against a bad group? Very mad). Gruner has a typical character by Van Damme and works for the removal of blockage by everyone (or bad). <br /> <br /> The Earth was very cursed and very easy to think. Gruner probably did not know very well if this movie was to be compared with possible options. This ghetto is hell and I liked trying to see the speed of the crew's characters, as if it were an option against Gruner's character. Music was a typical act of music (pianists and drums, guitar inflammation) was not as bad as it was. The director really needed an uninterrupted 5-minute break for a family tension momentum. <br /> <br /> Finally, I gave it 4/10, especially because it was an average action movie. Oliver Gruner struck out, but you want to close whatever you want to see what you leave the movie.
