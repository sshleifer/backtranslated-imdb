The address here must be a problem. I recently heard John Cleese offer to Fawlty Towers. He had to attack his car with an office. The first branch was very weak and not fun. The second branch was very hard to be fun. The third one was quite fun to be fun. There is no attention to detail in "Corky Romano". It does not matter how shameless it was a bit of comics, it was not fixed, and there was no cutting room on the floor. The value we can find in this film is a very divided film, without resolving it without breaking it. <br /> <br /> I have reviewed some other reviews here. The number of revisions to the loss of time I suspect is that some people are encouraged to promote my titles. A person over 9 years can rate 4 this MAX, MAX. I mean, come on, it's 5 average. I can not imagine anyone, even those who take away the money, valuing so much the average. <br /> <br /> This is the worst film in my 10th season. And, hey, I really like Three Stooges and Ed Wood!
