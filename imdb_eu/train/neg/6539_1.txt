If this is 0, it would be valid. From the wood-burning wood, from troubled rhythms and sadness, from the puerile angle of exploitation to the sad spectators, they have added a sophomorous pseudo-drama degree. This is a ruin of a movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is Predictable, from the beginning it is absolutely sure what will happen to all the characters and how to start the plot. Starting with a boring and non-peculiar start, due to its pathetic and slick appearance, each of the presence of this film is wasted, and a lot of talents created for this turkey are lost. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something you want to see something like a terribly thrall like a child, watch one of the Ilsa movies. At least they think about what they are doing to deal with. Something that has something terrible in the way of something like something that is something that is unpleasant or more specific is sometimes a miracle. The most challenging goals come together. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not interesting, and above all, it's not the sense of the word. I think it's a crime; It's a crime that is never thought to be such aggressive and inhospitable dustbin, and the resources created, and even more, that this tragedy is still defective by some misleading audiences. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The cheerful personality and jokes of the Elvira would not be the great excitement of this movie. Avoid at all costs.
