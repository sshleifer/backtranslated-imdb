The German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has not managed a lot of horror fans. Teuton Uwe Boll has been a colleague of the worst film horror ever made. <br /> <br /> Lommel is really Ed Wood. millennium new This movie is as damaging and appalling as the worst of EW's. I'm proud and embarrassed by what I saw, so that he was fascinated to determine the small bars. The answer is: groundwater; Lommel made a hole and buried it. <br /> <br /> The fun begins internationally with the cast of the nobility. Since someone who has lived in Los Angeles, as an actor or screenwriter for car mechanics, medical and mail, Lommel has so proudly found so many actors as his ridiculous conversation is ready to dispose of his face. <br /> <br /> The main character, a great police officer, is a German actor who plays a thick German accent. In addition to being a serial killer, LA is the oldest police officer. He stops the innocent driver and carries them into custody, then leads them to his home (that is, on the top floor of the furniture store), and he does everything in front of his new partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, attacking his ninja style in his accuser In a physically attacked manner. <br /> <br /> The sets are bad. The production designer's budget was apparently enough money for a painting tin; It's enough to paint 707 on the cardboard wall. <br/> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Mimbos and desperate women of the middle ages - and they set the standard uniforms of police, just like they should reasonably mention the sets, special effects, locations, or other production values ​​that were set for a few money. Unfortunately, they could not afford to pay a police car; Uniform police officers cross the streets at a merciless luxury. <br /> <br /> More than half of the story is based on the efforts of our reverse German LAPD officer and two young rookies. One of these young actresses is especially fascinated as the only actress with a fiery film made on a full-fledged career. The other one fits in well with rockabilly hairstyles and tortured Brando to see what this postpole should look like. <br /> <br /> The final episode of the movie is the title that gets its zombie, as our victims. The murderer was resurrected, when a girl who visited voodoo priests killed him, ordered him to put a spell on him. Do not ask why a Romanian girl is planning to kill voodooism, Lommel's logic is admitted and she enjoys an absurd outing. <br /> <br /> After stretching along the flat roof tombs. , zombie girls manage their appearance. They look like death earlier, perhaps more beautiful, black glamor makeup around the eyes terribly airbrushed. Like non-zombies, they look like a top-class model. <br /> <br /> At this time, Lommel warns the venerable birth for the generative note, Boll, and injects large amounts of Euro cursis. garbage techno soundtrack We are talking about the prehistoric Bumblebee electronic noise. The costumes could have been played on an Ibiza record that Lommel was still young enough to shake power. <br /> <br /> Unlike other zombies, Lommel's girls are normal and they work ... I mean, as they did. Before becoming a zombie. This allows our author to give us an opportunity to give him an opportunity to find out more about his or her golden conversation. Yes, it's a golden shower. <br /> <br /> I will not break anything by revealing the final excitement. I can say that everything coincides with that masterpiece. Ed Wood's spirit lives ... or I must say his geist.
