You know the story of "Hamlet". I do it <br /> <br /> Well, the "Be Be Not To Be" (not the same talk) has entered so many times on the ground, which is not very interesting (it was not so great to start). Actually, "Hamlet" is a good but very poor performance. It's not even Shakespeare's best: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo & Juliet" are ten times better, "Summer Night Dream" and "Othello" not far. "Macbeth (knock on the table, aside from the drawers, will change the puck, OW!)" Not bad. There are many others that are better than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I did not comment on the movies too much, but I will make MST3K a completely dreary episode. <br /> <br /> Okay. . . Mike and Bots earn a card game to select the movie. . . They ask "Hamlet," Pearl will send yadda yadda yadda. . . and never prepared the boring Sci-Fi MST3K section, I've never seen any CC. <br /> <br /> While watching this "Dr Zko bloodstream", this is a huge episode, because there is no movie, but rather randomized scenes combined (I recall Mike's "Future War": "maybe shorts, an anthology without movies "), SOL Crew fell a lot and well cracks. It can not be said here too. <br /> <br /> Riff blurs, host segments (as usual) are in the midst of best, and the movie itself (this is not bad) is really better. (I mean, as a quality movie, not as a camp, like "Space of Prince") than the MST3K version, you know that it must be a bad show. I laughed (the last time I saw it several months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times. I tried and tried to be entertained, but I could not. Line occasionally, "Good-bye Queen Dilbert's boss!" (And when it's the fun line in the section, yes, ahem) and occasionally, I mean ten minutes or so. I saw it the second time, I did not laugh even when it was fun for the first jokes, and I only gave it fifty minutes before. <br /> <br /> The movie is not horrible; It's just a German version of Hamlet. The actors are good enough, and although duplication is not the biggest, it is not a reason to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> "Hamlet" four stars; Three, either for the THREE MST3K version. <br /> <br /> PS: Why Why, MST3K!
