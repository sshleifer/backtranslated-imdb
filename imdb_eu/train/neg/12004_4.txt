"Salaam-e-Ishq" is a three-hour and twenty-minute running time trial, a beautiful and superfluous Indian Indian television series that offers us six stories of romantic love (at least four short stories in my opinion). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An MTV video clip and a Super Bowl commercial beer shot, exotic movies, fascinating colors, sexy showgirls, songs and dancing The high cover is a mash mash that is huge. Numbers, dreams and fantasy sequences, flawless character, honest conversation and comical shows - Bollywood's events are in many standard themes. It is a boring body that tries to dance all the characters in an unpleasant way. <br /> <br /> The viewer looks at this much - especially not all. Drop all the gorgeous women given, but you will need patience at work to cross it.
