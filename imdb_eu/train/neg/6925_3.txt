I feel much less with this movie. The portraiture of madness of this century is always quite curious to be a different species. Their plays are so incredible, to be completely fiction. Everyone is Napoleon or any other story; or they are fascinated with chicken. They are doing or are against each other. As the scriptwriter has said, what can I do to fix it, what madness or mental illness is. Check out the wonderful human portrait when "Kuku nest was over" where diseases are credible and real. I worked in a state headquarters in the state. I do not see anyone of these boys. These are very intelligent and can be a way of life to calculate.
