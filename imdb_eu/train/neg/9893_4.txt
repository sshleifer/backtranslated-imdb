I hope to see that no clown and historian is anything but "Cleopatra" or, if they do, they laugh. The film is more than just a gladiator, a well-written script that is articulated and adapted to historical flaws. Octavio, the Caesar's heir, is most visible in the Senate against the Assassination of Caesar: when he is 19 years old! <br /> <br /> In addition, the play is fabulous. Timothy Dalton has more than one James Bond suggestion, "Caesar Julio Julio." Billy Zane Marc Antony is a calm and dense. Leonor Varela attempts to make Pharaoil attractive (she did not look real in real life), but it is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> So this is a warning to historians - this movie is not a true life!
