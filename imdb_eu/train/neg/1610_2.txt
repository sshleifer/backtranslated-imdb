It seemed so strange to me about this movie - I saw a full 4-hour roadshow version, it's very inconvenient. Castro and Che, for a movie about a charismatic man 2, faced with a strained political struggle, there is almost no emotional feeling. Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (a second actor, with a bit of a voice, at least) do not play dramas or depths and, basically, they have dropped to Castro to Che: go here, go, do it and that What causes or causes the action without explanation. Odder is not yet an actor cast, who needs the power to play Joaquim de Almeida Castro, but he has abandoned it on the other side. second part These men and their followers become a strained film about movies that are not echoed or endangered by the tense or passion for fire, the movie, the bearded male beard, the echoes of the jungle and the filming. Many innovations that I have read, thanks to the work of Steven Soderbergh, have been almost completely discarded by almost all the actors. (Actually speaking about Soderbergh's movie camera, or more than actors, or with English subtitles in Spanish.) This is a must-have and extravaganza a) Soderbergh was the only gun hired. In addition to working as a film and b), he visits Che's visit to New York by taking part in the black and white non-neglected work of Oliver Stone's JFK. If you imagine it instead of the Reds Warren Beatty directed by Andrew McLaglen, you would see the dull ability of this movie.
