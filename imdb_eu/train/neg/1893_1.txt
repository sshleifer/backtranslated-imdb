This movie was very stupid when things started. I do not care about the characters; Susan Walters was so angry that the main actor (whose name he forgot) also got nerves. I can not remember how it ended, and so, but the whole idea of ​​foreigners with human bodies and everything that seemed stupid in this movie did not take things completely. My father told me that the movie was stupid ... I would listen.
