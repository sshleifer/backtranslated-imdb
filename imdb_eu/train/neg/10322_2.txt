If you want to be scandinavian or nice or both, you'll probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP is not really thinking about it, as well as stopping the strange habits of ordinary people. At the end of the second episode, I felt a bit embarrassed, I was sitting in the really created mix. <br /> <br /> Primarily, all the initial attention was covered with pride and beyond lies, this is just another. CBC is usually a smart, anti-septic and anti-septic commentary for making massive efforts in production. And once "LANDA-CANADA ROFLMAO LIVE MUSIC!" the hype generates its well-being, the show will continue in the eternal denial, because it is very superficial because it only judges its merits. <br /> <br /> If Muslims are not obsolete in the west and / or west. The smallest idiosyncrasies around the topic make me pleasant, I do not really see how LMOTP is pleasing to the curiosity created by it. Other shows have been better acquainted with the cultural / ethnic dichotomy in Western societies. LMOTP will never be placed between entertainment or ideas.
