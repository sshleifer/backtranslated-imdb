I watched this movie on TV and I have to admit it, though I was a bit surprised. Seeing an old section of Sesame Street was so much better that goofs, mixing and bad editing. Playing is fine, but please feel the "live video" feeling. The work team was a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the movie, but wait for ten minutes to hear the end. Believe, you will not say anything.
