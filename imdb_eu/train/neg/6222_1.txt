I'm not sure that users should allow me to review half the movies, but I'm afraid I did not take another minute. <br /> <br /> If you do not have a bad excuse for a movie If you do not have a GP, you have to turn around like a wheel in its grave, and I doubt that I will not doubt it. <br /> <br /> The excellent review mentioned above for a movie 'Parsons fans' does not add my feelings. How to dare to try something that is not able to deliver a second class director and writer. What did they think? Where do i start <br /> <br /> TEACHER: I will get a sliced ​​American slices. I received a poorly run slapstick, without any unfocused incident. Hippy ergel Check Crazy cops stupid? Check Excavative soil traces? Check Embarrassed women? Double check Do you miss out on the story you're trying to portray? Check it out. <br /> <br /> Little by little, what you see is what you see soap and not well-written. Scene with Knoxville. Scene girlfriend. The scene with Knoxville does not move much. Scene girlfriend, like last. And so ... <br /> <br /> CORRECTION: My friends and I decided to see it, that is, to see the bad passage of Quincy or the Duke of Hazzard, who was particularly poor. That was the wrong direction. Huge cuts, dramatic camera work, jokes and scenes scenes. God was honest. And then, the director was an Irishman and his most recent work is the BBC's Sunday night drama called Monarch of the Glen (trust me, it's the most convenient TV). And then, everything was reasonable ... <br /> <br /> EFFECTIVE: We are so critical that when deciding to decide on some random television, if it is not so bad, do you hate it, we apologize for its efforts? Knoxville JUST ABOUT exceeds each scene. Christina A. The poor guy is not lucky. Its performance is a car accident (with what you do with those lines but I do not know). "Hippy" knot: ah dear, dear, dear. Are not we moving from Cheech and Chong? <br /> <br /> I'd keep going, but I think that you get my drift. Like any other opinion I would say, nobody in this movie is clear about Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers or Gram solo solo work. They did not know anything about the American road movie, and they definitely do not want to start making a rock mythology story really good. This movie was superficial, it failed to explore anything and jaw was drillingly unfunny at the beginning ... o wait, I did not quite do it late. And I recommend you stay away too much.
