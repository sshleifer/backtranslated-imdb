Disney? What happened I really want the movie set in the 60's; It was like a book. Actually, I can make cheaper special effects for a specific adjustment to save your budget ... I am glad that someone might have read the books ... but, as with the Red Eyed Bender? And what about the volcano volume? Where is it in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! In the long run (1978) I heard that there was a European version of this film. I'm sure I write. I can only imagine that the real story would be closer than that inadequate adaptation. This movie must be Xd.
