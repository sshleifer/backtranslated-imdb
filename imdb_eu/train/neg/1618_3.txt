I watched this movie with the most positive expectations. I saw Jacquet's previous movie (penguins' march) and I heard a very positive radio show on the radio. However, I was very disappointed. Above all, this movie is very boring. Literally nothing happens. I tried to describe a movie about a friend, and we both ended up laughing, "Well, the toe, the winter, and then the spring, and then I have an eagle and a river and a little time. It's dark and the girl enters into a cave, and in the other one it has fox babies, "and so on. After half an hour, I began to sigh, silence, turn my eyes, curse my radio on the radio, and wait for it to end soon. But the movie went on and on. When it was over, I sank so much on the bench, looking at something like Stephen Hawking. The most dangerous part of the movie (a) Girls are, of course, the children they want to identify there. She wears the same clothes throughout the film (one year), and she shows exactly two facial expressions: joy and seriousness. It's nice, there's no question about that. However, a movie about beauty of nature like this could be done without a human presence. When it happened, I could find myself drowned or something horrible in the river. (b) The comments made to the adult voice for the girls are clear, boring, boring, and redundant. (c) Music, unfortunately does not have sharpness. When the girl is happily playing, the music will also jump. When an eagle threatens to become a threatening music. It reminded me of the beginning of the filmmaking days and it was foreseeable to enjoy it. Actually, many of the kids who watched the movie, of course, liked it, at least somehow participated. This way, my warnings are only for adults: if you have more than ten years, try this movie. You can get to sleep (and cheaper) in other places.
