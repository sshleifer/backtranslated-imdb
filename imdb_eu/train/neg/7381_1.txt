Well, first of all, Seagal's voice doubled as much as 50% of the movie ... Why? Apparently, they are shooting the script and the story, and they need to change their way of continuing their conversation, because there are several versions. Since the beginning, you only have to scratch your head, because you are not paying attention to excesses, but they do not make sense. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the story still sucks and does not make sense. When I reached the end, my mind came to me, because the movies were so absurd and the end was not meaningless. <br /> <br /> Avoid pestilence. This movie made me see live video games that I swore to seagal.
