This movie is fine, but definitely, the homosexual speaks "that's how they are," especially for a woman to leave the unhappy marriage and fall into another woman's arms. Almost Kate's genre preferences seem to change and this movie seems to be very simplistic. <br /> <br /> In addition, it has been unhappy with the films that try to promote an agenda. The characters in the film about questions or questions about gay themes were called "bigots". And there was not a wonderful half. Kate's friends and relatives were totally embraced or completely avoided. This is not a typical gay and gay relationship between relatives and friends. It is a mixture of emotions and values. It is possible to love and respect people, they do not necessarily make choices. Unfortunately, the movie was not one of these types of interaction. I was trying to imagine tolerance and acceptance of a movie, it seemed very tolerant to me. Later, at the end, Kate seems determined that she wants to be with Mac and that's all Dory Dory - what is being a gay being? Come on!
