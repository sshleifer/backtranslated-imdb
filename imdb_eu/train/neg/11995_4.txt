I was excited and I saw this movie when promotions were featured in November! It was impressive and the songs! I was very disappointed to see him! It is a movie that draws together 6 pairs. It has a group of 12 people! In this film they have worked on many stars. The director Nikhil Advani did not manage the situation and would not have thought that this could be a lot of people in this movie, which would make it easier for him. Nikhil's director, 'Kal Ho Naa Ho', falls behind 'Salaam-e-Ishq'. Nikhil I think it's a smaller star cast. I think the best factors in this film are songs! The songs are excellent and I think all the songs are wonderful, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy has done a great job and has done a great job over the years. I think the reviews of this movie are excellent songs! One thing I was disappointed, the director will not give me a nude film by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikes. I saw this very rude with my family! Although some of this comedy is naked, it's something you do not want to see with your parents! I think the best play was made by Salman and Priyanka in general, I think the movie is wonderful!
