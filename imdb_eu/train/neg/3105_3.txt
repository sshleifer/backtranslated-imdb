I can not believe how to make a comedy about the subject of the believer. Brooks, of course, does not make a homemade realm comedy. There is no mention of drugs, prostitution or violence in those streets. The people we know in this movie are homeless in fantasy land, so the only difference between us and ours is not as frequent as usual. Brooks's films have become worse and worse over the years. It is just another nail on the dumbbell.
