A family drama, that is, if parents explain their message to everyone. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: they feed on deer for one year and then kill their mother and die at the beginning. to punish themselves about taking responsibility for their actions. Bears and deer blame themselves for eating "eat poorly", they do not take responsibility for proper use of locks and fences, or even for animals to learn to shoot and survive twice as long as they are.
