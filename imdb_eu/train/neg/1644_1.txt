I have seen the worst movie I have ever seen. I thought the Final Action Hero could not be destroyed, but this makes it easy. Three single boys meet on Sundays to discuss their weekend breaks. The fourth guy, who was married and part of the team, explains what he and his wife do. There's nothing in this film. The jokes are not fun, but they are repeated over the whole movie. The big shot at the end of the movie is not dark. Avoid at all costs.
