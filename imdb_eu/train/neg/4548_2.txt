Boring. Little crust There is no character development. With this great book I entered into this movie. It could be a terrific movie. It's likely to become a classic cult. No, the bottom was huge. He was thrown out of evil and had extraordinary effects. It was difficult to determine which were bad: rebel or military or the church or all? I'm still confused with some of the movies. Some aspects of the so-called "prophecy" remain undoubtedly, and it's not really clear. In the science fiction channel I was watching a horrible episode of a mini-series. TV seemed like a movie. Ignore this movie. It's time and money to lose.
