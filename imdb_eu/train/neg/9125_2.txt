Being a young person is one of the fun things that can be easily deceived by publicity. I talked about it in another movie, where (comedy) seems more entertaining than the movie ad. When I saw the 1981 ad, I thought it would be a fun movie. I and I did not see my brother, I do not know if the scene used in the television ad was the last scene of the movie! <br /> <br /> Since this scene is the result of everything that came before the movie, I can not guess that it's just fun to use! Last scene thanks to a young potion, Dr. Fu Manchu starts with a long bearded man, a rock star that is as bright as Asian. (Moments with less than one!) Moments. The rest of the actors were sad and my brother and I both slept. When we expected the "Panther Pink" comedy, Peter Sellers was so great. <br /> <br /> It's a shame for her last movie before she died. Muppet Show's appearance was so fun that this flop wicked. However, I do not blame. Anyone else involved does not want to make a better movie about it. 2 star generous!
