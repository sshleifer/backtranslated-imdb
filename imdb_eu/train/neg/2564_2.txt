When I go to see the movies and I would like to see him or not, I would sleep, but this one was wrong, I actually got up and I'm out! ... This was not the script and put it. Together, I hate it. Also, Brendan Frasier could not get rid of it, it was much better. I was not as good as I expected, George Jungle 1 liked George, and the graphics were not as good as the first ones, such as the bird, and it never deteriorated in a tree. I hope that this director, and the next film, has to review ... horrible! I really would like Ursla to do a good job, because it's worth the movie (until I walked) ... I'll give this movie in general 10 out of 10
