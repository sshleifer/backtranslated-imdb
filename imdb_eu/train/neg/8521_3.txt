This turns it on the plot. Charlie Brown A Christmas Christmas is one of those classic timeless, Christmas value and only enjoying vacations. This, however, is not. Charlie Brown tries to catch the emotions of Christmas, there is also another Christmas theater, but the jokes and the simple ones fail. Charlie Brown is no longer wondering about the Christmas spirit, but she wants to buy a gift for Peggy Jean (25 $ gloves ... what?). Sally, her sister, is an annoying character of the movie. Here is one of his jokes: Sally writes a letter to Santa but does not know how to write Charlie (for some reason she must be in her letter), so she decides to nominate Sam, she knows how she knows. Sam wrote Similarly, Sally plays a theater theater in a daytime speech: "Hark!" Instead, he says hockey sticks. If Sally tells you 12 times (it seems completely the same thing) he will not kill you, nothing will be done. Peppermint Patty and Marcy are the main focus but they hardly improve. Marcy is fun with Patty's answers, but Patty is another story. He feels like a boy (he does not scare his rumors) and he feels foolish when he has to be sheep in the theater (awesome bass and everything). It seems that sheep are every year every year, and he is worried he will forget his lines (he did not have any lines). He is so worried that he mentions twice, next to each other, and he gets the same answer. I think it has to lose some short-term memory or something. Lucy and Linus are welcome (although Linus has some annoying advice), but it's hardly a lot of time to emit. I'm sure Schroeder does not have this. In short, he tries to be the parasite of the original, but he laughed to endanger a message.
