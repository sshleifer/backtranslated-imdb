This movie is the worst film of horror ever seen. And that's a lot to say, given that I've seen giants like Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane and Bloody Murder (close-up). However, I love horror films, and as you can tell me, this really stands out. Sometimes there's no more entertaining than a slasher movie. In this movie, the first scene that the fried fried woman is a woman is not affected in the movie, especially since the movie fails to say that the incident occurred prior to the 2-year movie. The play does not exist, and most of the camera movies are covered by Spanish women. The policeman I ever saw was the most monotonous police officer. The best / worst part of this movie, however, must be a murder weapon. A giant security pin! What did they think? Who is the killer? "Huggies" a shy employee? I would like to give this movie a zero overall, but I would not see it blown up
