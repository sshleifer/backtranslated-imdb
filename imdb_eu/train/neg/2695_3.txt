When I came to the video store, when I was confident about an IMDb movie, I had never seen a movie for 7.0 or more, when I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet, XX. One of the best directors of some of the best films of the century has made it really worst here, making one of the greatest filmmakers' mistakes: strangers with a movie and any real quality retrieval. > <br /> I like films with bad guys, but everyone who is obscure in nature has a little bit of light here; In addition, gray tones are darker or brighter than others. Mr. Lumet crossed this line with a completely unknown and almost non-masochistic character. <br /> <br /> The 30-year-old married to Ethan Hawke's Hank marriage is crying, immature and irresponsible. The wife that hates her and her wife, that is to say, the lover, that is to say, very. His unwillingness and willingness to leave people dirty, because he has too much cowardice, his bank robbery directly falls and his mother dies. When the movie is finished, at the head of his older brother, he is completely pathetic, rather than praiseworthy. Ethan Hawke plays his character well, but he does not work much, his face is depicted with a constantly sealed person, and he does not "pay special attention". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He speaks, his character's wife is too bad. He has warmed almost warmly from all the films' movies and has helped the child to grind out more money and more for their insults with self-esteem. Actually, he does all this character. Harpy's similar behavior is evil. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays father Charles, and Finney has been a great actor for many decades, spending 90% of this film with his own mouth. open up half grimac on his face, as the biggest challenge in the world's upheaval. For someone who is just like an actress, Mr. Finney, do you think he'd have more emotion. Although he does not show much, his character is supposed to be mourning and anger. And when Andy crushed the movie, it was similar to Dr. Frankenstein putting his monster out of his help. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < In an unhappy marriage to Andy and his close relationship with his brother for an unknown reason. When Andy's world begins uncontrollably, it abruptly breaks aboard, but it does not really make any selfish or self-serving in the film, but probably the most common sense. <br /> We have finally arrived to Andy, always by Philip Seymour Hoffman, the only reason I nominated this movie on 1/3. His adjunct heroine, who has been the director of the financial crisis, has been "stolen from crime" stolen from her parents' insured jewelery store. Disbelief and tragic is the decline of a misleading and insoluble homicide maniac. Hoffman's character has come to be the main movie film, but it is difficult for him to face the challenge of having an emotionally-cast brother and father who admitted to himself the poor early parents whose parents brought their son's psychosis and indirectly, intentionally murdered his mother. . <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie deserves to see the PSH's high-performance and family-run disaster nature. Do not expect a person worthy of not expecting, because it's not really.
