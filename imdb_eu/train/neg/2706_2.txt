Yes, people are racist. People are also racist at the university. That is good, and the problem of the breach has been dealt with several times in different films. Unlike the Higher Education Group at that time, it is considered to be a subject of racism every year and in the way it is planned, but it is also in the university. <br /> <br /> This movie is about this problem. Racism As Frankenstein addresses most of the problem, he overcomes you over and over again in a brutal and slow manner. Most of the characters are cartoons, one-dimensional, caricatured (feminist lesbian, male black angry), to react to situations that react as dramatically and as far as possible. In addition to challenging stereotypes, the movie is too much in them. Angry black men feel deceived, feminists hate men, etc. (Feminist also has a "Missing Men's Non-Violence" signal. I see what I mean?) I do not want to give anything, but if this movie seems to be a terrific loneliness or a data racer, it's likely that they will play the game Changing characters The changes that are obvious to everyone, but the people of the film. According to the great line of the country, the violent neo-Nazis decide how to be neo-Nazi violent. I think you just see what will happen. With this movie I have another problem that I suppose is "supposed" and "hardcore", but I did the Nazi bad. Ok, the Nazis are evil, but that's my opinion. Everyone thinks that the Nazis are bad; We are not breaking new ground here. The Nazis portrayed the bad guys since the 1930s. The film does not make any doubtful debate on any point. It deals with topics we all know, such as the conditioned school. Rape, racism and anti-Nazis is not a controversial topic, about a debate. <br /> <br /> A higher level of study, cartoons and stupidity. Avoid at all costs.
