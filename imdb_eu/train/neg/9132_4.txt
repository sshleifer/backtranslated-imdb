Dr. Fu Manchu's generosity is an injustice for Peter Sellers in the discovery of characters by Sax Rohmer to end the Sellers' career. The territory is very simplistic, and the way in which it was done could be handled properly, but it was poorly executed. This movie was not a good reason for the interview, it was a poor, laughing laugh, a noisy direction and a feeling that was somewhat incomplete. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, acting, it was the only thing that kept my interest during the mixed image. I did a brilliant portrait of Manchu's devil's work with Sellers, with lines that will be remembered from time to time. For example, there is no scene in Fu Manchu, which he supposes: "Ah, all of you look like me." I want to admit it, but I laughed at that line loudly. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, I caught my attention to some powerful assistants, similar to Helen Mirren, who was the keeper of David Tomilson's refuge. Sir Roger Avery (his latest film, not ending career), and Sid Ceasar (which renders the performance of the portrait of Al Capone's FBI). These characters also saw me. <br /> <br /> The set was also nice.
