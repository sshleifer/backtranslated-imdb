* Can it contain a spoiler type? * Crispin Glover's only mention is to send a bunch of geek to her pantyhose. George McFly has sealed his American milestone awareness of Back to the Future forever. Recently, Bartleby and Willard want to return to the unconscious. <br /> <br /> This time, however, Crispin has made a 76-minute short film. At times, he reminded me of genius, it almost completely harmed me, but not because of its content. Content? What is that? It's a movie, half of the movie all the actors have Down Syndrome, and so it feels freakshow. The other half of the film is Crispin Glover, Adam Parfrey, and a kind of brain palsy. All this he was trying to do with John Waters with Desperate Living, and at the same time he felt better and failed to feel bad. <br /> <br /> It also kills many actors with Down syndrome. It's about a snails guy and it's over. It also torments others' bundles and grasshoppers. She is in love with two girls, one of whom has sexual intercourse in a cemetery. It also falls with a friend that affects a friend. <br /> <br /> In a semi-middle set, Crispin Glover is the director of this show. It's like controlling the head of the man, and the type of cerebral palsy is like sexuality. Well, at least it's masturbating in explicit scenes. There are "awesome" fun, such as the Nazism Swarm, crossed by Shirley Temple, as well as juglares playing by Michael Jackson. killing snails and taunting other people. They dominated the rocks, and yet. Later he was sent to the minstrel after the trial. <br /> <br /> Inside, Crispin Glover continues to be the leader of his team, and everyone tries to control it, but fails. <br /> What is it? He has a lesser sense than Dr. Caligari, and has more than one stolen style. The claustrophobic mental space looks like the wall without Dr. Caligari's face seems to be claustrophobic. Also, the conversation was absurd. And, in general, it was wrapped in absurd figures of humor. <br /> <br /> The problem is in the movie about 20 minutes ... maybe a little more ... What is it? images are exhausted. For the next 56 minutes, we follow the same set of images, introducing new images through a show of absurd puppets. The film seems to be more than just a movie that tries to push movies roughly offensive and taboo. The audience tries to scatter and mix. But the problem is that it only has images for a 40-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Even worse than that, cinematography, design and everything else was very cheap and almost unbelievable. "Okay, that is, we can do this way and get it." It was not very interesting and it was quite boring. Dr. Caligari, on the other hand, had an amazing film and film. The difference between the two is quite surprising. <br /> <br /> Score: C
