Connie Hoffman is very nice and sometimes attractive topless. <br /> <br /> That's it, people. The only reason to consider this film or not. <br /> <br /> In the 70's, sexual exploitation pieces are sometimes entertained by their dating (flared pants, hairs, shoe mustaches, etc.). This is not. <br /> <br /> The script is a bad thing, the performance is bad, the direction is bad, and the elderly person is a bad idea of ​​being a romantic old man. <br /> <br /> A title comedy suggestion is a very misleading title. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend avoiding this type of pestilence by heart.
