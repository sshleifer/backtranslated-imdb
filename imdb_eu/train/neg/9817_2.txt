Wow ... bright shine. <br /> <br /> Become a thriller / suspense / horror comedy. <br /> <br /> Having seen this, I have never laughed in such a horror movie ... a ridiculous plot with 3 undeveloped characters, an undeveloped depth or too much depth. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a horror movie full of stupid conversations, mixed in the plot, for nothing. Characters are wasting bad sounds and bad development in general, then this is to be seen. <br /> <br /> Make sure that "food processor" in the classical scene and police research is completely ineffective. /> <br /> This has a low screen performance and low handwriting that makes you feel stupid, bold or courageous throughout the entire duration.
