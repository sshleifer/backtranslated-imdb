I've heard about that long movie and I have finally seen it. In 1963 and 1969 massive animators killed a camp boat was closed. Later, he arrived in 1982 and opens his former student, Bambi, with new recruits, including Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (Reinhold judge) and Sandy (Debralee Scott). One kills one by one killers, until one is left alone. Then we know who has done it and why. <br /> <br /> In the same way, the movie Tom Smothers makes a great conception as Canadian Mountie, and Paul Reubens plays Pee-Wee Herman Schtick. On the plot, in general, it's not very well developed, and quite lama, but some fun scenes, such as Pies House and strip poker scene, take place. At the end it seems to have been pulled together, it's a shame. <br /> <br /> In general, there are very little about ten or fifteen minutes, the rest can go on. Maybe caught on TV, but it's not worth it to buy.
