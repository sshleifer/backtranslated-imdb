While Bondarchu was not asked to work on this project while he was not a young man, he was still a beginner director, with a single single image, in order to adapt the short history of World War II. Bondarchu, of course, was a famous actor star in a decade, but his abilities were behind the camera, and he was able to make a large-scale production as a director. And in theatrical groups, which often shows a mixed film that is evident in a lot of camera positions, seems to have led to a huge number of agents that gave the director a different quality, because they seemed to be the magnitude of the agents that appeared. like radio broadcast ads. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Vidor's "War and Peace" was probably the main cause of this production by the Soviet Government. He made a joke on VIDS's URSS photo. Without a doubt, Bondarch wanted to emulate the greatest Hollywood film and find his own Audrey. His latest selection, Lyudmila Savelyeva, is dark and hairless, like Hepburn. Sadly, Kirov was a ballet dancer without performances or talent, so it is surprisingly the best word to describe his performance is "horrible". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < This proves that this will not happen. The revolutionary decision pushed away the thin top layer of Russian soil, as the War and Peace world grew, so that the great contributions of these prestigious Soviet actors involved in this production are as clear as Shakespeare's Americans. of course, American actors can not play Shakespeare's credibility, but I know what I mean if I'm part of the American adaptation of the Bristol team in Branagh's adaptations). Among the three main characters, Bondarchuk's Pierre is highly recommended, but even though he was old to this part and there was no place at the start.
