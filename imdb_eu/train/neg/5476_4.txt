I do not know if this is one of Syfy Channel's original movies, but that's it. A low-budget cheap budget, probably very fast, has a stirring effect, tears of conversation and a stellar brand name naming a darker star (children of 90210 are making funny TV movies). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ian Ziering plays with Cortes, who knows that in history he conquered the original people as an explorer, when he conquered parts of North America. Here he is not acting as a hero, nor as a man, but an opportunist confusion; his character would probably die if this was not based on a historical figure. In this story, Cortes makes a brief survey, trying to find something that proves worthwhile financing to continue exploring in America. He and his men have found a small tribe that had dinosaurs a week ago. <br /> <br /> The true hero of the storyline is the lieutenant Rios, that is, honorable, useful, and wise. In every situation, he faces the opposition with the Cortes, and knows well with the young and ambitious Aztec shaman. Of course, the original girl who supposes a powerful sham and a trumpet married Rios, raising his anger towards Spanish outsiders. So it's very topical. Dinosaurs are easily brought. Although it is being done in an open area, the story is in a pretty forest or Azteken village, although it is 95% of the time, so it's not so exciting. <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not know Ian Ziering. A sharp stone of Hague and a convinced accent, and somehow disappeared. It does not look like Spanish or Spanish for the second time, however, in all ways the casting selection is malfunctioning. If this film had been published in the theater, it would definitely have been nominated for a Razzie. <br /> <br /> Overall, unforgettable.
