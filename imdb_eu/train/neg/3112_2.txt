I will try to stop too many catastrophes. Usually I enjoy movies by Robin Williams, but this is not one of these. The suspect was billed as a thriller. It was just night-time listener. To be exciting, 6 people attended the opening day of the theater, 2 went out for good reason. The film was, in my opinion, written and directed. The play was fine but there was not something to work on again. This is a story that reads a good book that reads a good movie that dies. However, * enter scary here * no one can check the existence of children. Thus, Williams goes to Wisconsin to try and find the author, but all this makes the head of the boy's headache and excuses. There is not that, that's all. Wait for an hour and a half and the movie ends. She was sensitive and terrifying as the visit to the Dentist office. Homosexual tone or cement had nothing to do with the story, and the film was somewhat cheeky, but there was no reason and no sense. As a result, I can not write a review about this movie, because there was nothing, the color was as attractive as the dry. I gave him 2, it was worth playing because he did not direct Uwe Bolle.
