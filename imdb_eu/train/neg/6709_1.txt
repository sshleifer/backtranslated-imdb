I am easily entertained. I enjoyed "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and many of their descendants, although most people find it unbearable. I also enjoyed most of Pauly Shore's films. I know it's a bad thing to say that there's only one movie ... and that's it. Since I saw it a bit, I remember thinking that it was sitting in the theater: "This is a dumb movie. Why did I see that?" Honestly I can not recommend the only movie.
