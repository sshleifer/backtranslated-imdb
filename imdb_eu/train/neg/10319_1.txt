Unlike many, I do not attack his or her premises in lesser ways. However, its execution is another thing. Like B-minus movies, it seems that all the gag have come in the door. In 22 minutes or more, we're sitting on the front of the crowd with everyone's mood. Or at least not let something remote or count on carpet fibers. A couple of exceptions are horrible acting; Some comic excessive gestures and gestures can be adjusted well with night-time commercial innovation, but it's not the first comment (though a Canadian one). Despite being the original angle of culture, I can not help, that is, I think that, above all, I apologize for the CBC shot for Corner Gas to succeed. Unfortunately, rumors and scripts were completely wrong in cells. The last insult seems to be that they can not work in a real small town in a place (why are they so hard in Saskatchewan?) Did they think the public center would be misled by the outside of Regina? As a Canadian proud, I hope this thing will soon disappear and the rest of the world made by CBC publicists forget the terrible shame of a sitcom.
