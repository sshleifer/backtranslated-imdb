Simply, I found the "Mash" TV show, preaching, regular "correct", repetitive, pretentious, and the greatest sin of all. And that's it? It's so dull. Alan Alda is the main ("star"), he and his wisdom so much in love, I am even sorry to try and try through a passage. The original series were McLean Stevson and Wayne Rogers, whom I accepted happy and stylish in the presentation of their character. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan, and Mike Farrell, together with composers and composers, like Wonder Bread, like Caviar and Ostra are eating together. Loretta Swit also found it sad, she did not need to hesitate, and Gary Burghoff, who was good at the movie, was tired and performing in the show. When I saw an exhibition every year, it showed me. Jamie Farr just had a "comedy" brow and here it is not worth mentioning here. The reason I did not give a rating, anyone who now reads, would ask, any type of valuation is not merely a subjective call, but a relative one. TVs, except for a few exceptions, are very serious. This is quite literal, Mash had the quality of the time and today's production (according to television standards) and, therefore, it is worthwhile. Rob Ritter
