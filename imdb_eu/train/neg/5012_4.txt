I saw this movie because of the rocks of Amber Benson and Nick Stahl is very nice in general. I like that and any movie that respects it has not been bad. In that sense, I was right - given the interview they provided, they both do well. It's not enough to absorb the movie, you understand it, but it's enough to get it done for 75 minutes of the movie (which is the main sign of a horrible movie: in 40 minutes we already pray to overcome it). <br /> <br /> It is difficult to start "Taboo" problems. The conversation, as you say, is horrible; wood and completely unnatural. January Jones's performance is very bad, and since most of the time is the character that follows the house, this mistake is undeniable. The plot gets so confusing that it does not make sense at the same time, as it can be fully predicted (literally, one of the main 'twists' in this movie would surprise no one). Apart from several interesting shots, the director tries very hard on the wrong success, the wrong tracking and the noisy camera, the story of the little one that focuses on the story. <br /> <br /> There are three of the stars in this movie. It has Amber Benson, and the latter has been honored for the reasons that caused me to do some joke. In no case would I ever recommend this movie to anyone. Avoid at all costs.
