This movie is never one of the most impressive examples of propaganda ever produced. The disease is a persistent pathological equation of the Jews, and it becomes even worse in a short period of time <br /> <br /> by repetition. This raw thing works well, even <br /> <br /> briefly, the subject of the objects itself. You need to have a strong stomach and get it right, and I will not recommend it unless you try to get it right.
