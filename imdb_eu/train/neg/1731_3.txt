Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology, similar to Star Trek. That's why there are many lovers of the show, who believe that each time they were the winners. They get 10 individual shows and they can not evaluate the show objectively. For this reason, I have reviewed all the passages of the original Star Trek a bit (good and bad), since the overall ratings and opinions were very positive. Now, in Twilight Zone it is also necessary to do the same. <br /> <br /> While I've got so many episodes 10, this gets 3 because it's bad. The writing was in fact bad. In a large war two people in the opposite party are seen throughout the passage. Soon afterwards, it seems to be the only two people left in the Earth, as you learn completely as completely stupid and completely convincing. In the end, at the end of the tour, he makes excellent passages - he has killed him!
