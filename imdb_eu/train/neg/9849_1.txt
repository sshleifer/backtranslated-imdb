This is one of the worst films ever I've ever seen. It's bad, even in TV Movie standard levels. The plot does not have a diabolical defect and the famous names in this movie are wasted in confused and uncertain characters. I do not know the director managed to keep this excuse for a movie - it's bad. As a "horror horror thriller", it's definitely terrifying. There's nothing exciting about it. And he could do psychological harm! The opening opening scene had this promise - whether it's just one aspect of the brain, but all the following self-crash challenges do not believe. No matter how hard you try, characters are less important. There are so many ideas thrown down by the collapse of Chinese philosophers, the bad movie, Brain Dead! <br /> <br /> I bought more than 300 movies on the DVD. , and this is the first one to get my money back. STEER CLEAR.
