I got a copy of this movie, thinking that "Zombie Bloodbath" was one of the alternative titles in 1964. In film mode, this film has a better score than the aforementioned titles; This means that the other is really bad! This movie is also bad; Of course, if you do not want to enter the movie called "Zombie Bloodbath" and you want to see a masterpiece, it will appear directly under the title screen ... but it's very old and tired. This does not help stupid acts and stupid lines. You only have your average nuclear emission that makes people zombies and so on. The film begins with a melting sequence that brings a lot more to know; low quality zombie rubbish There is a lot of gore in the film, and it's a real job, otherwise the movie was very boring. Zombie Bloodbath seems to be really cheap, and inexperienced filmmakers gathered clearly! The main influence seemed to be the high level of the Romero's dead. However, it could be something like zombies and gore. However, everything that is usually foreseen and that ends in any sense is reduced, and in general I can not say I was surprised!
