The main error of the movie is scripeless. Bettiek reconstructs the story Banner and Klaw shorts. While Klaw Replays is well done, it is not necessary to recreate near. Although Richards is not an amazing actor on the page, he generally does a decent job. And sometimes, it has a great similarity to Bettie. It should be noted that the attention to detail is great. Good attire and clothing, like some directives. The sets are generally in-depth and feel like stage-y, but feel at the time. Sometimes it is surprisingly illuminated, and the palette of colors has clearly been thought of by giving an overall look, a passionate and retro feeling.
