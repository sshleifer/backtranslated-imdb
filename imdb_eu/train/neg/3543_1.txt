You were hiding about a couple of years ago. I have never changed before posting it here, so perhaps this movie deserves a star for that, but without a doubt. I saw it on the DVD, I lost it in the movies for illness and I did not see it until now. I did not read about it, I definitely did not think about it for a few months. The friends got it in the store, so he saw it. <br /> <br /> Bad mistake. <br /> <br /> The shooter I mentioned above is at the top. trailer and poster. Previously, Jason Statham has hair. GR as in another movie. Or any movie that I saw JS. At least in quantities shown here. In socks, Ray Liotta should be warned in advance. It's terrifying and fun, but there's no ha-ha-humor in a way. Its more in the way of almost-The-Office-but-a little-mutated-and-so-fail-sort-humor. Everyone says the same thing: "This movie is not like anything you expect from this movie." <br /> <br /> Now, I've been expecting this movie, according to the wide-ranging experience of the previous broad-band movie. little things You like: <br /> <br /> () Consistent, <br /> <br /> () Interesting or attractive, <br /> <br /> () It is not a full and completely drawn fiber, <br / <br /> <br /> () It is much more important than the "mischievous beasts" that are more than just a standard mystical ideological center, which is "a misguided standard ideological art". > <br /> () Fortunately, better than "The Idiots". <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed my tones, it has failed to check in any top box. Instead, it was: <br /> <br /> (x) edited incorrectly during the {rhythm shop, the 70s jump-high-style jump cuts, incomprehensible "plot winds !!!" I'll be delivered by flashback hackneyed mountings ...}, <br /> <br /> (x) It shot it like a 14-year-old fortress weekend weekend with Truffaut and Godard watching. Drapes drawn <br /> <br /> (x) So, just behind the head behind the "I am very smart, for me" motive or message, it just makes sure to repeat every 20 minutes that the audience is silent (that is, they do not like it all of them) assure that they get the point <br /> <br /> (x) the real residue of my time. <br /> <br /> Some people have a "doubtful" ability to "get" something from that. I'm glad. A poster told me something he said: under-25s probably understood it better because of the edition. Maybe editing means your work is made more accessible, not less. Just like the "Genius Light" brigade you know, you need to suckle and grow onions. There is nothing more imaginative and insoluble than another person who does not know what art is wonderful, because they do not understand "author /" works / materials / the moon's cycle. poet / artist / palm reader / idiot savant is using his 'view / scheme / high-risk dog disease'. <br /> <br /> For me and many, a lot more people, their rubbish. <br /> <br /> Movies, art, stories, poetry, are considered to be a fervent and moving thing designed to see other humans. In some directions it is metaphorical, spiritual, emotional or personal. <br /> <br /> The only way I had time to move forward was two hours near my inevitable. "The biggest trick ever got out of this Philosophy. It was in every thing. <br /> <br /> Now, please, take my loafe away.
