This movie should never be done. Honestly, I have to admit that before I saw it, I had serious doubts. The director is not an excellent actor, even if he has made a lot of films in Holland, and the youngest woman who has played a leading role in TV-personality is the smile that is constantly and not much self-criticism. I have seen recently the main actor I have seen in the Bride Flight magazine and although this film was better, it did not convince me. To start the story, I do not read the novel on the basis, but the script under the movie is likely to be able to perform on a rainy Sunday afternoon with a birthday party. the director who wants to see the good movie. It was really disturbing about conversations, then a great voice was heard. My mind goes to the cameraman, at least trying to do something. It's a pity that the movie has not been released, otherwise some scenes were more believable.
