Others commented on the "decline" of Tobe Hooper, but about Brad Dourif? He was able to select good projects (as he demonstrated that he was the protagonist of "Exorcist III" the same year), so why did he show that he was? Of course, it gives a good performance and the movie is not quite bad; It's just not invasive, interesting, and unpleasant. There are three "excesses". (* 1/2)
