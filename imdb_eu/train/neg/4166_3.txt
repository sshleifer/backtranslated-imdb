Wasting time ... This movie is not a comedy, it's not drama, it's not love ... nor even the youngest comedy !!! The story ... should be the end of the end ... but so disappointing! When I finish finishing the movies, I hope that the movie will be a better movie ("Fight Club"), but this overcoming makes the movie worse ... I see the comedy of teens, and I do not. Do not do that often, I hope to joke lies and a lot of anguish. .. jokes are bad and there is no nuance ... You just got ... I must admit that I look very ... girls, and ... that's it! And he has completely dressed the whole movie! The day is a bad day ... like a serious soap ... Do not waste your time! There are ports with a better story and performance! <br /> <br /> (Sorry for my bad English)
