Fantastic, it's just awesome. My theory proves "star power". This is a type of television that is a great TV (Battlestar) that is titanic, this guy is the same type that directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chicken. B O R I N G. <br /> <br /> Find a thousand times more interesting, if you do not watch TV, without any images or sounds. 1/10 (b / c so high I rated no negative score on the rating system.) <br /> <br /> -Zaphoid <br /> <br /> PS: My theory of "power of the star" It is about: the more you use the "stronger star" show, the show is weaker. (The best quality 1 / "star strength" is called a proportional indirect, better quality "sp" less, etc. To see another way, "it's no less") <br /> <br /> - Z
