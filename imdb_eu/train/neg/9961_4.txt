Both Amelia and Michael are married couple who cheat together. She loves Amelia for a long time and does not hire a prostitute who satisfies her. Both disbelieve their infidelities, but eventually connect with each other. <br /> <br /> It is not a specific short. Direction is direct and dramatic, good, acting is honest, but the story leaves a bit of desire. Why exactly do we care about these two people? It's a bit difficult to see this story coming from any other infidelity stories, it's much smaller and does not make sense (unless you're a welcoming rhythm, if it's the case). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know, it is possible that I have never been connected to these stories. But I realized that blocking these narratives is the same thing, that is, while the couple is talking to each other while being busy in the journals and avoiding eye contact, the nice things in some shorts are a bit more room. I want to see something different and different. <br /> <br /> --ParisDiB
