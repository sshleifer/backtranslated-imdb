The back cover of the DVD (lost when it's lost) is a "A Triumph" (New York Post) and "Mesmerizing" (Newsweek) hated by Hitler. <br /> <br /> No matter the Post, but really, whoever ever wrote this word in the same period of Newsweek, peace, art, should be released. <br /> <br /> I do not know where to start. Why did not Hitler's evil image exist with colors? He was ill, but now his character is historically unknown (compared to animal lovers, compared to the gentle way of dealing with women and tightness) and so on. <br /> <br /> Actors are good, so you have to feel them for them, you have to jail within their dimensional characters. With Peter O 'Toole here is a curse type: this is the second time of honor of his career when he misses the old and empty leader of the film that has failed (or, in this case, television production, to be precise). The first was the legendary Galigula, of course. <br /> <br /> Historically incorrect scenes should only contain 1000 words that the IMDb supports. That's why I think I'll leave here. <br /> <br /> This is ok if you are on the TV and you do not need to do something else, but believe us, it's the best on the shelf of your virtual store.
