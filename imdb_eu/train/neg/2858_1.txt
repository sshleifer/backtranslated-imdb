It must be one of the worst movies of all time. The graphics were awful, the b-movie feature and the effects were Nintendo 64 complex. Do you think they were trying hard for a while? Of course, Scifi channel is a movie, so you're expecting a low rate, but it's a cake. Hell, I still laugh. So it's not shaken in the unexpected movie, that's fine. <br /> <br /> Although it seems that actors and actors are familiar, it is difficult for me not to believe that the quality of this film is worth its time and effort. <br /> <br /> You may have good graphics in the early 60's or early 70's, but let's move on, this is 2009! I will not give disasters, let's just say that you played "Jurassic Park" in the Nintendo 64 that you have seen in this movie are very popular <br /> <br /> It's definitely not worth 2 hours. he sat by that thing
