How does Scottish love the love in a purple crest? Very, very careful. Now, I was born in Scotland, I have a great deal of advantage to being born in Scotland. Too much Americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously. It's a joke, people, "good four legs ... two bad legs" as Orwell had. Jessica Lange has stressed that Wells would be the result of the production of "Brigadoon" in the "next Brigadeon". Liam Neeson - seemingly famous lady among them - has a toy wandering at the Waverley train in Edinburgh before leaving Grandmam the Great train with all the authority of a man. And Auld Enemy? Where would it be that Scots do not hate and blame them all? Rothe, Cox and Hurt should be ashamed of their inclusion in racist stereotypes. "Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves" seems to be a masterpiece of historical accuracy. And at least Alan Rickman was fun.
