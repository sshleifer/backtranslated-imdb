<br /> <br /> Any action to take into account. In 2000, if the Caucasians and African-Americans continue to be the rumors of the feelings of Georgia, as is shown in this film, of course, there is a lot of people back in their attitudes. It's at least hypocritical, Hoy Berry, Whoopie Goldberg, Beyonc√©, Noemi Campbell, Denzel Washington, Will Smith, and. At the rear, there are racial breakdowns on the back. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the grandmother's daughter gets her black child's impetus to get together with her grandfather in a very blue water society. This story is sweet, it does not make sense to be tragic, and although most of these types of television films can be predicted, if you guess the final scene ............? Is not it ....... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands offers her honest surrender in her typical style, and Louis Gossette is right for her; Little Penny Bae happily does not steal the show. <br /> <br /> A "pleasant" way of relaxing after Sunday afternoon, without too much effort, even having a small juice. in the middle.
