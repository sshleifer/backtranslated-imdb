Please note, I only saw my friends and the movie with the title. It's nice, though clearly in the plot and in the direction - you know where the movie is in the first five minutes. With the plot my main language is that they remain consistent in a sustainable way, they never explain many things behind the characters. Alcoholic dad, mother, sister, sister-in-law ... the family is bad, but the occasional mention of the sister is not a resolution. I also mixed the scene with bottles ... it seemed pretty random. <br /> <br /> Writing is a second concern ... the children did not have bad actors, but they left their screenplay a lot. you want. Unfortunately, the special effect of the niche movie could have been set aside, a single script and a clear script.
