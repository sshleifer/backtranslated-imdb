Actually, it's not a horrible movie, and Glenn and Keitel are the encounters. Also, they work very well with very weak scriptwriters. The landscape is lush and the plot has some interesting atmospheres. Also, I understand why the actors and crew were shot. They are professionals and they pay for it. But I wonder why the studio spend time and money on a movie, and then they do not publish it to the audience of the theater? Despite being a flop in the movie, he earns money. If you're a fan of Keitel or Glenn, I've rented a video or TV, just like I did. As I'm saying, the movie does not solve the Mexican immigration problem, but the experience is much better than 90%. Today's television rate.
