I waited for a while to play this movie. The film based on the book "The Christmas Box", based on Richard Paul Evans, assuming that it would be similar to "The Christmas Box". I have sent numerous emails to friends and family to see this show so we can better understand a small amount of my "new life". After seeing this movie, I was so disappointed. In November of 2003, he lost his only child and was really a pain, and I expected that this film is thought by parents as "thinking", when a parent understands that a child has lost. This film was very lighthearted and the parents of Diane Keaton buried their faces buried their child. It was unrealistic to start from the beginning. After making a few calls, each call is the same, "That was so much it was released and it appeared that you are returning to the road for a short time and listening to the song on the radio and returning to life" What is the bullfight! It's clear that the director and Keaton never lost a child, since they never had such a huge movie. I think Hollywood.
