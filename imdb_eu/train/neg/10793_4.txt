I watched this film at the 2005 Toronto Film Festival. Based on the novel by Brian Aldiss, the author of the science fiction novel, he tries to tell Tom and Barry Howe's story to get his family together with a family businessman and set up a rock band. /> Almost deliberately miserable, the movie is also half exaggerated (if he pardons his pardon). By mixing genres, styles and modes, the director (the previous film Manchako Lost was a great documentary) lost quite quickly. I was never sure if to take everything seriously or not. Flashbacks, the sequences of dreams, were much less. Also, the promise of rock and roll just moved me. With Hedwig and Angry Inch sometimes I remembered too much, a movie that was original and moving. But in this case, the songs were not good, and the main characters did not feel good either. An analogous comparison would be similar to Velvet Goldmine.
