I was interested in seeing this movie because it was based on Christianity. The director had good ideas / intentions when making this film, but it could be better. I understand why feelings of the greatest love of his life would still be felt. However, I did not understand why the director made his friendship, mediation and violence. The main character asked his friends for forgiveness, when they were for him. They did not understand anything and God used it as a motive for explaining their behavior. The main character, nor did anyone know that the old girlfriend was divorced or not, still married, and so on, but they resolved the old feelings that were to be faced. His friends were supposed to be Christians and their decision was agreed upon or not. We do it several times when we do not make things in the past when we do not forgive, and when we try to do it, they all oppose us. Unfortunately, when he was looking for an old friend who was accused of his new friend, he had a strange thing to keep his name, address and phone number ... It seemed Stalker. ! There was no friend at all, he only looked at himself. God is love ... and I think that God wants people to be together with people and that the film has made an incredible injustice that God does not care about true love ... you are going to go for a bad chance. We all do mistakes ... it's about making changes. As I said, there was a potential movie, but I was tired of the constant recurring vision and the spectators were shocked by the "good meaning" of the spectators. This movie does not seem true to Christian love, but I gave it an effort.
