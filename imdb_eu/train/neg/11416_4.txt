The movie that wants to get the most successful movie in the history of cinema is that they shook my head! It's true, but at the same time wonderful. The Swiss arm movement can be much better. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting at the beginning: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) has forced the military to absolve her military training, marrying her love with Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter). <br /> <br /> The way in which one way of playing is not true, it is not true that only a few employees who drink and steal. Melanie Winiger plays Michelle Bluntschi with a strong role, I've personally found it wrong. <br /> <br /> The story has a comedy combined with comedy, which does not work as expected. Religious pieces are too trashy, and the comedy section is not fun, it's just cheap and it's not the whole movie. Pre-deceased children between 12 and 13 are fun, but not for those who are looking for a fun comedy. It's a weak mood except for some shots. <br /> <br /> Dope? Cool! In robbers? Cool! If you want the right comedy about the Swiss RS, make sure your military training is not acquitted, and then you do not expect too much! <br /> <br /> I will give you 10 star stars. Marco Rima is very fun because of the time of her screen. There's not a lot of time on the screen
