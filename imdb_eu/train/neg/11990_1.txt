I would give this movie a zero. Cheesy effects and acting. The only reason to see this movie is to see what's wrong. First of all, we started off with kids Brian. Geek what! I could not believe the sauce! Then he spoke. I can not keep the movie silent, but anyway. Yes, of course, he had to be skinny-dipping, something I did not want to see. Jared, however, yielded a great deal of performance compared to the special effects department. From birth to crash, I had something to do with myself, it's better. Without a doubt, Gary Paulsen had nothing to do with production, no doubt that the movie was not called Hatchet. In the end, I do not think that the writer had ever read the book, that nothing happened. I think it was a great book, but the movie was as dirty as a goat!
