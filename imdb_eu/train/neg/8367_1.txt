This movie, because I can not call a movie, can be summarized as: <br /> <br /> -If the black crime with stereotyped black is in trouble -But black wants to be a baby. Fully developed adult face, body hair and genitals -Black makes a mistake (in other words) a woman who wants a baby -White black, who makes physical and sexual violence more than people who see what they peel, and do more crimes - Wait happy <br /> <br /> Honestly, even if it was not correct, it was a good satire, out of such talented wild beasts.
