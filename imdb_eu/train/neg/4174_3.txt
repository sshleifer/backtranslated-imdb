Whoo-boy, that's definitely the worst thing I've seen all summer. When it was on, it was in Sci Fi, and I do not see a lot of Sci Fi, but I can talk about men, a thin line on a plot and two-dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotyped and excessive. The plot and the setting were incredible, the vampire was less scary, it seemed more fun, it was useless, the special effects were so diminishing and ending? Well, the only thing that was not planned on the end was suddenly becoming a tomboy lesbian and the vampire with the female, which means that it is not so hot for about three seconds. You are closer to "What the hell?" then "the man is hot". If it is repeated again, let God not, DO NOT SEE.
