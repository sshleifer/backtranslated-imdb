The basic plot of this movie is not bad. He makes great ladies and returns his courage to his soul. But despite the release of Robert Young and Eve Arden, the movie is wrong. I blame him for going to Crawford or the director, or both, because his performance is horrible. Instead of being a real person, he plays a wonderful performance of a deer caught in lanterns. In other words, he observes in space and expresses "curiously." In a few minutes it was annoying to me. Now, he definitely does not like the Crawford movie of his Crawford movie, more than he has done - in JOHNNY GUITAR or in many subsequent films, such as BERSER! My advice is to make another Crawford movie, it's definitely better.
