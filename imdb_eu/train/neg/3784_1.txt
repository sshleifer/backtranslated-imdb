Oliver Stone, Brian DePalma, Al Pacino, and Michelle Pfiefer make a monumental piece of cinematic junk. It's very nice to see people so rich and 'successful' in one of the most unforgettable and unlucky poets of all time. This movie is the worst of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> What is this? Is it based on a true story? Well, they start with some basic news that was read in today's US. But then the movie goes into a fantasy world and the Cuban refugee will be in US drug sub-biology. Rocky cocaine is like it. Is Cuba a Cuban movie? In my life I do not think a single Cuban in this film. The accents are completely false, and the mother of Antonio seems to present the middle American scene. The whole scene is something out of Dick Van Dyke's show. A movie about Miami? Looks like L.A. in Florida. Later on, a palm is a palm tree. Is this a love novel? The relationship between Pacino and Pfeiffer is so evident that they can not interact with each other, and there is no such relationship between them. Is this drug movie? Well, no mention of obsession or addiction. The behavior of the actors following a string line did not have to drink more water. It's true that the play is awful. <br /> <br /> Let's go to the rest. It's a favorite music and a Latin elevator or a show by Lawrence Welk. I heard a polka Camera's work is wrong and it has a brain that is more effective than ever. It is clear that the budget of the photos was excessive. The sound is bright in many places and it seems that the conversation is in a warehouse. Writing is awesome This is one of those films that writes the script itself. You drag each other into a separate part of the conversation, each of which drives land as a brick sack. A series of drama could be together for two and a half hours. A series of drama has at least one focus. Perhaps poorly interpreted scenes are just engraved together. Regardless of whether it's a movie or not, it's just that.
