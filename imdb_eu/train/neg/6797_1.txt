What can you say about a rugged and ill-timed 16 mm stem film, the most attractive and attractive performer of a German shepherd? Nothing would be positive. Avoid this furtion at all costs. In any case, it would be difficult to find out, because bestiality was the subject of taboo in the U.S. and illegal. I suggest that the IMDb visits his valuation formula for valuation implementation because the score score for this piece of faux is absurd! I have not, in any way, been able to spend much time in the classical films of the 70s and 80s; But this is a lower product, even more unlawful (standard) illegal standards.
