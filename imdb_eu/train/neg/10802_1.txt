Let's say a very short movie: Max is rotten and rough, with a radio called Kazaam Max: a rap. Like all geniuses, he gives him three wishes, but, being good, Max helps him with his personal life, because he needs to confuse rude and fatherly organized crime. Throughout all, Kazaam occasionally raps (Shaq's raptured rap skills also known). <br /> <br /> This film proves what we know: athletes need sports. I admit I do not look at the Oscar film, but all the waste of this film is horrible. They are not characters that are neither stupid nor stupid; Plots are not worth mentioning, the conversation is a joke, and it's only a quarter of Shaq's problem. Unfortunately, even though Denzel Washington played Kazaam, the movie would still be a joke. I know the movie was just drawn, because Shaq was so big (they did not know at the time). I can not honestly think of the only positive thing to say about this lost time. Shaq used to make this movie a bit so he could put on free boots.
