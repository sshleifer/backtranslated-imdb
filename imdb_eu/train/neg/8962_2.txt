I think this was frozen, because it left the cube and gave us a lot of information about why and why it came from. The original CUBE never left the cube and left all the imagination. This badly feast gives you everything. and I did not like it ... Despite the strong repertoire, I think this was because the reason for this was because other people than ORIGINAL filmmakers did, Vincenzo Natali believed that this prequel, or even the rhythm, would be better thought, and that it would be more truthful. So I recommend you to stay away, far away from them, and HYPERCUBE, the other movie I do not want to discuss ... (I gave it to perform only 2)
