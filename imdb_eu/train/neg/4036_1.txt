Go, this word is almost poor and there is no conviction, but again, most people would struggle to continue to be the script with such pure inspiration. The conversation really does not flow, and sometimes in this case it is less (or should be). This is also protected through strange scenes (for example, the cemetery movement), because you think it's going to take place somewhere, but it would seem that a few seconds of your life would be lost more. I am convinced that the combination of gangster / sit comedy that seemed to me to be a good idea, but if someone has to be honest with the scriptwriter, here it was. <br /> <br /> Well, it's Martin Freeman but I think it's always a character that plays, so I'm going to give a script or react normally. <br /> <br /> Finally - humor. This reminds me of 'Python (I think) about his comedy about Shakespeare - if it were funny, he would put a joke. Well, I did not see one. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time - I saw it with a friend, I expected it would improve. <br /> <br> /> It is not.
