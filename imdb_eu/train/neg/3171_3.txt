Is this the biggest movie I've ever seen? Is not the worst? No <br /> <br /> Being four children, it's nice and fun to watch something. It was very good, but it was nice. <br /> <br /> I think the improvement was tremendous, but it has been tried. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this movie is worthy of extreme or not the abuse of another reviewer. Eva Longoria does not care. I think it was better than Sentinel. I think movies are an opinion. Actors play a big role as a hit or a flop. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the cast did not work. Maybe a lot of things happened. <br /> <br /> I wanted to talk about other movies, not horrible. It could only be a chick flick. Similar to Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband still talks about them. :)
