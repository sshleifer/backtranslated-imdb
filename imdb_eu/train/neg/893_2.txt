When I bought this DVD: "I think that comedy is a light and enjoyable love in Portugal's standards? Let's give it a chance?" I was totally wrong! What a funny movie! First of all, it's not a comedy; The drama is cheap, so it's so melodramatic that it is much worse than Portuguese portraits! Second, the plot is so boring and is it not anywhere? Does not structure, like wind, in one direction or another? Production is bad! Sound mix is ​​awesome, sometimes voices are offline. Did they remind me of the old Portuguese films of the 80s? Should the operation be better too? In short, it's not like improving films in Portuguese with this one! In fact, it was the worst Portuguese film ever seen in recent years! Bad argument, performance, bad production ?? I did not have much hope for this movie, but it seemed to me much worse than ever! Forget it!
