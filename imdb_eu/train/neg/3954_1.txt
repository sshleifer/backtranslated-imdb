THE TOTAL VIDEO The first flashbacks of Boogeyman are incomprehensible, as well as the footage of Brainwaves in Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love. It's today's (90's early anyway) footage is boring, poorly played and cheaply drawn. The film almost completely returns the movies, repeating the same flashbacks that are repeated throughout the movie. So you see repeated footage, if you have not seen it anymore. The originals were not bad enough. I have never seen a movie ... Someone was playing the final dollar from those movies. Total escape. And talk about the filler ... why should I type 10 lines in the trash? If I transmit this junk in two lines, it should be enough.
