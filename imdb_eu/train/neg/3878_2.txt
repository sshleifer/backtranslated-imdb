"Astronuat Lurrera Earth, a plot that is back in the 1950s, that would not allow humans to travel outside the Earth's orbit to mutational monster and to use this first film," was a wonderful science-fiction movie to use the idea of ​​THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT argument. So, from the beginning, the idea of ​​being a redundant return on the plot. The unfortunate VIEWING THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN seems to be the smallest problem in the fields <br /> <br /> First of all, it's a very bad movie. The budget is in a single figure and I'm not talking about a dollar. It's not a film to talk about and it's everybody's a lie. For example, it takes a photographer (it's hardly a legal one) for a photo session. The sun is cut directly to a cut behind the pattern and the cut of the sun behind the photographer is cut and the sun is cut to the pattern ... <br /> <br /> There is no need to quote the movie to other aspects. According to curiosities, the quote was so low and the producers achieved any footage of Saturn, so an astronaut Steve West mentions that the beautiful appearance of Saturn makes the footage of the sun. Actually, the sun shows a great performance in the film, because the human actors do not use pornography. When I appeared in this, I would not be afraid of horror monsters. The other cast would be terrified. Maybe we would be a little sorry, even if there is a lack of budget that appears as things that agents should wear clothes. For example, a general does not wear the uniform of her elegant outfits. She wears denim clothing and baseball. <br /> <br /> He's not supposed to be suspended by such movies, but he fails. at all levels Early in the ring, Mr. Melty, a nurse dies and escapes from the hospital. Instead of making a police call, he said he had been murdered as Dr Nelson decided to pursue his own patient as he sought out his missing cat. It is also strange that a deadly homicide monster can walk unnoticed on the road, but this is a typical 70-year-old movie that stops their cars crashing their roads quickly and while the public tells women about their pregnancy. Police have a loose monster. <br /> <br /> A large-sized garment is Z MARKETS. Certainly, I can understand why people enjoy this movie, "Because it's so bad, it's good", but Rick Baker is sometimes a great effect, it's just a pleasure to blame.
