If I did not have to see it for work reasons, I would not have gone through the first 10 minutes. And then I also forward it quickly through the sections. The '63 movie version was great in every aspect. Yes, I read this faithful to the original play, but it was wise to change the script's writers' 63! It's long, it's dragged, songs that are in this version, and not in the movie version, they are boring and non-imaginative. In the version "Kids", in '63, it was a very funny and real humor that was a real classic of sarcasm. In this version, Kim is too old, Conrad is absolutely awesome to see * (when someone tears the shirt, when I was condemned ... the director of this version does not know what sexya is). This Conrad does not dance, can not sing (he can not tune in) and it's just repulsive. As Elvis Presley really did, he went through his career. As for the other actors, I continued to dance as Alexander ducked out, and Daly finished it just like Mommy. See the performance of the Stapleton movie version to see the role that has been performed successfully by someone who knows comic time. This television version is not a complete waste in anyone's life.
