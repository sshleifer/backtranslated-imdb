The word can not describe this movie as completely bitter. It's a series of random and non-clips, which gets rid of a dangerous stupid Batman, who gets an old dead woman (real alarming). Underground Comedy Movie is remotely fun to watch the best actor to watch Joey Buttafuoco. The NC-17 is also rated, the only one that can handle it.
