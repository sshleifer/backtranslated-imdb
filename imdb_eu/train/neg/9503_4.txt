In another way, also known as the "Exorcism House", this short film <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ a> <br /> <br /> <br> Sommer European Tourism <br /> <br /> With European tourists, Telly Savalas has taken the European tourism, like the devil <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> in a cool squad. Sommer gives a stroll to the <br /> <br /> mysterious house of the country <br /> <br /> <br /> Butler's house. There, it's like a long dead, and the real <br /> <br /> xabier theater theater begins. The blind matriarch of the husband's wife <br /> <br /> his husband and wife had a close relationship with the dead woman, the father of the son of matriarch's son. A pair of Sommer's career? <br /> <br /> Well, the woman gives her driver a "back seat driving <br /> <br /> lesson" and her husband knows and does not care. . Eventually, <br /> <br /> most are cast, Sommer drug is raped, <br /> <br /> escapes and the viewer is driven to the climax. br /> statement ... that is, it could look like pure plays <br /> <br /> this thing. <br /> <br /> In this version, the "Exorcism house", </ br> <br /> add added with a priest. <br /> <br /> <br /> A copy of this VHS, from Elite Entertainment, is crystal clear and <br /> <br /> envelope. After the final credits, there are "extraordinary" ones. erased sex <br /> <br /> and silence writing. <br /> <br /> Mario Bava's direction is angry and angry, but his script is horrible. The ideas are baked, abandoned drawings, and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> which is something that is not encouraging. <br /> <br /> You have life on practical funerals, blind matriarchs do not blind this <br /> <br /> and Savalas gives them the same "Kojak" () who <br /> <br /> <br /> Does it go back, baby?). <br /> <br /> It seems that the project star was double, and then <br /> <br /> wrote a script, something. It happens every day in Hollywood <br /> <br /> with the occurrence. Savalas seems utterly lost, he has delivered his <br /> <br /> lines and his character "The Dirty <br /> <br /> a dozen" did not want to die. Sommer goes through and cries and upsets a lot, but <br /> <br /> his character is empty, I use the word "character" to be lax. <br /> <br /> The only thing we know about is the name. <br /> <br /> It's a really weird movie and your reaction can be: <br /> <br /> How much are Eurohorror and Kojak. I can not recommend <br /> <br /> "Lisa and the Devil". <br /> <br /> This is not calculated, and includes all the extras at the end of VHS <br /> <br /> copy physical violence, sexual violence, strong <br /> <br /> gore, high levels of female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, and <br /> <br /> adult status.
