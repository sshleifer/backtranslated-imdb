An old man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse. She catches her, or something is emptied. It quickly becomes bad and it covers a certain amount of white larvae in the hospital. The effort to revive a period of time creates blood covers. <br /> <br /> Police are in the hospital, because his partner is playing badly in a shot. In some way, the police come in with a female doctor, as well as an entomologist. There are some young children who walk through the hospital, I suppose they are admirable, but they are very annoying. They walk through the room they walk through where they stay, and throw a growth hormone. The logic of horror movies would say it deserves to die for the following reasons, but they are never in danger. <br /> <br /> The critter begins to grow and grow. People get away from it, and sometimes, for some reason. The hospital includes military personnel, if you need it, they are ready to destroy everything. <br /> <br /> There is no really credible character in the film, and most people seem to be looking around the monster. It was boring. It's clear he owes something to the Alien films, given that the monster is part of a human being and the stages of growth. There is also a character called Bishop, and the main actor has Sigourney Weaver's hair.
