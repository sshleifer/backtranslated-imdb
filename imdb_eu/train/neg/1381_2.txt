Smooth decorations here. I'm dying of this movie so I do not have to watch it. <br /> <br /> Jet Li's films come in two categories: Shaolin's contemporary films and contemporary Hong Kong films are made up of organizations like Triad or Triad. Each genre has its best and worst movies. "Twin Warriors" is Jet Li's best-known Shaolin era, "The Evil Cult" is the worst. 'Legenda Fist' is the latest 'best time' in the movie Jet Li. Certainly, it's called 'Black Mask'. <br /> <br /> He received an injection that saw Jet Li, a self-exiled mercenary, gave him superhuman ability but reduced his life. In exile, he plays a "pacifist" new life as a librarian. When he rips his former mercenary groups, Jet Li becomes intelligent. Crispy cartoon makes a stupid mask, as a librarian to hide the identity of the police (and public), as well as conceals its true identity to the members of the army. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was dubbed, and that's why. Why does Jet Li capture and kidnap the library's colleagues when he is kidnapped? Is there a love story among them? Why does the police chief not care when Black Mask recognizes the true identity of personality? Land is a DAD. It seems like a superhero-like variety, when the characters are ever developing, in poor character interaction, I'm totally interested in a story that is half-way. <br /> <br /> Action action and martial arts sequence is on top. There are many blood, gore (split body parts), explosions and Matrix style superhuman martial arts fiascos movie. Unfortunately, this is the best selling film and the only one. If you want to play Jet Mas in the supermarket, it will be delivered on a Mission Impossible movie by `Black Mask '. Jet Li is a real disappointment to other fans. This is Jet Li's not one of those films ever made by Jet Li: he does not have the chance to charm his charisma, or even the impressive and realistic ability of martial arts. <br /> <br /> Normally, Ozzy Osbourne's Chinese challenge would be enough for me to get into a movie, unfortunately it was the exception of the 'Black Mask' rule. In fact, the antagonists of this movie, dresses, long straight hair and sunglasses of the brand-stained Cup seem like modern and old Ozzy Osbourne. However, the criminals are not worth the time on the screen. I suppose that Ozzy's appearance was deliberate; In addition to being an evil appearance, he also hid Satanic. Ozzy Osbourne could do much more with villain gimmick! If he had been a writer, director or ANYONE, he wanted to develop and develop the character of the evil arch of the film! <br /> <br /> `The Black Mask 'was shot in the first Jet Li movie in the US after the deadly Weapon after 4, and I'm glad I stopped by now. It's possible that Jet Li's entire perception ruined me as a martial artist and actress. If you want to see the worst Jet Li, rent `Black Mask 'and' The Evil Cult 'and perform two functions or horrors, deliberately and involuntarily. Otherwise, take them to the moves that Jet Li's talents use, and think of plots that are acceptable. 3/9 star.
