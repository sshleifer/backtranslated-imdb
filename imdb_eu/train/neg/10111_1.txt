Awesome play, bad story, cheesy make-up, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. I never saw a worse film in my life, I decided to move forward 5 minutes before I could see if anything had happened. It's not. (Except for a nice breast shot) The film was apparently filmed in the furniture store, and the warehouse itself used at least 90% of the sets. You see the same red chair as "locations" in at least one office building and at least renting an apartment in several movies, or any storage that will rekindle all of your actor's conversations. (Producer notice) Small offices and one-month apartments are much cheaper than a whole warehouse, and both are quite adaptable and credible) If you spend your money on renting people, you'll get a return guarantee ... you will be refunded ... $ I only spent 2.99 I rented and extracted at night.
