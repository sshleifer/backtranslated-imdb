I'm surprised how much the "real" comment on this show is. Maybe I will not go into the same universe, if Veronica Mars has something, it's a great way to go. <br /> <br /> The impact chews the landscape with great enthusiasm and the plots would guide the holes with a truck. This is not what I call genuine. <br /> <br /> It is so important to be "important", as Rob Thomas and his staff just show the reality of the incision. <br /> <br> </ p> <p> Overall, I found it much worse than the rest of the party and the worst part. Kristen Bell seems to be a good actress, but it's hard to tell her the style of the show.
