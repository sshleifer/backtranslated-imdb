This movie is very bad, you can not imagine it. The play is awful, even worse than in third-grade TV shows. It's a shame that this movie was the most successful in the last 20 years in Switzerland. The interaction between soldiers did not make any sense. This story could be drawn from a bold photo story, conversations were woody shrubs, and plots were larger than the middle black holes in our galaxy. Today, however, it does not satisfy enough. They were also beautiful actors, such as the former Swiss Miss, and the main character (Woah!) And, definitely, a great deal of abuse of drugs. Real man! Especially in adolescence between 12 and 13 years old. They were allowed to discard the movie that did not create an atmosphere created by the media, because they were manipulating the dynamics of the teams, if you are a nerd who goes to another 'sheep' and you say it. I was exactly what I was in the army / that is, exactly what I will do when I go to the army, to all the cheaty actions related to drugs and freshness. And I do not think I like the army. I was there and I hated it, but this movie is worse than the dishwasher that is worse than cleaning your teeth (because I owe it to the lieutenant), it is not necessary to have a sophisticated film. Sometimes you're just entertained for a few hours and just want to forget about the problems and I do not think it's bad. But what movies make adolescents much more influential in adolescence when they show a fresh lifestyle, they are just stupid and they make strangers, unhealthy and self-centered. But now my opinion is not very well known, now I'm going to be relaxed and we recommend that you avoid any horrible film without movies and for that purpose! <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
