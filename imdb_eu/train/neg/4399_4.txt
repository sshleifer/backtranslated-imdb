"Tapeheads," a fun-filled, funny video of music videos, a perfect comedy could be short, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly absent in chaos. Los Angeles's two-half security guard patrons take video games, video aces, groups, parties and death to their company, It is very bad that filmmakers had to devise the dark sidewalks (a sneaky politician and no hindrance to his neighbors, if they did not take the first wave of the film, sending the music culture late-80s). However, Cusack and Robbins create a couple of original here: nerd but loose, smart street and dessert, boys are in the same length of waves and never fall apart. It's a real companion comedy. * 1/2 ****
