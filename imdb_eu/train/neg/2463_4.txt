I do not know how to describe this movie. In the end, it's one of the most curious films I've ever seen. Sometimes it's really awful, but it's boring in other places. The scenes of torture are very elaborate and can be attracted to anyone who enters gore and sparsely. In some of the aforementioned scenes I held my teeth. The thing about the movie is that it is our fears and, therefore, the dentist is very unbalanced. <br /> <br /> The humor of the movie is hidden and maybe nobody knows it. But if you're a fan of curious and curious entertainment, if your teeth get drilled, it's just the movie you're looking for. Give it a try! <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (maybe it may be very rare for my liking)
