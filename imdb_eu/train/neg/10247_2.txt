This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, it's horrible. Christopher Lee is good, but almost not in it, it's a good part of the only opening scene. <br /> <br /> Do not deceive the title. The movie "End of the World" is a bad thing, I saw that it was so bad at the end, only for those who die for hard-hitting fans.
