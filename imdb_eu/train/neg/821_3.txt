Stanley Kramer directs a thriller of action and has left two key things: actions and emotions. DOMAIN PRINCIPLE Gene Hackman presents a prisoner from prison, to perform a mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert and Eli Wallach are their agents - they think they work for the government, but, as in the plot of the film, they are never clear. Hackman's ENVIRONMENT INSTITUTE never responds that the movie is nowhere. While trying to make night moves and perils like minds, DOMINATE PRINCIPLES confuses ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film is very well photographed but also against it. Kramer's direction is without any style. The movie is very sunny! <br /> <br /> The Hackman is in a good performance, it's not a bad thing. Widmark and Wallach play badly and Albert is a lie in Widmark. The usual evil Mickey Rooney is also a good Hackman assistant. A curiosity, however, is caused by Candice Bergen's wife Hackman. He tells us that he has spent time in jail and seems to want to put a southern twang. Kramer encourages the trailer to become a landfill. This idea is to make it look like ugly brown. Valerie Perrin or Susan Tyrell's favorite is a better feature.
