H.B. In the seventies, Halick's classic movie is horrible. With Vanishing Point, Gone in 60 Seconds is a must-have movie car. It takes the original Remake and puts it in its head. Halicki left 75% behind the car and 25% for the theater, 25% in GISS 2000, and 75% against the car. Cage as a super man, saves his brother, kisses the girl. MTV changes, tits and ass. Save your money, rent the original. Halicki, at least, did not live to see his baby (he was written, produced, directed, and starred in film 74).
