Basically, I crossed the movie but it was enough to see it on the plot. Actually, it was boring and in some places there was no sense. I only saw the first movie CHACE CRAWFORD !!! It's hot, but this movie was strange for her. But still hot. <br /> <br /> <br /> Although <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I think the plot is not bad, but it really was like every single sentence that was thrown out of me. Is it difficult to express your anger every time F tells you to say? The decision was annoying and all the vibrant camera gave me a headache. <br /> <br /> With everything, though it was well on the plot, the movie seemed to be boring and dramatic. That's why I cut the scenes of CHACE. LOL In any case, it is not worth renting unless you are a fan of a specific member like your cast. Yes, it was hot. The girls were hot !!! But CHACE IS THE BEST!
