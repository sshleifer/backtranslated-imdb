Literally, all aspects of this low-budget film are included in categories classified by their predecessors, contemporaries, and followers. You can expect special effects bad, bad stories, hilarious amounts of blood and red, annoying and senseless blood. The "Sabretooth's Attack" is about a new holiday establishment, driven by the owners of Smilodon's cats engineering. Cats escape and they start dying; The show wants to keep the guy and warn him about silent visitors, and there are some workers who damage the visitors and the rebels. <br /> <br /> The sensible special effects are based on an average achievement of the film's budget. Sabretooths are represented by poor CGI. It is surprising, however, that cats have a more realistic look, far more far and more precise than a CGI better hidden plane. Their attacks are bloody and painful. As you expect, they attack, they break their arms and legs, and they leave behind. This is part of the reason that goes down the poverty of cinema. <br /> <br /> They are as terrific as plots and characters. We have some kindergartens that arrive at the university and organize a hunter. And take it very, very seriously. Refusal of private property, handling and stealing security systems. Why do they take a simple game so seriously? Have I Missed Something? Was the money involved? Or were they sent for that? I do not know, I could hardly keep the movie going. But it seemed to me that they were doing it to make fun. However, they went too far to normal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < it's cheap Most of the audience will get tears, it may be appealing to some, and will laugh and laugh. Note that this is not a comedy, it's a horror movie cheap. So, it will not be comical.
