It was a horrible part of Horror Masters. It seems, Mr. Carpenter has to learn one or two things in the intermediate and acceptable dialogue. Sometimes I cried out on TV that something would happen. He thinks he accidentally puts it, but Carpenter must cut off his (or son's) musical backdrop of too much simplification, and take some action forward. How many times did the girl say: "No, I'm not this baby!" and "O, is it not here"? Carpenter makes films much better (Assault on Precinct 13 and The Thing), and here it casts them as a recognition and value for their trademark style. Here's a real suspense and energy. It's like going through the process of filmmaking during the night. <br /> <br /> Trying to get better Carpenter movies and go for real classics: Gauza, Halloween and Bizi. To get better masterpieces in horror episodes, check out my personal favorites: Family, Jenifer and Dreams in the Witch House.
