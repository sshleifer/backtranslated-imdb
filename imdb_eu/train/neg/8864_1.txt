After seeing this, Christopher Leer lost a bit of respect (as time progresses). This movie was a junk. First, they tried to regain the final "Howling" at the end of the day, with very bad make-up. After all, they tried to make them a sad excuse for porn movie men! Plots suck and the whole movie is wonderful! One of the first men in the movie is the victim's brother (they look like being Dee Wallace Stone), Lee and another woman to destroy the rough team, Sybil Danning. all the time. <br /> <br /> This is not even worth the rent (if you do not want your time and money to be naked). Try to catch the cables. So, it would be split up, it really makes sense.
