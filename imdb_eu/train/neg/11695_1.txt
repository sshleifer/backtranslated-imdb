It's like calling "Thinner" movies like Earth or Pauly Shore's un-Talent. There's no news, but that's what people got to know. <br /> <br /> In regards to this film ... The book was good, although it was a minor result of other stories. "Be careful what you want" genre. Burke plays an abuse lawyer who kills gypsy daughters and is damned by his father (from Constantine television "222") to a few kilograms per day. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's a good start, but why does the mafia (Mantegna) entail? Why fire take so much automatic weapon? Why do FX become so much a dependency? I thought it would be much more effective when I had a lot of weight loss, illness, death, gypsy, and, among other things, the fine effects of severe death. <br /> <br /> But no, it will not be. Remember, we're talking with Stephen King. <br /> <br /> And the end ... almost the same as the book, but a bit too much. In fact, all the films speak too much, they have to explain all the land to reach us. I did not expect "The Dead Zone", but I still could not do it without the "Pet Sematary". <br /> <br /> Try at least half a decent make-up for a star. However, the rest of the movie must be left ... saying with me ... "The fastest".
