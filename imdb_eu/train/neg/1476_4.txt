This huge sword formula and film is a good way to show John Woo's talents. Cinematography is excellent, and the work of some swords is remarkable. Unfortunately, the film works under the burdensome story and low budget (check out the dirt scenes, if I doubt). However, it is worthwhile to watch, especially in the way of catching up on ATMs.
