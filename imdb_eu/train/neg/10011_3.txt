This film is about a male escort that participated in a study that killed a man's wife's circle. <br /> <br /> I thought that "Walker" was exciting and vibrant, but I was wrong. The rhythm is slow and slow, after 40 minutes of the film, nothing happens. Seriously, the first hours can be condensed in ten minutes. That's slow. <br /> <br /> Because it lacks emotions or action scenes, it gets bored. It is almost emotional that both the plot scene and the emotion are empty. Maybe it's a tough upper-level social class? <br /> <br /> Sad "Walker" becomes a confusion even though it is very sad. Blame in a bad plot and even worse.
