I totally hate the movie. It was so delayed. There must be some interpretive lessons ... no, wait, this does not help because the Naked Brothers Band is postponing. Do you know why I am here, although I am a Naked Brothers Band? When the NBB did not get any money, the NBB could not get any money, so they can not delay other amateur idiom songs, go to any person and write it within 10 seconds. The song lyrics are not only translated, they sing badly. Okay, the movie came out here ..... in all ways, it was boring and it was a terrible behavior. It's NOT any fun, though they really tried hard. I think that seems to be worthy of some ... well, the movie is not worth your time. Check the score. The movie (and the series) is very painful for those who have half the brain. Seriously, if you like it, it is best to watch the movie actors acting really, that they do not get rid of their lines in a monotonous way. I'm at my school's theater club and some people are really better than Nat and Alex. Hurry up too late! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece of poopie. I do not know why I went to the HALF in that movie too. I do not think the movie is worth it too ...
