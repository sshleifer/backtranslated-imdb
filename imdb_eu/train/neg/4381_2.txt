As far as harassment is concerned, this is one of the five worst movies ever seen. <br /> <br /> They did not try. The writing was honest with some elements of structure, good cast, good performance. I do not know where it went wrong, but it's wrong. <br /> <br /> Some elements may be a bad structure and not an essential story; when it is better maintained), management and bad editing. I had enough for about an hour, removing half and a half my hair, and it was very distressed for a minute and a half. There was no shame about everyone, I found someone who was the heroine addicted. He was disturbed, that he had nothing good to glamor. Thirty-year-old junkie was in love with a pretty 17-year-old girl who was fortunate. <br /> <br /> And the lead character was hard enough to deviate. The structure was an attempt at the wrong points of land, but the final results were startling and constant (with different time lines). The characters were colorful, but they were not endless, which I felt to be of high quality actors, just for the actors you have not seen enough. <br /> <br /> Skip it. I thought it was his first target, because he enjoyed himself, but he has done it before. Bad ideas for me and others I think someone who will give you money.
