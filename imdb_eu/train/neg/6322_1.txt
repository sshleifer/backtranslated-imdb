It has been between STUPIDEST and PREACHIEST anti-nuclear films in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> A child and a basketball star have the idea that "the world may change" is quite limited, the "peace for children" and "celebrity protests" and the ARE. <br /> <br /> But the Soviet Union thought it was consensual in deciding to disarm nuclear, because some young people learned in a "silent protest". The West is stupid. <br /> <br /> What happened at the end of the Cold War? Too hard for America, I ventured the "Reaganesque" attitude and socialism internal failures. There was no peace march, "die-ins" or "Amazing Grace & Chuck", "Miracle Mile" or "Testament" movies.
