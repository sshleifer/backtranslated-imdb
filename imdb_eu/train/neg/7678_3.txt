This is wrong, the classic Bimalda Parineeta is a poor remake. The story is based on the Sarat Chandra in the same name and is a distortion of the original. Well, a creative level can be estimated, but it is not a fake creative. The performance of all people is damaged and the movie is fake. Shekar's father gives Lolita (Balan) an opportunity to speak outrageously cheaper and confusing and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again, the scene that Shekhar (Saif) carves Lolita is quite important with the flow of films and characters; The senses are pretty much liked and easily avoided. Similarly, the sex scenes of Saif and Balan are quite inappropriate in attracting movies and audiences. When creative work destroys the original and does not destroy the spirit, the job falls. The song "Piyu bole" is pretty good. Another silver cover in the dark mist of this movie is Saif's self-defending and rebellious against his father. The origin's output is positive and it is worthwhile. In these numbers, the movie is worth 3 stars. Rekha's song and artificial dance is made up of clothes. The song is a melody, but I remember that they've heard it somewhere and I'm not mistaken that it is plagiarized. <br /> <br /> Well, the agreed hours have changed so far. But, then, this movie is not the reflection of modern times. <br /> <br /> This is how modern Bollywood filmmakers are becoming increasingly obsessed with the NRI's impression and the NRI entertainment market. These films are not in India or anywhere else in the world.
