T.Z. Post, a university professor, receives a fake letter that has inherited approximately 750,000 dollars. Now, with financial resources, he saves his life for $ 4,000, and he will eventually go out and live. After receiving the baggage he has received from Chicago, he will meet with a group of colleagues, and it is enough to put on a Broadway show. Exhibition tonight, Post Prof. the poor must hide from their creditors, Pansy's girlfriend and Elozor, and floozy to resolve the relationship between diva, and still have to keep the show going. After seeing a lot of silent Keaton gems, it rests, but I felt it could be much worse. Support teams During, Todd, & Selwyn are sometimes very annoying, but they're still fun. Before Charlie Chan Toler is just as frustrating as showmaker. 90% of the script is poorly written by MGMs for poor male Marx Bros. which is trying to pass as a film, because many of the visuals that are falling from the beginning of sight blur. The film that had been in trouble at that time in Keaton was just a sad moment in the life of Buster. Rating- 3.
