The hole in this movie is just too much to be enjoyable and so much of Hollywood's strangest look, out of context, goes beyond the Hollywood context (this is not a spoiler, you never guess how it ends). <br /> <br /> You must also be bold, in a kind of tone that is politically correct. The conflicts between white and black were very thought and supportive. I did not understand why the authors could act in a good way for the local black community to be racist? <br /> <br /> Real movie bizkaia. Look at the holes in the plot if you are really angry and would like to discuss all the things that happened or maybe you did not suppose. <br /> <br /> But filming and acting is good.
