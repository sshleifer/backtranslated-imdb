The first few minutes of "The Bodyguard" do not have a fascinating charm: it opens with a Bible brawl (Pulp Fiction's recital recounting victims' victims), continues with a two-carat school. New York teachers discuss the eternal question of mankind (who is better? Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), And then Chiba appears to play herself; He immediately stops flying an airplane and two hands breaks a bottle. Unfortunately, the value of entertainment, whether deliberate or unwanted, will soon destroy the unbalanced story, lack of action for a long time and the bad quality of an actual action. To make it so easy, that's why "The Bodyguard" is a permanent movie: <br /> <br /> 1) You do not know what's wrong. <br /> <br /> 2) There are just fights. <br /> <br /> 3) The battles in it are short and horrified. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Lee is gorgeous, her face is glorious. For them I only give a star "The Bodyguard" 2. This movie feels 87 minutes for 5 hours.
