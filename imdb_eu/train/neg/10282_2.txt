I did not expect the movie to be excellent, but I did not expect it to be so horrible. I hated so many channels I hated my mother's nature. I went back, I expected that it was just part of the movie, but not. And when the daughter is sitting, she will take you to embarrass or almost at work, or be mad at her house? Are you kidding? He respected me (and even he was afraid) in my home (but I was even scared) but proved to be the case in my closest hotel to my house. In short, I would follow some rules of my mother's house. <br /> <br /> I did not buy. I tried to give it a try, I really did. I'm sorry.
