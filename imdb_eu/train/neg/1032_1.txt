I have never been a fan of Scooby-Doo (as a result of the tremendous value of production), but Shakespeare is like the pieces that Hanna-Barber has brought us. Without a doubt, Scrappy-Doo is the most annoying and horrible character created by children (Teletubbies and Tommy the Tapeworm). What was a brilliant idea to create a short mutant dog and talk to Scooby-Doo when he was riding on the characters? Anyone who dies or deserves to see this show (I think it's better to die). The bottom line is that the bad dog does not create any problems, it's annoying and rolls - and this is only in the best episodes! After many years, it would be better to finish the franchise than to create this mess! I look at why Scrappy-Doo is a horrifying Scooby-Doo live movie - everyone is almost hated!
