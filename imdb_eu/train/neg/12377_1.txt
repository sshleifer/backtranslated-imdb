Since someone is under 10, it does not mean they are stupid. If your child likes this movie, it's better to try it. I am constantly impressed by the fact that people can participate in something that is so bad. This "movie" is a showcase of digital witch and NOT EVERYONE. Writing is awesome I can not remember when I heard a bad conversation. The songs are unfortunate. The play is a sub-score, but then the actors have not given much. Who chose Joey Fatone to work? He can not sing and is as ugly as sin. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is obvious. They would like the writers to be as stupid as possible. Great children's films are full of evil, intelligent and intelligent. In recent years, they are films like Shrek and Toy Story, Willie Wonka and The Witches, to name two of the past. When it's falling more in America, it's just like finding Nemo (well, that's it), the Red Hood Riding Hood is like the last round of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and the red-eyed red trash.
