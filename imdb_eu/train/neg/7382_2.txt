Well, let's say, I've been a fan of Steven's seaman and I'm very good at his films, but that's just beyond the rest. I think they're very stupid I did not like everything. I do not like the main reason because it is very wrong and it does not make sense to me. The performance is very bad, although Steven Margal does not do a good performance. I can see other actors because they are playing video clips directly. It does not follow a straight story, everything happens, why it does not make sense. It's hardly any action or action to get a good movie, it usually needs action. Special effects are very bad and you can say that they are fake. That's why all the worst movie, if you do not want to watch a movie by Steven Seagal, is not rented. So try this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ** outside ********* <br /> <br /> * outside *****
