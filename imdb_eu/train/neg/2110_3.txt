Now I love Bela Lugosi, I'm not a bad guy, he's one of the most interesting people who has ever made a movie, but he's definitely the owner of his films. This is just one of them. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays Dr. Lorenz, a physician who has received medical reasons for his unexplained reasons. However, he makes experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful. He showed that he was still 70-80 years old in the middle of the 50s, so why did he get married with this old woman? <br /> <br /> However, these treatments or experiments forced the wife of the altar wife to give them a sweet aroma with a married woman. Then Lugosi and his companions send them to a bunch of bodies and they are transported to his laboratory and they are stored in some catatonic animations or situations suspended there. Then the stolen wives have a needle. somewhere in their body, perhaps in the neck, and then the needle enters the needle to return the body of the wife of Lugosi to the young and the beauty. We can never see where Lugosi is doing the needle or what wives he does but who has recovered his wife. The old man is sorry that Lugosia screams. The wife screams a lot until her younger situation returns. The only thing about this movie in Lugosi's entry into the lab is ... the strange old man and his two sons deformed ... he's a big son. Lumpy, slow-looking fellow who likes snoozing wives fondle and other little son dwarf ... is a bit of a person to be politically correct in today's world. At night, these three just accumulate and sleep in Lugosi's sad. bottom lab Who are these, and how were Lugosi's awesome contributors, like many things in this movie, ever described. <br /> <br /> So, however, the female reporter is given his gruff task. to find out where the stolen wives are. It has been quickly discovered that the usual routine of all the stolen wives is strange. That's why he asks, and it is said that the well-known orchestra is a well-known expert around the world. This expert is terribly lucky for Dr. Lorenz. Hurry up and break his awesome house. I'm not sure where they are in the police station but they were cleared by journalists. dirty work <br /> <br /> Lugosi film always seems to have something like a plot of land, it means that the whole thing has been bent down into the sky. They kidnap an orchid of celebrities in a world by brides. Does he know that the orchid has been created? FROM OH! <br /> <br /> And then later on, it is revealed that young girls do not even have to work on the bride to work on the procedure, so why did Lugosi kidnap her from church-based caretaker churches to create and create experiments and journalists? Why not take a prostitute as usual in the removal of the street? This clunker reminded Lugosi Stinker of many others, "The Devil Bat" ... dealing with the same lines of plot and bad performance and the 'reporter himself silly guy'. <br /> <br /> But Lugosi is always good - it is boring and malicious, so you can keep watching at least watching. The woman who played the reporter was a great actress ... she had no emotion, she handed it as a machine gun. As soon as they were left behind. Everyone else liked it very much, when they came to be good actors. <br /> <br /> But this thing is a clock, only if it is only fans of Bela Lugosi. vivid, when it was a picture dog. He knew that he was taking some wonderful pictures, but he might even know that if he would give it a little bit of that intensity, he would surround all the land and bad performances. . <br /> <br /> And he was right. We will always love the horror fans to Bela Lugosi. and was in front of the camera. We give you two, Bela.
