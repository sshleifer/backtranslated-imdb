To make it as honest as possible, The Devil's Plaything (or Blood Veil or Vampire Ecstasy or The Black Sisters of the Black or Damn) is boring. Is the movie a good premise behind? A revival of a long vampire, through the support of a group of women dressed in black with the body of a future? But the execution is horrible. There are moments of great moment on the screen, literally, nothing happens. They are just characters without having to do it around. There is no mystery, there is no suspense, and does not engage in any kind of plot. The play is abysmal. Most of the operation dancing a dance group naked and dancing with a camera downstairs. This is done repeatedly. And it seems that there are few plots to enter the dance floor designed to attract naked females. As if the orgy is like a dead man, it's as bad or useless as dance or plot.
