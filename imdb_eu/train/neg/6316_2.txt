It's an excellent example of a movie like Amazing Grace and Chuck that has no left in this country. They never did it. Liberalism continues to forget even in the politics of oblivion. <br /> <br /> This film is played with a league baseball star, a nuclear weapon that decides to leave the nuclear ball. He understands it to be ridiculous until Alex's English NBA team has joined a team of professional athletes who have been targeted by former stars. Some of them are not linked to cause. When his movements arrive at his time, the entire league of professional sports and colleges must stop the seasons, nobody will play. In order to carry out the review, I am ready to give this premise. Although it never happened in a million years, I imagine that I could do it, and from there I will go. <br /> <br /> I do not remember how, but it gets a kind of agreement and decides to really wake up and laugh at what the loved one loves. <br /> <br /> Before criticizing the message of this movie, let me tell you that this movie is badly written, dramatized and directed. In accordance with the attitude of the boy, although it would be impossible to build this film. And it's shameful that many good actors are debris. (Peck, Curtis, Petersen). As Alex English can do with his character, however, he would try to work on more films. Oh, it's a lot easier to find work in the NBA coaches world. Mr. England could learn more about these NBA types of the NBA, a bit of rock shooting better. Alex did, no doubt, know how to put the ball through the hoop. <br /> <br /> With regards to the Festival message, it's just an incorrect head. Plain and simple Those nuclear missiles that are hidden in these mirrors are PREBENTED WAR !!! This boy and his flock would be the same thing to protest the US real war or NARC weapons. Weapons were never used, and here was the genius of their existence. On the sides of the cold war it was not enough to quench a single fool's missile. Without arms, who knows what could happen between the US and the USSR. <br /> <br /> The film's film makers take the reason for America's children and follow Chucken's footsteps. In America, however, they are more intelligent than kooks on the left side of children. <br /> <br /> The movie is only worth 10 stars. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a big movie about the dangers of nuclear war, take it with Dr. Strangelove. Mr. Newell, you're not Frank Capra!
