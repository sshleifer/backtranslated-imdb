DARK REMAINS is a low budget horror movie that manages to win 2 prizes. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to have two different branches. First, a woman suckles herself on her wrists for bathing. Secondly, the young daughter of a technical writer has cut her throat. The couple decides to take them to an isolated cabin in the mountains. Later, the booth is seen and the surrounding locations are upside down. <br /> <br /> If you continue with the movies, the two different stories of the story match together, just as it might have been. However, the execution is unfortunate and, consequently, disorders can only be solved by a great deal of vision. Unfortunately, the film does not attract enough audiences to attract more than once. <br /> <br /> Everything that could crash this movie goes wrong and quickly! And a small budget can not be used to justify shortcomings we have found here. <br /> <br /> I think it would be wrong to give an opinion on the agents involved in this production, because the material was only bad. /> <br /> Characters are of interest as stated by other reviewers on this site. The script written includes too many people without giving an interesting conversation, without creating chances of character situations, without giving them any depth. <br /> <br /> The direction is inspired. J-Horror movies, such as RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL, are evident. Unfortunately, the director of DARK REMAINS did not pay much attention to the J-Horror style. J-Horror works so efficiently because he is afraid of the stranger. The voltage creates constant changes between strange situations (for example, the ghost of a CCTV camera) and warns of this reaction before the main character. In these films there is no humor or cheek. Everything is played right and does not help with any movement or limitation, but you can be persuaded and fascinated. The atmosphere set is a suspense that ensures a psychological impact on horror, unlike the "jump" used in Hollywood movies. CGI also avoided. The tribute to J-Horror could have been well-known. Unfortunately, the lack of inspiration is likely to make audiences "scared" laugh. The effects of "ghosts" were not very bad for the low budget, but their actions logically challenged. This movie was torn several times from my head. <br /> <br /> I could not finish it, even if I wanted to. I can not understand Everything I could mention, I wanted to say something more than once. <br /> <br /> What is left? The response from another web page indicates a boredom. The films are about to be seated. Luckily, pain lasts about half an hour. However, most of them would be shut down much earlier than the end. <br /> <br /> In this movie I can find 2 positive things: avoid clich√©s and avoid "f-word". As usual, each sentence is found as expected. This is 2 stars. Those who like fears of supernatural or psychological fear related to fantasy and suffering can stick them with films such as THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING or J. Horror Sub-genre. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a lot of movies set up and you'd like to see a huge budget "R-rated" on ghosts, watch MOVEMENT A CANCELLER CITY. Perhaps it's the biggest horror movie ever made, but it's much better than DARK REMAINS and has some real surprises in stores. <br /> <br /> I'm avoiding SENTRAIMING like everyone's plague.
