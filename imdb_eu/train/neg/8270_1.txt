There are no plots, the scene of the managerial scene is badly bad (the world's famous sniper players can not walk away for a few goals) and what will end? ---> a group of legislators in the Carnival filming gallery? WTH?), Technical errors (how many bullets are included in a glock magazine? 100+? These people fire guns without recharging them). The movie is very bad, although the big Hollywood actor Michael Biehn (Aliens, terminator) could not save this junk. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie (I realized that my goodies lost 100 minutes, this is a prized life). Fortunately, the director leaves the movies or even learn more about the next movie.
