This low budget movie is compared to the classic "Silent Night Deadly Night" because it is labeled Slasher Flick. First of all, I said that "Silent Night Part 2" is better than that (more than half of the original movie flashbacks were completed). "The evil Christmas" tries to get psychologically, the main character is crazy (a solid word), slowly (very slowly). They do not get a Christmas meaning and they can not get angry about the quality of their toys. Santa dressed, she is finally dying. It is also a solid word that only 3 people have died without the need for real effects. There are no tensions, no emotions, no gore, no cast. It's an exception: Jeffrey DeMunn is there. Tom Hanks is known as one of the classic "The Green Mile" wardens. He still needs to move forward to accept this role. He is the only one that can really act, his main assistant principal. (who is not a bad one, but if a small assistant is darkened, you're not too good). And with that weird ending? (you must see, believe). "Christmas evil" is not boring, nothing happens and the work of art is misleading. This is not a slasher. You want to watch a real Christmas slasher, check out the greatest of all time: "Silently, Deadly Night."
