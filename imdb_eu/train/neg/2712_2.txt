In some of the 60s, it's a fun movie, and most of this entertainment laughed at the movie. It is very different and has annoying elements. Take, for example, black and white and change color. If it's done well, it can be quite effective, but when it was done, it became an aggravation and it just did not hurt it; Much of the film was amazing. The play was not too bad for the TV movie but it was once again shameful for other films. Many events were not consistent and confusing. How did this family end up in one of the many 1960s events? It was the end of my liking that I liked. Since it was hollywoodized, in the end, everything was needed. I would advise that you did not waste time in the 60s and have your time done something else. I'm glad I saw this in class, and not in my time. I think the best part of the movie is the introduction of Bob Dylan's music. These are just rambling my thoughts about the flick. I hope to take my advice and stay away.
