The Deadly Wake THE PERFECT MOVIE is for cinematic students ... to learn how to make a movie! <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what did the crew blow in this movie? Mixed music worse Edit worst worst script ALL AID PREVIOUS TIME Worst case Worst choreography Worst filmography Worst case is worst The worst lighting is black and white and silent. ... it would still be horrible. All the scenes are dark (the lights are called "black people"), often the musical scores were interrupted by meandering conversations, that was fine, since no one had ever given a full effect to two full sentences. The "evil" robot was the most horny ... what's that? Jazz dance Oh ... I think it was a tactic or something to do. I'm sure the hearts of poor writers ... And how do you edit rubbish so much footage? Impossible Garbage is rubbish, it does not divide any importance. How did one get this everyday? <br /> <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: I could not see more than 15 minutes of segment, it was so bad ... but I saw the whole thing (doing a lot of jumping) just Whether to be in the best part or not. Laguia! HOW IT IS! <br /> <br /> It's not an excellent example of making a movie ... serious movie student to watch!
