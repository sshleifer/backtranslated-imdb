Black Candles is a confusing mix of "Vampyres", and much later, "Rest in Pieces", among others. I just saw it. In any case, we will be in love with a couple, so that a nearby pin is placed on a voodoo doll and then crosses it, and the man is awakened. I do not know whether he was one of those two at that moment. From now on, the man's sister has come home to read or listen to her, or listen to something like that, and, of course, except for everyone else, is something that worships the devil. It is really difficult to find out who is at the moment and sometimes confusing. To be specific, there is a huge scene simulated with a black goat (simulated), sure to be a nice crowd. Ugh. Occasionally, "Rosemary's Baby" echoes the baby, because a female hostess gives herbs to tea, and she also thinks of the place as an evil herb of Satanism, as she also realizes. However, herbs are not the only thing about this movie. The end seems to be back to the beginning, and many spectators wonder where they were in the middle section. It's not at all inhuman, it's not very good, and I think everything depends on what you want to see in movies, and there was not much here for me to do a lot. 10 to 3.
