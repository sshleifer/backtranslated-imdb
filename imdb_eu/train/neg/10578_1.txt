Horror fans (I'm talking to people over 12, despite an insult that can be apologized for under 12): In short, I would like you to confuse your imagination in well-written storytelling, because it's a surprise. After delivering well-frightened fears and convincing performances, I strongly recommend - Avoiding these stamps - apparently selling data from the past since past executives. It's not an accident that almost feels like any episode in the 1980s. Do not put on the shoulders of some of these old boys (or, indeed, the 80's), with no movies of Argento, Carpenter, Landis, Landis, Dante and Barker (really Clive, WTF are you doing). Is it Romero happy? they asked me to leave without a chance to see it without thinking ...). Mick Garris, perhaps, has to give a finger to the creator, including the restoration of the logic that differs from Stanley Kubrick's 'Shining' masterpiece masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the state's indicator. TV today. Do we overwhelm the fear of television when we applaud a little old arrow that we disconnect the networks? Unfortunately, maybe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would not normally see the point of adding comments to the mistakes and merits of a product, I would only value it accordingly. However, since this series is merely lacking (with the exception of the theme tunes), I write a reminder rather than review: do not waste your time and money. If you do not agree with me, you may not see too much fear. The first films of some of these directors would be much better, but the "Master of Fear" only evaluates these works, so they never graduated to graduate. They were not studying at a University degree.
