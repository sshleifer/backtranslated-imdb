This movie is not a very bad movie, with some great actors - supposed actors - a boring and non-attractive story that copies a scene from the brilliant "giallio" directed by Sergio Martino. In 1973 (two years earlier), one of the most prestigious Italian psychedelic films and worship of the whole world. In the book "La Sanguinusa in the dance", the director repeats the scene of the bed between the black girl and the white girl, looking from the bedroom window. Of course, Rizzo's movie is ridiculous and Martino's film's softness and charm. The best way to prove a black girl, another white girl and another, who repeat the scene, is Rizzo's idea that he has no idea, no originality, no taste, and nothing. I think these things are a crime of the audience.
