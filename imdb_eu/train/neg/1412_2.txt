While watching this movie, I created the script for a movie called "Making of 10 Less Less: <br /> <br /> Producer: I have good news and bad news. Good news, we can get Morgan Freeman! <br /> <br /> Writer: That's great! But what's the bad news? <br /> <br /> Producer: We can only hire one day. We need to get someone else. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we hired one day. A movie is one and a half hours long. Work day is eight hours. I do not see a problem. <br /> <br /> Producer: But ... it will continue to be a character. <br /> <br /> Writer: So he plays a character. It's essentially the same. <br /> <br /> Producer: But he still has to understand his motivation and all that. You are saying that we are playing a great low-budget movie that is being made, right? <br /> <br /> Writer: Why not? <br /> <br /> Producer: That's ridiculous! But well, at least Morgan Freeman will be the movie. And I think they should also have a Los Angeles movie. <br /> <br /> Writer: of course. <br /> <br /> Producer: this script is empty. We're better off making money for that. There you have to put Morgan Freeman's character Wal-Mart or Target or one of these stores, so at least someone wants to sell DVDs. <br /> <br /> Writer: sure! <br /> <br /> Producer: wait for the second ... what is "ten or less" about a small small cellar? <br /> <br /> Writer: Oh, I think that's pretty strange. But now we can not change the title! <br /> <br /> My script is very similar to reality with reality, but then it does not even "10 elements or less". It's a good act, but a bad writing, and I hate that it will happen. When you are watching an independent movie, you expect to try to convey a certain message. I think maybe they did not let me "leave anything" trying to get tired of old-fashioned death, much longer. In any case, using "10 or less", I got the single message "Look! Look Morgan Freeman!"
