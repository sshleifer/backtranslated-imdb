I do not know what Shield wants, but the results speak for itself: the shield is almost impossible. <br /> <br /> Really The Shield's performances are excellent ... <br /> <br /> Actually, the show is very bad together, because you can not really see the performances. For example, the edition moves away from the reaction plans before having the full impact. <br /> <br /> I do not know the intellectual reason for this, but it shows all the emotional impact. <br /> <br /> The Shield will give me an ambition regarding this matter, but I can give it quite a bit. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see a lot of talent. The performer has ruined his gift in a strange thing.
