I have just finished the marathon of this series and was looking forward to it. From fictitious historical elements, later in the face of the horrible accent of O'Herlihy, the show is only exploding. If you are looking for a low-quality general production for the WW2 fluff, I would recommend it for the 1st season, but avoid doing so, making it a step by step after the show, with increasingly serious stories and sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Any old B & W film for any recreation related to Colditz It is the best, and that is also not expected.
