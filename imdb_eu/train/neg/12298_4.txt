The "Witches" 80s horror film could be more inconsistent, but fortunately, it has some compensatory quality, such as fantastic gore effects, music scores and excellent casting options. Honestly, the script does not make sense, but who looks after Linda Blair (a hairstyle that explodes) and depicts a hugy photographer David Hasselhof (who can not seem to find anything). a constantly-presented film that blooms voodoo, sew-close lips, upside down crucifixion, cunning recordings and too much but a really creepy tune. Eight people randomly gathered on an abandoned holiday island on the Massachusetts coast holiday. The young couple is going to explore the dark history of the place; Dysfunctional family (with pregnant Linda Blair, nobody remembers where her father is and how far she is), she only takes into consideration the delicious hotel and architect of a casual age. They are forced to stop at night in the bad hotel and then suddenly the previous hunter? An aging actress or something of a black dress? They start in different ways. However, in some way, a woman accused of witchcraft is linked to the entrance to a window. However, the plot is of little importance, as a non-official subsidiary called "The Evil Dead" in an Italian horror franchise. The atmospheres are disturbing and the make-up effect is definitely the main component of the film. There's something bulky and disturbing waiting for a woman who is hanging over to a fireplace waiting to wait and fry.
