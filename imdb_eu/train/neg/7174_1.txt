I wanted to read other comments before my opinion came out and most definitely regulated: this movie is aweful! Animations from non-realistic animations due to mistakes. I really expected that flaps might have stretched out part of the imagination (I could not extend it without a flaps). The landing unit can not be depleted unless it is electric. This tiny little fan went that was not enough to lower the landing drops. It was curious that the only thing I thought was being carried to the ground, they touched the rear wheels and the nose was lit, lining the plane with two air tires. How did the captain apply the brakes to the left and right brakes on the ground? Did they waste? Talk to the director: Find out all * about * shots before making a "plane" movie. I apologize for the inequality of the technician, but I give this movie 1/10.
