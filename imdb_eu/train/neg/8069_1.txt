"Soul Survivors" is a mess that is confused with the passionate and vibrant musical theater genre of "horror movies and the survivors". Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel are preparing two different couples to go to different schools, but before taking part in Thanksgiving Break, they participate in the last church, in a church that is burning at a church party, according to a suggestive suggestion Annabel slutty ( Church Dushku, Faith, another individual killer). Motivational, unbelievable boys, Cassie (generic Melissa Sagemiller) are very careful, for reasons that are never explained, and in the end, the quartet has left the party. When they go on driving their Amestoy, they overcome hundreds of muted and motivating guys who are deliberate and incomprehensible in the middle of the road, causing an ill and fatal accident because Amestoy goes through a line. the river He's killed (or is not he?), And Cassiek's other film plays loneliness and guilt (as he is driving) Sean's ghost did not invade him or the great boys frightened him. Uncensored inconsistency continues as Cassie's mental state becomes more decaying, until it reaches the predicted succession. So who is dead and who lives? After ninety minutes of this purgatory, who really cares?
