I did not expect so much, but I was still disappointed. This is the favorite Halestorm production I have ever seen. I thought they thought it was a comedy, but I only fell with 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really fun to eat red donuts and a man falling back and forth? What happened to the divine Heaven scene? Fred Willard has been angry with some of Christopher Guest's collaborations, but that does not work. The "famous actors" had to spend their entire budget because there was no lighting budget that appeared in this phenomenon. It seems like it was filmed with a video camera, and the majority of the scenes were very dark. Does it really matter if someone actually shot and made a basket, if it does not cut or edit a ball through the basket? I try not to be a critic of the low-budget comedy, but if you want to see something funny, the church will go to a basketball basket instead of the movie.
