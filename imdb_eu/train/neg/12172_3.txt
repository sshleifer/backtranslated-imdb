After debacking the Sleepaway Camp debacle for the first time, who could be born from a franchise. It is a high level in the SC II. Inspired killings and much more fun. Perhaps this is not much said (compared to the first film), Sleepaway Camp II is worth renting. <br /> <br /> Pros: Entertaining is not very serious for SC SC. Contrasting jokes: sterile performance and varicose veins. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: 5/10 <br /> <br /> <br />
