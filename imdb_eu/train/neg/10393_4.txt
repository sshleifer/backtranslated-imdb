You're welcome: <br /> <br /> Penelope Keith Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (English spine). The first scene has died. This show has no spine! <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole Ol 'Colonel's first war, the first war and now the mansion's symbolic palace. <br /> <br /> Joanna Lumley is a lady ensweatered, under 20 years of age and under 20 years of age, at least 20 years old and at least 20 years old, but still glamorous (Brit spelling, not mine) enough to be a toy boy on one side. Well, they have full knowledge and permission from the Cricket Colon (the guy has come back to Christmas). However, for Colonel, this toy is just as old (what a hell!) <br /> <br /> David McCallum, like that boy toy, is as skeptical as his tightening. Pilcher could not give him an explanation of the story, so he gave him a circus work. <br /> <br /> And finally: <br /> <br /> Susan Hampshire, Miss Polonia Teacups, is a member of the Aged Girls' Boarding School, tea-office in her office, with a deep and noisy advice in the world outside For life, before graduating. His best advice: I've been in Nancherrow (the local England house) for more than one occasion. I thought it was very beautiful, but somehow it's not in the real world. " Well, we can not say they did not warn them. <br /> <br /> Oh, Susan, it was time, your character would run the whole show. He's not writing that way. Our loss, not yours. <br /> <br /> So, with this cast and setting, you have the restructuring of "Brideshead Revisited", right? <br /> <br /> Wrong! These three-dimensional support roles were taken up because they paid well. After all, it's one of the oldest timing of performances (you name another!) <br /> <br /> First warning signal: there are many lights. They shoot the outside: "Yes, it's just sunlight!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Not crying, eyes are damp. That's what the novels are: Leading Lady "eyed-eyed" <br /> <br /> <br /> From now on, Lady's main LL will be called <br /> <br /> Third note: LL really has stars When your eyes are in love. However, I will give Emily Mortimer a prize for her eyes with this focus (would I admire the use of contacts?) <br /> <br /> And finally, the fourth warning signal: it is not on the screen "Mrs." da. "Miss" or "Lady" I could not say and what to say. <br /> <br /> Summarizing: All World War II live without anything. <br /> <br /> Well, in the end, LL finds that he has lost his parents in Japanese jail camps and brings his baby home. Meanwhile (always "in the meantime") a young man from LL has enjoyed (when I do not know) during a war period, and there is Manor of the Lady on the street (some must be) if that street is found. Two wars to rescue Nancherrow (Some must be "strings", somewhere in these stories!) <br /> <br /> <br /> Great drama.
