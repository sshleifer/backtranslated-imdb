Being 'Paris, Je t'aime', I was very much expecting this movie and I admit that I had entered into great hopes, but I was disappointed with a lot of reasons. <br /> <br /> Although I did not expect that the 'Paris' reuse structure in New York was the same as I expected. It was the decomposition of neighborhoods that I liked about "Paris". You got the story of each director and the story they wanted to tell. The stories of 'NY' are not clearly separated, at different points in the movie, characters from different stories are interconnected, and I saw who I was accurately confused and what happened. Likewise, change in management was obvious, but it was confusing because there was no flow. I love love in love with 'Paris'. It was not romantic There was love between parents and children, not damaged love, unusual love, lonely women and love, etc., he analyzed various layers of humanity's complexity. It seems 'NY', only strict sexuality and above. Two shorts (the couple spent their entire life together, Julie Christie short), but in general, "NY" did not cause emotion for me. I did not connect to it like I did with 'Paris'. I remember seeing "Paris" and I feel deep sadness, loneliness, longing, hope, and wonder ... I had so much soul. For me, the soul in "NY" was not there. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, without being threatened in the back of my brain in Paris, when I entered into a comparative way, this film could be created. A more beneficial response, but as a self-recovery called JeT'aime in Paris, I was very disappointed.
