For a long time, knowing the comics of Enki Bilal, I had to watch the movie. I thought that this artist would be like Bilal to expand his art and ideas to broader audiences. I also thought it was a good movie I would recommend, and I thought I would enjoy watching ... I was wrong! The movie was a real torture to see. It has a potential idea ... but the movie is too much to be desired, and you can better understand everyone who is watching this movie. I do not suggest any suggestions on how to watch this movie. This option is if you're reading this page or seeing it, but it's been prepared for a very bad 102 minutes.
