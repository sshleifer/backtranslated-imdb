This movie starts with the execution of witchcraft and her mistress. He is cut off and buried separately from his body ... "It should not be like a thing that does not die, right? Well, that's how it plays a bit, but after collecting the head of the body, all the interesting and terrible deaths are made and the movie is moving very slowly. I mean that the movie was just 88 minutes and I continued to think "When will it end?" Most of the movie's characters are stupid and they deserve to die really stupid. The evil one is also very bad, because it is slow and really asks you how something you can do that looks strange to you. The only thing you can do when re-assembling your head is to keep it up is that there are so many boobs as you start to lose gestures. I still want to see the horror movie, it's not a soft pornography movie, and it tries to slow down like a horror movie, it can be slow in long ways, though it's pretty nice. And do not read the backs of the box as the areas that ate the people that attacked the people, there is only one small scene where three or four zombies attacked and repeated so easily. They are not a factor in the film and their scene is absurd. So, I would say that you should avoid this movie a lot, if you do not find it really cheap.
