I rented this in the 80's and I can not honestly remember anything specific about the movie, the worst movie I've ever seen. This is not one of them "it was so bad, it was fun". This is not one of them "so gory, it leaves you feeling bad". There was not one of them "what happened to that hell?" movies I can not remember the performance of the actors, but it was not shot well, the story was imbalanced, and it did not have a definite style. When it was over I was angry that I had lost time. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why there are many films, styles, and / or stories that we do not know about, but that's it. It was clear that these films had some of these properties. Inkubak has nothing. <br /> <br /> I really thought that someone who did not comment on "piece" was afraid of seeing curiosity, but I would like to warn anyone who appreciates the movie. .
