JUDAAI showed Raj Kanwar's daring film at that time in 1997, when he was out of the box when he was out of the box <br /> <br /> He shows how he delights the credit he intends to give himself to. people can get what they want to go <br /> <br /> The film is damn melodramatic, often horny in places <br /> <br /> Anil does not buy a television for his wife? When he earns so much to show just why he was poor? <br /> <br /> The card is handled well but manipulation is out of direct 80s The Johny-Paresh comedy is here and there entertaining. since it does not fit into the story <br /> <br /> Although there are several memorable scenes, <br /> <br /> Raj Kanwar's direction is appropriate, although sometimes there is also dramatic music. <br /> <br /> Now, in its part, there is a great Sridevi, Urmila is decent, in the break Kader Khan is as usual as Johny Lever is fun, Paresh Farida is hard.
