I'm a fan of science fiction in the 1950s, but this is not my favorite. The concept behind the film was a natural vehicle, although the teens bopper was a natural vehicle for a fictional science fiction movie, the director thought he would take a feature film. It's clear that you can not work without money, that the whole movie is always worried about the conversation. * * I have never seen so much time killing a movie. <br /> <br /> There's probably less than 60 seconds in the movie "Blob Footage", and most of the rest come in. in a misunderstood conversation. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but a good sky ... how did the questioning think of everyone on their own who believed them as teenagers?
