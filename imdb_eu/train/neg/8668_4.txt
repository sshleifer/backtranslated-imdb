I have never read Bradbury's novel as a film, but, as I have gathered, it will be interesting (at the end I read it and I will do it). My comments are based exclusively on the movie. As soon as I saw the trailer, I saw that I had to be so excited, but when I finished it, I felt so bad. This is because the movies were so sensitive. The actors did not throw away (although Robards and Pryce are good actors, not here). The appearance of actors, apparently, was asked to appear on the characters' clothes, say the lines and make faces. The set and props were cheap and unrealistic. The management was surprisingly bad. So I was surprised at how much horrors I had to do online and check with whom I had to do, to see the type of work he did. Editing was cut and pasted and the plot (script) was also (even if the author involved himself, irony?). The tension, fear and suspension were so gentle that it was not effective at the time it was reached. <br /> <br /> I have read comments about this movie and it is hard to believe that people really like it. was it Most pain is that content is interesting and fun and interesting. He had so much potential. Unfortunately, the movie was so badly technically that it deletes the story's brilliance.
