Val Kilmer, good performance. Dylan McDermott, good performance. Josh Lucas, a good performance. Three very attractive actresses giving decent performances. The problem is, who is looking after the land? John Holmes. Although the hystery is hired by his patient, drug dealer and AIDS, he is not an interesting character because he continues to make adult movies. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds previous events. At the end of the 80s, Los √Ångeles had been murdered by the deceitful murder, which Holmes was charged and arrested and murdered, and was eventually acquitted. As in the case of OJ, the guilty factor, whatever the result, was quite "He did it". <br /> <br /> There's no need to play in this movie, just like everybody. It's a self-serving crime. There's nothing remotely interesting here.
