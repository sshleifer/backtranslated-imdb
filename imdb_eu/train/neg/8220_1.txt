I wanted to finish in this movie within 10 minutes, it was painful. All of this "horror" movie was a strange group of 90-minute stupid people, crying, weeping and screaming. Do not leave a positive comment fool, because this is a really cool movie and you do not really have to watch it. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie has been a bit big, but it does not happen. Five teenage "groups" drive a night driving home, a stupid female driver who wants to kill her. It's been in the film for two minutes, and the characters already argue and this does not stop. We need 90 minutes for girls, crying, weeping, screaming, "acting" and arguing. No conversations are also interesting at a distance, so you do not really know these characters and you do not enjoy them. <br /> <br /> The effect was horrible and I was surprised to learn to bring these characters. be teenager Not even one of these women looked less than 20 days and one of them seemed almost 30 years old. At least the people who look at age. No one remotely had to give up performances, and it just seemed to have been removed from the street or the director's friends were not acting. The murderer passed the "actress", but at least another girl did not show something - a bit of talent. <br /> <br /> The characters do not help things with these girls. a giant and stupid fool. That's what I really care about them, and I do not help that ALL survived. If I have to enter the details, in a scene, the girls are killing behind and killing cars a lot. A girl dies and tears herself ... four of them are not wearing seat belts ... what do you expect? One of your companions is attacking the killer ... and helping all of you "overly injured"? Anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie shoot is totally awesome. I do not care if the film is a quote for a peanut, it was like a great movie and it was like watching a version of a movie pirate. The cameraman was clearly in the car, the girl was pushed against a window somewhere and the camera was frightening, shook and frustrated against a "actor". It was too grainy, and at times we could not hear the characters say (it's not something worthwhile to hear). <br /> <br /> Expected movie killer cars (who have allegedly been successful, even if we've only heard the accident, really is the real life of the director's car. It's not surprising that the car did not hit! This movie is very cheap, they can not drive to show off a bit of a bit ... Oh, the sound to be mentioned ... what was it? It was crazy about it ... the second and then hard. <br /> <br /> Finally, Five Across The Eyes tonight It feels like a horrible movie that is filmed in the middle of the road, a stupid girl that is about 90 minutes away. It's not a frightening screenplay, it's not a frightening / tension / suspension and (it's hardly a rumor for that), the play is awesome and the quality and shooting of the image They are awesome. <br /> </ p> This was a very small budget movie. Avoid all costs. <br /> <br /> 1/10
