While some of the performances were good -Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau, and two Italian friends - the story was a lama and a derivative, when the girlfriend's racial fever was handled with care, and her relatives were most often represented as stereotypes. It's not a real people. It was fun to be uneasy at times. I can not understand why the local paper released has been a good SF movie, and it's surprising that the WHO published a review on IMDb. I was very disappointed in the movie and I was mad at the theater, based on the faulty connection of the Garden State, which is a very fun, more understandable and moving film. Especially noteworthy is the emotional viciousness of the church, almost the number of wood and virtually left, and others that are really among the audience. At that time, I saw a crazy cemetery that I saw before a month ago. I really do not like being deceived without spending my money.
