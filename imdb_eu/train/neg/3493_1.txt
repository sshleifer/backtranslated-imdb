I do not write too much opinion on IMDb.com, but I think there is a need to warn the potential audience that this movie is awful. Just terrible Shaw Bros. I like movies (I'm not a hater.), And I had a lot of hope in that regard, I've found the "Top 10 Kung Fu / Martial Arts Movies" websites listed. (I am convinced now that all 10 top-notch jobs are cut and pasted). First and foremost, there is hardly any action in the film. Most of the movies are about talking about the plot, that is, the amazing show is the best. And the same action was evident in 1978, but it is routine according to current regulations. Special warning for Netflix users: the DVD for the boat is horrible; The image is horrible and it's not even improved at 16: 9.
