I'm so disappointed. This film made me think of my time and mind. Here's how the main scene in Woody Allen's movie is: discussing whether a neurotic neurotic high man will cheat Manhattan's husband or wife. Woody, I've seen these characters already, I've seen your story ten times. Where did your creativity go? You need to open your eyes and look around you. The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall - and you have to change it. <br /> <br /> There are interesting and fun scenarios for applying too much severity and neuro-nutrition. Why not try to replace the old bell and replace it more than once? <br /> <br /> When I hear about a new Woody Allen project, it does not do anything for me - now I expect it's because of its old reservation: couples who are tired and cheat. Restored and old, old. <br /> <br /> If Woody seeks for his fans, then he must understand that humor and intelligence are sensible, not insulted.
