"Beautiful girl with bad hair to decorate!" "Beautiful girls without risk!" "Direct shooters can not go straight!" Within the framework of the Dragon Dynasty, "Dragon Heat", Hong Kong is a gangster drama. For some of the reasons that could be totally hidden, the call for production and polling of the "steroids criminals" was somehow signaled by both the evil Maggie Q and Michael Biehn. But they do not do all this to this awesome slug-fest. <br /> <br /> They are the best actors of today, each one of his resumption and achievement list, and Biehn's. In particular, he has the courage to take on different and not heroic roles. <br /> <br /> Maggie Q "Live Free Or Die Hard" was a super bad, "so nuff said. <br /> <br /> Biehn, of course, was famous for being a future soldier , Because "The Terminator" had a disastrous science fiction / fantasy in 1984 as opposed to Big Arnold, that is, Californian Governor! <br /> <br /> Michael Biehn almost completely wastes the wonderful train of a police drama. There is no reason to believe that the plot, which is very confusing -especially in Chinese, was a story in Hong Kong, that non-Chinese viewers could be worked better with a foreign narrator. <br /> <br /> In other words, Biehn's Interpol's observer or coordinator or if it were used as a kind of deep-cover agent, it should be done by someone who should be given every five or ten minutes, which would be great, but not a group of a small group of special forces, who work independently in the agreement, because someone has completely ruined the agreement of a local king of ruined agreements. <br /> <br /> Yes, I said all that. Confused? Me too. "Welcome to the party, friend" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There's only a plot story. <br /> <br /> Bad guys vs. good police. In a violent violence in the Hong Kong state of a triad or a group of people, it seems that the filmed police police are much more than just the parade of the gallery gallery, as criminals cut off. br /> <br /> So it's not surprising that almost a similar scene is almost incomprehensible (in fact, several scenes) that children try to shoot wood ducks in a video game to win animal prizes. For this reason, the police take their name on their behalf, leaving the Kewpie dolls to play the game. <br /> <br /> It also has half a half "love creation". interest "between one of the police and a single visitor police. <br /> <br /> The visitor policeman thinks they are material witnesses to the gangster chief of the Triad, but not his team, but the mercenaries (Biehn, Maggie Q and others.) These killers want something, but we do not know what it's like until the end of the movie! It was a stupid mistake in the overall story. <br /> <br /> You can not get a suspense on a crime scene or get it or get it escape, at the beginning of the story. <Br> /> <br /> Add this to "out of scene scenes" that are "out of the scenes" that show bad and common bad luck, and filmmakers can easily understand this dog this dog. It gets a score of 1 with this criminals with criminals and conspirators and Hong Kong.
