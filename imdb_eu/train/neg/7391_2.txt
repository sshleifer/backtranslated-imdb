Like most of Steven Steven's fans, I know I do not expect a masterpiece when I'm making a movie, but I'm expecting a movie quote. I saw the copy, the biggest problem was more than doubling. I know that in some films I have to do that and I accept it, but when they cover a completely different actor with a voice and when they take it out, it takes it. magic of excesses Likewise, it seems that the sets are carefully constructed, thanks to a glass slip on a secret single-stage laboratory that has a huge crack. I was really disappointed with this film and the next Stevens project will end before the purchase or rental of the movie. The story of this movie I was watching a science-fiction movie, or I did not look at foreigners like some sections, but they did not fully explain what was very misleading.
