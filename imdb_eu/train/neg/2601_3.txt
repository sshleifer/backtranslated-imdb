I watched the movie for the first time. Drew Barrymore wanted to see me and I wanted to see one of his first films. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a young girl who plays Drew Barrymore, who moves from NYC to LA, to overcome past loss. After moving with a man who is in love with her, it becomes obvious that the twin is evil, soft. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty bad. The dialogues and the actors did not see the movie as worthwhile. In sum, Drew is something for Barrymore fans.
