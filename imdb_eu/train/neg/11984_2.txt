Ugh! Another DVD to "deceive the cover". I expected an approximate bear, cat, and such as some actions on the cover. I do not have anything! Bad movie! <br /> <br /> I forced myself to see all this in a different way, finally, FINDING would happen to something ... I do not have luck. <br /> <br /> Now I have given it a reason for this 2 landscape; otherwise he sucked. <br /> <br /> The baby was terrifying, talking to himself (although I think they did not have to make a mute or conversation), setting a tree's carat. stump, threatening a raccoon, munching worms, and kicking a porcupine (what a dumb one). And he did not get those feathers easily ... just like fishermen. At least the bears (weakened) fought a couple of times. <br /> <br /> What happened with the flashback? The bad movie became worse. I wanted to see a survival movie, not a dramatization about a boy about divorce. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Well, maybe they should have a baby or something with a bear. It could be at least more exciting. <br /> <br /> People, do not waste your time on it.
