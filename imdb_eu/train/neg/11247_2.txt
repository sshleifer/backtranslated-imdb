This movie was an overwhelming way. Many audiences thought it was "amazing" because they had to enter the old school movies, the whole movie is set in the past. At first I thought the movie was showing something of the past, so I expected the dreamer to be like a superhero, but it's just gone. Basically, the movie was trying to mix the future with the past, and 2 did not mix well in this film, even with special effects. You could see the blue screen in which the actors were working. There are too many movies according to what the film does, so the criticism does not necessarily mean that this movie is the "greatest movie ever". It's just a stick. He also did not have the story line so much. I do not understand why this Hollywood movie was born, and I do not understand how actors and actors in this movie are prepared to be such a movie. Almost everyone reads the script and reads the writing as they forget ... "Everything will be done on the computer." The movie was a movie that had to be on the net, nothing revolutionary about this movie. I am very sorry to pay for this to see this. Do everything you do, do not waste time and money in this movie today or tomorrow.
