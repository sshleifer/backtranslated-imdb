There's a little ground spoiler, this is an unexpected scene in this movie and it can ruin a fun surprise. There is also information about the first film in this series. <br /> <br /> I received this movie on the DVD, which someone gave as a gift to my roommate. Together with the first film "Blind Dead", the play came. <br /> <br /> This movie was much worse than "The Night of Terror Blind" first. In addition, the many features of the first film changed dramatically. To launch, the movie was dubbed in English (the first one was subtitled) and I distract them. <br /> <br /> The concept behind this series in the distant past was a local branch of the knight's temple. worrisome rites and secrets. The discovery of these crimes led local peasants to death to the temples, because their eyes can not be used anymore, to determine their revenge to return to hell. We will leap to modern times, as a result of which the temples arise from the dead, first of all with their ancestors who revenge. Certainly, dead kittens have no eyesight, they can only be found when the victims see the noise. <br /> <br /> The tenant was in secret order, XII. From the Century. crushed Approximately 150 years ago, the Pope and others did not get rid of it before the beginning of the 1300s. Because they were silent, there were always rumors about their ceremony, especially for the beginnings. Likewise, as society was organized, you did not necessarily have the church authorities in the custody of things, which means they did not warm the inside of the man when things are done. And because of the nature of their trials, they tortured confessions. The order was the strongest in France, but Portugal and Spain existed, where the movies took place. <br /> <br /> The first sacrifice of the virgin film and the knights sang their blood directly in the body of the virgin. Breast-film here, of course, is a horror movie, after all), and then the knights are back, the victims attacked alive and absorbed the blood; In this sequel, everything disappears. You still have the same scene (virgin, not footage), one of those who refuse to leave the virgin, but they put in a bowl of blood and drink from there. So when they return, I mean that people are only pirated by swords or claw people, that is, it's a much more effective way to interfere with your audience. There is a problem in the time: in the first film, the dates are closer to the Templars, where they say, it means that they are the 500th anniversary of burning boys, that is, it would be around 1473. The temples also have less interest in losing their eyes. In the first one, they were thrown into crows. Now, they just smoke, and a very ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> Yes, and maybe it was just for me, but there seems to be a lot of people in the first film that appear in this film. although he died). It's not really a problem because the movie is completely different, and there's no tracking in the sense of a tracking, but it's no wonder. <br /> <br /> The most prominent feature of this movie is that it is rich. to pay attention to the deceased children while doing a jeep for a break. He escaped from the hand of this wealthy child's father to make an attempt to escape, so he went out and told him to find his father. It comes out of blue, and the movie scene is more fun. Of course, why is not the child die right now, and he is disappointed by horror fans. <br /> <br /> I could not recommend this film to anyone. It's not so bad that it makes fun, so it's a horror film. The most important part of the film has come together in a church; Everyone must make their own efforts to escape the blind dead that surround them. At the end of the movie, you will not be surprised at the result; In fact, quite disappointed. If you're new to the Spanish horror movie, watch the first movie, at least innovative ideas and unexpected results.
