This should really be worth the "O" rating or ten negative ones. I saw this show at ages, and the show jumped into the shark in the series 7 series. However, this episode shows that shark has shown. Writing is lazy, nonsensical, self-indulgent and does not deserve Beavis and Butthead. <br /> <br /> It is very possible to be ridiculous and still fun - Caribbean Pirates, Mummia, Count Montecristo - all the "fun" movies to be taken seriously. However, it is ridiculous as the "worst thing I ever see" is said. And, in fact, this is the worst episode of Stargate ever seen. It's totally horrible, and someone comes with a star in the basement. <br /> <br /> I wanted to sell all my stargate props, most importantly.
