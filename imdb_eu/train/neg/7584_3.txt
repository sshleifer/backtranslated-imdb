I've seen the revival of Broadway's "Blithe Spirit" with Angela Lansbury, Rupert Everett, Christine Ebersole and Jayne Atkinson. It's an excellent production and shows what good actors can do with a perfect play. Angela Lansbury is very funny, Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> It might be a mistake to review theater theater with Rex Harrison. The movie does not have the energy or laughter of a good staging. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Blithe Spirit" is probably one of those works that works best for direct work, people with people. laugh The actors can inevitably improvisate, touch and nudge the operation and giving of lines, and can not involve the audience at a personal level when they enter the movie theater or DVD, when the viewer separates them. the story of the fourth wall Story: Charles Condomine (Rex Harrison) is a successful writer with his wife Ruth (Constance Cummings) in the English countryside. Charles, his next book, supernatural, includes information gathered by Madame Arcati (Margaret Rutherford, repeating the role of original production in London in 1941) to make a spiritual support. Carlos believes that spirituality is false, but he expects "trade tricks" to be picked up. But then, Mrs. Arcati Elvira (Kaye Hammond) brings ghosts, Charles's first wife, seven years ago, died of pneumonia. Elvira does not want to leave, and Ruth Charles develops his rivalry with him (because he can only see or hear Charles Elvira). <br /> <br /> At the stage, the actors can give laughing performances. state But on the screen, the actors in "Blithe Spirit" violate the lines, they do not know anyone. They mar the lines designed to laugh at the stage. The performances of Harrison, Cummings and Kaye Hammond are flat. Margaret Rutherford seems only her spark and humor like Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> The visual effects of Oscar films are not outstanding, not according to current regulations, but according to the rules of 1946! Above all, Kaye Hammond surrounds fluorescent footwear and make-up, which captures pictures in a special illumination to look like a glittering ghost. <br /> <br /> Cinematographers are worthy of creative lighting. But the sad visual effects of "Blithe Spirit" need to be compared with the innovative effects of Disney's "Southern Song" so that they can be picked up in the same year. "In the South" people and animated characters share on the screen at a time in a few minutes. Compared to "the South", Oscar's "Blithe Spirit" for special effects was absolutely worth it. <br /> <br /> In any case, I can not encourage you to play this with Broadway's resurrection before starting with Angela Lansbury. closes Like Rex Harrison's movie, skip.
