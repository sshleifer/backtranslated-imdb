After the direct action of Disney, George of the Jungle, I had a great hope for this movie. Great disappointment A pure matter argument, bad performance, bad visual effects. This film relies on lame one-liners, idiotic (and pointless) product placement, and the gadget car car blocks the thing's secondary. I saw two young children there and they were bored. The only laugh that was taken from this movie was a joke that was a bad joke, so that the guy was crunching.
