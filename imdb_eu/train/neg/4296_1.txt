I recall that I have never been the worst movie gay I have ever seen, but I can say that the genre I have ever seen is a worse movie. <br /> <br /> You know you 'High-difficulty films begin with a personal "personal note" from the director, asking for the first time "understanding of" the "challenges" of the audience in front of the director. The track of audio is so bad in many scenes it is almost impossible to continue the conversation, and this from a DVD version. Bad lighting, bad set, bad photography, poor script, in general, this "movie" is not easy. After several attempts, I made a bad end, and I bought the DVD I bought a fool. I'm sure there is a lot of challenges with having a first challenge. But do not try to manually finish the finished product as. In the details of the reviews, I see that this was not only the first directing essay, Richard Natale, but the only one. This is a positive thing to say about "supposed movie".
