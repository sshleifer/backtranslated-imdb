I think that all Grisham films have been seen now and are generally very poor, except The Rainmaker, but this is very bad, it's unbelievable <br /> <br /> SPECIFIC NOTICE <br /> <br> /> No one would have any characters It's one of those films that makes stupid and stupid things. For the sake of Christ, he is a lawyer. Why the children are missing, the police do not call them. Yes, because all the police hate lawyers, they refuse to leave and attack them. <br /> <br /> When he was arrested after the break he freed him, he would be blocked in a cell waiting for the bail hearing. <br /> <br /> Why should you drag them when children were easily protected halfway across the country? <br /> <br /> The police will not run away to try to find a sick person. They do not worry about comparing their daughter. <br /> <br /> <br /> Unlucky ending ?. <br /> <br /> In summary, the fool, very unrealistic and losing time. /> <br /> 0/10 ?? The worst film ever.
