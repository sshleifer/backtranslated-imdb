I've been trying to enter songs forever in a perpetual movie. In my opinion, the quality of the movie would automatically improve only very annoying songs. However, things have changed rapidly this horrible black (no song) and after seeing this movie (3 songs). Although blacks are extremely weak, the page offers a very strong and straightforward story. The songs were almost unexpected and almost completely mixed with the movie. There was no doubt that water was not soaked in water, without reason for the mysterious water sources, while at night it was horrible on the streets. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate to be surprised by the daring and inaccurate view of the director. There's nothing glossy about, and almost every scene was absolutely compelling. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to the Hindi speaker, at least to understand Mumbai's life. The first subtitles in English were below par, and some errors appeared, sometimes the meaning of actual expression was reversed. This is because the accuracy of the representation will be obvious after you have lived. <br /> <br /> I would classify international recognition as a work worth it. The scenes with Gossiping drivers were a touch of pleasure and, at the same time, a real sense of humor as well as a whole other mixed perspective. There are a few movies on the screen, but sometimes they say no explanation about what the characters impede the general direction of the movie. <br /> <br /> Also, I thought the scene was not a couple of sad ones. very well made. It was a fun way to see it, it turned on sad feelings and the whole scene was stupid. There are minor problems, however, because it's strange to watch movies as a whole. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's cynical and pessimistic, and that's refreshing! Actors, not 'heroes' - that's the key. A unique opportunity to see the compelling man in everyday life. The background shows a measure of depravity and a strange ray of hope in Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10.
