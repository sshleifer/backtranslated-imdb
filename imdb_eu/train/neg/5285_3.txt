Somewhere, on this site, someone wrote to get the best version of Jane Austen's work, you would just read it. I agree. However, we love the adaptations of great literary and remember today's writers strike without good writers, it is difficult for the actors to live their roles. The current PERSUASION version of Jane Austen shows what's wrong with well-written adaptation. This version does not compare with the 1995 version of Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, well done, and keep the limit of the essence and characters of that era (except Bath Parade and kissing in the street scene). . The 2007 version shows Anne's twin. The other characters were not very developed, because it was a crime, because Austen could paint marvelous characters with a few approximate selections. The rhythm of the rhythm of the ritual of the novels was completely erased, and Mrs. Smith, Anne's worried and impoverished fellow, is walking around Bather - - she jokes, as many people seemed. The strength of the character that influenced the first-degree captain Wentworth did not seem to be the writing of Wentworth in Rupert Penry-Jones. Ciaran Hinds had a greater substance and could convey much more with a look, than P-J could do with his attitudes. In short, the 2007 version was disappointing. It seems that the novel turned into a melodrama that could cover manually, it was desirable that he deserved. If they want to bring curiosities of modern emotion into Austen's work, what they should do with Shakespeare's adjustments: adjust the present. The "bride and groom" at least came from the settings of the historical and local locations and was fun, like "Clueless". PERSUASION was not that, but they did not know what else to call.
