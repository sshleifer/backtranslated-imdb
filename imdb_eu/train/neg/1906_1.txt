The Twilight Zone marathon was played on July 4 and is the worst episode of the Twilight Zone ever seen. There is no synchronization with the ring tone. Twilight Zone is a fairly uneven series with many episodes planned, this one was far away. Compare this to mythical episodes such as "Willoughby Stop" or "Midnight Sun", and realize that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton had a horrible material with great stuff, and he was really shocked. someone in the historical comedy would take it to this stage. Although he seemed to be making an effort, he needed money ... there is no other explanation.
