I can not believe this movie was made recently in 1984. He has some huge plays, one of the most stupid of all time. Who would have ever asked Joe Don Baker a Texas sheriff fat, he was illegally arrested in Italy to go to Italy Italy? The title of the movie will tell you almost anything, as I am thinking of, it's a general title for short films and magazines. I think <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw MST3K as Mike and his boots. Seinalfeld warns of his resemblance to Elaine ("Nobody's terrifying") and Baker's weight will remain. This movie probably is not worse than "Mitchell", but Baker's reputation is definitely here before: when his title begins at the beginning of the film, Tom says: "I would not want to be illiterate."
