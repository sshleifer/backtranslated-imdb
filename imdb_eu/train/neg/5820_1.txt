This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen. I am studying French at university and, therefore, I understand the whole conversation, so the language barrier was not the problem. I should say that it is difficult to empathize with all the characters depicted in the movie. There is only one professional cast in Cast, and I do not guess a professional director or writer. <br /> <br /> Although I rated fifteen, it's probably not a bad rating. This is just a trivial endeavor to get out of today's 7.3 grade realism. You may have a more accurate 4.3 score, because the film is not true for a 100-minute event, you will never be back. His busting walnut is busting a movie twice as good and half length. However, if you want to join the circulation around the IMDb, you would also give it a "Lost translation" of 10.
