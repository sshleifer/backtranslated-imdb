I wanted to see this movie because it was Eliza Dushku, but she only has a smaller part, and her character is not very nice. However, the main character, performed by Melissa Sagemiller, is very beautiful and delight throughout the film. This is really just his appearance and talent just like a showcase. He works very well. <br /> <br /> The story is the same, the face is pretty absurd. After a car accident, some friends can die, but they continue in the past, and all mysterious things happen. They are after some bad guys, but we never know who they are (maybe they were others in the car, but we certainly do not know why they listen). The final scenes are particularly filthy as they seem to be great, but I can not get that kind of something consistent. Inauguration scene, the bad guys (who have some strange masks) cut the girl's wrist and picked up a blood I never explained or continue. The bad guy Cassie (Sagemiller) does not have the representation of surgeons trying to get out of the dead, but it does not seem like that is not working. The bad guys are bad; They merely blend a story that might just be interesting. In a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice, who needs hell boys? <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10
