This movie does not follow the story of the movie. Not all the goodies of the book were in the film. Meg and Calvin finished a Disney "Disney" twisted movie story. It was so bad that she was acting out of Hillary Duff, or the one she likes. This movie was just an insult to the book's intelligence and mysticism. I can not believe that Disney has made such a cheap basic interpretation. If you have read the book, I think that I agree that the "Lord of the Rings" will be equivalent. This movie could never be used for A Wrinkle in Time. Badly done
