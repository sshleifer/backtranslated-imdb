They should call this movie: "The intelligence mouse is a little brother inspired by Stuart Stuart Little Someone remembers, a little bit of a book, but especially remembered" It was not so deceptive I would give it a better review. <br /> <br /> But seriously, make your children feel good and read the book. It's possible that learning from mind is something based on what we know as a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Stuart's book is not about the mouse, it's about a very small person. like mouse He was born from his parents, did not accept it. The book is about his life and refers to the journey he leaves and travels home. He thinks he feels like a cat named Snowball and Snowball thinks he can not speak Snowball. <br /> <br /> They rotate all this film. The only thing that was saved from the book I think is the races and names of the ship.
