"John Hughes's son wrote a high school drama! Wow!" When I watched the fluctuation information here, when I arrived late on Saturday night, I saw the initial credits of the BBC2. <br /> <br /> I ended up seeing it, unfortunately, it was down. han You can not undoubtedly ruin this film, but I will leave it to disasters. <br /> <br /> There is little style on a few substances: unfortunately, the style has not been released for eight years. In terms of substance, the film tries to present an interesting character of social control through the school and the microcosm of life; But underneath the bright veneer, it fails to produce an argument remotely significant or important. The characters are traumatized, the writer's father fell into the stereotypical genres he wanted to question. <br /> <br /> The director Kyle Cooper is doing a decent job keeping pace (maybe a little bit too confident, which is a great future soon, but at least encourages the story) but his effort. Do not hurt the inadequate script and a curious quiz (as someone would put in 'Maddox' mode, when Blake Shields's gurns and glovess through the piece I can not understand), mentioning a lot of citations. holes (all creative license, but "bad" "good men" know their identities, because they make life miserable, but they do not stop, why do you have to ask why this script was not in the process of making any other news before - Daddy- he also read?). <br /> <br /> I'm sure that young audiences can enjoy this movie (and power for them), but they're really better than Mr. Hughes. with the secondary productive of the institute, and the idea of ​​school-time riot if it is real. Appeals, the "If so ..." class 1968 is a much better study on the subject.
