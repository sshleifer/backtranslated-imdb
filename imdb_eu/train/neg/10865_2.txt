I love munna bhai MBBS but "Lagge raho ..." SUX really SUX. I have never seen this movie asperity in my whole life. And did these high scores really impress me, what happened to Indian cinema fans? <br /> <br /> ** HURTING HOURS ** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A little girl got a hint He needs a Bhai, who discusses his personal problem. Do you come across phones and phones in the world? I agree that movies should be fictional, but these things can be really harmful. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10 (2 stars from 15 minutes)
