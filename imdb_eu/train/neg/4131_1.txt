This movie must be nominated for a new genre: The whole component! Except for one or two rumors and gore scenes, the movie is a waste of time. Calling "Campy" is not even cuts. "Campy" is funny because this movie was not fun. You spend the first half of the film: "It's better to get it, right?" As a matter of fairness, at the end, at the end, when the "brother / sister" team explained what they are and what they want, you're almost out of the question, because the second part of the second part of the movie asks you exactly why Mrs. Onorati and Pacula did something wrong for someone like that stuck with terrific film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
