If this film has a budget of 20 million euros, I would like to know where the money is. A monkey could make better CGI effects, then it was wasted about 3 hours on that piece of garbage. Although machines and martyrs really play, in the original 1 game of the station, and the first PC games seem to be very pleasing. Had it not been a match in the mid-90s? What is the puzzol about where did the money go? The Pendragon film could make an excellent movie with a good old model and a computer-controlled camera with George Lucas Lucas around 1975-83, and the actors look really like (or in this case the same spoils) about 20 million. This is surely the worst film made by EVER! I would rather see seeing it again in Ishtar's 24-hour repetition projection. I totally hated it! I got back I have said that this is the EVER movie, unlike other bad films like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes, or those that conquer Santa Claus, the movies that are so badly for you are your hearts, they will love you. There is no love for this movie and there is no DVD library. I sold it to a man for a dollar. The money in the movie is a bet and a lot of other vices. Honorable Pendragon movies! I want to make my money back!
