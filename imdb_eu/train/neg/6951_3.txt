Do you not hesitate calling steak but does the restaurant give you chicken? <br /> <br /> I felt like I was "Battlestar Galactica". Arguments can be made on top of quality, but they remain true, not mandated by fans. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you were sitting in that proverbial restaurant that I mentioned. You're waiting for years to recover the beloved New York Strip. When arriving, they bring the "New York Strip" to a chicken dish. You complained, but the server only says "but cheek, that's really exciting!" Do you really care that chicken is good? You would like the New York Strip! The server explains, "It was a matter of course, what the chef wanted to do, as a zayzing NEW, we thought it would be a cheeky popular with our previous deesh name." You are asking whether you will find out in the New York origin menu, but you know that you have a dish called "New York Strip" in the restaurant, you never know the original New York band. always again <br /> <br /> Creating something like that happens and applauding the name "Battlestar Galactica". <br /> <br /> * This small series is damaged by the original show! * <br /> <br /> It is unrivaled that the production team responsible for this new version, of course, was the contempt of the original. A team that reverts to BG AMOR loved the original series - the fans tried to find the improvement they liked and do not try to sell this new series outright with the use of Battlestar Galactica. NEW to give a show, then DO! Give a new name! Do not use the name we remember by name in the effort to join the audience. This will steal the view of the appearance of the future in the future. <br /> <br /> We've been waiting for 25 years now because we'd like something from what we know! We did not just want NAME and the footprints of the basic concept. The original series LOVE some things! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the best elements of the original were probably not there. Surely, the original BG is not perfect and can use some updates. This new series, however, does not have improvements in any aspect, but special effects (which, according to current regulations, are not good and good). <br /> <br /> Many audiences will debate the New Exhibition, but we do not apologize for the destruction of our dream of SciFi and Ron Moore. <br /> <br /> That said ... The merit of this new minute I will give you some comments (not in relation to the original): <br /> <br /> The fights sequences were the best part. The effort, of course, was to make the effects look "more" and "wow - look at that effect". I would not say that these sequences were unique to the current rules, but they fit with the original cables. What was this "pseudo-direct camera"? Some views attempted to monitor the "real" effect of the camera, with remote monitoring and cavity zoom. However, it was overused, considering that there was no apparent source of these cameras. The infinitely intelligent Babylon 5 series is the only case I have ever used "live cameras" when we witnessed the Security Camera's action. <br /> <br /> Script, are you asking? As was written by a teenager's writing for other teens. The characters felt cardboard and stereotyped. In fact, the entire story was collected through other well-known stereotypes. The good features of the whole story were just a few of the elements stored in the original serial. It was obvious that your television's average audience digestion was "completely". <br /> <br /> Human interaction was wonderful. In a subtle, subtle, and drama-based look, every moment of human tension was so prominent that it lost its ability to move the fine viewer. This was evident in any interaction between Adama and son. The director must clearly try to avoid the audience being the best and most believable, even if he does not pay attention. Sorry, but real men are not constantly playing. <br /> <br /> I would not have considered this when it was a BAD show itself. Nothing great True SciFi fans or craftsmen will never remember, but it may be for people to watch. But I lived without it. I only saw how he captured the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> This miniature is a symbol of how to remember how much the quality of stories has always neglected. SciFi Channel also produced products produced by SciFi Channel in front of the true niche market, science fiction enthusiasts. We asked for a chop and asked for chickens, despite complaints. <br /> <br /> I will leave only one thought - <br /> <br /> No "MOORE". <br /> <br />
