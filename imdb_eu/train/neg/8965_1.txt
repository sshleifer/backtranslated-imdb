A small budget, a type of film that is intended to capitalize on the success of the original for television. I'm a fan of B movies, and this could have been good if they did not add the name "Cube", because the original director and line were better, and the taste for the whole series was ruined by my movie. Characters are annoying and topical, there are problems with monitoring and they have failed to produce a lot of production. The story can hardly be developed, because of a dialogue without conversation and that is why it suffers. They use roughly the same coin horror films over the film, and because the first ones are so good, this is just a mistake. I'd probably give a movie, four. The "1" rating I gave was almost the expression of what was being watched by quite a few effects and intelligence.
