Yes, horrible Why would not you use real actors? Look, this must stop! Do not use actor! If you want to have credibility or messages through these low-budget films ... please use real actors for God's love! Most will be free ... take advantage! Now I returned to my comment ... however, humor was less than the bathroom variety and it was not fun at all levels. In terms of quality ... in a scene recorded on a public transport bus, you can see the island's crew ... what do you guess? It was a guy who looked like a Sony camera, and probably not. Well, I think the only viewer of this film is people with fetish fetishes ... and he was not good at all.
