Ziab la ta'kol al lahem is a horrible movie. This is not the addition of unlimited scenes. The act is very bad, as well as the presence of the good actress Ezzat El allayli. But something stunning in this movie, talking about sexuality, emancipation, is that nude scenes are very rare in Arabic cinema, even today. I congratulated the director and the actors for their courage. We want to see more of this style in Egyptian films, but with a better quality. The reasons that motivated me to vote in cinema are not just scenes and performances, but lack of professionalism. This movie resembles amateurs. We can see a lot of errors on the screen. If you want a good Alava movie, Ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not recommended. But if you want to promote movies without Arab cinema around the world, see and make your friends and family the same family.
