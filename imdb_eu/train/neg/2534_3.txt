* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> This movie is written with "Lifetime forever". Often, the final scene is considered as a reference, but it describes it more thoroughly once the dead and buried series after this unexpected transmission after this sharp and illogical shipment. <br /> <br /> There are "hey kids, let's say, about this telemovie, a show, it's nice to be among the places, some fans will feel like an event, when they enjoy selecting all the camera's appearances, writer and co-producer Tom Fontana friends will meet friends and favorites of other shows, as well as true Baltimore characters. <br /> <br /> That's almost completely back. TV members show a lot of mistakes, your favorite old and later non-favorites. <br /> <br /> Barry Levinsons, Fontana, James Yoshimura, and quality conscious executive producers were always the rest of the group of creative anti-executives of the NBC budgets, who wanted a bunch of police officers like "Nash Bridges" to regularly win "Homicide" ratings. This has overwhelmed his form and provoked a show that totally provokes a timid sensation. <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Fontana's film is nothing more than the writer Yoshimura and Eric Overmeyer and Jean de Segonzac. he threw a towel. They took the most exciting story from Serio, aligned with a new artistic and unsuccessful line of land, and burdened the burden of burden from all the messes. <br /> <br /> Shortly, it's been a while since the last episode of the show. The heart of the Baltimore murder unit, Yaphet Kotto, as lieutenant to Al Giardello, is currently the candidate of Kurt Schmoke, and Schmoke himself has appeared. But this hopefulness will begin immediately and it will surely happen tragically. <br /> <br /> Focus Giancarlo Esposito will change Giardello's son Mike. A handsome man who made a beautiful job somewhere else, Esposito later became a supposedly beautiful television cartoon. But the viewers always had the question: Mike is as uncomfortable as Gee's son, or is Espoo uncomfortable in the role? <br /> <br /> In order to be fair, Esposito does not have the main story to take. without interruption. That is why writers have chosen this moment to revive another story that was inspired by the loyal voters of the show. <br /> <br /> An apparent streaming video was promoted and seems to have happened on the Internet. After some red tuna, the suspect was arrested for alleged suspected suspects. But Zalko Ivanek forgot about the harassment and abuse of state lawyers and the suspects were released, only to die later. <br /> <br /> Summary: he sent formalities because he was not there. The most prestigious cases of his career, the mayor, the attorney general, the governor, the entire Legislative of Maryland, the US Attorney General, NBC, Court TV, BBC, AP, Reuters, People, The Sun, Washington Post, New York Times, LA Times, Time Magazine, The The Times of London, The Economist, Johannesburg Mail and Guardian, L'Osservatore Romano, Le Figaro, Paris Match, L'Equipe and Computer World were not called every 10 minutes. to ask about the situation of the case. <br /> <br /> However, old detective groups and associated flocks have returned to Baltimore. There is a vast set of talents. Unfortunately, with limited number of conversations, only some of them are displayed. <br /> <br /> Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, one of the strongest actors, have criticized the criminal as Jon Seda is losing time. and Michael Michelle could be better spent on ads. Writers have this satirizing, Jason Priestley presents as a big deal deal detective. On the other hand, Michelle Forbes will easily come up with the scene. <br /> <br /> There is another sly casting with Lieutenant Gary D'Addario, with the center of the book. The show was created, playing another detective. Guests came out of other shows, such as Whitney Allen's "Miss Sally", "Miss Sally", who loved the "Oz" prisoners from Fontana for a children's show. Dina Napoli of WBAL TV will appear. <br /> <br /> Although they are entertaining, these guests may be very careful. Ed Begley Jr. really advances the story in his short appearance, as Dr. Victor Ehrlich plays "in other places" of Fontana. He still has a great deal of vitality and goes into one of the hospitals. Do you remember, was not St. Elius's autism a fantasy boy? <br /> <br /> The most useful kai is the corporation's synergy. This film was made when Court TV purchased the same rights as the series. Helen Lucaitis, who was interviewed by Homicide, later appeared on "Oz". The television correspondent is working efficiently to summarize the news, that is, to recover points. <br /> <br /> Even though Lucaito goes back to the side, Lucaitis also handles a bit of physical comedy. . He deserves it in the scenes of his Lucaitis, with his usual colleagues. Perhaps both of them should do a spin-off. <br /> <br /> As the movie goes down, the cream of the castilla is rising to the top. Although they are saddled with the script loss, Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor have passed. Their audiences have reminded their shows, Homicide, big shows, the best aerial show and one of the best television productions. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch senior professionals; It's a shame that this movie does not give more options. Without a doubt, hardcore fans will want to watch this movie, but you can live without it.
