I am a fan of the original book and this is a bad adaptation. First of all, he has decided to be a kiddie toon or an adult, a strange mixture of an adult story and a curious little duck that creates rather dreadful dancing at the beginning at the beginning "fun". <br /> But it is not very important, the film is boring, moving and not with the original story. Orwell does not disappoint all the points he wanted to make about his book. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> Second revolution? !! Did not the boys learn anything ?? Then who is next to Napoleon? Benjamin? !!
