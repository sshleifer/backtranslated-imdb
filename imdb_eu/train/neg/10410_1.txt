This is an endless conversation with monologue and dreadful confusion that is confusing and confusing. This is not excessive: you have to make a huge effort to try to get involved. <br /> <br /> I really thought that Fassbinder would have something interesting, why he's sued by Erwin / Elvira. But instead, someone tries to explain to every scene: "When it was young, this happened ..." and "Casablanci returned and ordered to cut everything ...", etc. <br /> Soon in the movie, Erwin / Elvira sits in the slaughterhouse with a friend of prostitute (he is definitely a good place to take a slaughterhouse) and he tells the story of Elvir's life. Fassbinder kills one cow after another. It is difficult to pay attention to those who are disturbing or travesty. Of course, we find very strong and bold symbolism "I have suffered a lot in my life and I will die." <br /> <br /> In one of those moments that really is happening, Erwin / Elvira will find her old lover, but it's like going to the level of homosexuality with the other two, even after a very homogeneous choreography, she is familiar with Elvira. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting shots and ideas. I must admit (when the messenger tells the story of young Erwin), but the film is wasted on Fassbinder's self-indulgence.
