and it does not help the Rohmer case a few years later that Syberberg had come up with a great deal of work on the same subject (with a little help from Wagner). <br /> <br /> maybe this movie is not "It looks so bad when it came out, without comparing it with syberberg, it was probably shot in a smaller sound stage with fewer resources. Actually, I do not remember whether there are horses in the syberberg cinema. I know, however, that the German version is pure magic; This, on the other hand, is similar to some documentary films for archives. <br /> <br /> music ... la musique ... is not paid at all here on IMDb ... but someone based on "twelfth-fourteenth-century air" or "something" ... The great support of the film is not authentic and bad, comme le frommage mon cher. !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition, .
