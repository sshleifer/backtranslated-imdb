I have read some comments on the Internet, such as "... hard-working accommodation ..." about this movie, "the camera never turned into a really violent screen ...". But none of them is true. The camera never has a screen because it is not on the screen. The scene itself is repeated again one hundred and one hundred times. The woman is on the table, the murderer sometimes raves women, the murderer divides women (you never see this whole movie!). The police came and arrested. The murderer deceives the jury. Filmed In Germany we would say: "Viel LÃ¤rm um Nichts". In the end, one of the most boring films ever seen. It is not recommended.
