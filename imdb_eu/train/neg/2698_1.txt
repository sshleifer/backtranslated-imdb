John Singleton shows how this racist shows. It represents white and other races, as is our evil system in our education system. How quickly he forgets that the education system is the same and he has failed. Ice Cube's character is the image of a horrifying black man who was in charge of most horrifying movies. Singleton almost did not touch the black and white characters who wanted to get together. When Omar Epps says "They must be with my people," this rational note said the volume. And John, do not think for a minute that they did not pay attention to the stairs of Thomas Jefferson's tower. Beautiful touch!
