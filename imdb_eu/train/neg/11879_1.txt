My wife and I rented this movie, because some people drew a parallelism between "Office Space". Blockbuster and IMDB were also "recommended" as the "Office Space" choice. <br /> <br /> Now I have seen probably Office Space 15 or 20 times. I love. It's probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Over the years, they reminded me of the exciting, humorous characters that my characters impressed. "Haiku Tunnel" is like "office space", because they are two movies. This ends the similarity. It is likely that sitting on the HT for the first 50 minutes will be a bit hesitant to wait, but rather * pray that it would be better. It was not. We could not take it anymore and stop the tape. Thanks to God it was a free rental. Then I would pay. We should focus on sitting by it. Now, as we have not seen at the end of the day, maybe it is a miracle that comes together and it is recovered. I have no doubt. <br /> <br /> Haiku tunnel is so bad that it is hard to believe that it has ever been produced. The movie is not very painful. Send a letter already! Assigned premise. Jokes are awesome "The printer did not work" we had to get the scene and stop it. We can not take it anymore. This movie is EMBARCAMENTED by Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Office Space ...... do not waste time with this turd. 0/10
