I think that this movie is very well made and it is reasonably accomplished. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANYTHING I could not pass. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's a game that's about the idea of ​​"Russian-Russian" that has an hour to complete. It's a serious problem if you are performing a "live show", your competitors will be miserable to draw the "real" bullet first. So what do you do? You must complete the 50-minute show and show nothing. The corollary is fine, you reach the end and the first five players survive, with the six numbers bullet and can not make any money. At that moment he will not shoot himself, so it's similar to the climate. <br /> <br /> The second problem, almost as great. Human nature People are hungry, they will scare to underground underground clothing and otherwise they will do things that are not good for TV. Too much courage That's why "real" reality television is really well-scripted and even more well-edited. <br /> <br /> (Random thing is a "performance artist" of women's sacrifices, which was historically strange, even though this was a precautionary approach, without firing himself. <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> We thought that the ratings of the show were going on the first morning of the morning (it was not difficult), a girl announcing each momentum. <br /> <br /> The race and gender point are surprised. The films are two minority (gay) and two female competitors, so we're left with two white men and, of course, a few of them are fond of shopping, but the purpose of this show is random, but the man who least likes is a guy who dies . <br /> <br /> Klimax is fighting for a suicidal television after two hours, the character Eva Mendes (Mendes has produced and starred in these things, so he does not have to blame himself), really It grows up when someone dies. What happened THINK? Instead, he shoots himself out of all things about himself (without explaining why) and the show has been a success. Really <br /> <br /> The problem of satire in the media must have some basis in reality, so it must be up to date, playful and pleasing (like networks). This is not.
