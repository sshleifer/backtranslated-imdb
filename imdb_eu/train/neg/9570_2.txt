For the first time in the years, I felt it necessary to sign in to the IMDb by writing a review of this movie today, because seeing it is pretty diehmic. The earth seemed amazing to me while I was reading, I expected a thriller of a minimal mysterious, claustrophobic phantom hunt. Unfortunately, a plump and lively story of love is so much spoiled, "a bad movie that is not a movie," that is, there are too many strokes out there. agonized <br /> <br /> Here is the bad crime against these short films: <br /> - The script plays so hard in coincidences and stupidity and inexplicability. it's horny No, really, it's angry. And lazy. <br /> <br /> - Related to: cheap emotions. Long parade "at the moment" moments. <br /> <br /> - The main characters. Well, it seems that the scriptwriter has never lived true human beings in real life, but has won all his knowledge about bad films. So, his characters are second-generation boring topics. Empty groundplates, placeholders are without any curious personality. "Men and women are still loved by one". Except for 100,000 movies ever seen, it's not realistic or enjoyable. Think about the two-dimensional Hollywood holiday and you've got it. There is not a character in this film too remotely fresh, charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> - To fall into a very wrong and very wrong resolution and a boost, even if the word "resolution" might be wrong here, the movie is a swampy mix, but it will not go anywhere. When you're passing it, it does not matter anymore. The last one third of the rounded-up movie, to be seen was one last that was overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Okay, that's it. Anything that retrieves this movie is impossible to bury. Do not watch this turd.
