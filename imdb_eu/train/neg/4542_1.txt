I watched this movie with the multitude of the "spiritual" New Age-type, unlike me, this movie was very enjoyable --- although the book is also known (it seems that there is a book that has more nonsense), the movie is not quite good. So if you go to become "spiritual", you can believe or at least "things like" aura "and" astral body ", and do not consider the term" energy "out of context. In physics or technology, you would really like the movie, and you probably have more to enjoy any book-based apparently. <br /> <br /> However, especially if you join the physical universe, your ability to break credibility is easy if New Age's inactive nonsense and plot-based plots are depleted, as well as the small tolerance of small-scale lightening spirituality and perhaps perhaps Woodworking woodworking is not a real conversation then. This is my recommendation about this film: Stay. Out <br /> <br /> Do not think so. Tonight, the movie Dungeons and Dragons moved the worst movie I had ever seen in film theater (I did not go to see the bad films I had, such as Plan 9, etc.). At the same time, I went through almost two films (D + Bena the Other). I do not travel in movies, not even this, but for the first time I saw the visual representation of an aura, since New Age BS continues to grow thicker and thicker than that. <br /> <br /> Earth is about a group of people with some old prophecies looking for spiritual illustration and the evolution of mankind to the next step. Or something like that. The next step towards human evolution really speaks of the next step towards human development, that is, the most humble idea of ​​human evolution. The movie is full of rumors like that. Sometimes people would probably be described as "other dimensions" or "other planes", only to become invisible to those who do not have the illustration. Godliness. <br /> <br /> In the end, the director protects the audience with the "ideas" that make up "prophecy", probably to learn and make the cinema better and clearer to the people. <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie? Some beautiful plans of nature, and some decent help from Elizondo and Almeida. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that they take a person seriously if my film is considered to be interesting or acceptable. It's really spiritualism of any kind of background, and if that's not the case, you need to spend your time and money on something else.
