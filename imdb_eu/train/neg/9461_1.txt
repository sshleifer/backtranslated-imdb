The Cat in the Hat is just a slap on the face movie. Mike Myers is not as funny as Cat in the Hat, and Mike Myers can not go wrong. This is the worst movie ever. The play and the story have been awesome. I mean Dr. Seuss's beloved tale in the film and one of the worst and most desperate films of all time. I could not see the worst movie, also Baby Geniuses. But this movie is very bad, I can not describe this movie that was very bad. Bo Welch must be shot or the writer should. <br /> <br /> Hedge view: 0/10 Without star F
