"Meatball Machine" has been the science-fiction ridiculous I have ever encountered, to be the most complex of the most terrifying movies that is overwhelming and overwhelming. It is a good against evil and is a tale of an older age, with the aim of entertaining with a bloodthirsty, noisy and humorous context. For this reason, violence is not particularly terrible and you do not mind it, but it is free of blood supply and nudity. The worst I've ever seen in the shows of Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka, this is not enough by an unknown director named Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie is all, the bone is bad! It's time to watch b-movie freak! ... Simply: enjoy and strange jewelry.
