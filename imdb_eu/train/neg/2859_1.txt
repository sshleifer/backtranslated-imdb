It's been done in 2007 and it's a bad movie for CG 1998. There is a stop for a movie from a dinosaur movie that stops in film, but CG also looks very amateur. worse <br /> <br /> The writing, performance and management of this movie is all terrifying. This is as bad as Raptor Island and worse than 100 million BC ... just crap! Once again, as with other films, it is the only thing that is really scary about this movie, and it is currently expanding into the science fiction channel. <br /> <br /> I still do not understand how to activate people with some kind of activation so that they can play in those movies, and then all the other people in the movie can do a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> If you're not sure, the other poster is obvious. It's sarcastic in his review ... or he's the people who worked in this movie.
