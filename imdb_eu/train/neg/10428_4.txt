Did someone else feel it as a betrayal? The first hours were pretty strong but last. My God It seemed predictable and cursive. It's not terrific, as the show has been. Most reviews have been read, but I do not understand why. I predicted the previous WAY in general, I predicted, but then I pulled it back, I thought "No, I would never do it, that is, a very fall." I can not accept it. I'm so happy. I think I'm ready to go to the front door to sell it for the owner. Someone please. Change the idea. I love this one. So bad Someone told me why I'm wrong. Great show Awful ending
