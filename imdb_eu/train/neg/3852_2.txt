Was this one of the most boring movies ever seen? I do not know why? The guy you want to marry, and when someone else thinks it, your story begins. The story has been said a thousand times. Nothing is new or innovative. <br /> <br /> I do not know really what's wrong with this movie. This is a very entertaining time when most types of actors / actors come together to create a million-times-a-month movie. The clear thing is that there is usually no other place anywhere. For some reason, this is not paying attention to you. You can get some fun pieces or clear ideas, but for some reason they are not fun or clear? I would like to explain the news, but I do not? Do not waste just your time?
