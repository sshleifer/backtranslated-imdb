Do not bend around it. There are many things with this movie. It is located all the way, it is not very fun, predictable and open. Let's start from the beginning: the characters. It's absurd, with a happy character - Stiller gives another point in his sensuous buzzing belt - he is supposedly wild, but actually, it's quite normal, the love's interest - Aniston works well, but he did not need any effort - fat, wonderful friend , and then the variety of topicals: brave annoying Australian guy, a confident guy from Spain, and so on. Storyline: The home is a bit unusual, but later, any standard movie style, as a preverse deal on each plot. your average challenge joke. The main problem was the "development" of Stiller's character. Like the school's average theater, writers knew where it started and where it ended, but did not put enough of it in half. In the end, supposed "jokes" were not very versatile versions of the standard; There was no regulation of the Chunder scene, men sweating fat, etc. <br /> <br /> As a result, the simple act of this movie is the only thing to learn to mean meaning 'shart'. Hanburgon drank a dog here, and Stiller and Aniston's sugar coats were held by the audience, but eventually the taste was quick. <br /> <br /> Last comment: this movie may have been horrible, but Aniston still chose a better Friends-seasons movie than Kudrow's "Marci X".
