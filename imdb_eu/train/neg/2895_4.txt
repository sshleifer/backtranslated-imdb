The premise of this movie is included in the DVD box. A textile worker develops a wonderful flesh that does not degrade. But the movie fails. Instead, he covers it for 45 minutes before making a big discovery, by noticing the preamble. The audience does not look much like a boy who seems to be much more beneficial, it's a strange chance: the movie has been successfully blocked on any topic. After the discovery of the fabric, the film explains quickly how bigwigs of the industry want to invent their own invention, leaving the film with two weak movements; inventing chemistry and oppressed. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why I would describe the comedy. The tone is not funny or comical. It's like serious social criticism of that era: capitalism drives supply chains and production. This also prevents the arrival and improvement of world innovation. Yes, surely, it's true, but even if they're not playing in front of them, the movie is just a serious argument. You need a broad definition of comedy to find here. <br /> <br /> This is known by British Meet John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe?).
