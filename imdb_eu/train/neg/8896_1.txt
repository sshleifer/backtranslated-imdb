I watched Brigadoon TV last night (September 12, 2009). I'm 61 years old and I can see films while I remember them. Actually, I can say that Brigadoon only sees the worst movie I have ever seen. Accents were shameful. Local children's clubs would create better sets. The characters were so woody; surely, they rang from the tears of the sponsors who unfortunately saw it. It is hoping that the stars of this film will have enough to protect from the shamans they had to endure for watching this movie. The owners of this trip should offer a great service to humanity and destroy all copies of this film.
