Nice essay and good ideas (recovery from prostitutes, helping humans ...) but a bad result ... The director obviously tried to emulate Tran Anh Hung from French colleagues, which is what we portray in a relaxed atmosphere. Vietnam ... The only problem is that Viet Nam is gone and there has been a history of "green smell of papaya" ... trying to project this type of atmosphere (sounds and slow pace of life). ..) in the current days leaves a false feeling. In addition, it creates a feeling of boredom and the result becomes evident. <br /> <br /> The event takes place only in Saigon or Da Nang, Harvey Keitel, formerly a former seaman in the movie. He was probably in war ... But in the south of Viet Nam, there is no one or very few people who speak with the North African accent that shows the actors ... Seriously strange too bad speakers. <br /> <br /> An old old poet ... very doubtful (not a disease for his disease), a farmer's reading and writing poetry in Vietnamese ... doubtful ... <br /> <br /> < br /> <br />
