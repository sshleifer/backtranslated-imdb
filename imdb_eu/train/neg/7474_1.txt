This program is not for me, but I'm a fan of the genre. The main factor that was disappointed was not one single scene that was not the main character. This made it two-dimensional and I gave it up before the end of the program. <br /> <br /> I would leave my criticism when I was not a film critic, but the IMDb's instructions say, you have to make 10 comments. Hudson Hawk reminded me that the main character was in a single scene, and I hope the writers of this program can offer more diversity to the audience. I do not doubt the talent of teammates, just after seeing things like "wire", I hope the drama of the police is excellent.
