I saw the "Rachel's Attic," I thought I was enjoyable and enjoyable on horseback. However, it did not happen. Visceral, yes, but nice? It would be great, fat, no! In fact, the only reason I gave him "3" is that Gunnar Hansen (so short) appears to be one of the most abusive characters in the film. Hansen ... I never knew how they never worked. The story is interesting, but poorly executed. Pedestrian direction and performance is mediocre. They are special effects worse than that. Yikes !!! I have seen better things in school theater. Leave, Mr., W, it's time to change the career ... I hear you are hiring Mel's Diner! There are very few films, the Indie films created in Michigan ... and "Rachel's Attic" is not one of them.
