I've always loved the bill, the script and the great characters, but I finally feel that soap has become an emotional one. If you see the promotional photos or posters of the bill, the officers will see you embrace each other or, in addition, you will be able to see something related to friendship for some time with the promotional image of the invocation of the crime. This shows that the police's dramatic drama has shown a lot to the average television soap. When I see it, I feel like I'm seeing a Coronation Street police version or something similar. I still have to say that I like the bill when I'm interested in police work and things like that, but I'm really asking for the greatness of Bill. I want to rate it from a quarter, because you have to admit that the people who take the bill have completely ruined it. <br /> <br /> The script and the characters down, most of the time most of the great characters have disappeared (although some still believe) and I do not say that the newest characters are poor or nothing, because there is no doubt, They are lacking in hard-hitting, personality and script lines. old people used newcomers and family problems <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He has lost a lot of uniqueness (if it's a good spelling) and would now name him as a horrible television picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
