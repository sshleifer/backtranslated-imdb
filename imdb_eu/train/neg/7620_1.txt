I rented this movie, it seemed pretty interesting to me, but it was my worst movie I ever saw in My Fear! I read the Gumby-8 comment and have to be a member of the cast or crew. Gumby-8, unless he is a member of the 4-year-old child or worship member, should not consider any potential movie. <br /> <br /> I can not believe Gumby-8 comments. <br /> <br /> Quote: From "Duna" the initial animation was inspired by the fast pace ... this film maintains the eye movement and works well to repeat that it is not unexpectedly seen. "/> Animation was the only part of the film that was of interest and the film is still eye-catching. Well, they are looking for suspense of any kind. I mean, I had a break for Halloween, they shot me with a budget of $ 100,000.00 and they also painted a mask and become a classic worship. "Repeated visualization is unforeseeable "I think he has written. <br /> <br /> Another Gumby-8 budget is the only fan:" It's also a powerful part of the operation movie. "<br /> <br /> Regarding respect for all actors, their performance is more than the talent of Robert Napton It's not. <br /> <br /> Exciting excitement: "Be careful with the time between the moon and the darkness." /> <br /> There's no darkness or darkness in this movie. <br /> <br /> MPA The rating is "Rated of a Violent / Rated R" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br I know that it could be sticky grasses. <br /> <br /> In short, I've seen horror movies from the 50s and 60s. I saw that they were totally worse and they were very good. The director of this film did not make any attempt, he was asleep or took an acid blow. In any case, I think the actors are trying to recover the bad work they deserve to be applauded. This movie would give me a rating for the movie .5 "B".
