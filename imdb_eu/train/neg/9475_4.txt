They made beautiful photos and played well in general, but the script is very unknown. There are such scenes of conviction that there is no joy in the viewpoint. The young lover, like a twin brother, was terribly trembling. And the "emotional bulb connection" also seems terribly. <br /> <br /> I do not know, however. If you like to have some glasses of wine and you want to relax with some beautiful comedy scenes with a beautiful look, this movie is pretty good. No effort is required from the viewer. But Italian films, especially Italian comedy, are much better than this.
