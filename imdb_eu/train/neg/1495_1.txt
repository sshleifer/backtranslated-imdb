I've been watching horror films for 5 years, and I started with Childs Play. Since then, I've seen good horror movies and it's a bad thing, but I'm sure, I've ever seen the DUMBEST movie! The actors did everything they did with the material. The land was stupid. Besides, it was just all the gore. I burn a lot of blood, but that was so ridiculous! In a scene, a character sneezes on the back and strikes the intestines! Stupid! Another problem in this film is the boring and probably the slowest film ever made. In the end it's just a mute. But it goes on again! At the end, when the girl / ancestor moves away, she receives help from an old woman. The old lady is making tea, but when the girl turns around, the girl attacks her. He became a Kanibal! Delayed film
