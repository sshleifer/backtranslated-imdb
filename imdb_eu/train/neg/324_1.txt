The worst mistake in my life. <br /> <br /> I received this movie for Target for 5 dollars, I thought, "Hey, Sandler can get some ridiculous laughs." I was wrong, completely wrong. In the middle of the movie, my friends were sleeping and I was still suffering. The worst plot, the worst script, the worst movie I've ever seen. For an hour I wanted to knock against the wall, then I would stop and you know why? Because he felt ill After knocking the head, I saw the damn movie stuck in the microwave and burned it up ... and felt better than what I had ever done before. American Psycho, Army of Darkness, and Kill Bill needed to overcome this. I HATE SANDLER, THROUGH YOURSELVES THAT, AND ALL YOUR LIFE DOES DO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
