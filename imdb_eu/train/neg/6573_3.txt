I read reviews for this and while I did not expect Ryan to save a private, I expected a movie of a substance. <br /> <br /> The film is very fond of the usual introduction to history and how the unit came. being in But it's just 1944 and you do not know where it is. Accents, etc., are very poor because this unit is from Hawaiian / Asian American, but everyone talks about a very poor imitation of a Japanese Englishman in Harvard. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 10 out of 10 after 10 minutes, I could not see it anymore. The characters were of a dimension and I did not feel like those based on real people, and that's why I did not care. A very bad television medium movie that will be shown at midnight on a cable channel. I would avoid better efforts and I looked at him. <br /> <br /> This is a good story, but it's better to say it. In this sense, the director saw the band of brothers and thought he was enough to sell the movie. My advice, avoid and watch the band of the brothers, like Tuskegee airmen, Glory or any other movie, when the trumpet disappears ...
