Broadway's music "A Chorus Line" is the best in music theater. It is about the experiences of people living in dance; joyful experiences and sacrifice they make. Each dancer will listen to the pieces in the Broadway choir lines. However, each of them comes out of their way of life as stories of dancing rested. <br /> <br /> The movie version shows the passion or beauty of the stage, and it is undoubtedly the worst film adaptation of a Broadway music, without any affection and no love for dance. of any kind <br /> <br /> Sir Richard Attenborough made the biggest mistake of the director's assignment, which he offered for his "Gandhi" touch. Why would anyone ask the director to a pretty limited place that directs a musician to the epic director? <br /> <br /> What leads us to the next problem. The "A Chorus Line" scene is staged in a theater, limited real groups and costume modifications. It's a lie in the music of Broadway, and its simplicity is glory. However, this is not filming well, and nobody wants to think about it. That's why we had to take the life of these dancers, and you should leave the theater and audition process. The singers could offer their songs in other environments, and even the first ballet, jazz or tap of the group. Heck, with Broadway's dazzling imagination. However, there is no imagination to perform this film, as Attenborough danced and his show goes away, as his direction is lacking. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are correct if the dancers claim to hear the director (Michael Douglas) or not. Douglas's character is amazing when choosing someone's ears, and who is not impatient. <br /> <br /> While filmmakers were true in the theater, there were some heretical changes. "Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love" - ​​beautiful dancers returning to adolescence when they removed the wonderful number of scenes and "Surprise" was taken away with a song that was so bad that it was called a song. An Oscar By adding "damage" to "surprise", he has recovered the same story as "Hello, love", but without any doubt or pathos. <br /> <br /> There's no reason to see this movie when you transfer the Broadway show to the movie. If you want to watch a movie version of this show, the next closest thing is Bob Fosse's "All That Jazz". The daughter Fosse is part of "A Chorus Line", but she was the director of Fosse. He could know what he should do with that material, that he deserved more respect for this sad effort.
