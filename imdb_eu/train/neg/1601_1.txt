Stereotypes for posting Slasher's books are too far from their supposed entertainment. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby, and indeed the entire cast is totally wasted. Lame jokes are numerous, and all the punching lines are well-telegraphed. Extreme liners run fast, and almost all fall four as a frustrated grape. The musical numbers only help to get the whole movie up and continue. Another negative is the claustrophobia that is completely part of an abandoned school wall. Avoid and find the fun movie "Lampoon", the funniest movie like "National Lampoon's Golddiggers" - MERK
