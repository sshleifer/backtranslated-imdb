This was first for me, Tim Burton for the first time I was disappointed. POTA is not a bad movie (excellent ensembles, costumes and stunning performance) but it can be made by a humble director of Hollywood. The rhythm was very curious, the last third was waiting for the movie to finish, myself and cast. Tim Roth was brilliant, surely the only pleasure in the film. Back to Tim
