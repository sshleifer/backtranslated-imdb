I did not think it was possible, but something has come and replaced the Open House, a small budget that killed someone with a high-priced property, the worst movie ever ever seen. life. <br /> <br /> It was the best movie in the final of the Montreal film, which is believed to be accompanied by people who read all of the other wallpapers as mere voices. > <br /> Seeing this movie was like a little slice of Hell hell. It is Austrian, and Short Cuts and Blue Velvet tries to diminish, scenes of different characters that live in dark suburbs. The owner of the dog who hates fat and his young maid, his wife, a house that lives with his wife, in a house that includes a dead child's room untouched. The list goes on. Forever. I spent the theater in two hours and the same way. <br /> <br /> <br /> Yes, the characters interact, but not in a fun, interesting or more important way. I can not say if they were actors, according to subtitles, "You are!" The lines that were equivalent to the Austrian were given. Certainly, they did not have much to learn, because they each repeated at least three lines in their field. <br /> <br /> This is not Gummo, not one of those films. No need to find art, and then nothing but the "never wander in a movie" policy (that is, if the oldest couples had done during a random scene). It's not your parents unless you're in the middle of not having any idea of ​​a couple of middle-aged and unwanted couples. <br /> <br /> This film was offensive to me. It is not a hairy nudity, nor a soundtrack, nor a scene with pistols. I have been offended by someone who has really spent money doing that when able to write writers and filmmakers that are capable of financing. I ran away from someone outside, who could go to see Dog Days and asked me what Montreal could find the best. Mostly, I was guilty of the belief that everyone who attended the festival believed that the emperor was beloved and hypnotising, and that maid was clear that her wives made a striptease. <br /> <br />
