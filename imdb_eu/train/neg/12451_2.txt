This movie is the horny one, not in a good way. Fights are done very badly; Sometimes they try to break some bones and, at the same time, only two or three times, it's definitely not enough to call a kind of excitement. A gun means that the heroes are walking in the open space that 10 people can shoot, take a gun, throw it back and not get injured. <br /> <br /> The empty story, the awakening guy, loses his memory, is fighting well. Five years later, memories are back, blablabla revenge. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money, you do not really deserve the time, drink and get bored.
