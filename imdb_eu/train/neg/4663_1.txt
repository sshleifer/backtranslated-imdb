This movie was bad. I love movies of war and I can find something that I usually like far away and most of the movies, but this is not one of them. This film had no substance and intensity. I have a good time, the Finn is having a great fight, but the story is wrong. You have no connection with the character, and there is no story to follow. You go from one random scene to another; nothing to convey is trying to convey the story. If you want a live movie movie to save live movies and you're not surprising enough without a battle scene, I'd like to say "Downfall" (WWII German movie). Or if you'd like an excellent story, I would suggest the "War Brotherhood" (Korean War / Korean film). These two films will not make you a winter war.
