Marie Dressler This drama of the Depression is about the likes of the bank owner, who recently published in TCM on April Fools comedy month. If you come up with the hilarious hopes of Dressler-Polly Moran, you will be disappointed, that is, a really fake movie. It's also a bad mistake, surprisingly, it came from MGM. Leonard Smith's non-cinematographic film "set up the camera and not move school" unfortunately works, often perceived by the lines shown on the screen (such as cannon printing and scanning) or cutting heads. The film also has no director, the nature of night-time production under an apparent fly. In general, it is a disagreement with confusion, Dressler often stirs with great emotion and only strange and shadows to the bathroom.
