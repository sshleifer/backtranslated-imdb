This film would be zero, but that was not an option! This movie !!! Women can not act. I should know when I saw Bobby Brown. In my home no one could believe the channel first changed 15 minutes. Black women are ridiculous as Gunslingers are on the western days. It's not the only race, but the genre. The combination of two things is ridiculous. I'm sorry that some people in the movie are not a bad actress but the movie was horrible. it was not as credible as the movie. You may be "entertaining" to people, but I'm not in that group. lol. and using a great line from an excellent movie ... "it's all about what to say about it."
