Not even Bob Hope, helped by many beautiful actors, can keep the demands on the War Comedy bad, his patented time does not work so much. The plot involves a star in Hollywood called Don Bolton (Hope) and attempted to avoid the military at the beginning of World War II, and then went into a confused attempt to judge his daughter's colonel (Dorothy Lamour). Bolton's agent Lynne Overman and his assistant, interpreted by Eddie Bracken, are registered with him and participate in three flight workouts, filmed in the mountains of Malibu, California. Paramount has made a great budget quote, employing some of its greatest specialists, but David Butler's usual trustworthy direction was weak, and lacking is missing comedy elements. Bolton's creation of the possibility of heroism has also begun to emerge as a result of bad evidence and camera. Oddly enough, Lynne Overman gives them the best lines and this master's old man does this very well. Dorothy Lamour looks beautiful and works well, and it's always nice to see Clarence Kolb, like her father, just to watch her voice on the screen or on the radio, but they have little to save her. Assignment of script as with an error.
