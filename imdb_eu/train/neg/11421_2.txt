Surely, I will hate this movie - I think I did not approach the next generation nobility. But it's enough to say - San Elmo Sua were pretty crazy, even if the Brat Pack goes on. <br /> <br /> Here's a great example of neurosis and a self-indulgent self. everything in the 80s (RENT, anyone) Plots that are hardly in existence and philosophies are kitchy, well delivered, the rest of the time. The lack of something like a nice character does not support the situation. There was really no growth, he did not move forward. Even if the climate-suicide scene did not affect death or reality or something like a riot for adults. <br /> <br /> They hate every hatred and most predictable image of each cutie cutter. way possible Stalker is beyond the Stalker and another reason why Andie MacDowell is not beautiful. Jackas reminds us all the power that keeps you constantly reminded, yes. Gorgeous Slut really soulful, with deep savvy hidden hideout with life. Poetry makes moods and finishes 3/4 years of the film, revealing (!) Teddy bears and sun and rainbow. The Virgin finally becomes a happy man when he sacked a bag at the Virgin's bag to attack a Jackas before changing (this time). The deceitful scoundrel scares him while he is trapped. And finally, Feminists go around the sacred water on any soul that "commits". <br /> <br /> What brings me my final beef; What is the super-cement link keeping these people as friends? I can not imagine being one of them; Now think about the whirlwind created inside this narcissism. And they were so great amongst each other - the heads in the toilet, near the rape and constantly linger on their sleep. After the conversion of Feminist Gerezia, all the baboons that were sponsored by both BFF, "Umm, I really do not want to be with one of you. Let's get in touch with each other and we can get it completely inconvenient. One might know one day or the other, but you no one commits a lot of commitment to satisfaction (It's not that word!) "And they smile as everyone says" Golly gee, I never thought about that! What a wonderful idea! " <br /> <br /> It's not alone. Watching this movie is not in a good way.
