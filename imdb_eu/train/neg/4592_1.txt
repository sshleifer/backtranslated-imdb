I was angry at this movie. I constantly wanted to "scientists" and the invisible filmmakers. She is very, very painful. Sophomoric and pretentious in a bad way. There is little information about brain function / chemistry and quantum theory in a high-horse horse sh * t. The worst Delinkorts were Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza, who were rodents. Mr. Dispenza informs us that most people live in mediocrity, and clearly, this means that they live on a higher level. The ideas and attitudes that I am basically agree with are generously, maliciously, high-profile, pretentious, and predictable, I felt the desire to refuse them. I think that it was annoyed by me, that they had taken on the deep aspects of scientific thinking and had infected their new hokum age. In most cases, quantum theory is based on the application of macro-world concepts. Properly, the parts with Marlee Matlin are amusing and topical. <br /> <br /> Bill Bryson would like to say about the brilliant science survey: "A Brief History of Everything". Surprise in life and the universe is deep in the science set in science.
