When I was in school, I made a movie about a couple in a tree, and I spoke in the middle of the editing, this was not a purely aesthetic strategy but it was just a topic of Canadian cinema: unloving lyricism and metaphor. socially uncharged comments Despite the failure of my movie, I feel much better after seeing this ... this ... thing. For one thing, mine was 20 minutes ago, not 85, and with that it was more content: every four years, five, six minute tires of the business sense, they are relentless. The male lead is incredible, the philosophical performances take on an immense immersion in the face of the improvements of the philosophical ideas taken from a T-pub, and we are greatly hated. If it had not been acknowledged, if it had not been such a hole, the third act would be less meaningful, to offer a great pair of far-reaching and far-reaching echoes of "exploitation" values. but it does not make it easier for you to see the "zipper" with a full heart rate until the magazine is exhausted. I take it back to what I said about AUTUMN BORN, at least with the courage of its terrible misunderstanding: this crater is cinematic and will be the worst Canadian film of all time. At least, I really hope that way.
