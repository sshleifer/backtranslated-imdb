Just PPV'd this. I do not want to miss out on these times because most posters say better than ever, but I wanted to say some things. <br /> <br /> I did not know which one was more entertaining: Redgrave followed a few tiny seats and followed her nurse; A careful reflection of his "precious" boys (he and his lord decided to be a drunken loser) came on the road; The most prestigious Ann shouted with Peggy Lee; or the Cryptor's annoying CGI CGI looking younger! <br /> <br /> I did not buy Danes from Redgrave younger. I also did not buy Richardson and Collette sisters. If Meryl Streepen's daughter wants to be an actor, it's best to give Mama some lessons! The idea was zero because any girl (or Buddy) will fool herself with the stud du jour over Harris vapid! Ann's daughters are sucking and absurd, Luc leaves behind the crack, and I do not give them any corruption! In the afternoon it gives Chick Flicks a bad name!
