Spice Girls remembers the movie and how bad it was (as well as the songs), Simon's manager (also the director's bands) makes the same mistake as S Club (from my favorite groups) in his film. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (Paul Cattermole became the seventh partner?) Basically, they will request a break from their boss. watch yourself on TV! Three of them change, and vice versa, on the other hand, proves clones made by ardent scientists, and the other half create problems. Gareth Gates himself is also a clone. This movie may have more than one plot of Spice Girls, but it's not possible to watch "Bring it all back", "Do not Stop Movin" and "Never Have A Dream Come True". Long time since the band was well distributed. Fit!
