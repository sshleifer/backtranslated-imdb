Where to begin ... O, yes, the message sent by the bad guy: the person you have witnessed a crime committed when you found the first (to kill) was committed, did not talk about it, so another opportunity to escape. Message from the victim: when thugs talk together and argue, take this option "HELPED", do not sit down and watch them until they hear the noise they hear. Message from the director: If a 5 or 10-minute head goes on a vehicle or on foot, you can not immediately bring the boys to his heels or claws! Time and movement does not work that way. It would be nice to think that women did not brutally (4) kill men, allowing them to discourage their relationship.
