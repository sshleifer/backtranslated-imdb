As LÃ¼beck's only feature film in the "Nordische Filmtage" of this year's edition, this year's festival will be a little memory for me. <br /> <br /> This movie, which was announced as an erotic thriller, is not just an evil piece of crap! Forget the language, but there is no decent word to describe. <br /> <br /> First, the actors are not the best. Better actors would not even save the movie. For example, on the plot: after 15 minutes, it was quite clear that John was sick, his neighbors were not real and his first girlfriend died. The so-called "sex scene" is no better than anything else (blows from each other until blood goes to me without sex), but unfortunately there were no images to show. Everything else was copied by some directors, for example, for example. Lynch, but of course without his geniality. <br /> <br /> So, shortening the whole movie and saving the time and money of other audiences: the guy loses his girlfriend, the girlfriend returns home, the guy dies after the girlfriend dies. Guy finds it hot, but neighbors crazy girls, the guy has a very awesome sex with one of them (or so he thinks), he finally realizes that he is crazy and his new girlfriend and lover was in his apartment all the time ... bad story, bad actors, photos In spite of it, <br /> <br /> From 10 to 1 (for 1 point, you understand Norwegian as good as you learned Swedish - at least one afternoon benefit - and you can not choose 0 points here).
