Well, I rented this movie and I was aware that it was really awesome. This family is the same with the same foolish family and family fights; Then the fresh son comes up with his stupid camera and likes to take a picture of the damaged buildings and strange things and curious film, and then ask his father to take him to the side trip and just agree, etc., etc. abar They will go to the people they come in. Nobody knows what they exist (blah blah blah) And the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and you still do not understand what MOVIE is! I've seen a lot of mysteries in movies, but that was the worst, honestly, I do not even have a description and I do not want to see.
