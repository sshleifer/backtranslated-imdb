Ahh this film had so much potential! A good cast of quality b-actors, Jessica Simpson's thighs, and ... that's it! <br /> <br /> I think one of the marketing department named by some had an idea. Basically we can make a legally weird film, but do it in New York. Opportunity, power and money in that huge city shiny and where everybody is heartless, power / money is a hungry person. Let's add Jessica Simpson, a small town bimbo, brother Owen Wilson and apparently some Andy Dick reasons (for which only you have to leave this movie apart). <br /> <br /> Basic story: <br /> <br /> Boy leaves NY. The little girl continues, the scams of boys. The girl remains in the NY with her cousin, the work she gets through a fake job, the mukos, another boy (Brother Wilson) dares to keep together the kiss of the day. <br /> <br /> I find some words when it comes to mind, that is, it is horrible, unbearable, unbearable and xenophobic when <br /> <br /> Just watch the movie, you will be happier. A review spoke about Guantanamo and I agree with him. This movie causes shock. And I know what you're thinking ... sometime when I'll see Simpson naked or shut. It will not happen, save time and YouTube itself. You will have a better time! <br /> <br /> Is the film an indefinite edition, the performance is unbearable, and why do you use blue screens? <br /> <br /> Finally; That is to say, the film's betrayal that must be punished <br /> <br /> Why Willie Nelson almost always plays Jessica's father in any of Jessica Simpson's films and why there is no black, Latin, Asian or European . People in this movie?
