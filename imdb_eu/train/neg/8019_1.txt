I read half the comments on other users in the table and it seems that opinions vary greatly. I have to agree with those who have found this great movie. Writing to me I hardly expected that I would expect it to be great, or I would like to see it the other day. I like to contribute to independent cinema, especially if they are gay issues, but this movie is almost overly tolerant. Over the course of three minutes, as those who walked out, they did not care about getting out of $ 11.00 or just getting there nowhere, quickly and not improving. Maybe I'm optimistic ... before, or they did not pay. <br /> <br /> Logan gets bored. It's a clue. Gay da I'm good at that. The problem is that the main character of a movie is terrified that it does not mean that the film around him should be boring! There's a scene from this boy, ENDLESS, who puts it as a laundry charge, sets the scene back to what has already been learned, and the second scene, etc., etc. Nobody understands anything, it's funny or interesting. Probably the most amazing thing I did not feel empowered with Logan. This is a great achievement in itself. He did not grow, he did not change, he did not learn (there was nothing to teach), he did not do anything, and he did not even film! The same thing happened when the scene is not filmed. <br /> <br /> Besides, the title does not make any sense. 1/10.
