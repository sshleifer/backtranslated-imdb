I've seen several episodes of this show and I find some interesting elements, considering the medical events that they can learn. However, it destroys immoral relationships between the characters of the show. It seems that everyone has slept with almost everyone, even in office hours, that is, an unrealistic realm. It seems that there is no strong marriage or relationship, permanent throughout the show - everyone is broken and trace - the reflection of almost every American is not true. In fact, the lack of respect for marriage or monogamy is totally lacking and it is really wonderful. <br /> <br /> Then, the "dilemmas" are presented to endless wizards and generally solve those who diminish. who does not agree with the management of private practice and the degenerate employee. For example, one of the episodes of the last episode has been presented with a rare child born with unknown genus and that Addison does not completely refuse surgery. . They do not match the patterns and the stupid portraits. <br /> <br /> And I think anyone who is against abortion would be compromised by the viewer as a pro-lifer. Addison commented: no one was given an opinion on the subject and only one black person was given dignity for moral reasons against abortion. If you are feeling abortion in general, you feel terribly hard: it's hardly a popular US feeling. The two leading exhibitors did not mention that abortions were younger and they had no pardon or regrets, though the research may underestimate women's depression. Moreover, a girl arrives at the clinic for abortion, and then she is grateful to the staff of the solutions and someone helps this young man how they helped him and how happy he was. Predicted parents. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is a cheap, inexpensive show that is totally independent, but only if it decides to present a totally unbelievable telenovela relationship and distant medical conditions. full show
