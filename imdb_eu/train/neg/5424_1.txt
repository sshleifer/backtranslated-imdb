Mirror Mirror (1990) is a flat four-month movie. Why did I see this movie as younger? Who knows? Maybe I was to watch another movie to punish me. I do not know, I think I needed a hobby at my age. An Exclusion of a Teenager (Rainbow Harvest) searches in an old mirror. Soon, this ancient mirror learns about tremendous power and uses it to fight against those who hate it. Films like these, power lenders have side effects. This changes the inside and away whether you like it or not. <br /> <br /> D.v.d. a few years before. I do not know why. He had to leave the shelf and collect dust. People love the reason for this movie. If you do it, I would like to know why. Until then, I do not like this movie and I do not want to see it again. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended.
