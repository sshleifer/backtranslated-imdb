I really despised when I saw that movie was 6 or 7 years old, I had a great pastime with Robin Williams, but he could not do anything wrong. Until that. Robin had ruined the trash for a long time. I am recently recovering with his father's fun but serious day, but then he created another mistake, I think it was Bicenntinial Man, but it's the point. Now, Robin would get a much better job and he's been back in the muddy one of the "classic".
