There was no belief in this movie. I saw it at the 2004 San Francisco Film Festival. Before the start, the owner of the theater got up and told us how half of the audience left the theater, "world premiere". I do not play any theater, anyone understands what the movie would be like at that point. We all understand at the end. <br /> <br /> It is not a documentary, even for sale. Dark Angel was a bad biography and paid homage to Bettie Paige. Half of the movie is just Bettie Paige's old movie versions. The film lasts only 90 minutes, and the content of these 90 minutes is minimal. A scene started, someone would say "Wett Bettie is so big, why do not we make another movie." This would be Bettie Paige's 5-minute remake, almost as absurd as the movie (and even more boring) part of the movie. At the end of the film, people laughed at each other when a remake of the Bettie Paige movie was created. it was wonderful In the theater I heard a lot of laughter, but people did not laugh at the movie, the movie and its content and the structure were weaker. It was easy to say that the parties that achieved most laughter were supposed to be serious or revelatory. <br /> <br /> I know films are expensive. I have seen many independent films, but somehow, films and quality of this movie are something that I have never seen before. The movie seems to have been made for 12 dollars. Cutting out cuttings, grains and sensual plots made it a memorable experience. This movie "Dude, Where's My Car?" Looks like Citizen Kane <br /> <br /> My friends and I left the theater to torture as we paid 8 dollars. Only one part of the experience, when we thought someone made this movie and we thought it was really good, we got a laugh. It seems that the night before, the "world premiere" was the director / writer / producer among the audience and people laughed and starred in his movie. Bettie Paige's films were destroyed. They should also destroy this movie.
