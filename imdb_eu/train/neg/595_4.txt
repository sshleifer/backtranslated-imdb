Creep - "Your trip ends here." Very graphic scenes and ... well, yes, all this about this film. <br /> <br /> It's not a real plot, it's not the story. He is not a favorite character. Well, considering 'characters' is incorrect, someone does not really think about it. I mean, in the sewers they are looking for ("what is this? Why is it?)" I think it's something weird, I think it's pretty scary, but I take care of it? I do not. Why not? I do not know what these people are and I do not know I have to live or die. It's a single dimension that is based on gore and sound effects, which is rarely reprimanded. <br /> <br /> This film does not make sense, it's not intended. and I lost 45 minutes of feeling. It jumps directly into action. Basically, some women and their friends are locked in the London subway, after a strange creature escaped. <br /> <br /> Creep leaps It's a good place to have fun, good art, it's a great location and sounds good, but that's not a horror movie like that, so unfortunately it's all damaged. <br /> <br /> There's nothing new. The other " horror "predictable and makes Kate (the main character) stupid" hey, I know I'm sitting at home, I think that I should do a sensible thing in this situation, but not! I am going to be completely opposed because I am a dumb blonde. "I do not want them to be, it's so many times boring and predictable, because I am pretty angry that strange girls do not infect the extraterrestrial vaginal creatures. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "The end of your trip here" is the label of the movie. Well, Creeps travels a little bit in the movie. If you have some beers, you will return to some friends, then be sure, see all the ways But if you want something original and fast, avoid it.
