That is, indeed, a curious movie ... First of all, we are a US gymnast trying to activate the actress (or something), and seems to have never achieved the unique role (I know). good reason While the role that maintains a bit of interest is quite successful, the performance is tender and flat. Secondly, we have a worst effect on a movie that we have ever used. I'm not joking. This only makes the movie very comical, but in an annoying way. hehe And thirdly, in general, if we have a cast of a nice performance (including the necessary heat), a really bad story, and some cool images; interview, gymnastics (horny), and overall plot execution is weak. This movie will be just like a television network (Fox was not bad in 1985). It's just a bad movie. However, you can not respect yourself and enjoy yourself even more when you get used to it, especially since it has been the perfect home for night tv and late cable.
