I have just finished reading a book about work by Anita Loosen and a picture of MacDonald's TCM magazine appeared to her angel costume (awesome wings), so I would like to see this movie. I had never heard the movie before, so I had no previous ideas. He thought he had started playing Eddy Playboy for the first time in Ireland, and it seems like MacDonald did not know the secretary. The scene that looks like a dress in a party, really cute, with a simple attire of angel, with a halo of co-operativity and no need for wings. Even with the movie Eddy was asleep and seemed to be a real angel. But after a while he started to fail me. Eddy "lo" stops in the whole movie, so it's a dream. Everything that happens next does not really matter, because it dreams. The rest was a small and useless plot. I had to force myself to stick. And MacDonald's only last number that goes through the number of music from the musical number to a crazy hallucination. I think it would be much more interesting. I wanted to see more of his true characters. <br /> <br /> There was not really enough music to call a musical number. The first songs were good, but MacDonald's jitterbug number was like nails like nails. The voice of his opera was completely wrong. However, Eddy and MacDonalds still shine, showing what the true star is.
