The Danish film "Slim Slam Slum" was surprised to be the worst movie in that date. I did not think the listing of bad films was possible, but this is worth the gold. It's not fun Playing bad, shooting bad and the story is bad. The only positive thing you can say about this movie has three girls. I truly believe that this film could cause the Danish "Stjerner uden hjerner" other Danish film to be the worst damn movie ever! And that's really something. Congratulations in advance!
