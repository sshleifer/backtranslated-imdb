I'm a fan of Matthew Modine, but this film I've stumbled upon is completely impossible. I see that the scriptwriters and the directors were the same, so there was no one around to see its worst instincts. There are no surprises, original lines, and no original characters. Gold fish was basically a loving character. Which is the loss of all this talented actor. Now that shooting in New York is very expensive, I have to ask how to get it first. And if you ask why I saw it, I swore I had a cable after a movie that I liked and left while I worked on the computer. It's not a sharp picture!
