Okay, I'm blessed. I have seen two scenic productions, one of New York's original works and another in the San Diego diary (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, you rock!). Compared to one of them, the movie is almost impossible. I'm immersed in the DVD for the past two afternoons and we're not finished yet. You can not get too many conversations, and you can add the added scene and people. Yes, four great performances are pretty good. Mrs. Streep. However, compared to the scenario with the movie, it is an example "less is more". The play's thickness was a bad chance to meet the variety's performances and performances of the filmmaker. Please, please visit a scenic product somewhere next to you.
