I'm not thinking of places songs and (embarrassing shame) with bad tools and other boners right now. The mistakes are fast and rage so you have to have your toes. <br /> <br /> I did not give this one "1", especially because it was filmed by Liverpool and the actor. Rain) has given everything (Lennon is a credible person and works well). Also, the song "Cry for a Shadow" is heard at a moment and it counts to BEFORE. <br /> <br /> So, watch it fun, but do not be historically correct.
