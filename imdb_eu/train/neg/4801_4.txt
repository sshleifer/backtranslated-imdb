I really wanted this movie. Pleasant prison, conspiracy theories, wild zombies, terrible touches of 80s and an effort directed by the actor John Saxon (bad too). It reminds me of some Italian horror (dear) movies. But the direction is very woody and there is no horrible and horrible moment. It goes ahead and goes ahead and ends (logically). More seals and more daring visions and a classic worship sealed their fate.
