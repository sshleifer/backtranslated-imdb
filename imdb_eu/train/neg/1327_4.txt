This horrible film captures all Asian stereotypes that you can imagine in a huge package. With the loss of money, the reputable Japanese businessman sends Pat Morita a foul but friendly police to recover the secret industrialities of Detroit. There he meets Jay Leno, he immediately mentions a murderer called Jap and Morita Tojo. It's all that's down.
