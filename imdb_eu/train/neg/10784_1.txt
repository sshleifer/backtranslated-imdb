It was hard and painful. What a waste of a cast! I swear, the audience (1/2 full) laughed twice in 90 minutes. This is not a lie. Do not rent it too. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones has been compelling. <br /> <br /> Cusack was well. Okay I felt forgiveness (the actor), if people remember that mess. <br /> <br /> Roberts was the same as he was. Charming and sweet, but with any purpose. With John, "love" was incredibly incredible.
