I do not know what other guy was thinking about. Since this film was made independently, it was not so horrible. You can be as big as you want ... most of these movies do not care. For the first 40 minutes to be seen I was insulted. And that was not merely a mere one. The operation is horrible, but the plot never develops near. There are many holes in the story until a story is not called. I have never read the book, so I can not criticize it, but this is the first review I've written here, and it's only a matter of time for your viewer to save an hour for the rest of your life. I can not remember the last time I can not see the movie. This really takes the cake.
