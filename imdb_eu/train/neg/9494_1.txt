The only thing that amazes me about the likes of the movie is Clint Eastwood, and I admire that. The Mills had no chemistry. I did not think it was a bit deeper than lusting between them. The story is just the truth. Add stereotypes and conversations that carry a lot of plots that lead them together, and you're real. Kay Lenzen's nude scene deserves for those looking for wealth, but it's a huge time. When I saw the movie, it would be better to call "Cheesy".
