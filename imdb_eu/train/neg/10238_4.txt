The movie was good at the beginning, but it never came to the expectations. The director has a lot of talent and good camera angle and artistic ideas (the most common of Asia's directors), but he does not know how to create or tell a good story. The story was fragmented and it seems that the whole film was torn across different directions, never finding a strong, descriptive, and interesting angle. Basically, the movie never adjusts to press releases. The plays were very good. All actors gave good performances, as Jude Law was always outstanding. It's very bad to make that film so weak.
