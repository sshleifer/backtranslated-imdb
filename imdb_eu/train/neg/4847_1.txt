As usual, I am running mad, I still have not seen films before the Oscars. I really wanted to see this movie on my alley. I can not understand in my life why this film has been achieved. No story! A boy's team walks around Iraq. One day a bomb is spreading. Tomorrow, they work around the countryside, they do not start at least and they start taking a sniper fire. There is no wait here in Baghdad. There is no cohesion story. The three main characters are, therefore, very empty characters. That means, we have the fear of dying. We have a hard-hitting, hard-hitting military man. And then we have a daring cowboy who does not meet these rules, but the sweet little boy in Iraq is trying to sell soldier DVDs. What will happen to you ??? Well, do you guys think that the cowboy soldiers who do not follow will injure themselves with the delight of their children? Why yes! Does a cowboy Iraqi soldier think he's a little boy to die? Why yes! There's no story here. Writing is young and predictable! The camera shakes a lot to make it look like "art". And for all who think you are a wonderful war picture, rent "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Platoon." Do not waste time or money on this dreadful movie!
