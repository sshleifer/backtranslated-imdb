The dog found in a local dog meets Satan and has a garbage can, one of which is given to a family who has already successfully ran the previous dog. The puppy wants little time to make Donald Trump and shoot the Mexican home, how festive. Dad only suspects that this dog is more, and then it seems to be obvious. The rest of the family loves demonic jokes. So dad's day. <br /> <br /> At the end of the 70s, when he made horror films, except for exaggerated nostalgia, he is not very pleased. When I saw the baby, I found it to be a nervous tension, but I notice it again as an adult, it is not only tidy, boring, and not very well. <br /> <br /> My grade: D
