Good Folks, I stumbled over the night when I rated the movie footage. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that nobody deserves a worthy genre. The Iceland is a minimal attack I've seen in "Beowulf and Grendel" and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This Sci-Fi version matches Christopher Lambert. Yuck <br /> <br /> What do I like? A CGI. Terribly bad Most importantly, it's the loyalty of the storyline, it's not grieving. I've both seen them with all the versions. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Peter
