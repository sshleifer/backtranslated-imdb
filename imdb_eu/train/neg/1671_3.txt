I saw it at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> It's a real money. This is not bad, but you must compensate them with a bit of sex or gore. <br /> <br /> Think Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> I think it's an interesting cast for Sean Young - producers. I guess well. <br /> <br /> The start of the downstream ship is the horny scene. all the crew shaking hands! <br /> <br /> Ha, well, but I like people who have done well - at least not dare.
