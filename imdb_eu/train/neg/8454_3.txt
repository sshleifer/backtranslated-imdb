This series has its ups and downs and occasional ups and downs and the latter in this case, here. Spatter is a nice song, with an invention of Baby Cart's weapons, but the film is a severely disjointed film that is more common than usual. Sometimes the action stops the crawl, because the camera continues to fail the "child", which is almost lost at the beginning. In the end, disappointment. <br /> <br /> That said, there is a spaghetti oriental music and action that can be admired by dedicated audiences. This division goes through a lot of time as a result of the small size of the boy, looking at the abyss of his open death.
