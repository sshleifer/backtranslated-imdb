This movie was physically painful, maybe (many people, like my age and younger ones) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and I love books - funny, quick, cheerful and subversive at the same time. The story "The Cat in the Hat" sucks all interest and spark, and Mike Myer's Performance Cat is especially great. Why the accent of the Borscht Belt, does not know joke, jokes, charming outfits? I had to go back and I had to read the books again to see the real problem: the books are LARGE. This movie is OVERBLOWN and it's a long way. <br /> <br /> You do not expect the children's movie Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but this is a new bass. How did Mike Myers make money?
