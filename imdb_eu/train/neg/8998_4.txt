Stephen Feinberg, who played Proctologist and was one of the writers of the movie, died in early 2006. I met in Steve Portland in 1993. Last year, when he wrote to Hollywood, he told me he was a Hollywood writer. , especially in television promotions. He asked me to watch 'Tunnel Vision', but it was too late, I saw it already! I really saw some years ago when they released it. At that time I did not think the movie was bad. However, when I see him as an adult, the opinion was different. Yes, it's a little modest, even dated. Steve admitted that the movie was not very good. He said that the "Proctologist" was proud.
