I attended a premiere of the night and had the following comments: <br /> <br /> 1. Because you've directed a lot of music videos, it's not a film-making capability. Without a nonsensical movie, there was an enormous angle and an overwhelming light in the film. The publication does not mix it up. "Dixie" appears until the late memorial service, which warns his mother's hand, but it's not clear what the hell is talking about. <br /> <br /> The plot was ordered by the plot, but the script was thin and had holes for Ford Truck trucks. We are never the one that drives the characters, what really matters, how conflicts are and how they all work together or how to solve them. The sixteen-year distance disappears four days, apparently with magic. The deep conversations tightened the stupid clich√©s. (In fact, the whole town was a great topic of southern life.) In the midst of the audience, Toby cheered: "I walk through my blood rumor" ... and we did not treat it twice, but twice. ! The revelations were in force, and the dramatic statements were "stupid and hard". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The performance was good because of the background of a script that needed to work. Dark Toby and most of the movies were astonished, but when he smiled and clarified he was charming. No such screen had more time to pity. Kelly Preston's chopsticks are rusty and show. Lindsay Haun is a talent and, definitely, it is not his fault that the writers were so horrible at the outset that he was not looking for his father's guilt that he was not looking for him. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper were able to do more about this film, but they still lost or lost more. (And, indeed, their characters are lost in this film). <br /> <br /> 4. If you are a lover of Toby, you love songs. Often, the movie was a scene that felt as one of his songs or artists could appear on his record. For example, the official love of the movie "Crash Here Tonight" is. You would think about a pretty scene of love, but not ... We hear about 45 seconds as it goes to the memorial service. They said "well, we should use this song somewhere". "Broken" is a disturbing song and the best thing to get out of this movie. <br /> <br /> In short ... a promising plot never fully develops and the movie is incredibly different. Ford Trucks's Toby Keith music and product positioning vehicle. The bridge passes through the broken people's attempts at the power of music, but the story is so badly understood that two points are losing the old way of music. I like Toby and I really liked being "Broken Bridges", but I would like people who want to quit this movie and give it to someone who deserves one of the deserving remedies.
