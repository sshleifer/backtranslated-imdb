I would not recommend this, unless you are enthusiastic about David Copperfield and want to "complete it". There are some great performances (for example, Uriah Heep) and the right moments (for example, profits), but in general it is compared to the BBC version and previous versions in 1999. <br /> <br /> There really is not much to do with the explanation of the story's changes (though the stolen treasures might even be important). Unsupported American: Sally Field is a good actor, but it's wrong with Betsy Trotwood, and the English accent is a bit better than Dick Van Dyke's cockney. I look at why Michael Richards Micawber was chosen; however, he eats too much and gets angry. It also speaks of its lines, with the accent that exceeds the eccentric, and simply becomes absurd. Anthony Andrews is a threat as Mr Murdstone, but it almost certainly waits for a black cap to connect with his mother with a train line (although this may, to a certain extent, be a blame for Dickens). <br /> <br /> I got a free log. It was a Sunday afternoon, but I was finally disappointed
