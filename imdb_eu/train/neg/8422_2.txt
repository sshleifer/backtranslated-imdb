Before beginning, I can say very briefly that this movie is very well done and that all of us are doing well, including Whittaker, which is worthy of his nomination. It's really fun and. . . As a work in the context of FICTION, it is a very good film. To do this, I give it to two stars. <br /> <br /> However, I want to see the absolute fictitious nature of this movie and how to explain it to me that it is not wasted a hundred times. It is dangerous to sell fiction work, as if it were true. I should point out that this film, which is no credit, is credited with the fact that Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is a complete invention of the fictional character. On the contrary, this character presents himself in a true historical context, and misunderstood from the viewer's point of view that it is truly true to admit and see what is true. I have no problem creating a confusion between fiction and fiction - but, in my opinion, I think that such wickedness is so misunderstood. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that Africa, together with the third world, has a human suffering and suffering. Hollywood has long sought to get people's suffering out of the country in the film. But Hollywood is also making money. The only way to get the most out of ourselves is that you have the chance to experience yourself in the West or get at it in an honest documentary. <br /> <br /> But these representations of fictional characters can be done so much in real historical settings. In the end, they are less likely to decide on the audience themselves, and more about image and image and self-realization: "See, WE ENCOURAGE!" The main example of this can be found by anyone who wants to watch the documentary on the DVD. Undoubtedly, the most amazing picture of the movie is Kay Amin, the second wife Idi, who is killed when he found his infidelity. In the film, we can see that its parts have been exchanged vice versa (arms legs and vice versa). The director is Amin, as Gungan says, Bom-bad! When we are watching the documentary, we know that, in fact, the myth that is being seated at that time by the Minister of Health will not be a myth. <br /> <br /> So. . . what . . Do they just have these things? Why? Because Hollywood has a low opinion on our minds, that's why! We do not achieve self-confidence. Look, he was killed and he was dissolved, since Amin was not portrayed as a media, we do not have to fortify the images inspired Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE! And that's just the tip of the iceberg. The visual debater does not even show that Garriga's main character is the same fiction. There was no Scottish doctor under Amin's wings. So, Garrigan helps us to understand the African world. Producers seem good that we were not interested in a movie about Africa, if there is no white face. (Ironically, even if the headline was portrayed by a black character by an American actor!) The problem is that Amin is not a sign of his regime, but an exploding thriller about a white West that comes to Africa. bad guys, after a great deal of mistakes, he had to "sell" himself, with the cost of three innocent people. Honestly, I would like to condemn the fact that Mrs. Amin, a mistress, was a real tragic event. It seems that almost a joke for entertainment becomes a mess! I really want Hollywood to shake our money. First of all, I noticed that this was a very manipulative trend, with heavy manipulation to adjust the sweet and sour sweetness of life of Ron Howard and John Nash, which eliminated the darker side of man to justify the tortured heroine that America alone could. I do not have enough of you. True, it's sad that Hollywood has been selling us fake for years and is looking to find fake, hook, and sinking fake portraits to find out how to get inappropriately or reluctantly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It's my point, to convince the human nature to be truly moving, why should Hollywood look at the subsequent fictional moods? Why should Hollywood continue to hurt us by holding hands on these films? Why can not they believe in ourselves? Can not we make good representations on the screen and let the audience decide for themselves? I've asked everyone who is watching Hollywood's "real" movies, ask yourself to always research and never come to the forefront on the screen, that the truth is very close!
