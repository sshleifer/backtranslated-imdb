The story of Hawaiian tourists travels to the Earth's center, three of them, one of them, a young British nanny who protects a dog. As brothers and sisters accidentally flee with their horseman of cycling dogs, they would follow these nannies (perhaps more buying it could be safer to buy more) to try exploring caves (I think). For some reason, they go to the cave and, afterwards, when the caving begins, they try to do it, except for the six-year-old sister who tells them to receive help. In the meantime, the more they move in the cave, the more they continue to move below the ground. And here you will find Atlantis City and its foreign world, foreigners who live under an ominous rule of a foreigner who does not want to ask other questions. <br /> I see that the director of the film Rusty Lemorande has commented on this film, that the last half of this film confirms that part of it is Alien in LA. The stunning movie was a bit higher than the City Limits (a 1988 science fiction movie with no budget) because it is the smallest end of this horrible piece of film production almost inconsistent. In the last 20 minutes, it can have humor and fun, what is at stake in the alien world of life in the middle of life. I give it a rating of two stars than one, because it's sometimes fun, even though it's only its subtleties. For example, foreigners ask the British girl if she is a foreigner and she will explain that the Ministry is sending her work visa. Or the alien girl Bryan finds out and explains that he is in the city of Altantis and that is the mistake of Atlantic City, New Jersey. Small things like this make the first stupid or so-so-the first hour. Imagine what the movie might have been 1), that he really intended to do it and 2) to make money really. <br /> <br /> In the end, nobody knows how to do it. He was initially sent to help the younger sister. He would travel through Hawaiian caves, and not far from the sumptuary volcano.
