This is a very serious production. The general consensus has always been that the princess Margaret could have deteriorated and slowed down and enjoyed the luxurious excesses she could afford, she was a very beautiful woman. The production was the weakest point, but the actor failed. Also, production budgets could not reach the hairdressing salon; From the beginning, Princess Margaret's hair seemed to look like a nest of birds, and she seemed to carry her through a bush. The actor who plays the Duke of Edinburgh has prepared himself for his role as Rory Bremner imitated when he imitated Prince Charles and was stubborn. <br /> <br /> Production was incorrect, joking and a shameful burden of garbage. Everyone in every newspaper reads a Christmas free DVD copy.
