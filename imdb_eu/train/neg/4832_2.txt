I noticed a small 2008 movie that won the 2009 Academy Award for Best Picture in 2009, and went to see The Hurt Locker. Unfortunately, everything I got over the two hours of investing was confirmed by the award that won this movie for screen reasons. <br /> <br /> The direction and visual style of this film are some of the weakest. you will never see It's not like Bourne Identity's other homage, when it's annoying and annoying "vibrant cameras", it shows all signs of a side-by-side soap in regards to lenses. <br /> <br /> The "plot" is wrong, characterizations and dialogues have been developed on characterization of Beetle Bailey, which is a case of "minimalist" films and turns out to be a soldier by a seemingly unreasonable two. the worst recorded ever. Correctly, actors act on everything that they can, so that the bad project does not get dark. <br /> <br /> The whole movie thinks it's "mockumentary". They were full of humor and, therefore, they re-edited, as soon as possible, a serious drama. <br /> <br /> If you spend these two hours, you will never have two hours of the movie. Come back, and you'll waste two hours in the rest of your life for years.
