Burt Reynolds, a very tired look, tells the mercenary that his former employers intend to sell "Iranians" heroes who are struggling with some societies. Producers of "Silk Stalkings" offer low-wage nonsense with decent action and many different "drama" ... lack of logic and overwhelming dialogue with defining parties, although the last turns and loyalty change. It could be a good end to the best movie. Burt still has a presence, but that means that you also notice a lot more in the middle of the bake with "single-stroke".
