A New York-based intellectual attempted to make a Swedish movie in less than "10" essays - "Carl Carl" was made by Susan Sontag, a Swedish actor, not the least! It was the first. Oscar Wilde said best, with reference to Dickens's "The Old Curiosity Shop": "It should have a heart of stone to not laugh at the death of little Nell." The same thing happens almost here. "Inner" includes rumor conversations. ("I'm afraid of my anger." Looking at the middle distance: "I do not like who I am"). Bergman's management mentions are parody. A very self-involved family reminds us of the brightness and talents that are at the point of surprise. ("I read a poem of your day. It was so - I do not know - New York." "Oh, this was an old poem. I worked again." But I found them very hilarious. A great deal of conversation in Allen It's just like the fun pieces of the first films, the actors directs them straightforward, and without playing the movie, Mary Beth Hurt plays poor from her, intonation, and all neurotic habits, she becomes a shameful representative (like Kenneth Branagh "Celebrity"). /> <br /> The basic plot - the dysfunctional woman with the most relaxed family - seems like Bergman's "Winter Light" seems to be roughly up to date with the basic family melody arrested. However, stores appear in visual tricks / scans on pencil the proud being on paper, the surfing that diminishes the people walking on the beach, etc. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Allen's later "serious" movies are less shameful, but even less entertaining. I'll take the "Inner". Woody rarely made the funniest movie.
