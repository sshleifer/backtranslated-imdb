Some types of films, where a psyche of a variety tries to damage reputation (and, in the end, to eliminate it completely) can overcome their naive person. Such examples include false attempts, Pacific Heights, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, Single White Female, and thousands of television movies. But a few, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights, were able to offer at least some paranoid, suspensible characters or some plots of land, unlawful entry into the book. And if it were not for the popularity of its stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota and Madeline Stowe), this movie would enter into mediocrity faster than a series of Danielle Steele miniseries. <br /> <br /> Russell plays like Michael Carr. Naive, called by the help of some officers, when he enters his house and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, the straw was condemned by his anger that the police officer (Ray Liotta) felt the ill condition, a psychopathic legacy that had no limit to his power. He was angry at Carr at the beginning (probably only if this was done), the police are reconciling with the couple. But soon, police Carr wants to destroy the lives of the boys as nearly as they can (this is pretty easy when you are in police, and when you are a police man who installed the man's security system, his house), he thinks he is going to take his wife. It seems to be at least oriented, and the police want to demonstrate their power. The wife is more than a trophy, that is, the end. And the story plays books completely, you can surely appear before these appearances on the screen. From the current "stunning" moment, our main and naive character realizes that the victim of fraudulent credit cards (the psychopathic miscalculation carried out) is the last-not-so-late-death.
