It strikes me on how to make this film. I watched when I worked at home, writing emails and answering the phone. Yes, I saw that the "revenge" was good. Needless to say, e-mails that were worth the emails that were not forced by vengeance and land were forced. Indeed, I do not know what happened at the end. The play was as bad as the replay scenarios of "FBI Files" - the worst of the restarting remakes (actually, only "arrests and trial" could be re-performed). I did not know in the third eye that the seamstress was the main movie until I watched the IMDb, but it is clear why he did not film. I hope you are a good singer.
