<br /> <br /> Get your crafts and enjoy this mistake. Speakman's remarkable skill kempo (a nice spin-shot, decent machine, poor sofa!), Is a very good quality movie that cries only a bad performance. The plot is not half bad; run pretty badly But if you see this movie as a non-martial arts movie, your ship is completely out of your reach. And for a movie that will take place in Koreathown, there are few Korean actors (even extras).
