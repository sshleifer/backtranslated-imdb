What did he think? File: Whoopi Goldberg plays a policeman with a dinosaur that speaks in the future (!), for a case of crime related to a madness that wants to start ice age. It's a shameless and ridiculous direct ribbon, looking for a tall concept. It seems that Jonathan Betuel was a love affair for the writer-director (one of the producers); unfortunately, the final results are anemic to be charitable. The mere presence of the Goldbergen screen is often misleading and bewildering, even though it is a bad deed, but it is drowning here and you can see wonderful results. STARS NO ****
