I saw this movie really late last night and, normally, if it's too late, I'm pretty much forgiven of the movie. Although I tried, I could not get out of this movie, as the film progressed, it was getting worse. I know it's a comedy, but I'm not that funny. It was also a real portrait of rural life, and shameless. Anyone who thinks it's rural life is definitely not. I have to agree that some kind of members have been nice, but French was really fake. I have to agree that the story wants to have a good lesson, but in general, my recommendation is not seen by anyone over 8, it is very annoying.
