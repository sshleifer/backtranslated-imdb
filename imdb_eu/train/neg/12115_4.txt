I have recently traveled through a collection of Lugosi films, and Lugosi and Boris Karloff are making a few days of the combination of "The Black Cat". I really expected to see their cooperation. "Raven". Unfortunately, it did not work for me, and at the end of the film I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> In the first three quarters of this film, or so, there was no real suspense in the story. Lugosi was doing a pretty good job, as Dr. Vollins, stupid, is in love with a young woman (Irene Ware), who cares after a car accident but can not do that. partly because he is already in charge, and partly because he does not accept his father (Samuel S. Hinds). In order to face this situation, Edmond Bateman (Boris Karloff) will help him - an awesome man who wants to make Vollins more acceptable. In addition to Lugosi's performance, I found very little interest. Then, suddenly, in the last fifteen or twenty minutes, the movie changes completely. It suddenly becomes suspensful, but I abandoned Lugosi's performance, largely because trying to relieve movies, and there is a difference. He plays a "crazy" under the "well-controlled" and "evil" controller. "Insane" is a poorer control, and I do not think that Lugosi is doing well. At one moment, he offers some maniacal smiles, as he finds himself fake. Meanwhile, Karloff was very disappointed. He never caught me Aside from that, Lugosi must be a grating - movies with co-star - getting Karloff's top billing, even though "The Raven" is clear that Lugosi is the star of the protagonist. This is undoubtedly that I would add Universal as a great horror star, I would add, because I always thought that the two best actors, Lugosik. <br /> <br /> Either way, Edgar Allen Poe's "The Raven" story is not a real link, but Vollins's Poe fanatic, who tries to regenerate torture techniques in Poe's tales. Overall, disappointing. 4/10.
