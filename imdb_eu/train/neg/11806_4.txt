It was difficult to see this movie and be completely correct and objective, since I was a fan since I was an original 1944 movie. That, for me and many others, is one of the most recent films ever made. That is to say that this is just a short television short film, and most people have thrown it in the trash, I did not expect much, but you can not compare it with the movie '44. After the scene scene, I found myself comparing myself to what I was looking for, and how Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others played with each other. Now I saw the famous actors Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. <br /> <br /> When it was time, I did not expect it as bad as I expected. but it does not match the original 1944. This television film did not have two main areas (1) lacking electricity between two leads and (2) the story of just 90 minutes left for the development of the plot. , amongst those who bring characters and chemistry. Crenna and Eggar were flat, and they just did not match MacMurray and Stanwyck "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson" respectively, respectively. "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton". Cobb has been the key player in insurance and Robert Webber Norton. It was also interesting that the time had changed, so that houses, cars, phones, machines, etc., were at the beginning of the 70s. Otherwise, the story was very similar, just running. <br /> <br /> However, a conception was enough and I would happily return to the original version of this classic story and the rest of the movie.
