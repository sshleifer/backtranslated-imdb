With regard to HEIST, this film is quite weak. Continuity is pretty bad, as there is not enough character to track you in the way you understand the characters. Peter Falk is great and is one of the reasons he is watching. Falk has some excellent lines, such as "he will go back, mix it sometimes he will buy it" or something like that ... there are beautiful scenes, even for the actors' efforts. Direction, script and edition lousy.
