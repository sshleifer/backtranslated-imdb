Then From her awesome performance (as she asks young girls what happens, they cried to the television "I can not act!" When she asks for what she needs, I cried out "I have to teach!" Dialog ("Give me my organs!"). <Br /> <br /> And Brian DePalma is also over, it was very awesome. I liked it. Dunaway is one of the best actresses ever. And the production values ​​were pretty good. <br /> <br /> But, wowzers, I laughed I needed it, LAUGHING!, in most cases. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about curiosity, This was my first mistake. I only had second and third and fourth.
