Final score (interpretation of the classical cinema features, interpretation, imagery, creativity, payment, humor, fun, etc.) <br /> <br /> 4.3 (10) <br /> <br /> Have "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" It's been a few years ago, since Disney's animation seems to be bold and serious. However, "The Emperor's New Groove" comes after an almost genius, and Disney will take a step by step "Disney Formula". Disney's animated film is a fan of the feature film. They love or hate them all. "Atlantis" is an animated return of the "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" film, and similar science plays of the 50s and 60s. The problem is that this version has almost no idea whatsoever. It feels something to be rebuilt, even more so than the real remakes of Disney (Tarzan, Notre Dame's Hunchback). The characters are much more than the usual echoes of traditional suspects that are usually filmed by these types of films (rare mechanics, general, hard-boiled women). The works that exceed beyond Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner) are wrong. The film also has a short pace. Instead of dividing it into an epic story, Disney disrupts the possibilities that are developed ... the suspicion, the characters, really. They invite us to this amazing new world and we can barely stop. In some difficult rhythms, sometimes a pretty simple story is mistaken. The animation is dark and dull and cheap. This thing looks like a drawing that saturates on Saturday. They hope they will not forget that 2D traditional animation is still amazing. He has demonstrated "the giant of iron", amongst others. <br /> <br /> Negative: images, rhythm and lack of originality. <br /> <br /> Positive: probably the most beautiful scene of Disney's death for a long time. It's a great creative film.
