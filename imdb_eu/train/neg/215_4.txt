I'm not like Love Sick. In the end, the film showed Alex, Kik, Sandu's sexual relationships, whose triangle love was full of intensity, frustration, and jealousy; Alex finally woke up and realized the result and did not realize that they were not in the future. <br /> The director Tudor Giurgiu was at the AMC theater on Sunday, at 12:00 p.m., at 12:00 p.m., and we watched the movie together with us. After the film, he told the audience that it was one of the main reasons for expressing Roman sexual relations. <br /> <br /> <br /> From my perspective, sexual life is always difficult everywhere. You do not feel any impression and special effects on the movies. Alex and Kiki and Kiki and his brother Sandu's love were like stories from the neighborhood. <br /> <br /> What I do not like in this movie are two main reasons, first of all, did the movie not tell us how they loved each other? Alex sounds like Kiki when he came into the building, two girls are in love. It does not make sense. How would a girl be loved instead of a man with another girl? You need to connect to too many pieces, images and stories in your head. Secondly, the whole movie did not have Alex and Kik's sex scenes, that's what I waited for. However, they still had to recommend some parts. The "piercing ear" was an interesting part. Alex appreciated the love of Kik, who was ready to get his ear drilling pain. That was a moving scene that gave you a little idea of ​​love. Also, the scene of the football field was in the conversation, the love proved to be true and fervent.
