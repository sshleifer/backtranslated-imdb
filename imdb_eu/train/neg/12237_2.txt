Original Claymation Rudolph: Pretty good. Original Frosty cartoon: it needs little work, but it can be worse. But Frosty and Rudolph together on July 4th? Pull it! Give it to him !!! It was a movie to do. It was bad It was not a holiday anymore except the 4th of July. This was especially bad when Frosty and Rudolphe were joining Christmas time. And it can ruin many songs of any movie. The songs that made songs seemed a lot longer for the movie. The movie is a bad movie that can not be seen at any time of year, with the American traditional holiday (which seems almost American), which is known as the "American Rest", known as the American movie, but also suggested by Frosty and Rudolph. I would like it.
