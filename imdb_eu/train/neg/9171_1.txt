What can I say? I overlooked the reviews and saw myself. They were good reviews. What is the loss of money considering the budget? <br /> <br /> Well, I went after seeing this Kill Bill. <br /> <br /> It would be a crossroads to see the terrifying movie! << br /> <br /> Bottom line: I like "Girl in Gold Boots" better than this crap.
