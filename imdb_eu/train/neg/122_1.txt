This would be placed on the top of my movie list in the trash category. There are bad movies, but they are the ones who are not worst, but you think they'll like you because they're good! Sexual sequences, shocking at the time, could not turn the rabbit. Nice politics is secondary-school secondary-school amateur night Marxism. Film is consciously art in the worst sense of the term. The photography is white and black skins. Some scenes do not focus or come out of the wrong angle. The sound is too bad! Some people call art? <br /> <br />
