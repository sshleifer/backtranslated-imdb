I go to the movies before going to the cinema, just like what others think about what I think. I have read a lot of comments, what they say about "thriller not horror movie". This is what I tried to give this film. I must really discuss these "horror / horror" expressions; I went almost there and asked for my money again, and if many reviewers had enjoyed this litter ... you must be nice! At the end of the film, the people behind them said loudly "how much time did I lose" and I turned to them and answered, "I could not say it better." I was waiting for something to happen ... but not. Good hope was good (or if you wanted emotions), but it did not happen. Williams played well enough, but I soon felt that he had changed the script and was not there anymore. Save your money to a turkey that will appear next to the turkey DVD in the near future!
