This movie should be fun. A young Lea Thompson, young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. In space But he was dragged, he had unpleasant characters and he had no recipients. <br /> <br /> Some children go to the space camp, and unexpectedly enter space with their friends' robots (called Jinx). Space scenes are long, repetitive (the same accident happens twice) and juice or scary depending on your point of view. Adults get bored and get out; Children may be afraid of the way they shot it, it leaves them awful. <br /> <br /> There is a common love, but unlike shuttles, this never comes out. First of all, why does it make sense, perhaps, except for adding extra characters, but it failed if this idea were not. Young Lea Thompson should be curious and attractive, right? I mean, "Back to the future" is great. But no, it was an angry and average look. You do not want to update someone you want, as a friend or even as a model. Joaquin Phoenix? Fortunately, it never came up in those films again. Maybe Mikey will play it as Life Cereal, but I do not know how normal a boy is. It does not fit on the screen and I do not think you can identify with it at home. Actually, I would be happier if it had not returned to the Earth. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film to anyone.
