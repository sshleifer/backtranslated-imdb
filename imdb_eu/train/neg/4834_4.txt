I was looking forward to Kathryn Bigelow's movie, a great budget, an endless hype and 6 Oscars. Unfortunately, it's really not a good movie. The representation of the situation seemed accurate and compelling in all numbers, but beyond, the story was incomplete and the film's direction seemed doubtful and bold. The actors made a good effort, but I did not want to get what the movie was. Full Metal Jacket is as atmospheric as it is hard, not as epic as the Band of Brothers, because it is not ... well, as an act of doing nothing. Certainly, I can not see why they were so named, nor why people "move them" to such epic proportions. Please note that, considering the films of the last two years, I have not chosen many options.
