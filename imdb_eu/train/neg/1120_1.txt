I watched this movie in the international film class and I got it. This film is only possible after the next shock. <br /> <br /> The fourth man is talking about an alcoholic writer named Reve, who is in danger of waiting. He talks to a woman named Christine on a local book club and decides to be with him, knowing how attractive his boyfriend is. To make it easier, he likes a saucer from Reve Holland. So, Reve has planned to captivate Christine's boyfriend, eventually to stay with her. But later he found out that Christin had three previous husbands, he killed all of them. Now Reve and Christine's boys can be "THE 4TH MAN". The story is senseless without parts. The editing technique about this movie is very good for editing. They're just raw movies and I felt the need to get rid of them in several parts. Basically, this is not my tea cup. <br /> <br /> The movie comes out from Reve's bed just for a T-shirt. So, at the beginning, you'll see Reve's beautiful beauty while walking through your narrow apartment. Then she has a dream where her pecker scissors cut a couple, and show that they come along with a blood source. Revek likes a statue of Jesus and homosexual sex has a mausoleum. There is also a lot of blood. Freddy Krueger with all the movies with more blood more blood. <br /> <br /> I do not have something against "amazing" scenes, but this movie is amazing. The whole movie is about the shock value. <br /> <br /> So if one of them is your tea cup, watch this movie. Otherwise you are far away from what you're far away from. My head is still afraid.
