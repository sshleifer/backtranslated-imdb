A filmmaker is recording a B-level actor (MOLLY RINGWALD is a great diva-ish) with his mother (Kylie Minogue! Noble!) 12 years ago to complete a horror movie. At least one plot is a weird selection, any Aussie fan of horror knows that this genre is unfortunately the female director. The movie has a curse, because Molly's original set was to kill some psychic killers. But he's back, because he needs exposure. Unfortunately, there is still a curse and people start to "set". The cut is an Aussie essay of "slasher", but unfortunately there is nothing new or exciting to bring to the table. In fact, Wes Craven's 90's film scrambled. The movie called "Scream" falls out of the world (except for the name that is being dropped with Jane Campion ... see how this is not funny) and "is this a lot true or is it a movie?" "New Nightmare." Editing is bad, music is annoying, effects are not dark, almost everything is wrong about it. Fortunately, humor can be a movie: at one moment, the girl who plays a well-dressed girl in the movie says: "Do not worry, we treat your house as if it were ours," and he responds, "that does not mean anything for me Want it, as you live in a garbage! "Ha! And Molly's ridiculous strangers were enough to not regret it. "Is there a food coke?" (While in the cinema, he walks in the teacher's car) and "Does anyone know where I can buy a tofu?" (The first thing in the mutters in the set) and "Where's hell my agent?" (Oh wait, that's what I thought for him.)
