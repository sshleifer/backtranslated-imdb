He is very surprised to see the high score for this movie and a few positive reviews. Watching the movie was pretty bad. I was not very pleased to find it. It was slow and the entertainment value was lacking. The scene of the dead is not a little, and they do not look like the general stucco that they give good looks. And the supposed end of the tour is not so much, I saw the coming, and then the end seemed to be alternately. This movie is not much needed, but it's overcome by the small one it gets. I would not recommend the movie.
