So far, Starz on Demand is one of the worst movies I've ever watched. It seems that all straight-crap-fest DVD feeds that appear can be found here. <br /> <br /> Why? Who knows! It seems that anyone with a digital camera and a huge budget comes with a horror movie and puts it on television. Honestly, this seems to be horrible since I saw the trailer - but I gave it a real opportunity. <br /> <br /> I always try to make the low-budget movies an open mind. Some of the best films I have ever watched were low-budget works or other movies that were a must-have for a small budget. <br /> <br /> This is not one of these films. <Br /> <br /> Now you know the plot, I'm sure you're reading this. You heard either Starz on Demand or for any reason you were bored on this page. It's a pathetic and noisy girl, we know about "heavy metal" a very bad video clip for about 3 minutes. He who played together seemed really interesting, but really, really. However, he kills himself. Then someone has it. Then some murders begin. It is impossible to totally average and boring. When the first shotgun comes out in their apartment, popcorn is quite popcorn. That could be the best sound effect? I can find a better internet sound effect on the Internet (without copyright) on the Internet ... right. now <br /> <br /> Do not let any other comment as it deceive you in 10 star films. Of course, they are the distributors of the movie or maybe the director is trying to try to think it's worth buying it.
