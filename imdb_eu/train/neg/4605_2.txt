This movie is written by Charlie Higson, which is based on one of Fast Show's "legendary" shows and one of his own shows (Tony auto sales men). He also wrote books for children's James Bond. <br /> <br /> I really saw this before, Gordon movies based on Lovecraft's stories, and each of them is wonderful. Here Gordon tries to make something different. The style is completely "contemporary", that is, shake the camera, fast and strange cutting, fresh music in the background. I think it works well here, but it's still meaningless and inexpensive. I try to think of the cameraman who is shaking his dv camera in front of the actors / actors and trying to make some excellent moves in the images (if something sustainable were to be released). The casting is good and there is a whole atmosphere of good management. I think the main character, "zero" young boy, is quite interested in his "zerone". Fat guy is also good. And that guy, Alec Baldwin, is not it. But early enough the movie is not so interesting: in this case the scene of sadism and disease is endless line. In this movie or story there is not a lot of humanity: it's totally pessimistic and everyone in this movie is boring and hopeful, or has died soon. Needless to say, there is no mood. It is a 1'40 long vomit without any relief. However, today Gordon continues to be one of the most interesting filmmakers, and I think this movie is an experiment and a failure. Each one sometimes loses, the way to learn and find it again. Gordon's work could be strange and empty.
