That must have been the worst film I've ever seen. This movie has nothing positive. Some of you really like the movie! I have seen many Dracula films and I liked all that I saw, but when I saw this movie I said: "What's the hell?" Stupid movies Now they become Dracula, who is Judas. Among those who did not know Judas, Jesus betrayed Jesus and then felt guilty of hanging himself. You have to be kidding. That's the reason I've ever heard that makes Dacula why he became. Who asked the reason anyway? What is this movie? Those who feel like an excuse for a movie should be beaten. Dracula is also horrible. If you have ever seen this movie, you would not think it was Drakular. Wow, Dracula 2000! Does this title want to impress me? Do not waste your time or your money in the trash.
