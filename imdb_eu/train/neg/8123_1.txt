(spoilers) Wow, this is bad. I watched the old episode of Star Trek twice as long as I saw it double - everyone was infected with the disease of the space and then made a bit of nutmeg and Stewart Moss, a famous "Lives" hero. At night! He played the first infected crew, who died of depression. I thought everything was seen in many of his films, that is, he had depression. This movie is full of people that are really impossible. There is no passionate character in the film, not one. It is very difficult to feel bad, as Dr. Beck (or what he is going to do), as he does not like. And you do not like her wife sharp, bony or crazy. Ward, or Dr. Moustache Love ... So why would you invest time or energy in this movie? Where there is no empathy for the characters, there is no reason to look around. About a terrific film, that is, filmed through urine and five-five special effects, many of which came in for a fan role to simulate the hordes of flying bats. I have never seen the worst movie I've ever seen on MST3K, but at the bottom, it's definitely.
