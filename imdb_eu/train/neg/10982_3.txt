The film had good performances and good times (despite a fairly low budget), but the basic premise was a poorly developed bad score. The main conflict between the two directors is not realistically. That's why some of the scenes do not agree, but there is a great deal of discussion about how there could be a different way in the world, especially since Glenn's work has been wounded in this part of his life. (and Adam is active with enough time and money). Several times Glenn is also negatively reflected in his own way of being (forgiving his forgiveness for Adam's past) while Adam appears and is "traditional." The film eventually claims a "good way". I do not like such a preaching. I went to a talk session with the director, after seeing LTR, and told me he had presented this conflict among them, as he was in Glenn's shoes (and in real life that he has been linked to Glenn's vision), he could not ask someone. With Adamen opinions Well, I think Glenn thinks he can do it in the movie, much better work. Also, the director directed this one, after reading his first film (Directing For Dummies), the direction was not so bad, but far from the greatest effort. I've seen worse, but I rarely leave the movie feeling.
