Would he be a comedy or a drama? This film begins with a light story between three women. Art. It becomes a conflict between women when one of them knows a man. Art. Among them there are some tricks. Art. But when the plot thickened and eventually it became black, I asked the first part of the movie I was misunderstood. It goes on for a while to finally retrieve the original whistleblower. But now it's too late. It is hard for them to still speak together and convince the end. Actually, the lesson (which is aimed at the British film) is not knowing how to make movies. It's hard to see how the producers ever convinced. And it's been a real flop at the box office, because I've never heard of this weekend (after four years).
