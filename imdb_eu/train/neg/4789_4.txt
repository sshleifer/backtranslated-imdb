In 1979, "Phantasm" was a very atmospheric, horrifying, terrifying, horror film that was very original and, in a word, worship. The first episode of 1988 was incredibly, terribly, with many different and entertaining activities. After the first tracking, the creator of "Phantasm" Don Coscarelly apparently lacked new ideas. In 1994, "Phantasm III - Lord of the Dead" is not an empty one, though it is quite entertaining, but there is no more originality, and the desperate attempts to bring something new are often laborious, which is quite similar to those of its predecessors. <br /> <br /> - ADVERTISERS - <br /> <br /> At first the secret behind the mysterious sentinel fields (which is absorbed by the brain silver silver balls) has been clarified. From now on, a new short-lived, short-lived character (Tim, "Home Alone"), Rocky, a rugged and super-cool nunchaku, rich in a black crew. ) have been added. The film also has its own characteristics - Reggie Bannister is very encouraging, with the guitarist who plays Reggie. Angus Scrimm is pretty like Tall Man, but Tall Man speaks much more in this movie, releasing some of his fears. Mike character is directed by Michael Baldwin again (James LeGros replaced it in Section 2) and, in my opinion, did not take much notice. In addition, seeing the film gore is quite interesting, but it is still disappointing, especially because the attempts to resolve the lack of ideas are angry. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the "Phantasm III." acceptable is a starter of the time, but it certainly differs from the previous ones. "Phantasm" can be tried by the first two films, but I recommend that your expectations not be too much.
