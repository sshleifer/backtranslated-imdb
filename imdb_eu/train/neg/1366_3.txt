Sitting in the back of a police car, waiting for the bust to be pointed out, his face and body are tense and attentive. Unfortunately, the bust over several times, the transitory Youngen does not change. This is an inaed actor. <br /> <br /> He has to compare his best friend and friend Arnetia Walker with young people, to understand what's missing from Youngen. Walker is open, emotional and comfortable at all times ... there is no obstacle between what he or she feels. The book is open. The young man, on the other hand, acts like a neighbor to play, suddenly becoming a movie star. Basically, he has no thoughts. <br /> <br /> The big gap in the middle of the movie is a reflection of the blurring of the story. For example, after Miss Young's kidnapping out of the closet, Young Young, she breaks the door when she is left alone. In the given manner, it is only dressed in cloths and panties, but in a similar situation, with a psychoanalytical momentum, you would have to get the door ... or take time to spend her salon, get some outfits. and dress? I think that this scene and others are trying to suggest some mixed emotions that are experiencing the character of Miss Youngen, but Young can not convey this type of complexity. <br /> <br /> Some moments in the movie seem to be. , for example, short interviews with police officers, but, in general, this is an effort. It is very bad that the comic style movie that Miss Young replaced while exploiting some of the alleged limits of humor (BATMAN and DICK TRACY), while trying to play real people, is very surprising. Watching Miss Young, at least this "thriller" is a sad show.
