First, I'd like to apologize for my bad English. <br /> <br /> I'm not a hardcore hostess, but I still liked the movie. Live stream, however, THE SINGLE TIMETABLE! I have never seen a gore movie with a great performance, but what's surprising? It was a live feed ... well, no! Some have commented because they've seen a school project or something. Okey, but not the students in the media or theater school. This class is not at all! And the story? Very dreary hostel And what's the gore? What are the scenes of psychopathic torture that suppress your daring and cold sweat? This was the greatest despair around the hole! Lightweight, fast and NO. More than one progress is like a torture. Okey, there were blood cubes, but they did not look like either. Murder and violence Braindead reminded them more than the hostel, or any Saw movie. And Braindead was fun! Okey, I laughed at Live Feed a couple of times, but it's been more than pure fun disappointment! <br /> <br /> So watching Live Feed instead of wasting 80 minutes, see otherwise!
