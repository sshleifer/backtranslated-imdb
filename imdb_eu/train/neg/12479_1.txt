DEATHSTALKER is perfect for B-fantasy movie lovers; A little bit of a 80-minute advertisement of the film structure that heckler can ask for - drawings that do not exist, an awesome performance (at least to save an awesome old lady), suggestive screenwriter and schlock edition and basement style basement background. settings There are no characters that find fun or interesting person (especially, the marker does not have something attractive about it), and the actors gathered do nothing to raise the F-grade material. If it is not enough, DEATHSTALKER will not turn up any of the major turkey (which movie is not something like that). I felt worse that women in this movie should not have any intention at all; 2) raped; 3) sex with the hero; 4) All the above. Besides, the background music is horrible; a strange mix of electronic noise, choral joke and the orchestra cycle. To make the hearing attack and the noisy look all the more interesting, DEATHSTALKER is probably the best person who laughs (and believe me, you have a lot here). Otherwise, I do not recommend a 100-year grade that CONAN wishes for anyone.
