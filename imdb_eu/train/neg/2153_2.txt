"Man was not there", called 3-DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! Inappropriate comedy has a shameful 3-D effect, "Jaws 3", "3-D effects" of Amityville 3, and "Part 3 of Friday 13" looks better. The end of the movie is the end. This was one of the 1983 films that featured screen pop-off effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor were trapped in this mess, but at least they did not die in their career. Tambor continued to play the role of "The Larry Sanders Show" and at the box office of Ron Howard, "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", but Guttenberg continued his "flop" with the "Police Academy" and "Cocoon". In these projects, instead, here in "Man Who Was There". If you do, you will regret it. <br /> <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (4)
