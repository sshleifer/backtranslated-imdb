I returned from a free projection and I'm very pleased that I did not pay this movie to see this sub-par movie. The theater was full and the people were a mix of children and adults. It seems that they were laughing at all the jokes and all the templates (strong gods like these poor crotch mice alike). The movie is quite young, incomprehensible, predictable, and especially annoying. The characters just seem to throw away the empty space and the relationship between them seemed to be very hard to do with charm. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the average movie really really stands out for nothing. Wallace and Gromit made a decent work to mimic the clay look, but the images are very unforgettable. <br /> <br /> I was bored with the whole movie, I smiled a couple of times. It's not an empty mistake, but I would definitely not want to see it again. With kids (and you do not care if your kids see cheap jokes) if you have a parent, then feel free to see them taken, but others do not waste money.
