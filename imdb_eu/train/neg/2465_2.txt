This Hollywood mediocre would be visible if you had a good editing. It is based on the typical plot of the American thriller: "Who will scare you." The rhythm is below the average, but the best actress in the film is the bright detective and especially responsible if the film tension rises. Empty video clips and sound shots are totally disturbed and seem like raw material. In short, if the student is not interested in watching a movie that resembles a movie project, it's a movie to be seen. It is enough that I would like to say about that movie, all else, perhaps, it can ruin enough tension.
