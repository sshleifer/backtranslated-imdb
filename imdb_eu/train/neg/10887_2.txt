...... this movie is terribly terrifying, the only thing left for me to be 1 point, unfortunately, it's been worse when I saw it. <br /> <br /> Jungle music, demon juttering and UV fluorescent style give blood / teeth / eyes a "great" look, and the script is fun. This movie is like more than one test. It's predictable, but not in a good way. This film does nothing well. I have watched 10 minutes ago and I thought I had a little bit to say. (oh and the performance does not diminish the movie, it's horrible)
