"Igor and Lunatics" is completely involved and the amateurs' quest for a hippie-worship hilarious horror film. It seems that nearly twenty years later, Charles Manson was still inspiring for filmmakers to be a great inspiration but not impossible. This is a typical production of Troma, which is boring, the weird material that is bored in the plot and completely irrelevant fillings. Is there a random gore and free evolution? is not it bad but it is very nonsensical and ugly, it seems frustrating. "Igor and Lunatics" are disappointed, as well as using a lot of footage twice, for example, as the circle has seen. Incoherent argument tries to tell the story of worshiping drug addicts and Charlie Manson Paul Wannabe wannabe guided hippie worship. Paul, one of the classmates in the lowest rated Igor, is obsessed with biblical stories and drugstores and gradually worsens all the worship of insanity. Igor is merely illustrating a small example through a small example: he turns his heart into a chest of sexy black women on cycling shopping! The synthesizer soundtrack is annoying and some real cheerleaders of pseudo-artistic camera, slow motion and similar dream sequences. Perhaps there is a sequence that is worth the use of some fanatical landfill and the poor girl is cut by half with a sack. Without specific reason, the camcorder saves fifteen seconds in fifteen seconds in the bloody bloody shot of the needle.
