The initial line of Joe Don says everything about this movie. On the island of the ill (a pathetic man island), Joe D Baker follows an Italian mafia. Joe Don's character is named Geronimo (Heronimo Pronounced), and he's shot in this movie and is arrested repeatedly. Everyone in the film hates everyone as they hate Greydon Clark. Previously I liked Greydon's "Angel's Revenge" image because it was not for the oldest boys. Avoid this movie!
