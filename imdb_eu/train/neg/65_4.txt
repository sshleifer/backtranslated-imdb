I did not get a grade for Amati Girls and I think it was a REAL one. 10 With this in mind, something more beautiful would be a set of art that would have more or less actors. my eyes In that color there are so many topicals, the hair of women is horrible and most of the scenes are not realistic or fake. There is no real passion in this movie, but there is more than one bunch that causes too much of an agent. Having a comedy is not really fun, really fake and sad, so my eyes are not good. I did not believe I was aware of something in my TV for my TV in Switzerland. But ... maybe it was fine and the translation has been lost? Who knows Certainly, one of the most curious films I've ever seen and that, definitely, is not in a good way! I'm sorry.
