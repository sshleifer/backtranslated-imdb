Be careful Spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is your typical Disney film. <br /> <br /> 1.Politically direct you to a home-based race host. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2. Shows audience intelligence with its simplistic lines. 3. The strict father's party almost never ends up telling stories. 2. <br /> <br /> 4. In a world full of crime, dissatisfaction, corruption, hunger and other proposals to take care of, only one lost group is worthy of divine intervention. Use it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 5. Did you know that the angels' swore to you? Where fell heck! <br /> <br /> 6. To help the team, the angels cause pain and humiliation to the opposing team. Very angelic indeed! <br /> <br /> 7.The group is helping the angels help you ... guess ... ANGELS! Disney worst! <br /> <br /> 8. "They only wear wings." Bright line! <br /> <br /> My disorder: I did not like it.
