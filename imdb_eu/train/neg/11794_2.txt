Original Sci-Fi Channel mediocre image. Shy, but not many. Nuclear power submarine. Jimmy Carter is at the top of the North Pole's underground freezing ice, when he attacks the super electric string. A crew member (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) thinks he has invented a way of communicating with monster, but he does not give it a blubber. Among the crews are David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This movie could have been better if eels / monsters were not so cartoons.
