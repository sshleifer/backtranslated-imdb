"Seed" is a torture porn ... definitely. But, surprisingly, he has written, produced and directed a smoother film than any other made in Uwe Boll's last memory. <br /> <br /> Every time I see a boll movie, I feel that scripting on some pages is missing. There are gaps in the story and the conversation. Of course, nothing makes sense. The festivals are somewhat surreal in this aspect. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> Why the six police officers arrested and went away. When they arrive in the dark way in different ways, as the police officers would clean and clean the house twice or three times? Why do not police use their radios? How can the body break so quickly, the process that usually takes a few months? (I know the photos with the passage of time ... but Seed would never have to continue in the calendar if the people waited for the point shown by the previous victims). Why does Seed dress up bibs and dresses? Is there a mask waiting for the queue of death, instead of the typical uniform prisons? How can Seed get into a maximum security prison, walk in the cell block, and do not stop or do it again? About 80 people (depending on newspaper diaries) have died, why is the only investigator working around the case? Why did the researcher suddenly decided to go Seed's house at Seed, where he was arrested and killed by the victims? (Did not he think he should have done it before?) Why does the police do not even do a single detective, back-up, and controversy, what was he doing and where was he going? <br /> <br /> This is particularly frustrating when Boll, of course, is aware of why we understand why the electric chair does not work well. It passes through several screen minutes to determine this, as it could spend other aspects of the film logically logical. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> In short, the movie serves as a framework for a variety of scenes (maybe Boll might be thought of as "his" vision would have bludgeoning a wild death, guns and execution. through electrocution, and live animal skin covers. (The hidden scenes of the animals were unnecessary and disturbing, but I understand their purpose in the movie context.) The central part is undoubtedly the noisy death of a middle-aged woman, using a shotgun. It's evident that this is a long time and reminds me of the classic "Reservoir Dogs" scene, but without Steely Dan's soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Is this a good movie? No, do you see it? If you are a fan of the genre of torture, or if you've decided to watch a sample of torture porn. At the beginning of this review, as I said, although this movie was very popular and very little, it's much better than most of Boll's films. He will continue to improve as a filmmaker. Only torture goes beyond online, and I expect more progress in the "Postal".
