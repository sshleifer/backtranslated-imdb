Wenders was great with Million $ Hotel. I do not know how it came up with this movie! After Spt11 the situation and the American Society's vision is promising, that is, about 2 out of 2. But that's not a movie. Someone is the best with a great idea (it can clash with western eastern). In the Middle East, important things happen and they are emitted on a MAC * screen, with the fingers of a Amerian girl in stupidity (which is ignorant about events). they are not well-shaped. And most importantly, the idea of ​​religion is, in some way, fun for me. In the end, Lana tells him that he tries to be quiet and listening. And the back music says "... pray." The thing is not really about religion. But it ends with that. How do you see the truth when you close your eyes and pray? The lights are already shining the truth. was it ps: "The house is not my place. It's people." The only thing that says 10 to 10 is the phrase. But behind that film it is wasted. (On the other hand, as one "someone" referred to below, one of the best Americas is not the best, they are just "poor" and "hopeful" who do not require soldiers who enroll in. Governments!)
