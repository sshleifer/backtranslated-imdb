I know that most people who speak the truth of this movie are not before they were born before landing the moon (1969-1972), or they were not recognized. I think it is easier to live through a non-questionable historical event. <br /> <br /> I was a young man in Apollo, but I was just as old as to understand what was going on. The whole world continued to land the moon. Our families got together around the TV. The headlines of the newspapers lasted each day, screaming, launching and landing, from the moon and from the moon ladder, to the joke, in many languages. In school, some classes were canceled to watch the main TV shows. Throughout Apollo 13, he prayed to the world and kept the collective breathless in a man's way without having to relax home. You can not go anywhere without asking what is final. The world was really a community. <br /> <br /> After a quarter of a century now with a buffer, it's easy to claim frauds, because world excitement and interests have been lost. We remain with our history books, and anyone can say that history is wrong and it prevents proof of "falsehood" in other ways that proves false and complementary acts, that is to say, the proof lives in the souls and memories of those who live through these fantastic and fantastic days.
