Oh dear. Chevy Chase and SNL teams set new ups and downs in the sketch format, which fails at all levels. Luckily, Chevy is hardly the same and can not be blamed for this trio. Very seriously, it's very bad. The premiere (1974) Although it was intended to be a political commentary in the United States at that time in the United States, it is still not fun or clear to observe. The sketches are too long and perhaps the satirical impacts may be lost until they reach full boredom. Chevy is nominated as a debut for the film and I'm glad I did all this, all that improved. Avoid too strange.
