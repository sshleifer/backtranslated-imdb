Several days ago I watched the scary movie I jumped into and played. I must admit, I found it pretty decent ... until I began to talk about the characters. Logical problems: <br /> <br /> 1. Your boyfriend looks like a nice look, it does not sound while he does not die. Do not you think he wanted to take at least the murderer? <br /> <br /> 2. When it comes to warning, the gym teacher, "SOOOO Lying in love with Loaf," almost screamed at the screen. When your teacher's best friend is killed by a teacher who was in love with HER, you do not have to make any such comments in your heart. <br /> <br /> 3. As soon as Nash had begun asking for the departure of his grandfather and his uncle, it could be dangerous, he would not be able to enter the smart little woman Donna, boyfriend, aunt and uncle, and drive away far away Has he kidnapped the house with HRT and no way to stop the murderer from the police? <br /> <br /> I could move forward. And good. And good. Basically, the plot was decent, the characters were not enough to make you profiled when they dying to feel any empathy and there were too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> <b>. > This movie can be ideal for teens or young couples to look for fun nights. If you do not have all the goofs, it's a minimal movie.
