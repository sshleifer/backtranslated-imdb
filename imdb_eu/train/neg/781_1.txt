This show was totally awesome. Une George is not funny, and his children are crazy. She also treats her mother without respect. In Hispanic mode, I am very sensitive to this show and the characters are portrayed. <br /> <br /> In addition, the operation of the family function has been taken to death. Once, I want to see something original. What makes this show fun when millions of other shows have made? ABC thought that I felt the senses and this part of the garbage was getting out of it, but unfortunately, we need a stomach until the "shark jump". <br /> <br /> I think they already did.
