After a few days after writing about junkies like MAD COWS and THEA FILTHY EARTH, when I noticed that I was completely outlawed by Ange, Duncan and Theo, I had to sit down with another British film. cents. Some people claim that the DEAD BABIES concept is based on a novel concept, it has a built-in market, but LONG PERFORMANCE AND MAD COWS have also been adapted as well as suffering. <br /> <br /> I read the plot synopsis, because a series of high-level horrors went to a remote Internet palace, protected by an internet cult, but it's not really true how the story is cleared and waiting for Friday 13 THE SHINING meets It is distressed, it takes 90-95% of the duration between drugs and 90,95% of the people who are sexually challenged. And what characters are hateful. There is no pleasant way, and in some minutes you will be nostalgic for Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot, who will allow the Democrats to succeed in the next communist to create utopian equality. To denounce the end of a decadent bourgeois film like this, it is unbelievable to embrace the hate characters of this absurd movie. <br /> <br /> The land has a meander and where the viewer fails to give a movie. The following is followed by the director who continues to deteriorate things with smart people. Without a doubt, it will surprise us, drowning and crying, "Oi god, which director is a wonderful way of transcending our artistic technique, and the talent that gives talent gives only a plebian, is not a man." I am sure that most people have screamed "How have my projects gone down like no other?" Or, "WTF was the last eighth hour under all?" You can defend the movie by saying that the original source novel was impossible and the movie is impossible. I admit that this movie is not invisible <br /> <br /> * Classification of the class as an American movie, but DEAD BABIES's styles and mistakes are from Britain. Americans believe they are hard-hitting with Bush, but if we have Tony Blair, babies trousers, MAD COWS, and LONG TIME. It is not surprising that everyone is embarrassed in XXI. Being British in the century
