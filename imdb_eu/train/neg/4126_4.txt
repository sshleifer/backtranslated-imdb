This thriller is a thriller that is directed by the usual collaborator of Amenabar's Mateo Gil. The movie, which in some way results in boredom and emotional search, really does not give, and it seems to be a boredom exercise. This is a smooth suspense in that period, which lasts about 30 minutes, lasting about 100 minutes of 30 minutes. The earth is lacking in sophistication or credibility, and although the idea is original, stories are arbitrary and all plots or plots are the result of external interference (deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens without showing any initiative or use. If you are a fan of the genre, see "Thesis" instead.
