This is not a bad video, but it was set up in 1994, because it was very tired in Britain. 75% Boogeyman is a new version, and it was forbidden to the same reason, whatever. <br /> <br /> I first mixed up with Annie (Kelly Galindo) as I thought was another. Lacey, but it was a problem with the psychic view of a boogeyman similar to the first movie. The fans will soon realize that they are not the same person. <br /> <br /> After watching the spa at the month, and also seeing the address, Annie, her psychiatrist and a psychologist similar to the man. In religious novels and cheap food, you can go home and probably the same bathroom. 24 hours later it happens like the murder happens. Of course, we do not know who this brave woman is or why she died. <br /> <br /> Then, the movie Boogeyman's story started again with other footage that we did not see in the original. It is noteworthy that the original is not boogeyman. Unfortunately, some good scenes were cut, but there were 90% of them. Why this new movie? Did they find footage in the registry? What was the goal? <br /> <br /> We never met and, although the psychologist tells Annie, healing, we all know that bogeyman will never die.
