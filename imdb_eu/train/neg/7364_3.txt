In 1692, Salem, a false lies about the involvement of a slave's witch, is concerned about a whole community. Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray, the main character of the drama of the costumes, is not silent, but is not a contagious hysteria. Three writers (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead and Bradley King) have worked. The elements of the story are quite interesting (especially when Hollywood came out in 1937), but they did not like anyone who read Arthur Miller's "Crisol". The melody that will appear here will not last long. The main problem of the image can be questioned: they are a pair of lovers with Colbert and MacMurray's witch hunting. MacMurray is present for these current environments. * 1/2 ****
