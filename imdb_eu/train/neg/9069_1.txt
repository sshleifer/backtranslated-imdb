(David H. Steinberg) seemed to have some real intelligent ideas that could make a good romantic comedy initially, BUT, BUT, ah, dear! What happened ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I will tell you what has happened. Originally (Animal House - 1978) and (Porky's - 1982). Although it has been a long time ago, but they are pioneers, godfathers of the new genre: teenage comedians. In the 1990s, when it arrived. For example, (Problem Child - 1990), (Dumb and Dumber - 1994), (The Nutty Professor - 1996), (Personality teacher - 1996) and (Something About Mary - 1998). I think that slacker is the cause, it was not the time of the era and the prophets of the next time: the only one (American Pie - 1999) is an icon of genre, without any doubt and without a match. Then I think that all such comedies have been very rough, cum laude, as it may be, as the youngsters admire! <br /> <br /> I think (Slackers) had a smart plot in the first screenplay mode, then its makers had to add large amounts of fatness, dirty, sexually surprisingly shameless - as easy as those days! Each scene had to be freely filled, for example: masturbation, oral sex, urination, etc. The story is completely unnecessary elements, but they are surely necessary to make the most of their profits and the latest comedy comedy. All problems put a comedy on how to replace them. <br /> <br /> His story was literally horrible, and as you see, it's the point. Everything is (Jason Schwartzman) with appearance and performance; memorable, very fond. So, being a romantic comedy did not make an ambition to transform from the pent up pictures. It's like horror that you ask all the time; what would happen (vow, lie, etc.); It is the easiest combination to create a contemporary comedy. <br /> <br /> Even if you hate it, you should get something to love (especially brave), for me Gina Gershon was just the scene of the camera. However, they were generally designed to make insanity mad, like a naughty dream of a teenager. Although most of them are close to the nightmare. <br /> <br /> I would be sorry to say that this is a significant piece of work, and not cheap, it was another stupid comedy that ended up in the end. . Remember thoroughly the details of the test (the first 2 minutes), so the main plot of film (we're trying to get a little girl to a beautiful girl) through the model of the boy (boys love girls and girls love another boy) is nothing more. With his material, the stubborn behavior of university maidens worked hard, instead of doing anything, they made a template that did nothing. It's over, and I'm sorry I'm saying, smile! <br /> <br /> Eventually he told me something (imagine it!) about time and place. scammers or stopping to make the comedy the same as the comedy. Another better film will end yet; That's my opinion about it. Once! And it's not so much to understand that the makers of this film are real black! Maybe it's stupid to be a smart Hollywood player, but even though ... The final result was at least an amazing sense of this word. <br /> <br /> PS: The story written by his screenwriter (David H. Steinberg) (American Pie 2), contains the main page of the IMDb and is available under "Additional details". His usual "Plot Keywords" are: Sex / Vulgarity / Humor Crudo / ... They just overlooked the writing of urine until they were thrown out by the elderly at the age of 70!
