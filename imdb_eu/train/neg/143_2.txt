Scary Movie and Shriek scammed the effort to recover the teenage genre, if you heard about what I did last Friday 13th, Valencia fails. Why did Halloween like the people? It was original, new and beyond what was never done. Why did they like Scream? At least it was sensible. Valentine is just a rumor, almost never. The Earth is similar to Halloween and Urban Legend, it's not fun. And when the killer enters the screen, you know who it is, it's just what's planned. Teen slasher genre DEAD Get over over! <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10
