A really unpleasant movie. Although the special effects of Rick Baker are very impressive (although they have been performed on stomach trips), it has no other interchangeable characteristics. Like many movies in the 70s, it lets you feel a long shower and feel like you're away from it. The character is evenly unpleasant and the plot does not make sense.
