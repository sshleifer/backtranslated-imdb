If you saw this movie, why did I say "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus". Hehehe !!! When they said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I laughed "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this movie"? I can not believe that Oscars like Freeman and Spacey were behind the scenes while they were captured on the screen by Timberlake and LL Cool J. Is WTF Timberlake? Dreaful acting! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could do a much better job! This work was perfect for Joshua Jacks and I'm not very funny ... but I prefer the actor, not Timberlake, this Android. And her girlfriend was skinny, empty and annoying. I was both happy when they appeared on the street. <br /> <br /> The story was fine and Dylan Mc Dermott thinks he's a good guy. The movie was fun, but I think Timberlake has spoiled it. It would be very nice without him. <br /> <br /> By the way, music was good, but when suddenly the music appeared, the movie became a MTV video clip, a low movement, and things like that. . I thought there was no place in the movie for this movie. Maybe they wanted to make an MTV movie for Timberlake.
