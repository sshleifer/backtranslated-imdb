It's a waistband to get the most flawed and boring actors. In addition to questions not published in other comments, what is so hard to detect thieves? Before robbers, see the bank staff, see who is in the bank - from the angle of all the cameras - before robbery entry and 4 robbers stop among the guerrillas. Where is the suspended suspicion about the body? It was so evident that the hostages were asked to change in the same uniform, they had to get out of front gates ... they often saw. At least Mr. Spike Lee could enjoy a good musical score and film shoot in the movie. The movie is not worth it. Soon!
