In 2004 I joined Sky Captain, I expected a good movie. Almost all reviews of this movie were positive, with attractive effects and preconceptions. <br /> <br /> While not saying, the movie describes the feeling he did not feel. It was anger. <br /> <br /> Beyond boring and misunderstood, this movie raises 2 out of 2 stars because it is stolen from another movie's source. I understand the difference between homage and the robbery: this was stolen. More importantly, it seems that filmmakers did not develop a point or stole the plot. They could steal that to prove it. At the beginning of the screening, the movie shows a wizard Oz movie at the beginning of the movie is not the same film that robs me of doing a different scene (I will not work on it). Needless to say, not all of the film's concepts originated from the original or even from the old concept: literally, it was just a reuse of something I've already seen, something that reminded Superman of cartoons and recent movies. The Iron Giant ", a leopard martial artist used in many films, known in recent years as Darth Maul," Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. "<br /> <br /> The theme of the real movie, most of the shows were wooden. Perhaps, the whole movie It was done in blue screen, because the actresses kept the computer image in its entirety. Actually, this is not an excuse. If a person is a child, they understand that there is no excuse for the visual reference that there is no excuse. <br /> <br /> Finally, There are no humanities in this film, the protagonists are real men, almost all the antagonists are robots, and the number of friendly characters that appear throughout the film can be counted on one side, if the robot attacks the planet, do we not expect the masses of humanity to flee from them? it prevents performance from being misleading. <br /> <br /> The movie was not working anymore, so it's not I gave it 1 The film was an example of what was wrong with modern movie movies: filmmakers tried to justify the movie with special effects, but it fell flat without any artistic or original approach.
