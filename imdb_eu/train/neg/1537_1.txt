Really bad movie was filmed in "film", not two, but three amateur video guys. <br /> <br /> If you make a horror movie bad, at least throw it in a blood and nudity. There are some blood donated by latex bought at the Halloween store. There are lesbians and fans but not nudity or sex. Lesbians spend a lot of time in bed, but they only talk. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no fuzzy editing effects, no wipes, etc. Sometimes there is a bit of blackness to separate the scene. > <br /> The great music that takes most of the latest music from the toughest metal bands. Wicked men are the rubber masks attached to the "actors" face. They did not have to wear a make-up on the brown neck, arms or wrists. <br /> <br /> I guarantee a 10-year-old video camera to collaborate with a better movie. There is no reason to buy, rent, or watch this movie as an example of how to make a low budget video.
