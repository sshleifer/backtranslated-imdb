It was in 1974 and was the star of Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> It only says what this movie awaits. <br /> <br /> And it was a movie. According to the film, Slovik reformed, she got a good woman and she did not want to fight. <br /> <br /> In real life, perhaps Slovakia has been innocent innocent or perhaps has been manipulated. systems <br /> <br /> Slovik is the one who wants to be or decides, but this was a movie that was about to make a dessert, as he questioned why he was fighting for a country, and took the movie. on the sides. <br /> <br /> The military in Vietnam in 1974 did not take them into account (Willie Nelson would say, let's say the truth, it was about Vietnam's war, not World War II). Gung Ho was a propaganda for over fifty years. <br /> <br /> According to this film, Slovik expressed his plain and easy attitude. He had a nervous problem. I have a nervous condition, I have a clinical condition and trust me, if I have made a military duty, I could not have trouble getting rid of my tasks and overcome my tasks and get a KP role or have latrines without problems. <br /> <br /> If we believe Teleflick, Slovik certainly did not have this opportunity due to its criminal history. <br /> <br /> The researcher wants to believe is the viewer. When I've learned about the decades of the decade, when I've learned about military services or obligations, they will take much more time again. <br /> <br /> In the 1940s and 1950s, serve your country. /> <br /> 1960s and 70s, your country's mockers. <br /> <br /> This is history. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was in front of Hollywood. When he refused to decline the server, when he showed emotion. <br /> <br /> This tremendous emotion can easily help in the expression of his nervousness, but, of course, he wants to show films as a human being and only when he dies is not dull. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Catholic, but I thought Ned Beatty and Mary's hail recite. In the end, Sheen, with the Lord's prayer, was very funny, as someone tells you to try it faster. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to watch the movie without realizing it. Tricky Dick Nixon and Vietnam's Warrior <br /> <br /> I hope that everything is worth to Slovik and anyone who wants to follow their example.
