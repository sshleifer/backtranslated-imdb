Lynn Hollister, a small town lawyer, travels to the nearby big city for business mates of his friend Johnny. (Yes, Lynn is a man who, despite being the name of a Christian woman, shortens the reference to the writer John Wayne's name "Marion"?) Hollister believed he believed Johnny was the first accident. But he soon realized that Johnny was dead. More research reveals a corruption, crime and electoral bundle associated with Boss Cameron, the clearest part of the city's political machine. The black cinema style began in 1941. It's not like that. "Man betrayed", despite his theme, is a light romantic comedy, rather than a crime drama. Hollister, Cameron, in love with the attractive Sabra Daughter, concentrates on the movies with suspense items. <br /> <br /> This movie could be serious, if it were serious. drama A reviewer John Wayne has not been credible as a lawyer, but he could not play a cowboy in each movie, and the hard crossing against organized crime would probably have reached his compass. When I agree with the reviewer, Wayne Cary Grant was not an empathiser. Romantic comedy was just on his street. One of the weaknesses in the study system allowed actors to ask their bosses anywhere, whether they were on their streets or not, and Wayne was one of the most important jobs in Republic Pictures. Certainly, he wanted to get the mileage possible. <br /> <br /> That said, Cary Grant could not even comically be a comic book "A man betrayed". This is not a reflection on his comical talents; This movie is a reflection about the fun material. Undoubtedly, I would question anybody who could laugh at whatever mood was developed. The clear heart of the movie is not a successful comedy; It prevents any other thing that does not take seriously. This is not a fish, no flesh or a red sardines. 3/10
