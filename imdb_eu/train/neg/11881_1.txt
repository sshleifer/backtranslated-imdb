This movie is not called "Office Space", except the premise. Office Space were hilarious. I did not recommend anyone to this movie, I did not laugh at the whole movie. Corniff's car retaliation disturbs Jason Alexanders in 15 different rooms. If you decide to watch this movie, use a free rental or watch it at someone else's house, if necessary.
