This film had a great deal of promise, and the argument was quite interesting, but the actors, the director and the editor seriously left this film. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for writers, it might be good. The plays are wooden, very few characters are incredible. <br /> <br /> Who edited anyone who learned new techniques for publishing and wanted to completely impress the movie. In every scene there are almost "exciting" changes, which are clearly symbolic, but they are annoying. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie and I expected it was a decent resolution. to break the balance, but no, I felt that I had lost time and the director of the cinema lost their money.
