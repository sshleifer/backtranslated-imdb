I was glad to see A Chorus Line when I arrived in my city ... then I was younger ... but it was an excellent game ... so someone would please tell me why they had to make a movie on the sky. and why Michael Douglas ??? The film did not fit in well. This movie really shook BIG time !!! <br /> <br /> My advice is NOT renting this movie ... save money as something better than "Cats."
