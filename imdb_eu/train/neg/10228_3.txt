To be honest, I heard that I was very bad when I decided to watch it, but I never gave any impact to others in my views, which is more likely to see something I saw. Before that, Bullwhip gave me one thing, Rhonda Fleming and she had a wonderful eye, she immediately became interested. The image is not very good, and, in truth, it is very morally uncertain, all the characters are in a bad and totally distasteful way, because everyone is motivated by their delights or triumphs. A bunch of despicable people created a shuddering climax of justice and a permanent image. Unfortunately, because you do not end your eyes with sugar, you can not shout out when you're cheating on seeing the bad movie, nobody gets any credit; wood at the end <br /> <br /> Rhonda, too, did not recommend anyone, 3/10
