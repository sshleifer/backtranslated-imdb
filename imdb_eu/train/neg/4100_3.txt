I would say a depressing movie: theater, so to speak. In many cases, I could not feel the expression of the face to speak words or scene. An angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) character thinks he is the anger of the viewer (or sad, happy, frustrated). This is not happening here. <br /> <br /> The characters you already know are the correct commentators of the writers. They do things and say things out of nowhere: Andrew's character accuses his parents of signing their signals together for dinner; Then he blows and storms his father "Do not touch me, you foli!" Perhaps, if we have seen the prequel, what we would have understood is where there is, but there is no prequel, so we have some sort of sea! <br /> <br /> Andrew's curious and surprising thing is to go to an old stone quarry, to sit under the edge of the "still water" below; Then he enters his jeans pocket and pulls out a cigarette and swirls it. He did the same thing three times in the film; I think that this is seen as an act of torture and anger only? Maybe once, but three times? It may take four times, I've lost count. <br /> <br /> Actually, he has recently admitted that he has found it; This is very early in the film, so it is not any dramatic change that may result from this nonsense discovery. It is not clear why that is so bitter or something else. <br /> <br /> I think the movie feels like Lynch, but for the first time the director would really try to climb this scale in the beginning of his career a mountain?
