Sacred cow, what is this movie? I did not know these filmmakers took a book of 250 words and turned them into a movie. I do not know who I know. I do not remember remembering the book being thrown, right? <br /> <br /> <br /> Every time they took classics for children, they added impulse, racket and inuitive sex, and they prostituted Kaka in a joke. This should be a good idea for Hollywood producers. I must say, it was an interesting sight, but the humor of the toilet was a wonderful story (although I think that's funny) I do not know what the kids want. <Br /> <br /> Do not take your children to see, or rent a DVD. I hope that the ghost ghost of Doctor Suess comes and hates people who made this film.
