This movie is all flash and not soul. The actors put a lot of passion into numbers, but often these numbers were not connected to the movie and the music videos were autonomous. And the numbers did not seem to work as if they were going on in front of you, and each one seems to start from one studio, which absorbs the life of the songs. In play, the performances were completely sad and unknown, especially Hudson, the angry black woman we saw before, "strong" (herself and selfish). He did not deepen his character, nor any other female carrier. Although I believe that the film's Hudson character is thought to be its weight, it is really his refusal to do the best for the group that issues problems, so that the end of the movie is completely absurd. Hudson's Oscar is a joke, there is no justification. When he sung, he undertook emotions (but he often lost himself, but he was the perpetrator of the writer / director), but when he did it, he did not write anything. Eddie Murphy's character is unique to the arch, and she did a great job, but it's still a decent Oscar. The only actor that brought something all day was Danny Glover, a character that was relatively small and quite important and made something real. There's nothing here to sink your teeth, drama or heart, or laugh. The location of music numbers was so bad, sometimes it seemed like musical films were scattered; The number that Hudson argues with another girl is so long as she can overcome the scene of a family affair. The movie I do not know what it is, and I have been insulted in the last minutes. It's time to lose it and it's boring, and the movie I've seen in 2006 is the worst, and last year nothing really happened.
