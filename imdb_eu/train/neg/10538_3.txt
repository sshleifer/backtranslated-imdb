First Power (1990) was a horrible film that appeared at the beginning of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s. This movie is very boring but it is very funny in some parts. This movie has so much sense and credibility, not even fun. In this movie, the fast justice systems make Texas look weaker. Lou Diamond Phillips is on top of this role (he plays the cops) and Tracey Griffith (Melanie's most attractive sister) is a psychic. Do not waste this time with this, it's bad. I took a minute. This movie makes a great party. Check out the switchblade cross package, Jesus Nun nunsploitation was not in a flasher. Nun I saw my legs nicest. Yeow! <br /> <br /> This marked the end of an era of L.D. The star was stained and he was not pulled out of his thigh. D.T.V. For him "retrieval" a few years later. <br /> <br /> Not discouraged unless you are disappointed.
