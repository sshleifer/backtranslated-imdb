That was the worst film ever. Chain will appear and Jed boys are there and they all applaud ... so Hollywood. Another scene was bad when analyzing the surface of the pavement that appeared when Kate's hands were paving on the floor. Andie's performance is so bad in this movie - I could not connect or I loved each other. The other two women, however, were very good and Andie was darkened. However, this is such a campy movie. Normally I like this type of film, but I can not get into this movie. After a few days and again, Ande√©'s acting did not support the movie. Also, they are all gums. Lancome needs a makeup with a slim putty, because it looks attractive.
