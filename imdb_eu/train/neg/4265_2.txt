I'm a fan of movie warriors. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, The Last Samurai and Gladiator. After seeing Mongolia, it's absolutely wonderful and I recommend that you have a great deal of hope in the film Sergei Bodrov. But it was horrible, horrible, though pathetic is not a strong case. The whole movie was exciting for me, but it did not mean that at least I expected at least a great epic battle at the end, but that was also a great despair, with some random rushes, swearing by the sword. ... There are so many good warriors in the movies, this is not one of them.
