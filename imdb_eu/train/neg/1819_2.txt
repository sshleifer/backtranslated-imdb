I found a single reason for this film - Al Adamson. He is the worst director of all time: Ed Wood, Jr. and with Ray Dennis Steckler, and with a horrible character. However, I was disappointed, even if it was a bad movie, it had never been a great deal of some of its previous schlocky films. That's why this film was not particularly fun to watch bad movie fans. <br /> <br /> Now, I was careful to watch this movie, because the title "Naughty Stewardesses" sounds like a pornographic movie. cinematography - I do not review something in the IMDb. However, sometimes this feature appeared, especially in the first 10 minutes. However, the script suffered a lot of changes, because of a large part of the movie there was no titillation and at the end of the film there was a plot that was violent and definitely NOT sexy! The result is the confusion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, one of the many parts is not good either. For example, as a pornographic video, it shows surprisingly little, and it is incomprehensible why a 71-year-old boy would put on love scenes. I'm sure, Mr. 71- Livingston looked pretty good, but she was still a man of age and nobody wanted to see her as a young man! Then, when the last 20 minutes become very violent, it has become a man like Livingston Rambo! About strange and unhealthy discussions. <br /> <br /> In general, we do not recommend this sad movie. It's not good enough to take a bad or sexy look and the movie can be quite boring even with a wonderful title "Naughty Stewardesses".
