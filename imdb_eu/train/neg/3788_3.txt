I like it here. The actors are first class and the scripts provide good conversations with the ambience of a family that is so complicated and enjoyable. However, the film is not true. Actually, his VI. The lion learned about the positive diagnosis, Leo reacts, in essence, to the fact that he does not match the solidarity that he finds himself. In addition, the film concludes that Leon, his brothers and other members of the family, have an affection for themselves. The young actor playing brother Marcel brother, Leon, is horrible, and in general, it's the rest. Unfortunately, scriptwriters could not decide whether or not the HIV effect is a profound dissemination about the HIV victim in the functional, attractive, or destructive family? While this movie gives thought, the viewer seems to want much more.
