I rented this DVD when I saw it looking for something else. When I saw the garment I could not believe my eyes. One year ago I read Yalomen's book and I loved it, I admire Yalom's overall work. (I'm a clinical psychologist.) Maybe I've seen 30 minutes of this film and I have been shut down. I do not know how much more I can take. On the surface level, like other comments, the emphasis should be placed on the best and hardest and most disconcerting cases. The play should be boring and comical when it's serious. Lou Salome's portrait is just awesome, and Freud is a bit less than school-savvy. I see little of the spirit of the book until now. I expected this movie to be recommended to my students. Instead, I will refer to the book. Imagine that.
