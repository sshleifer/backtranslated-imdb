I watched this movie in London premiere, and I must say - I did not expect much, but I expected at least something to be entertaining. <br /> <br /> The original "basic instinct" was not an excellent movie and yet it is something "smut classic", but it was entertaining. I remember several times in TV channels on Fridays or Saturdays when I got across the movie and started to pay attention to myself. <br /> <br /> However, this lame-brain waaay-delayed battle does not have anything. Is Sharon Stone still beautiful? Well, let's just put it that way - for a 47-year-old girl, it's pretty hot. Is it as original as beautiful? He has also clearly had plastic surgery on his face, and in this movie his hair is a bit dull. It does not seem as original as gentle or real or apparently innocent, that is to say, an evil seducer and something else. bad and wicked - and Michael Caton-Jones (director who usually does what he does not make sure, but deserves films) has delivered his first authentic turkey; That so bad movie was getting upset at times for some people. <br /> <br /> I heard it through several editing sessions, and it's very clear from the beginning. Nothing makes sense. The whole plot is a cosmic mess and the end - oh! Talk with disbelief and disbelief. (It is still predictable anyway.) I saw "Gigli," I saw "The Mask's Son" and I do not "squeeze" this film even though I can say with my authority (which you do not agree with, remember) I prefer catastrophic disaster Those two films. <br /> <br /> By the way, Stone left for five minutes before the movie started, and in the theater people got rid of things. on the screen while the scene of a horrible and insulting orgy is particularly insolent. <br /> <br /> "Basic instinct 2" - basically, it gets too worsened.
