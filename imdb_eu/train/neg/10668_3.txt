This movie had great actors! Unfortunately, they missed how they played. I expected the film to be improved, since the performance was very robotic and that it was condemned from the beginning. Actually, the actors were reading from a script all the time. Maybe it was the musician or the director, but one thing is surely a makeup artist needs another job! The dusty face was so thick that it hit the actors with the faces! It would not recommend this film to anyone, it's hardly surprising to go to theater. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods are embarrassed to give you all. The plots were just a lot more needed.
