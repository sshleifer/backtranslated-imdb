Was Steven Seagal thinking? First of all, I love Seagal. I love all his films until the middle of 2000. His first works are some of the best genres. However, this is not a great name. Attack Force (Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) is the star of Seagal's unexpectedly innocent move to Seagal's unique single line. However, what we get is a mysterious crime, with little or no collaboration with the political thriller. Seagal is always under his shadow for his weight. I could not follow this story. When people who transform superhuman drugs take drugs. What happened in this movie Seagal's duplication is shame, shame and embarrassment. Why double the man? The story is awesome. I get this 2/10 with Seagal because the request requires backup copies with him as well as him, and the horny battle scene is like a girl in front of the camera searing blind hands swinging! "Revenge is a street of two directions" in this movie, says Seagal ... Do you have to forget Steven's century?
