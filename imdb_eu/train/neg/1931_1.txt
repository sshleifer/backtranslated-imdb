I saw this as a great experience. Unfortunately, the conversation is stupid and, in general, the movie does not inspire awe or interest. A child is also lacking the logic of the behavior of the character. Today's kids need creative stories, inspiring them, which could be awful about events. In fact, it happened with films like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago. (How many children could imagine becoming a Jedi knight and turning their lights on?) Really, you do not lose your time and money.
