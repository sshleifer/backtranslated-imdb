Magnificent Los Angeles "Z" Channel about six months ago This film by Pia Zadora showed "Butterfly." I had so much hope for the actor, and then he goes wrong, of course, in this movie, WORSE. <br /> <br /> They were fifty years old and I said Harold Robbin's work was tightened by the smartest writers. . Jacqueline Susanna (who hated women's way of writing) erased him. Irwin Shaw caught many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had his own kingdom in the early 70's, and then became a stronger and more equal woman, Jackie Collins. men in all books, even more. That's why this odor job. Harold Robbin had just reached the viewer's 80s work. In the work of Pia Zadora Robbin, the kerosine was thrown into the fire. The support cast was not a help either. <br /> <br /> Oooooh ... it was scary, and even look at it 20 years later, it seems even worse. Pia was the hope as an actor and everything was shocked when it was done. It would be difficult to sell Pia to the actress (even though John Waters had a spark in the movie "Hairspray"), although it is a nice voice. <br /> <br /> Hey, Pia, where are you going? .. Hassipray can go on the tour! Take part in the show. It may already be the biggest return story. <br /> <br /> I hope I burn this film, if applicable.
