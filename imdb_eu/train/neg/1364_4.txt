I think more about it, nothing is compacted <br /> <br /> about this movie. I saw 9 months ago, so my memory might <br/> <br /> be worse, but I know that there was less than 4 people at least <br /> <br /> <br /> 10. <br /> < After watching the movie, I met the director. She seemed so rude <br /> <br /> what she was doing or what she did, and, as I said, she was not even watching the movie. Although he agreed he did not know what he was doing and he had to do some things because he had shot it digitally. <br /> <br /> He tried to harden his films to suit the same form: "All 9 people must be in some way linked. <br /> <br /> We can take the 'A' from point 'B' <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the prostitute and we'll see her back again. 10 <br /> <br /> A minute about each other's relationship. <br /> <br /> Two demensional, poorly drawn <br / > <br /> The characters may be dropped. <br /> <br /> I remembered only the angry part of the movie. Steve <br /> <br /> Bouchemi is a scene that's amazing. <br /> < br /> as you say ... 10 from 10
