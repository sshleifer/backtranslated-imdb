At the end of this thriller, the last image of Ally Sheer is used very creatively to complement more than one evil image. He believes in the bad role he played in Bette Davis, he could easily bring it. Unfortunately, I can not see many other reasons. If you missed, what Sheedy looks like in a pair of old glasses (but why should anyone else do it?) Then your answer is. On the other hand, the woman with sexually reluctant sex at Sally Kirkland is very tiring, and even if you like things like that, this tension is spilled in these scenes. Savage savage drunk by an insurance agent is inadequate, but at least it's a small role. One of the most important actors, Nicholas Walker is not a matter of Paul Keller's agitation and role is wood. Dara Tomanovich is better and during Sheedy scenes, the level has risen slightly. Although Sheeda's rigorous and discrete ability (often as a pilot, it seems to be automatic) is a matter of admiration, but it is out of context. The sets are extravagant, the camera's work is not distinguished.
