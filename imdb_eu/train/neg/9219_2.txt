I did not know that when I first saw the TV movie, but I guessed it for a long time. Clear colors, soft characters, and a reminder of what I remember when I remembered the 80's and "Afterschool special" is a "social platform" that is almost shouting. Anyhoo <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> he had I say Gees to myself, I have never had to play D & D exactly in his brother. It was also in the era of M & M D & D's biggest debate that people were lost to contact reality, without worshiping Satan, blah blah. I think that the concern has been a legitimate one at a moment, although it is very rare, but it is a great movie. <br /> <br /> We will find four young universities, who play well-known cave monsters, to socialize and maintain. some time away from everyday life. The submitted M & M is harder than its life in the world. There is no appeal of games here. Jay Jay's request to take M & M "real world" is nowhere to go. It's just a pretext for the characters to fall in nowhere, even though they do not remember that moment. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel are supposed to be different, but they are not really rich with WASPy prigs with problems. <br /> <br /> But things continue, they make it worse in more than one. . The small budget is very clear (I love the "Entry" sign and the cuts of cardboard cuts that are banned). Robbie / Pardu shows why not being a warrior in the harshest moment, and the "two towers" are mistakenly mistaken. hilarious Tom Hanks "Jay Jay, what am I doing?" he laughed at the end of the minute. Undoubtedly, the lowest point in his career. <br /> <br /> Do not look into a passionate satire as a mere piece of the TV bin in the 80s and you're still enjoying it. That is, if you are awake. Most are boring, but Pardu's breakdown is worth the end. At least Tom Hanks has improved. From now on it could not go worse.
