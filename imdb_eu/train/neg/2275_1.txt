Alejandro Amenabarren Reopens the Ojos, but this time he breathes a lively mask. The dubious advantage of the English soundtrack is that we can face Tom Cruider's enthusiasm, as usual, with depth zero. Yes, the character is identified with his character, but we usually give some characters to keep our interest. He denies any of his erotic energy, which is his only attitude to his character and to Cruz or Diaz. <br /> <br /> There is an activation exercise that enriches the oral presentation using masks to release the masks. It means the language. Cruise's masking is a painless actress. See 1997 Amenabar Open Your Eyes!
