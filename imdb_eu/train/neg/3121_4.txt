This movie is trash-poor. The flavor is horrible, and the pedestrian and the conventional writer are based on real facts of the script, which adds nothing but more desperation. Management does not do well with scenes and conversations in different places. I do not know what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. To start off, Williams is not convinced in a gay who breaks a relationship, nor does he find himself interesting. Worse, his character forces a story of a ugly pedophile, based on the plot and there is no place in the plot. You have an older Rory Culkin that reflects different "d_ck_smker" - it's fun ... it's just annoying and then Williams lays the character. Eventually Sandra Oh Williams is a guardian and is the last complete fiasco. Toni Colleter's character is annoying and is the direct trace of 6th Sens's performance. Very bad
