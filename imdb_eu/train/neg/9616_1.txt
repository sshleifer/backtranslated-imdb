First of all, I was doubtful looking at the DVD box and reading it, I read, saying that they could find in the lake a series of teens. Any movie with a premise like this has failed, unfortunately, as well as a slasher movie, except Friday, Friday, Friday. <br /> <br /> I wanted to stop watching the movie at least 10 times, but I still thought it was a bit better. It was not. Usually, I think there is something out there from all the movies. This does not do anything <br /> <br /> Make yourself one side, and find something to do with the builder for 80 minutes. Like, give yourself papercuts, or eat dirt.
