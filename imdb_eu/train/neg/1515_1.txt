I watched the movie "The Flock", due to the question of Gere and Danes, and I thought the story was a synopsis interesting. I have been one of the WORST films I've seen for a long time (and I've seen some turkeys.) I've never been posting offline, but I had to do that. I think this problem starts with a beginner script. The story is absurd and the conversation is so naive to nauseating. Poor Gere, so much better. In Gere / Danes, in combination with the screen, it's not just one minute to believe. I bet that Gere could have recovered the negative desire, such things were possible. It's shame to see so badly missed talent. I can spend two hours. (You know what you are thinking about. How do I really feel?)
