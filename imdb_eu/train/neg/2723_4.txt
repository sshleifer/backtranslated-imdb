Claire Denis's films seem to fit into one of two categories: violent and bloody or calm and intimate. "L'Intrus" enters the first category, but it is not so scary that "Trouble Every Day" or "J'ai pas sommeil." <br /> <br /> Now, since I saw the "Chocolat". I made a point to see all the new films made by Denis. And I've always been disappointed. "L'Intrus" is no exception. He still has to make a personal movie and a mobile as first. <br /> <br /> You get a lot of regular Denis: Beatrizia Dalle who seems old and wonderful, only to show all his lips, teeth spacing, cleavage, and a couple of nice coats; "Trouble Every Day" and "J'ai pas sommeil," Gr√©goire Colin and this Lithuanian or Russian black girls. Michel Subor's character was quite interesting, but he continued his camera for a long time, hanging over his forehead, hung on his forehead, and I was somewhat of a fluoride in Korea that he had finally cut off. <br /> <br /> Sometimes there were some acts: the murder of the deadly man, the son sought by a man - and maybe it was a plot, but the gaze was not enough to figure out, and two conjectures. I'm afraid, right? For some reason, the score was shameless and tragic (as in "Beau Travail"). Other times, the seasons also changed rapidly, and what was happening to him was still confusing. Oh, it looks like some beautiful photos, and if you like "Friday afternoon" with heavy cloth and bed sheets, appreciate "L'Intrus" aesthetics. Otherwise, it's clear. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in French and I missed something essential. In a few interviews in a movie called Denis, there are rarely more than five pages, separated and broad margins. The silence of "Chocolat" is the highest; "L'Intrus," is just dull.
