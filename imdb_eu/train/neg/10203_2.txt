Well, the writing was very demanding, the manager was the worst and the edition was worse (at least I expected the edition). The performance was not bad, but it was not good. He was not quite pleased. At least 45 minutes of that movie was wasting time and it was not used in another one hour or so. It was an excellent idea, but another good idea is wasting it. It could end up in 3 different places, but foreseeing most hollywood expectations. and it was not that the forecasts were so bad that he did not care. the end was not worth it. Sandra Bullock was out of her style and had to stay away from that kind of film. The film also ran. The movie was just worth seeing, and I was paid very crazy. I was disappointed, because I expected a great movie and I was very bad. Not all movies were very bad, but I would not recommend it. I gave 10 b / c to the idea I liked so much and I liked a character (justin, I think, super elegant). Furthermore, the holes were very cheap. As it tried to cover the cheap volcano cover, it was not nice. However, if you see, wait $ 1.50 for a theater or video, if you do not really like all the films you watch, you might like this one.
