It is a typical low budget quarry in the 1970s. Bigfoot must be a docudrama about a crew that runs across the Pacific Northwest. Each character is a stereotype, from the American American and cynical cowboy. The play and narration are a joke. If you expect to see a lot of Bigfoot footage - continue to expect. There will not be much, and what you can do with your backyard is cheap costume and a camera; It would be better than this movie. <br /> <br /> Not like the low-priced 1970s I like; I do it This is a bad performance, bad character, an evil story and you can not enjoy it. It's not a "bad one" category, and you can not laugh without the help of illusory substances. Especially people are camped, hiking, horseback riding and savage life, it's boring. Bigfoot attack is completely stupid; presumably, our friend Sasquatche casts rocks on the outside, as the rifles retract. From that point on, you're fiercely pushing bigfoot filmmakers to drop some rocks and stop the whole thing.
