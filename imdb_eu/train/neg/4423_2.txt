Poverty Row One of the many neglected films of the 1930s, revived by the magic of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Actors stocked the universal player Lionel Atwill (often assisting actor in several Frankenstein films) that twins participate in a murder racket. The victims die (the stock-brokers involved in a fraud) and ask for a specific time as witnesses, because they prove their hat and "innocent" because they could not speak to the witnesses. <br /> <br /> Obviously, where it falls, if it were a congenital body, would not the deaf be? Oh well <br /> <br /> Atwille does it pretty well here, looks like a deaf and dumb. Unfortunately, there's no one doing well here.
