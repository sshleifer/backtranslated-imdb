I still do not have this decision to replace Anaconda with the "worst movie I've ever seen". <br /> <br /> Even though dodgy accents, low productive values ​​and exquisite cameras work out, this film will do nothing. for that. I only saw the book as I read, and I saw how they would work the complicated plot in a 2-hour movie. <br /> <br /> The answer is simple: they did not. The characters show little explanation about who they are and then play a role in their narrative. Although the main characters act without reason, when the movies arrive at the top, they do not care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> I can confirm that the books need to be rewritten from time to time. movies, and maybe it's unfair against the book adapted to judge this film. But after my movie and my friends came out, I had to go through the whole trip I had to spend at home, explaining what happened. <br /> <br /> They also change the books entitled "Rancid Aluminum". If you insert into an unnumbered voiceless piece, so that they have a great movie title. <br /> <br /> A real blend of a short film from the beginning to the end.
