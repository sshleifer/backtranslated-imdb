The unfortunate topical thriller brings together young couples about the most famous killings in the country in American research, becoming a video game partner with a dark young woman and her boyfriend. It's a real psyche. Sharp and strangely, the movie tone between strict and horrible pseudo-irony. Hand made, but eventually horny. It's the way Brad Pitt's low-performing killer says. * ****
