Okay, this story - this story is quite simple: it creates a young man who suffers from death and death, a simple town, and his younger brother and life disaster. However, ideas are nothing (they all have ...) - the execution is everything. <br /> <br /> That's it for me with this tool. And she worried me a lot. The rhythm (direction, edition) was slow, the rhythm was different and the end came. Why have we seen five, six, seven times those highways? Norton's character was a game of children, not deep enough to understand his or her problems / soul / blah and against him or against him. Is coward, manipulative or in vain? References to "Taxi Driver" were ridiculous and useless and certainly left this part (or E.N.). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And IMHO finally completes it. Somewhere Mid America is a cheap trick for adolescent lovers. The guy had to kill the baby, to blame his father, he created a real havoc. Or the boy would have to kill his father, etc. But no, we got an endless cursing, losing loony children somewhere, the father is surprised by his life and relationship and loony, of course, dies. Happy and dysfunctional families are constantly restrained, safe and happy again bored to enjoy our pop-corn. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And this scene that loony enters the film, my God, I should think it's long and harder than something stupid find it! You do not have to shoot a scene with a hidden camera and a hidden trip. The creators of this film probably thought it was a good idea, but it was more annoying. Once again, a 16-year-old girl somewhere in Kansas, everywhere or anywhere, and if you dream of being a crazy grandmother twice your age, OK, then you can enjoy this movie and her "message".
