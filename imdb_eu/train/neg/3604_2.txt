In the days before Toxic Avenger, the kings of the Troma Films mini-camp took a good (slightly smaller) slasher live streaming video. I think they would like to see the results, and I think they convinced all the parodies unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> Splatter University is a film for the spectator masochist. It is worthwhile if two errors and absurd subtleties are included, it really is painful. Let's see if they can make a summary. <br /> <br /> When a dangerous psychopath escapes from a local hospital, Catholic action is taken to university (I do not remember the name, but honoring the title, we will call St. Splatter). Students are evil and embarrassing, and they argue together for abuse, over time. Meanwhile, Julie Parker's new teacher is not showing her work. Children avoid relationships, infidelities, unwanted pregnancies, ridiculous priests, and class work; An awesome Julie lover, St. In Splatter's administrative inflexion, he counts on unmarried mothers, and does not have an empty and expressive expression of his students. Nobody means anything wicked or resolved. Oh, and occasionally a POV shot will come and a little girl dies, but she does not wait for her. There is a Red Herring Killer, and after that, with the Criminal Conflicts with Real Killer, they have returned to asylum and roll credits. <br /> <br /> The slow pace and sub-sub accounts almost seem almost the frustration in the creation of this sense, which publishes the coffee with sound quality, which makes no sense of dialogue. And the worst thing about this movie is the consolidation of the female killer: men in this movie deserve it. I would be fortunate to pay someone to see with a girl with her pregnant girl or a Lotario trio with her girlfriend's roommate, or with a terrible priest. There is no justice.
