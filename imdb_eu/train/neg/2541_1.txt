The original series of the series has never been seen ... I hope that this movie is much better or that it was a fight that started in the 1980s, just as if they did not justify these horrible sequel. This film was a very good progress when it was announced to be shown in one of those old independent stations of the past. Anyway, it seems that it was a terrifying movie. However, it was a movie that Walt Disney could look like. Actually, this movie was just a bunch of light wines, so you can see them almost without huge stars. The actual observation is ending when its shape is seen, by means of a heavy storm, so that the baby is almost a creature that is very desperate. The story is basically that old wicked hunters are seen to have to kill any, and some bold brave in the woods that want to rip away the random boats from the boggy creek and the kids to help out or just randomly boots. It was not really worth seeing, but I would like to see the original, but a creator of the 80s, but in the 1970's "The Town the Dreaded Sundown" movie slasher was good.
