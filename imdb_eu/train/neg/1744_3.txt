In 1985, I watched Malayalam's (Boeing Boeing) movie (inspired by English-style movies simultaneously). The basic story of Garam Masala is the same thing - but it is said in patches, jokes that are commonly found in normal customary films (most likely the director combines Hindi flavor). <br /> <br /> I do not see the English origin. But I really liked the Malayalam movie (which was made by Priyadarshan himself), which was a comedy that was part of it. Of course, the performance of Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (the role of the chef) was so natural and spontaneous. <br /> <br /> Probably, I'm not in Malayalam movies that I do not even suffer from abuses. its Hindi remake But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have been abused. Paresh Rawal has made a decent job - but he has not arrived at Sukumara. <br /> <br /> But everything is fine, if we compare it with the latest Hindi comedy movies.
