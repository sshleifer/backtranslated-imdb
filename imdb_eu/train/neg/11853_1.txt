Let's see, romantic comics compete with light films (they have just been nominated for an Academy Awards every year). But, nevertheless, good ones are really art. Look at "When Harry Met Sally", "Sleepless In Seattle" and "Roman Holiday" and "It Happened One Night" classics. I like to see happiness for two people. <br /> <br /> This film tries to build something like a romantic comedy. But no one believes in the love of the main characters, and there is nothing more important to compensate for fun. It remains the main model, especially a romantic one. Surely as an executive producer, he had means - but he did not reasonably throw himself away. And Gershon ... I see the possibilities of some talented comics, but he has no script and undeveloped characters. And whose idea was an accentuated English? Nonsense <br /> <br /> The others have said, but I want to repeat it: this story is not thought of, poorly executed; the actors are terribly disturbed; And the characters, well, just give them a hoot around them. <br /> <br /> Art is not in this form. Go again to "Moonstruck" rent again.
