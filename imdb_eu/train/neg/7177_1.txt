I loved the original "Caligula", even with all its mistakes, I must say that this remake trailer is abysmal. <br /> <br /> Listening to Jovovich saying "lazy accusers" say "mmm cuhligyooluh ...". I feel ill. The set is not like a Roman ... it seems like a backyard's Hollywood home theater, and Roman clothing is like a cheap hook in a suburban store shop. <br /> <br /> This "charming" Adriana Asti looks like a fifty-year-old Hispanic woman who is terrified of herself as if she were not aware of the movie's trailer. <br /> <br /> Then the actor has to be the worst thing I've ever seen. "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!" Many of the lines I hear randomly. As powerful and badly annoying as you can. <br /> <br /> The random sex scene also included 40% and 50% of a trailer, and scenes with major actors / actors like Gerard Butler. three and a half seconds of shadow) that do not do anything, but they seem to me to be uncomfortable, or those that go above with their smallest lines, when they carry them down with their ridiculous delivery. A part of Courtney Love's hanging on his usual garbage bitch against the moon's moon or something. You can not notice that it is drunk or high, or just idiomatically cheating. <br /> <br /> Karen Black is just a nuisance ... he screams laughingly and cries out as you cry. <br /> Helen Mirren ... was the original and comes back to "Caligula" ... "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Especially "I love" (and I love love, I mean hell) Enni's line, "Caligola ... j00 does not maki me * something incoherent .... * It seems like J00nalo ..." To say Caligula four is also proud. The king of the year was greater than Jesus' birth and death. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is the worst, most exploitative and fanciful joke named "ever seen". Although Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula, he would not show or give his name to the trash, even if it was paid (a million tonnes). The worst trail
