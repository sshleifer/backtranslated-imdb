The book is fantastic, this movie is not. There is no reason why this film can not take the futuristic technological book of the book. The total of the total of hell a few years later was released and that's a good thing, even when he was released in the 70s trying to make a world of futuristic watches with an orange watch. A narrow German expressionist color, black and white in the visual screens, is no reason for this approach when the film was created in 1984. The main character is working on writing a white collar but still works with oil. and grease in a garage. This film decides to make a communist challenge for the design, atmosphere and subject matter. However, the novel is not necessarily directing a humble and communist worker who worships. This book has to be adapted in modern contexts because this book is more important than ever. I could not see more than 20 minutes from scratches. The soundtrack is annoying, it's unforeseeable. This film has been made to deny the sense of realism or credibility, that is, when asked to see the messages of the novel.
