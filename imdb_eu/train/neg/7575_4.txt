A retired diplomat from Michael York goes to Russia to take revenge on Russian gangsters killed by the diplomatic police. The diplomats help the Russian gangster to take him to justice. The Russian gangster helps justice. US Just Government. It is interesting to see Russia as the heroine of this time. <br /> <br /> It's not an excellent movie, it's usually a "B" action movie. Michael York in a few cases gives a short film. Alexander Nevsky, as the Russian police are saying, is "blah", but it's amazingly chemistry with Michael York. That face, Michael York, is a good actor, who would have chemistry for anyone who plays a scene. Unexpectedly, beautiful Adrian Paul dies during the first 15 minutes of the film. Now, if Adrian Paule is longer in this movie, it would be above the average "B" average movie. I can tell about Adrian Paul in the first 15 minutes of the movie, it's really nice. Richard Tyson reproduced that evil is your bad guy. She is very blonde and very bad in this movie. <br /> <br /> Let's rent this flick on TV. It's ok It is not bad to suck. The scenes of the actions are decent. The play could be better, the plot could move much faster, but you'll see what Russia looks like today!
