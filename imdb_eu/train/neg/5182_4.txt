As in most festivals, Hamiltons makes an interesting movie that has all the ideas and little run. Although impressive, it is a small budget that the film gives its last shot and becomes extremely long as it is drawn and obvious. The film is about an outside family trying to survive after killing their parents. People are kidnapped and fleeing from them and feed something in the basement. There are some dark and humorous shows of Mckellhar and Firgens and the rest are so many. The film never feels realistic or very disturbing. But in the first part, the mix is ​​amazing and dark, and what he gets is amazing. The next half was not so successful, as in the case of film oblivion, the twisted realism that goes into a completely hilarious movie that turns the whole movie. It is definitely worth the trouble to have some talents involved in this production and, despite being very flawed, remains an original and creative. It's very bad when it's delivered at all levels. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
