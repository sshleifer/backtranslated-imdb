He rented it last night. Opening (2001) WAAAAAAAAAY was too long. Hitchiker scene has no purpose. Some skits were delayed. I knew before, Chevy Chase less than 2 minutes. No problem Here are some of the best pieces: <br /> <br /> KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield song <br /> <br /> Total: 75-minute material 75-minute film <br /> </ p> The rest He was no fool or stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some advice: if you want raw films that capture TV and movies, rent "Kentucky Fried Movie". If you want less film and TV movie shooting, rent "AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON" or "UHF" <br /> <br /> <br /> otherwise, do not worry about this movie. You'll save 2-3 dollars. <br /> <br /> IMHO: Ken Shapiro's best movie STILL is "modern modern".
