Easter is jaw-droppingly bad. So, it's not that I started somewhere so bad. So, let's see ... Mira Sorvino, whose protector is filmed during her husband's trial, runs the police work from Madrid to Seville. In Holy Week (Holy Week, see? ... Everyone starts to sleep ... since the beginning has been so bad, since a murderer runs his bulls as a bull. Olivier Martinez and Feodor Atkine will find it nice. Soon he realizes that the killer will be the next target (wearing a red garment). Why, oh but why? <br /> <br /> Why ... that's the whole question the whole movie has on me. <br /> <br /> Q: Why did we see A: why? I love you Mira Sorvino (I'm sorry for this FIRST SIGHT) <br /> <br /> G: Why did we have only 8 people in the theater the first week after the release on Saturday? A: ah ah ah. Spider-man revived the same day. But, also, the film has been an excellent review. <br /> <br /> Q: Why this movie has been made? A: I guess money. But the monarch needs Mira to make money. <br /> <br /> then ... why ??????????? First and foremost, there is always something wrong with European co-productions. Here you are French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish. yi-ha <br /> <br /> Then he wants to play the same thriller / slashers / whodunit / mysteries / whatever playgroung. Although VALENTINE, unfortunately and badly written and filmed, was much better in suspense and fun. <br /> <br /> Then, in order to inform the story, the scriptwriter wanted to add a political vision of the story to the story. . Wrong: the flashback on a similar circulation photography is undoubtedly the most interesting thing in the film. It could not be stuck, it would not sit through the whole movie. Better to go directly to Guillermo de Tros at THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE (The Devil's Spine) to make fun. <br /> <br /> Then homophobia. Bullseye! First victims S & M drug addicts are twin gay gay twins. The annoying Mart√≠nez, however, goes to a dating agency that comes with a bizarre bearded shave with a hairy blonde with platinum. The call calls all the time to see the character of Sorgo. Do we need such things? Nah. Simply, they are just the necessary offensive comments. <br /> <br /> Then a suspense. Yipee. There is no apparent reason. The first killings are common illusions, because they are a representation of a famous painting. But no. And I think the revelation of the murderer (brilliant fascist, of course) from the beginning was the end of the film, I think, the director told me that it was time to "end the era of the damn movie. We will now explain what the murderer is and why he dies." <br /> <br /> <br /> Then the director thinks he is the director. Wrong: it is not sensible, no sense of direction to act, the knowledge of rhythm change. A giant, mega bore. Easter scenes are not necessary (maybe the co-production rule says: well, shoot in Seville, but show some credit for this historic and beautiful town with Easter celebrations. We are here: a mysterious movie tourists!) </ B> <br /> Then the actors. All mistakes Mira Sorvino dies himself: he does nothing doing anything in his right hand. All that he did best (Replacement killer, Aphrodite strong ...) was never the same. Olivier Martinez ... hello, nobody here? Are they going to learn how to be the actress, but not the manikin of speech or feeling? Feodor Atkine, soft and transparent. We only respect Alida Valli, one of the greatest actors of the last century (and I expect more of today's role). Here is the main attraction, giving only one life of its bad lines. I will not mention the other actors, only one-sided characters, but interesting and superficial. <br /> <br /> Non-consistent management, inconsistent actors, impossible plots. Idiocy encarnated. <br /> <br /> Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
