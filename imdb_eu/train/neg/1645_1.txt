This week I watched the movie and warned me to watch this movie for everyone else. In a nutshell As I feel like in the serenity, a scriptwriter would be written by Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy, that is, all other words were a curse. I do not have a problem with a deep curse, "Good Will Hunting", to deepen the characters. In this case it was vain to hear the audience often attempting to laughter or laughter. The three protagonists have their own stereotype, the wall street, the coffee jerk, and the "ni-ez-Gay-Just-in-Touch-My-Feminine-Side" are a little bit less. of-a-jerk You do not do any harm! The losers are the losers and unwanted ones. At the Festival, we have some fun moments, beginning and ending. The toilet / vibrator scene is fun in "Uh, y" in a bad way. Actually, I would recommend this movie to the worst enemy.
