I'm so confused. What is this movie in the world? What was the motivation of the murderer? It seemed angry, but I still do not know why. There's nothing in this movie. The depth was zero. Or less than zero depth. I think it would be a hill. Or a stack. Rough The performance was horrible. When I started looking for some of the actors in this movie, I heard very little, I heard them, and that was not surprising. I can not help feeling that you feel embarrassed by this bad movie or feel that they have to offer something like that. Starting . . ORAIN! (Seinfeld's reference.) Actually, do not miss this. There is little, there's no way to have fun. Without a doubt, this was the worst slasher: NO, a bad-looking movie, I had a bad mood I've ever seen and I've seen very little.
