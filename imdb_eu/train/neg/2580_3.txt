well its official They killed American Pie. The first 3 hysterical ones, but this and others have been incredible. I mean that the story is about fighting their houses about two brothers in their homes, I mean talking about a weak plot, the first three have grown, and the weddings are all points of development in human society. <br /> <br /> Stifler is the newest joke, it's hard to compare with Steven Stifler but not cigarettes. I give this movie 3 because it has 2-3 fun pieces in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best character in this movie, of course, is that Jimen's father does not know why he continues to do it wrong. developed films
