Like Cannibal Sex, or Devil Hunter is a popular English-speaking person, Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner, Ursula Fellner) has begun an actress and model with a new movie with the film's supporting actor, Jane (Gisela Hahn). After working for a long time, Laura is relaxing in a bath in her room, and Chris (Werner Pochath) and Thomas (Antonio Mayans), both dubious, have exploded and kidnapped her, accompanied by treacherous Jane. Laura's agent gets the renting hero Peter Weston (Al Cliver) who reports this situation. The plagiators have an isolated island in Laura and claim 6 million guarantees. Peter will pay 200,000 to return to safety and return another 10% to 6 million euros, even if he gets faster than a rat in a flight, Peter and his Viet Nam veteran helicopter pilot are Jack. to decide how to save the island and Laura. Thus, the hijackers Laura and Peter have 6 million, but they do not want to report it. To make things more difficult, this specific isolated island is the home of a original tribe (hell, in all generations where they lived, built a straw hut, which is now primitive). Altman) When the eyes are blinded by God, with human sacrifices and cannibalism this white young woman likes flesh and intestines ... <br /> <br /> Writing and writing this Spanish, French and German coproduction It was the director of the fertile Jesus Franco who also gives credible music. Sex Cannibal has won one of the most popular in the United Kingdom since it was listed in the 'Video Nasties' by the beginning of the 80's, according to the alternative title Devil Hunter, and therefore officially obscene and prohibited, I have no idea. why is it a bad movie, and even Franco, afraid of tying a fearless turkey, decides to hide it with Clifford Brown's pseudonym. I think that the greatest hardness of Francoism would also be difficult to defend this. Frank's screenplay, I'm sorry I'm Clifford Brown and Julian Esteban, Julius Valery was finally shocked by the end of the product and wanted to get rid of what he was named. It's just as simple and straightforward. First of all, the movie is so boring, kidnapping is one of the most mysterious things I've ever seen, without a lot of strain or excitement, and horror things are not improving when we get a big black. The eyes of giant and stupid eyes, plus two canals stairs. Cannibal Sex fades as a horror movie and does not have much success in action adventure. That is what must be avoided. Franco's director shows his usual incapacity; The land with large leaves around the bottom of the neck, to try to avoid adding anything. Kanario scenes are poor, action lama and walks through the jungle with scenes of random people, from "A" and "B" and do nothing. Watching about 10 minutes is very boring and boring, and do not forget that this is in 94 minutes while it is out of season. Also, I must mention the ridiculous scene that suits Al Cliver cliffs, that is, Franco gets his camera to turn around and cliver on the ground! Look how to cover the coat, and never catch it, it just pushes it. Gore is not very good and as Euro Canibal films are very varied, there are some approaches close to cannibal mouths, because they make meat pieces, a man is full of kidney, a little blood and a handful. intestines There is an unpleasant scene with Cannibal Sex and rape. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sex Cannibal needs a small budget and is low. This makes bad films, with special effects that are awesome and with rock-bottom production values. The only thing that is decent is the least real-world environment. Music sucks and sound effects becomes annoying when there is a lot of breathing in the cannibal screen. The play is sucking, of course, everything has doubled, but nobody has done that. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Sex is a terrific film, it's a serious mistake to be as boring as hell. I can say good things with a lively atmosphere and groceries to chew cannibals are quite serious. Anyone who seeks a decent movie experience should give the widest possible Sex Cannibal.
