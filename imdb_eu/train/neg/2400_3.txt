No, this was not one of the worst films in the 1980s, but, of course, it is located somewhere in the 100th. This movie was released in the shelf after two or three years old in 1981. Otherwise, how would you describe the special effects that are still pre-existing "An American Werewolf in London", and still a cool disco, and that Ronald Reagan is not the 40th President of the United States? At that time, do not forget the 1970s hairstyles in the 1950's and 60's. That's where I saw "Happy Days" and "Laverne & Shirley" combined. <br /> <br /> The movie was the tallest woman in the "so bad, good" category. Elizabeth Hartman is great, but it's hardly any. Biff is Miss Montgomery, a seamanship teacher who becomes a sexpot, is a stereotype that has been dying and is still emerging from Hollywood, but also as a "hot chick". That's why it's his call. Miss Wimp seems better than that. "Seven dollars in a beauty salon shot in hell". He did not start jokingly. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that there are no good parts in other places, they are just a few and I do not say that I like it. Hartman By the way, "Teen Wolf" was better than that. "Teen Wolf Too" was better than this, and that was not so good. <br /> <br /> <br />
