I just rented it and I saw it all to see this movie. So that's my reactions. It's easy to see that this is an inexpensive movie budget quote. The main argument of this film is about retaliating women for their rapists. This film could be a provocative film. However, the movie does not interfere in any way. He got bored. This movie can be a summary of less than 45 minutes. There are a lot of scenes, mostly, to complete the time, for example scene scenes and some scenes described below. <br /> <br /> ************ It has a spoiler ***** ******* I think the scene of rape is quite dear. I do not know if I saw an incised or cut version, that version really exists. I've found many pitches in the plot already written. Here is a list in my head. <br /> <br /> Why do not rapeers rape Jennifer midnight when they got out of the house to find out what they are. That would be a great time. <br /> <br /> Why do not they want to rap, but instead of delaying the pleasure of some rapists, for a long time prolonging Jennifer's lengthy time. It may be more touching and worrying. <br /> <br /> I thought it was very stupid to let rapists leave the woods and return home. Perhaps, to prove that these rapists are really proud. <br /> <br /> At least these recipients should know if they want to do dirty jobs, they do not have to send a temporary coward to work. /> <br /> Why did not Jennifer call police rapes after he finally left? It should be the first thing that will appear before many people, especially for someone who is a writer. <br /> <br /> Why did not these rapists dangle in the clouds when they saw Jennifer alive? <br /> <br /> I think it's amazing that a slim lady like Camille can pull a man. tree and hang it. ************************ End spoiler *********** <br /> <br /> But yes, this movie It's not without its merits, Camille Keaton is beautiful and I'll hear one of the funniest lines I've heard recently when he backs home to Mateo and protests at Jennifer. Why am I, I did not!
