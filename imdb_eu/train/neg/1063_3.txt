The idea is nice. Having so many stars in a movie is great. But ... too much story, too short and no sense. There is no scene connection. 3-4 stories were excellent ... but these were 18. The frames reminded me of "all the invisible children" - I really liked the movie. On the other hand, "Paris Je T'Aime" is not developing a short story, which begins and ends with the development. And there is no lack in all of these issues. I do not find a topic in Paris to connect 18 short sketches together. Maybe it's interesting for those who know Paris. Otherwise, I would not recommend ...
