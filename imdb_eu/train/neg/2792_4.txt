STUDIO 666 (THE POSSESSED in UK) is another DVD, directly to the DVD movie slasher sub-pair. <br /> <br /> While many live DVD movies are fast. Paced or mistakenly ridiculous in so-bad-in-the-way, STUDIO 666 is a lamentable failure. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing, all comments on the first page include negative and negative score review. . Each of these people got their nails on their heads. <br /> <br /> Two people (from 10 to 10 when they wrote at the time) were not to be taken seriously. Of course, they have seen shorts and they even more restrict their understanding of horror. <br /> <br /> The only positive point that can be made about this movie is better than CHOKE and one of them. My worst enemy I do not want, although I do not want the two very minimal films I do not want! <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie has been made hundreds, not thousands of times. The film only has a small twist to the usual expectations (and one that is badly handled). A depressed singer is suicide. Shortly thereafter, his spirit returns to possess one of his surviving friends. The aforementioned friend will die. The rest of the plot is very curious to summarize. You should see for yourself, if you only know that your interest is still extinct. <br /> <br /> The interpretation of the film is very poor. The actress Dora played was an exception. His character was always interesting and attractive on the screen. It helps to increase the film over current similar efforts. Unfortunately, they told me that the line was written incorrectly, so it prevented the movie from being stored. <br /> <br /> There was also little management. The criminals did not seem to be a minority threatening, all murders were without suspension or tension, the atmosphere did not exist and the camera's work was very basic. Some of the special effects (if you can call them), TV shows, GHOST STORIES, reminded me. Unfortunately, for the producers of this film, scriptwriting written by GHOST STORIES, unbelievable interpretations and excellent camera angles were made. If producers were watching TV series closely, maybe they could get a movie that could save you from that excuse! <br /> <br /> Music is not very appropriate for the tone of the movie. Rock is just music and not the best examples of this type. Do not get started at this awesome song! <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film, especially the interview, are unfortunately funny. Unfortunately, it is not enough fun to take the movie (or should it be down) to be bad at this level. <br /> <br /> In general, STUDIO 666 is a very mediocre slasher world that is very noticeable. parties I only recommend for direct DVD movie lovers and I would like to see all the slasher ever made.
