And when the first scene about the white beard began, I recognized my DVDs at "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> Continuing and following the movie, and continuing to meet the scene we and my friends were "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> We were very disappointed, 90% of the footage is part of "Planet Earth".
