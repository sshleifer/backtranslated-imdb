This dramatic drama comedy was a strange review that premiered in 1979. I opened the LA Times movie section and I searched for two pages of "Second Chapter": "Better than the The" farewell girl! "Neil Simon is doing it again!" What does Neil Simon do? He takes an autobiographical situation (after the death of a beloved boy, if he ever marries again) and makes him rusty, unpleasant and worst. James Caan is a Neil registrar. , that is, George, the writer who can not return to his life after losing his wife: enter the credible Marsha Mason (true life, Mrs. Simon ... she will be executive. Simon), who tries to love George, despite his mood and general melancholy. It's been here and on that day if it was not for Caan's indifference (Valerie Harper is painful and crazy, that is, the procedure stops.) Mason's last victory I liked at the end ("I'm wonderful! I'm NUTS!"), But I did not Two happy be happy. ** ****
