Gore Vidal's novel, one of the great American writers, carries on a whisker, like MAGNI KRISTIANOA and Fellini's DOLLS in Valencia. Raquel Welch, the star of the incredible (and not really great) body, (except KANSAS CITY BOMBER, was very good) in Rex-Reed (bad movie reviewer, not criticist) in alter-ego surrounded by drag queen Mae West, horny John Huston, young and "naive" Farrah Fawcett (pre-Lee Majors, what embarrassment), and many other creep-azoids WAY to spoof to plan things that did not go for that, except for the shorts of short films (for example, LIFE MORTALDIA, Lena Horne) ... JUST, so they can continue to take away all their lives. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 Best performance = ?. It's so bad, it's seen!
