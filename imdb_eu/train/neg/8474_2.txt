The opening scene moves as light as ice cream freezer. I would like to control the ability to play a dramatic conversation in advance. Vampires usually portray sexy, intelligent or shameless creatures. This vampire tries to captivate his prey by imitating a lost dog. I usually see a body count, so a cat (that is, not counting) the bull, a girl that fell from the sky (regardless of the sword) and then on the plot. The artist Foley respects the functions of creating an arm-shaped arm, but the use of a vampire to give a victim to an apple is very rare. I liked Warlock, but this movie was so bad that we were wrong when it was awakened and it was so unforgettable a year later we rented it off again.
