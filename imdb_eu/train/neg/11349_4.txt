Actually, this is a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first animated 3D animated film. I bought 3 years ago on the DVD. Bug's Life did not do that too? I think it was Disneyworld from that tree, so I'm going to say that there's no logotype before using it. Shrek 3D was a simulator of Universal Studios. They should continue playing as a movie because it appeared on "theater" and you can buy it on the DVD. The movie was pretty, at least they were small flyers. I liked the IQ. I agree with an animaster, they made a dean, something that is nothing more than an adventure outside the movie. I recommend family and children.
