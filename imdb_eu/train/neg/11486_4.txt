Some people, like me, want to know about a movie, if you want to see it, end it. However, I end here as I remember, I was not over 8 years old when I first watched TV and only. But I'll tell you, I was sure that the baby was frightened, and I thought a few days later, and it still stands still in my mind, even though some details are a bit vague. Was Abe Vigoda this movie? I do not remember! I did not even remember that Barnabus was in this movie and I loved darkness. So, in the end, I remember the main character (Belinda Montgomery?) Judge (Joseph Cotton, I'm guessing), even though I remember being an old family doctor or instead of a judge; do you see how the memory disappears? to the place of marriage, as I recall, in a certain rock? Maybe that's wrong; and Shelley Winters laughed and the judge has a cape, looking at the angle of the camera, and throwing back the mantle, and has goat's legs and announces the devil is really a demon. , and has played right (in the hands of satanic worship), with the kind of "mortal" in love (it seems to be Robert Foxworth) it turns out that Satan is a person who wants to marry her, The Demon. With Yellow Eyes, and surely, Robert Foxworth will show them, and their eyes shine. There are many shorts in the last minutes. Everyone is laughing and being guarded, except Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy, and shouts, screams or something, and that ends. They win bad guys.
