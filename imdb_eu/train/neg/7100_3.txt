This movie starts a promising and then confuses and confuses. Kamal Hasan has made a great effort to make this period look good, he was not guilty for more time on the plot. Most of the small movie characters are not shown for specific reasons. <br /> <br /> Generally, very depressing, I would recommend avoiding the movie.
