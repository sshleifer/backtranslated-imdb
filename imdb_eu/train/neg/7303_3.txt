Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth.Roth and Randy Pearlstein. The script written by Rothe wrote a story called Roth, that is to say, much more than George Romero and his first "dead movies", a zombie movie, and the "Evil Dead" of Sam Ramie's original "Ramon Massacrenot" from Texas Ramon. There is nothing original about it, and the story is not compelling. The play is similar to this genre, we've seen the story we've missed before. and better done. If he did not get a commercial movie, Rothe decided that the director was extremely terrifying, courageous and absurd (but much more ambitious) with the hostel. You should leave behind. Baby Fever is not a good movie, but compared to the inn is an artwork. I hope someone (preferably a psychiatrist) thinks the film chooses the right career. Cabin fever, 3/10 weak, not as an aby Hostel.
