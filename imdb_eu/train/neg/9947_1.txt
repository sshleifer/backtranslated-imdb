This movie was awesome. I swear, though I do not write a script simply for the whole movie. Ice-T was annoying. * Similar reasons to see SPOILERS Phht. * Sit for 20 minutes for breakfast. he could not disappear. The earth was tough, it would be almost impossible to keep track of dogs. And ICE-T is in the Hill and uses Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN as a sniper rifle (and then cut a tree with eight shells) to take 1,000 shells to cut a tree with a size. and manual guns are set at 100 horsepower. And they saw reflection. What reflected the light? I did not see the scope around this. Also, when he was involved in the intestine and continued, he delayed to kill him. Eating bacon or cigarettes in the boy. It would not blow and kill. Bullet would still rub Ice T, but barrel mess.
