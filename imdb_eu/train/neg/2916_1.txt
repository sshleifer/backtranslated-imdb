This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Land and message is horrible. There are too many mistakes in this movie, it's impossible to keep it. I do not understand how this film can get the candidature, and even less. 2 Here's why: 1) Sam Lee represents an irrational and irrational detective caused by his father's despair. Professionals: it is very angry. Control: in terms of explanatory scene, he can not convey his sadness / disappointment to his father. The false scene was false and it seems literally to tighten the eye to the corner of the eye. 2) When connecting to the movie title, the sounds of dog or dog were sculpted during battle scenes and rape scene, which is absolutely irrelevant and the viewer is confusing. I understand that it is a metaphor or something that is not ... but it's just so muted! 3) WHY HECK COPS DOES THE STAFF DO NOT HAVE? It's wrong in this movie. When the murderer began to shake an officer, take him. It's dead already! What the hell There were many options for the killers, but I do not know why it was not! 4) The little girl had a pain in her foot during the scene. In the scene, it was very clear that the girl's footstool was wounded, so how heck next time the scene gives full weight to her left foot? And this is the actress nominated for the best actress? WTF? 5) The sound of the movie is synchronization turned off. <br /> <br /> 6) I think that this film will bring awareness of wildlife and violence among Southeast Asian children. Won, and then got into the police fight? 7) This film is violent for no purpose. Do police beat CI's pasta and then cooperate with marijuana and coke? This is, in general, the worst movie. I really feel that this is a sadistic and ill person that writes this film. I have never bored a movie in my whole life. OPEN TO BE ACHIEVED!
