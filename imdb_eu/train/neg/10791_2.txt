Awesome movie If you do not want to see a Turkish film in 2006, you should be Banyo. Waste time A short film short of laughter this film does nothing, anything, sense, zero. The conversation is cheap and there are all sexual encounters. The director must see more films before attempting to direct himself. The heads of the red girl show what the actors do not have to do. If you are not interested in acting, the performance is bad. The only thing that can be said about the film is good, wait, wait, I can not say anything good. I really liked not writing much about it. Jeez!
