I feel this movie badly. XX. At the beginning of the century, the Hollywood artist as a candy sets a new bass, although Moderns or (gasp) Cradle Will Rock was past and I never thought I would see 2 times less than the movie. periodically However, suggestions and results were similar. <br /> <br /> First, there is a huge casting: Eddie Izzard CHAPLIN? Sorry? Peter, did he owe something to this guy? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies? Holy smoke, people are not trying to figure out the appearance or sound of the time they seem to seem. <br /> <br /> Well, the last Film Festival was a decent movie, but this is a disaster. and the rest of Bogdonovitch's photos were not much better. In the past, they defeated Welles and Hitch and Ford. TCM hosting is still good.
