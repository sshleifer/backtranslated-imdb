This movie was too long, even 75 minutes. The problem with the jungle horror movies is always that people walk (in the jungle, along a rocky cliff, next to the river or lake) that there is always time to walk. The film is always worthy of watching the ridiculous and naked zombie with its huge native and bloody zombies, always in a confused and reverent breath. Eurotrash enthusiasts will offer a great English dubbing, a gift of feminine flesh and stupid makeup in the monster and in their extractions. For a zombie / canyon movie, it was pretty clear on gore, but I probably did not see any version.
