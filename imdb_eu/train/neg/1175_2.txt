Rohmer faced a lot of digital technology. Sometimes it works well, the scene that graces Grace and her maid is remotely moving. King's execution is especially striking. Sometimes the movie looks strange, it looks like a home video. However, the main mistake is that mise's scene is purely artificial in the viewer that it creates an alienating effect. We know what we are seeing is not real, how do we feel for the characters? To be honest, I did not care what happened to the lady or the duke. <br /> <br /> There's another lack of a flaw, I can say, is the star of Lucy Russell. It's almost every scene and it is based on the success of the movie or its performance. OK, he is speaking the foreign language, but he can not express emotions. With the help of his friend Mme de Meyler (a great concert of great concert Helena Dubiel) he excited to see the audience at the head of a polo that excited the audience. Also, see when your hands express emotion! <br /> <br /> Very bad film, especially with positive reviews on the web.
