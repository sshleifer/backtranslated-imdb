Man, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1) Adam Arkin is a bit more noisy than Ross Geller 'Friends' <br /> <br /> 2) A great job is wasted (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this angry script. 3) The film suffers from a long career. She jumps around in a confusing and confusing way. <br /> <br /> 4) The story does not make sense. Why do you want to break the soccer line? What stupid violin music is? Not one of them explains. <br /> <br /> 5) It's not fun. He tries to think about creating accountants, saying "Lookit me! Lookit me being funny!" This was a bad attempt to make another "Love at First Bite". <br /> <br /> I like Larry Cohen, but the man has failed. I can not wait for credits. Terribly disappointed
