This is absurd: aside from the australian fellow who reviewed this film, I can not believe anything, but all those who have sent a review so far thought they were part of Elektra's production. . <br /> <br /> I admit that I was not a fan of conversations in comic books, so I did not have many hope, but I still think Elektra is very remarkable. There was no explanation in the film that he was so much in the movie that he thought so much: "huh, what's the significance of the plot?" or "how did the character's character come about?" I only expect a few things to appear in Daredevil, but I do not want to see. <br /> <br /> In addition, the behavior of the characters of this film appears when they make a face. The moments of adaptation according to the story, and I'm not starting to radiate the sub-plot for beginners. I also show the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character (I still do not explain it on the surface). <br /> <br /> If you could give this movie strictly to yourself, the excellent shots were shot, but otherwise I did not enjoy Elektra's enjoyment. I know that fantasy / action is not supposed to be asked, but almost everything in this movie is so unknown or confusing (even the standard movie films). <br /> <br /> Well, hell, at least Jennifer Garner looks good.
