The story was good, but it was not very well-known. I liked the main theme and storyline, which was not as clear as it was. It might have happened too much and there was no power over the king. The play was very cursive, some were more powerful than others, and moments of great quality at the time of the strong cast. I needed two months to go through the whole movie, I did not pay attention and the flow was bad. I just finished finishing and I'm happy that the movie is finally moving and has a bit of continuity. Once again, the story is good, but delivery par. It would recommend a little bit of a story line and perhaps some eye candy, and I mean, a little.
