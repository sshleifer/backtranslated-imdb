The holy God is terribly awesome. This movie was very bad, I thought I was in the drug store. In a bad way ... the character plays is the worst thing I've seen for some time. This movie is similar to G-Strings, IMHO (it's a real movie). Most of the movies appeared in a horrible green screen. My favorite part was in the car, and you can say that there is no horse. They run away from strange monsters, and as fast as they run they will make the same speed. Then CG rides with a ridiculous horse that goes far away. And, in general, CG is similar to Beyond the Mind's Eye 1992. I mean, let's go, really. It was like a horrible event in Hercules, only to save Kevin Sorbo there. Worst Movie Then
