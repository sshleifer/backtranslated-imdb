There is no sun fall down called "The Sunshine Boys", the only ironic moment with the name of the supposedly legendary comedy Neil Simon. Simon adjusted his play script (that is, without accreditation), it seems to be the same with irrational behavior in old age - and, worse, evil, gallant, irrational behavior of guilt. Walter Matthau is impatient with an interpreter of an old memorable man, with George Burns, a former member of the comedy team, for a particular television set (43 years ago, asked how long was Vaudeville?). Burns, when he won an Oscar for an assistant, has been in the mood for about 30 minutes. At that time, Matthau has already returned the material to hell and back. It gets the most frustrating movie, less exposed and visible. Herbert Ross did a good job, along with a script by Neil Simon; Here Ross generates guds as an amateur thudding avoiding belligerent routines (for example, Matthau's semi-consistent, audience-making television for a mechanic's garage). At this time, Matthau was still young to achieve this role, and he compensated too much by slouching and hollering. Ross and Simon decided to diminish the character, trying to give him a bit of temperament from the sun "The Sunshine Boys", but Walter still thinks he is still close. The image is incredibly insolent and crawls at a spiritual rhythm. initially lose hope. * 1/2 ****
