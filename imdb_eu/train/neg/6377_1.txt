This is a very nice and enjoyable film that is exploited by a black film, which is, of course, the movies we love a lot in our home. These films are either "exploited", or besides being more serious, they give a precious overview. Well, not Bucktown. <br /> <br /> In this story, he returns to Duke Bucktown to work with the night club that recently left his brother's brother. He quickly learns that the city is controlled by a rotten police force, which will save money from local businesses. The Duke refuses to face it and decides that the city will rot the police. Unfortunately, he does it in the closeness of his friends (people are almost unknown, since some dukes had collaborated with Duke for the first time in the "jobs" past) and the whole departments of police are dying of cold blood. And they literally do nothing to stop hundreds of witnesses. Ignorance is not justification for the murder, and it would be much more entertaining for Cracker Police to act out of action than just street action. This revenge is a matter of generosity and general assertion in this genre's films, but it is far from Pam Grier's reluctance to see his family reluctant to see thugs, that is, giving and using a jujitsu donkey dog. In the fireplace This has an art (and it's already a reason) and it deserves a degree of respect, just like someone shot in the back. Of course, in this strange story, a woman is playing at the fingertips of the man, who is in charge of the cries and the people who are in fear of their country. In fact, the advice given to Dukes "Run, man, will kill you!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < His friends, congratulations, and devotion to their homage, for example, ordered the prosecutor's office to defend and defend their charges. Duke's possessions take away the parade and, as a result, he has to fill vacancies of the police created by the latest killings. Immediately, Cracker Police proves to be more corrupt than the predecessors of the mayor (referring to the mayor, "they are ten times worse than before!"). Now the duke finds again that the Bucktown residents must rescue corruption, protective racket law enforcement officials and make them safe again to act on a decent prostitution business people on the streets. Unfortunately, Duke lost his moral and sympathies as a result of a hero, because he was ready to participate in the murder of the original police. I would not have saved it in one way or another, that he had saved Bucktown or that moment. I think we should have a fun way to give us the new Police Goons, but the truth is that the movie has become a violent opera, the Duke kills all his friends and friends with cold blood. When the crackdown fell, he did not feel compassionate. The pig is duke <br /> <br /> In the end, all the town's Duke, Aretha, but local prostitutes are dead and they had "wonderful heroes and heroes on their way off the road as marvelous qualities or worthy sellers, they do not ... The Duke is just a killer threat and Areth makes mischievous accomplices. If you're interested in movie genre, I highly recommend them, see Coffy, Foxy Brown, Truck Turner, Blacula, Sheba Baby? But if you need to run through this DVD during the process, throw away as far away as you can It should be treated like it would treat it like a hot flashy nuclear waste! There is not a single movie during Blacksploitation, that is, it's not very funny, nice, and wonderful and wonderful characters, that is, the second of its secondary school It is a quote for a few years of secondary school education.
