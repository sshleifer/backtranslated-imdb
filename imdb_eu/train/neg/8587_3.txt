This kind of storyteller is unacceptable. This movie is just one reason why five stars in 5 online stars are just behind George Lucas and he has the title "Star" and "Wars". This is an insult to film-makers, and many others have made excellent writing and acting movies, but they have not got it. This is an outfit. <br /> <br /> First thing first. Story The evolution of analogues? There is not. A little makeup around the eyes and a little shout, not a bit. Anakin Skywalker, a stupid young man, is paying attention to Darth Vader's only blow. With Darth Vader the only thing that was consistent with the original series was his intelligence, how good he did almost everything, planning, fighting, naming it. The only thing that he perceives in Anakin's pre-trilogy is his stupid one. Although losing his body loses due to stupidity. <br /> <br /> Which partition the Emperor Palpatine told the legend of Sith does not have an emperor to be a Sith? Unacceptable! <br /> <br /> Wrestling scenes have used excessive digital numbers. All people fly around the place in a tuxedo doll house. Count Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, almost all fighters had a double digital leap. <br /> <br /> Fighting in a specific scene, in the climate fight Obi-Wan and Anakin, both really stopped pairs and riposts, their sabers rounded off several inches apart. I know that they struggle to choreographed, but this can affect the credibility and the misfortunes. <br /> <br /> The writing was awful. All conversations had a very low quality. The actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did their best with their lines, but that was not enough. I can not say enough good things about this movie. There are too many special effects, there are bigger holes than in the middle of the universe, and there is no idea whatsoever. This is the biggest mistake of this movie: nothing new is offered. We know everything we know, Lucas has painted. <br /> <br /> He knew that Anaka had lost her body. We knew Luke and his brother and Leia, we know that Luke is the son of Anakin, we met Obi-Wan and Yoda in exile, we all knew. There's nothing new in this movie. If all fans want it, it's OK, Lucas could not go wrong. <br /> <br /> But finally, when Anakin becomes Darth Vader, he asks Padme and hears that he is dead. shaking his arms and shouting "Nooooooooooooooooooooo". This scene was screamed by the B-movie, and Darth Vader hoped "DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER" at any moment. That's it. A B-movie, based on a huge quote and an ultra-leap-based fanatic base, when the first two films carry standards to the Earth's holes, will fix anything.
