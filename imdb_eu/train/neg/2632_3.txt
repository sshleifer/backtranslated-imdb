In my opinion, it's my favorite favorite, say locations and genres, Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, D.C. and a political thriller, but "The Sentinel" is low. As they had had a good past, they signed the play and had great city plans and the rest of the holidays took place to improvisation of the rest. And I would blame Basinger for a frightening reality (I think it's the worst actress in Hollywood, but for more than a decade I'm still fluent, it was the only one and undoubtedly a bad actor in the film to win an Oscar for "LA Confidential" . But he was not the only problem. Sutherland, as I love Jack Bauer, is "Jack" once again in the magazine '24 '. I've lost time to 'A Time to Kill' or 'A Few Good Men' days. Douglass certainly decided the actor and he called this one. Plot: Someone, a treacherous Secret Service, wants to kill the president and Douglask (randomly). Has anyone ever believed? Actually, there's no spoiler here until it's just as fast as half-way to the board, it's over before it's over. And why did they want to kill someone (s)? Will this sequel be revealed? Too many holes in the ground, too many open doors and never close and predictable is the 'Sentinel'. If you only watch a movie in the year, you might not know who the mole is, but you know the kind of film, or you just know what you saw in a first episode of "Law and Order". Was it wonderful? Really, cinematography was good, and although Sutherland played Jack again, he still got it.
