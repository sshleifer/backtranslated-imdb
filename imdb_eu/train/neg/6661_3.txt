I started seeing this show in 2003 or in 2004 with my friends. Of course, at that time I was younger and enjoyed some of this show's jokes. In 2003 I was 11 years old and now I am 14 years old (2007). My age probably works as I judge this conception, after reading the comments of others, I saw that after the third season the show went down. Okay By condemning this show, it is repetitive and usually focuses on the same plot. <br /> <br /> Timmy Turner is a show, it was given to two lovely goddesses, especially because of his horrible life. There was a sharp baby. The plot of the whole show is that this boy (Timmy) and parents can always disintegrate an unwanted desire, because they want to say something else, "Da Rules". The show has many lines that continue to repeat, such as "magic can not be real love, bathroom" or simply decided that Nickelodeon thought it fun and decided to put it in several sections. <br /> The exhibition is geared towards young people under the age of 10, because it does not have a lot of attention or humor. Character voice voice selection can be even better. Timmy is a loud, noisy, feminine voice like Cosmo. Wanda is like an old lady. Timmy's dad is like the organizer of some theater or game show, Timmy's mother's voice is overwhelming to be feminine. The attitudes of this show are: in some episodes, Timmy retreats and wakes up badly. Wanda is seemingly smart and wise. Cosmo is stupid, dumb and impossible as Timmy's father. Timmy's mother seems to be doing what Timmy's father is. <br /> <br /> The show is too far from reality to get my tastes already. Maybe the youngest, I can see humor in this show, but it grows older as it grows. And it's not a given or "trashing" sound, but the show has the character that you want to engage in a homicidal character. Such a show should be your attitude, know what you mean. If not, it basically dislikes you.
