As always Dracula's other films make, Dracula's letters are always on the side of Dracula, that is, it threatened me at the end. In any case, I would like to see a vampire or not, I would like to see something he wants, in the first film, in the first film that generosity is against his master. It is of great interest (as the story tells you) to win the priest or the game of D. (we need some amazing land).
