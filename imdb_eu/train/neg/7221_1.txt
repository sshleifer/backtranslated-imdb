... DO YOU CHECK! The filmmaker swallowed and "Why?" Say the type of movie you want. Awesome cameras ... count the camera that prevents a person from being prevented and unable to do so. The conversation is ridiculous. The play is comical. They seem to have taken a ghostly western town to see if they can make a movie that is as short as possible. I would bet that they used $ 10 of home video cameras. Or that, or most cameramen drank. Actually, the trailers are more fun than the movie. If you want to organize the "Movie Movie Party", bring this. Do you want more entertainment ... look at the wall?
