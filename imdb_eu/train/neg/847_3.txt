The film is about two identical brothers, but they are not expected to be smearing - it is a surgeon and others can write a computer code. As they call their own self, it seems to be very pleasing to them, compared to personal characteristics from the title material. <br /> <br /> Honestly, it did not hit the movie style. I think that anxiety, confusion and deep blues create a goal, but I do not know why it's so much. The movie tells a cheap scene and story, which basically has no human side. Comic book as an experience. The viewer is terribly confused, but, in some way, blues is included in short dialogues, monotonous scenes, dynamic cuts, music and noises. <br /> <br /> The movie line is very easy, it's all about it. For a long time, there has been a great picture, especially with the confusing delirium that simulates drug use and dynamic effects. <br /> <br /> I will say openly that this movie I do not meet a bit of my removal.
