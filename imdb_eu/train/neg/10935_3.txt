I have never been a fan of Mormon movies. Because of being a Mormon, I always felt humor because of the exclusivity of the LDS community and it seemed like a series of obsessive Wackos. This is a breath of fresh air, which is, finally, I could not argue with my Mormon friends who are not breathing. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I found out that B-list talent had Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson and Fred Willard (one of my favorites), which is at least a bit fun. Also, this church basketball is a great opportunity to be ridiculous and hilarious. But I must say that no one in the whole movie knew what they were doing. Every joke was blurred, and all the possibilities for a fun gag were discarded. The interview was bland, and the movie I've ever seen is the worst character development. Wilson's character was less than a single dimension. It's hard to believe that the movie that confirmed the post after writing was still a headless rumor and I saw the trains. I can not feel the rage I felt through these words. My friends and I were the scene of the last game, and we went to the premiere of Washington City, UT. Kurt Hale, the director, was there, and I must say, I avoided all the contacts with him after the show. He waited for the door, apparently ready. I can not even tell myself that his film has not only ruined the good hour and a half of my life, but I will never forget to leave a dirty and painful dirty. <br /> <br /> Here are some specific problems: the little story of the lovers was with the conservative and pianist, but these two characters left nowhere and they were impossible, so friends and I asked why we were continuing. It was supposed to take care of two of these bad and most interesting characters. There were many subplates of the time, each one of them laughing, but each one smoked and went to look after them. How pretty was this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was a great fall, and I feel bad for all those who hope to have fun in the real mormon movie. It's true, jokes are not very exclusive to Mormon. Once again, it's hard to say what the joke was and he felt in my ears. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie. Note the fantasy of this hilarious movie. Resign yourself to disappointment
