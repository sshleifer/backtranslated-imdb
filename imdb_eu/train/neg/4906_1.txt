Well, I do not know where to start. Of course, it's a television work, so my expectations were small. I was very enjoyable in the general direction of the second hour, but they were painted according to the number of films that seemed before or after. <br /> <br /> And talk about seeing bad chemistry among the detective fairies. .. <br /> <br /> I would go deeper, but this film is not worth it. Rating: D + (IMDB rating 3/10)
