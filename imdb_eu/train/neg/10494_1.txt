Steve Irwin's show is awesome. It's not fun trying to be and it's just that, but I would also like to call a movie that was not a movie. I mean the guy in the car is trying to kill him: "Oh, this is the evil one" block! 'and straight facing the camera. He put too much on his face with the camera! And then when the guy falls on the car, would not you expect a dead waiter? And Terri had never seen the worst game! When Crocodile almost eats Steve, he says, 'Steve'. He was not afraid or heard anything, he was just 'Steve'. I mean, I hate hate, but that's not worth it. I love Steve Irwin but his movie was stupid too.
