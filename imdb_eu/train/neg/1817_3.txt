From the beginning, you know that a Sam Samman movie is more than a film by Al Adamson, because credits from "A Sam Sherman Production" appear in large print credits. Writing the script by Mr. Sherman, he was the writer, Bob Livingstone, to use a clean, Western-style, Western-style star of Hollywood, to be a male leader in Sherman's imagination. Last successes of "Swinging Stewards". <br /> <br /> Now, why did you want an old man to suppress an old man? Without explanation, Sam Sherman is for you. Hollywood's old-fashioned artist painted many of his films for the Independent International Pictures, and with Al Adamson they often strove to make their feature films (for example, J. Carrol Naish, Russ Tamblyn, Lon Chaney Jr., etc.). . But Bob Livingstone? Tell me what demographic is the second demographic of the 40th grader. It's ridiculous! <br /> <br /> But again "Naughty Stewardesses" has been a success for them, so we can not write it as a Sherman fiasco. However, all the standard aesthetics are inadequate. Al Adamson wanted this image, and it's easy to see why. First, he has no focus on the genre, and moves the super nucleus (tits and ass / simulated sex) with a kidnapping thriller (with Steckler's "Rat Pfink and Boo Boo!"). Including Sparrow's music, or Richard Smedley and Connie Hoffmann in a San Francisco photo session, a heavy and boring sequence of stewardee-assisted neighboring Las Vegas. Worst of all, Bob Livingstone will get Jack LaLanne in a blue toy, sexy ... gag! (Fortunately, her great sex scene Connie Hoffmann has been deleted, but you can shake her toys on the DVD in the Special Features section. Creepy.) <br /> <br /> This is a horrible and horrible movie. But I'll give it to three stars with Gary Graver's photography and Connie Hoffmann's sympathy with Livingstone's "Wrinkles". "Naughty Stewardesses" is targeted at Adamson's accessories and / or exploitation film, because Sam Sherman's comments provide in-depth information. All other, be careful.
