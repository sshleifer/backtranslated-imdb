Where did you start This movie started just like "Darkness Falls". A shining and outdated woman who lives in the woods offering teeth for children with gifts. Do you know? Then it varies. In "Darkness Falls," you've only been killed by tooth fairy, when you saw it. The fairy-tale fairy in this movie does not matter what it is. Why did the rocker, the hippie girlfriend or Bubbas and his sister need? I think the movie would be fine without them. Apparently, producers have been sitting around and decided to put more people into the film so that dental faeces can kill people. Even though it is very nice to get a beautiful blonde girl who does not see the portrait as a bubble head. Well rented, but I would not suggest buying it.
