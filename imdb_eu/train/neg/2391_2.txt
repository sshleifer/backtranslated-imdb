I love movies. I love independent production and studio productions. I love movies and I do not know the best. I love drama, comedy, action-adventures, science fiction, mysteries, mountains, and fear of any genre. I love foreign movies in English. I love good movies and I love them too, it's hardly ever to entertain some movies to entertain or have fun. Except Cowgirls Even Blues, when I participated in the show version of "Cowgirls", I joined a 10-person audience. Soon, I could not even bear the disturbing mixture that is taking place before my eyes, and I also left. Nowadays, "Cowgirls" is still the only movie that has fled out. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to describe this incoherent film, trivial, trashy, nonsense, or how to properly transmit the exchange value. It is enough to say that it is one of the greatest films of all time, absurd and impossible at all levels. It tries to be clear, but the concept of feminism seems uninterrupted. It tries to be fun, but its humor is bold and disgusting. This is one of the few films that profane his Etos, as depicted by the protagonists, as opposed to rebellion against them and their values. If you want to watch the movie, watch "Waterworld", "Ishtar", nothing more. Except for "Alexander". If you choose between it and yourself, read a book.
