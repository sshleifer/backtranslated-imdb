Remarque's novel A cast that looks great on paper. A left-wing refugee, struggling to stay in Paris. Official Gestapo with hidden information. <br /> <br /> There is no synergy here. Pieces and parts are never picked up. In France, stories about left-wing refugees should not be boring. Read Arthur Koestler's "Scum of the Earth" book (you can find it). Or his "Dialogue Between Death Interview" (firm). <br /> <br /> For me, the only interests in this movie are in some unexpected details. <br /> <br /> They spend a lot of fun. Drinks calm weather, Norman apple brandy. I ask myself to ask myself. Without a doubt, this film goes through faster. The film only sells in low class saloons. Live the tobacco parisian! That's what I say. Here are references to liquid poisoning; It seems that the scenarios are concerned. <br /> <br /> I enjoy movies in France, it's fun to be waiting for the avoidance of alcohol on the wall that will appear on the back. I was not disappointed. This time it was a rare opportunity for Byrrea. This film would give it 10 points only if it were to refine its booze mural. <br /> <br /> The strange score of the movie is by Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is best known - if possible, call "The Emperor Jones" opera based on O'Neill. Together with Paul Robeson in the movie version. Opera will last today in a recording of Lawrence Tibbett. He ought to go back anyway; The revival operations are potentially sold out. <br /> <br /> Opera seems to point out that Charles Boyer's character works under his alias "Czech". Two of them are "Wozzeck" and "Gunther", two important German operas. Is that just that? <br /> <br /> It seems that only the name falls into this movie. Note that they are called "Himmelstoss". It is one of the first major figures of Himmelstoss Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front". <br /> <br /> Well, they're joking; There was no time to develop any drama.
