All women in the world without naked women could not stop me by pushing the button down the road to a third. With a dreadful performance, the same CGI FX poor mumble as the same script; This film is a murder of the male genre. They are serious, that is, it would be fun if this movie could have a bad joke. <br /> <br /> This is the people behind the camera. Of course, they are competent, but they are too lazy, even if they make a decent quarter of something. Avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic men's films. <br /> <br /> From 0 to 10!
