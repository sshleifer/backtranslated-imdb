If the Indian Film Industry (Yash Raj) is a 2008 product of one of the largest production companies, then it is feared that it is a long time to get the right criteria. <br /> <br /> If you can, you can go wrong with Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena's amazing star star, and the film is still much more difficult for all the people involved in this film. The film is missing in almost all departments except cinematography and Akshay Kumar. It has good rendering conversations, but this can not be enjoyed in the movies with great expectations. <br /> <br /> The first scene of a car that ran from the mountains to the mountains is very cheap. a cartoon movie. He was a clear indicator of the vision of the director. Otherwise, each of the actors that actively plays a movie is wasted. When Anil Kapoor tried to make good English, it mostly blurs. And Saif surely thinks about signing this movie. <br /> <br /> In summary, "JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM" IS IMPORTANT FOR OFFER. I would like to say that "Aaja Nachle" was more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> You can not understand how and why this type of script was written and approved. Akshay's greatest sequel to the love story. After the wrong script, the weakest part of the movie is music. Vishal Shekhar has given some tunes for each song. The songs begin well and suddenly the melodies go down dramatically. "Falak Tak Chal" is a unique song that is somehow good for everybody. Vishal Shekhar has an unnecessary choice. <br /> <br /> As regards the product's follow-up ment, Akshay and Saif are on the hills of a foreign country (probably Ladakh). The next scene, when they were looking for Kareena Haridwa, then walk through the mountains of Kareena in their car. I still think I'm writing. <br /> <br /> If you pass through the final seat, it is too long for stupid and unnecessary errors. You can watch all the wounds that are wounded by the heroes, just like God. Do we see a 2008 movie with all the technical heights still achieved? So, you do not have a paternal and downward word about this word, but the honest experience of old agents is their hobby. <br /> <br /> Dads Anil Kapoor and Akshay Kumar: If possible, ask for the previous movie preview. it's out As artists of that age, you have some responsibility for your fans and viewers. People are still applauded when you enter the screen for the first time, respectively. I think that this type of movie is not seen on the day, because it prevents the reputation of all those related to the movie, actress and production house.
