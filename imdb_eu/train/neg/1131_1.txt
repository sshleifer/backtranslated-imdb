A shame, a talented director, Desplechin, has not been able to showcase a talented Phoenix talented actress, Esther Kahn has no substance to convey a very specific and clear plot. In an effort to achieve a concentric circle that is difficult for an actor, performance and presentation are highly invented and poorly executed to draw the audience's compassion. For a long time in execution, Esther's redundancy is very melodramatic to be effective and reduces the story in a weak frame of inappropriate storytelling. Because content is non-consistent and free, Phoenix is ​​struggling to develop Desplechin's instruction, as Esther thinks he's doing the same thing. Without feeling a compelling victory against the pain of Esther, we have never felt victories in the talent of Phoenician.
