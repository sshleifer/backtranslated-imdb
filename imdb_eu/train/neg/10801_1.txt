Now I'm watching movies that have gotten a bad review and "Hmm ... this is not so bad!" I loved The Cable Guy, and I thought that My Big Fat Independent Movie was excellent. Remember, I did not see all this with great expectations, but I thought maybe ... just ... it would be bad to somehow laugh. I was wrong. By means of this "movie" (and I'm not using it for a long time), I'm not in any way suffering that was clearly and not very entertained. To start, Shaq looks like Marlon Brando's Quentin Tarantino. I hate rap music, but as I can say, Amish a priest would have a better driver than himself. The main character is annoying and not a favorite character. To be honest, I would prefer to eat it with the fluff rather than eat a fatty blood from the bloody fetus to see it again.
