I usually protect myself from independent art and I try to be very comprehensive and tolerant ... I help everyone, because it deserves effort ... <br /> <br /> but this movie is far removed from understanding and tolerance. boundaries! <br /> <br /> imagine the following situation: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 1. Think of the horror movie you've ever seen in your life. <br /> <br /> Think of an attractive and attractive ART for the DVD's DVD box ... and a promising plot ... <br /> <br /> 3. voil√†! You got ZOMBIE NATION <br /> <br /> See if you only need to do it. THE PERIOD IS better.
