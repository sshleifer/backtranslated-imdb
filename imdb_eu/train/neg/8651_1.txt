I have seen the first 15 minutes, thinking that it was a real documentary (a cameraman "dramatic producer"). When looking at this garbage? "So I turned it off and I went on to warn others about the fact that the characters did not act incredibly, the excessive emotion that the boy travels around the world as he traveled halfway in a war country, played a child, and I do not think" his character was so the incident is for the bombing of shopping centers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Have you seen "lost city children"? a guy who robs you and raises his dreams ... I like it!
