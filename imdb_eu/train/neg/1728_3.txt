**** Do not read this review if you want to be surprisingly surprising the "The Crater Lake Monster". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < to ruin a group of local tits to quickly point the button forward. "The Crater Lake Monster" is called amateurs. If you are not in a low-budget short film, you probably do not want to look first here. <br /> <br /> The problem of the movie occurs when there is no monster action. It's really awful and it's nowhere. The script is very much Ed Wood-ish, which has been made as the main sequence of actions. Nothing is too much "The Crater Lake Monster". He explains the dinosaurs by crashing a meteorized crater on the Lake Street and "heats" the water, which apparently forms a dinosaur egg that rests on the centennial at the bottom of the lake. Even if the egg is lying so long and it can be acceptable and sustainable, it would not be water to cause "hot" water for that high temperature? If we do not see the scene fog sometimes in one scene or both, we do not see hot water, we only have a few lines in the script. <br /> <br /> The script is full of a few sequences and it will do anything to make the lake characters threaten to swell. While the pair that experiences self-troubles and the automobiles are serving, they decide to rent a boat and go to Crater Lake. Hmmm ... Do you think these strangers may be there to meet our title monster? Even in a strange sequence, a drunkard steals the drunk and pays four bucks for a bottle of booze instead of teller-teller and murderer. A car chase arises and should not know ... they end up next to the lake. Crateyra Snack! Yes, it's not hard to understand, and you're not writing until now when the printout lasts another ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Everything is annoyingly lovable, and I really want to like "The Crater Lake Monster". I can not do it There is not enough to continue here, and this is more than just a movie to be played during a party, you can talk about it and it should not matter. <br /> <br /> It has a short list of things that the film itself produces, and it is the same as the dinosaur that appears in the three most important: a puppet shadow, surrounded by a large patterned wood. , and a perfectly tidy insert. There are a couple of fairy hicks in it, and they make the humor of the movie intentionally. At the bottom end, one of the two monster and one of our lovers kill us, so all good things about this film end up dead. Why was this effect damaged? Songs that have been singing over more than one song have been republishing? Or did I weep inside, watch movies like this?
