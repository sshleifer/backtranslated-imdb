"Private practice" "Gray's Anatomy" is quite successful and well-written. It's a wonderful throw. The premise may also work. But it's just awful writing. <br /> <br /> The front-rider hiding in Gray's Anatomy section should be my first warning. The plot was pure. I thought maybe it was possible. So I set the DVR to record the pilot and any other episodes. <br /> <br /> When I was watching the pilot, I wondered how such a beautiful actress could throw a show a boring rider. The rider assumes that he will suck and retake people. Emotion, flash, excellent writing, an interesting story must be with a cliffhanger that will respond to the rest of the season. In a strange way, this show did not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Thinking it was a fluke, I saw the second chapter best. And although it's a bit better, it's not hard to miss the TV. <br /> <br /> I just saw this show removed from my show list. It is not worth the effort of the IMO, and I would be very surprised that this conception also took place in the middle of the season. Pass the following
