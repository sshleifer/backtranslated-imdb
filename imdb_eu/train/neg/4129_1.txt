After about half of that, I came up and prepared to get up, but finally I got there. It is a movie that is not a romantic comedy. The performance is bad - in the 80s, the film is much worse than in the T & A film. <br /> <br /> There are several attempts to make mood failures and 100% attempts are planned. Perhaps if you are a teenager, it will be a movie appeals, but you will find out how to find out more about the first 10 minutes after those who watched the movie. The rest of the time will run out of agony when the credits end up waiting. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the time.
