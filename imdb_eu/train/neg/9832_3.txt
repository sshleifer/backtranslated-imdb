I received Time Changer, because the low budget trip was a nice movie and I gave it something like that. The description said that something was biblical and on time trips, but I did not expect a fundamentalist Christian film! <br /> <br /> The special effect of the film was a worthwhile and interesting place, and it was a lot more interesting than the premise that could have been there. Our heroine, a biblical instructor of the 1890s, is in the mid-2000s and modern life is affecting evil. Jesus is not found anywhere. This wonderful technological feature built the functional HG-Wells functional operating system with the help of a biblical assistant professor somehow. The movie begins to lose credibility at this time, it is unfortunate because this film is very early. Earlier (or maybe later, it can not be remembered), our teacher's heroine was taught to teach a class of science, where he considered scientific discovery as valid. It is obvious to everyone that this is not a scientific methodology, but filmmakers seem to be useful if they accept claims and that they prefer a less-than-useful point of view. <br /> <br /> In any case, this belief is very valid and sensitive in the context of the character at the time. Therefore, if we consider the truth of life of these Bible teachers, then the teacher who invented and invented the time did not believe in it, because there is no evidence (and it is not offered). travels time in physics. So immediately, mystical messages and credibility are a problem, but it does not matter ... <br /> <br /> After convinced that the teacher is leaping to the future, the excitement of modern technology has been handled in most cases. It's been fun to not even tighten it to a specific year (the character reads the date of a newspaper, a car makes a branch and it does not end the date: it's just two miles ... * honk *). Even though some blows would go a long way. For example, when he arrived, he was one of the cars he found, and he invited him two days later to the church's night church and took a walk in the vans. He leaned his head out of the window like a dog, which frightens the lights and the engine of the starter. That seemed to be that since he was there that day. The city appeared to be quite busy. traffic In any case, it's not easy. The excitement of the rest of the technology was good, especially because it delayed the first meeting with the television, although he did not know what he was until he saw a child until he saw a remote one. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, everybody knows that everybody who starts to face our hero and who knows him as an older man begins to preach. Eventually, he achieved a bit of focus on church visits, where he explained the concept of Christianity in a long monologue, supposedly moving and spectacular, but above all the same. In the church, husbands and sisters start talking about this sense (go figure) and investigate their name. In the end, they can conclude that it is a time traveler or a determined teacher of the Bible who has died and who is to be found. Pelikulek draws men who are not believers to be skeptical. <br /> <br /> Before the teacher returns to his time, he stands before both men. The effort to avoid being arrested or transported will eventually become almost insane as Jesus will soon come, and he will be a prophet to hear him. In one moment, he has been evicted and a husband asks if he may have heard so much. <br /> <br /> Irony is basically becoming the teacher's self-proclaiming (that is, it means). and probably false) that knowing that Prophet's rapture was and knowing that God was sent out was true, when his fellow Bible teachers sent him, and did not have knowledge of God (he even pointed it out or even tended it). <br /> <br /> As I understand, the Revelation ends only when God knows that, and at the end of the film, the inventor sees the teacher (and fails) to send a bible to the future. . First 2080, then 2070, etc. Scene disappears. Clearly, he was trying to determine the exact date of the last minute - which should not be known! In essence, the whole premise of the film is abandoned, because its religious beliefs and what God considers so much is so much the same. This means that it could never be a machine, first of all, as humanity can. Find out something that God only needs to know! The whole premise of the movie is diminishing and the whole thing is worth it, if it ultimately undermines your credibility.
