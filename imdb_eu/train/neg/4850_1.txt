Some realistic video spoilers included. <br /> <br /> From the experience of real life, the film continued incessantly empty. Today, I'm on the second trip to Iraq as a man of infantry. This movie does not happen what happened in reality. To name a few: the bomb chariot, the EOD's non-solitary escorts, the EOD's sergeant on the VBC, the sleeves were thrown out of the ACU all the time, where I called it where I call. 2 copies of a haji copy, a sniper scene. The list would continue, however, it is not necessary to list things that are wrong in less than 2 minutes before making things worse. and the point was made. <br /> <br /> This movie is a vision of people and critics who do not understand experiences or military experience. <br /> <br /> Military people with background or knowledge will be disappointed with accuracy.
