Sorry, I did not like this doc. I think it could be a million better ways. People who know what they did are not very imaginative. Conversations are not very interesting and there is no real view. The footage is not too informatively assembled. It is a very bad movie, that is, it really deserves special features. What I have said is that Isabella Rosselini gets the most beautiful when she gets older. They are all considered, this only gets '4'.
