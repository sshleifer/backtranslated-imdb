This was a desperate movie for me. I came across a little "Classic Film Noir", which was a gift that I've been enjoying the movies that I've made through that style (black style is not a genre). I do not think it's a black movie. It seems that there is a tendency to market and market black and white films of the current B type from 1947 to 1955 and the label does not always fit. Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb) is a persecuted character, and most of the action of the film is at home. They are just a few black items that you can see. There is no deep paranoia, or real reason why Ed Cullen should be sympathetic. Jane Wyatt wore clothes and persuaded her as a femme fatale. I do not want this film to see disaster. However, I would like to hear from other blacksmiths about what they hear about it.
