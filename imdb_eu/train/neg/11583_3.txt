This film introduces many characters and their relationships in the first half. Nobody generates any interest or positive response. I began to wait until I was intrigued, I planned to improve things and lasted until the end, but there was no reward for that. <br /> <br /> If you want a synthesis, look elsewhere. The action is worthless for me. It's not a bad story, I guess I can say I have some scripting problems ... i.e. I thought it was a murmur. The look of credits shows that the cast here is pretty strong, it's useless. The oldest pros in this job do a good job; I did not see much of the actors, especially Deborah Kara Unger. That's all good to say about this picture.
