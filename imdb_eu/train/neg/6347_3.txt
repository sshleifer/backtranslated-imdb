It is possible that I will always see Woody Alleb as a movie, never knowing how to make a real return to his grandiose past. It may be worth the moment or the only excellent line. Unfortunately, however, this film does not score in any way. Actually, I'm sad and even a little guilty. I am sure that my reaction is similar to many other Woody fans, but what can we say? Perhaps, his time would focus on Clarinett, which I think is pretty good. To say all that, I'm going to go to any movie that could come up with Woody in the future. There is always hope and I love and respect WOODY !!
