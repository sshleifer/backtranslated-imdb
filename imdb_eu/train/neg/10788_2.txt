And I mean it's clear to understand. This film has four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond it. <br /> <br /> There's really no need to say too much about it, even if it's too good. bit, most of it is not very funny. It does not work anymore. What is a romantic comedy? Not in your life. Most of the conversations are very flat to be sophisticated, much more fun. <br /> <br /> It is really a joke that the premise is wrong. This movie could be much more, especially with the latest view on fake movies, with fake quotes. The film discovers that there is no mining area in the press: almost always writers who write beautiful writers. But instead of studying the mother of jokes, it will take about three minutes to this territory and continues to find love for the film. <br /> <br /> The same thing with Catherine Zeta-Jones' character - a horrible, centered movie. Zeta Jones is doing a good job with the one provided, but she's almost nothing. The homogeneous rubbish resembles some rubbish compared to the things we've been talking about over the years. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's hard to understand what Zeta Jones is, Julia Roberts. John Cusack and Billy Crystal will ship the boat off to restart The Love Boat. In fact, in ancient jokes, they should forget the script and shoot the deal. It's likely to make a better story. So go ahead and tell us, filmmakers, what do you have to appear in these stars?
