After initial credits, about one minute there is a black screen. One minute later, the little girl wakes up and takes a shower. Then, two college friends drive to a rock concert, after filling a lot of fills, they will knock something out and get out of the road. The old wheelchairs and their children wake up in the cabin. The murder is incredible because of a bad video. Fully stupid and pre-rounded. No one involved in the confusion would ever warn you. So sometimes there are still happy endings. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sara Ansley has a topless and Laurel Munson has a full front. <br /> <br /> My grade: D
