This is a strange hacked movie, the bond company has to get this feeling that you should enter, I am not surprised that there is no credit, who would link it with this movie. The play of all the people involved likes and motivates them, everything is very rational. As I said, it seems like the bond company had to enter, the footage footage seemed to be a lot, and all the music was a very badly-used music library (I think it's cheap). Very strange Maybe I could buy a DVD, what happened and what happened to me if it happened to me.
