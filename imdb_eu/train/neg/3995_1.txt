The '1408' scare tactic is cheaper. The kind of horror fans of the horror movie can occasionally jump in their seat and ear, but they will not let the public look for a little depth and direction. <br /> <br /> John Cusak plays a long-distance writer. Write books describing experiences of living in a horrible hotel rumor. Even though sponsors and owners have permissions, ghosts walk in the rooms, they do not become the true-believers of the paranormal. When he learned about the history of 1408 in the Overlook Hotel, I would like to say, the Dolphin Hotel in New York, that it will be the perfect chapter to be closed in his latest book. But Samuel L. Jackson, who plays with the hotel's owner, tries to consolidate the narrative of many years since the opening of the hotel to the room. The story is simple and skeptical we are able to sit through Jackson's long-term ads. <br /> <br /> In other words: fear! Be very scared! <br /> <br /> Of course, it's easy to pay a thriller-a-seat-thriller to see a thriller who has just paid a price, unless it's been time consuming. And also, as the "boos" was much more than cheap, it would be so frequent and arbitrary that they would eventually be expected. The temperature of the room changes automatically. The walls are poured into blood. A scary writer can not open the door, etc. And after spending almost an hour and a half on the listener, you can sit down and at least hope to end it. Although there are suspicions of dream sequences and other horizons of time derived from the dream, if we do not overcome any doubts before finishing the movie, we may have something completely unforgettable in the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although Cusak's exquisite performances (the whole movie) is basically the whole movie, most of those who want to make a warning are wasting (that is, Samuel L. Jackson) in small papers. It's a real mystery as this movie has received from the audience. Ghosts of ballots?
