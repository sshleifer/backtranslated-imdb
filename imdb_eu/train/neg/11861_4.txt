You just saw the previous screening tonight. What can I say? Although he directed the medieval trailer, he did not say anything. Before doing any movie he did nothing, and he acted as a reflection, at last I laughed at how I was laughing at the audience and I played a humorous movie. away <br /> <br /> So let's see ... it's more spectacular than before the main character that wants to go back to the old girlfriend, but it's not good enough, look. All three people have "their personality". She is the best friend to get the best friend of the girl's friend, but she is constantly excluded. On 24/7 everything is positive and it is thrown into single lines (in this case it's just a series of movie references from Disney) and the third name will never remember you, but to finish it. Square and consoling messages throw anyone who wants to hear ... look. The girl-boy and his former parent *************************************** ********************************************* ********************************************* ********************************************* ********************************************* **************** n Hours less than one hour into the movie, check it out. The film's "funny" moments are constantly sworn, people who fall or attack, the scene of the trailer and homosexual origin ... check. And I venture to call a spoiler, but we create an ending, as we thought would happen before the movie ... check. <br /> <br /> This could have ... no, wait ... PG-13 should be a movie. All they needed to drop were F-bombs. Frankly, it would get much more advertising in front of people who enjoy the mood, because they would get less exposure to the media, so I do not like people who like me to try to keep up the final level. Comedies like R-Superbad and Knocked Up. The humor of this movie is so confusing that it does not match what the people are looking for. The actors often linked them with a camera with many interviews and fixes. Let's get this way ... because in the theater it will help you laugh because it's on the big screen and the others laugh. When showtime is filmed and one day at 2:00 p.m., you can change the channel. Alice Eve's hotness (10 years ago is not good enough) is a must see. <br /> <br /> Aside from the main resolution, this film casts a lot of subtleties on the side of the hanging side and forgets to write more stories that tried to develop at the beginning of the movie. So there is the main resolution, but what comes? It's never too clear, and it does not stop at the end with "sensitive" violence. <br /> <br /> This movie was not the only thing worth the film, and that was a good soundtrack. Apart from the delightful selection of alternative rock bands from the 90s, this movie reminds me that something that David Holmes would recompose would remind me of the beautiful aspects of the movie. I will give sections for great sound options. In the end, this movie was probably thrown out last summer, because Pepsi was an outspoken but proud sponsor whose bottle cap was yellow. Rock Band in this promotion. I just had to catch a lot of Rock Band gamer if you saw him. But I kept my money. It was this PG-13, and at 15, on a Friday night, with a group of friends, I would like to say no. Otherwise, definitely pass. He has not competed with R films of recent years and, of course, was not so good.
