NOTE. This movie is wrong. It's a disaster. Do not waste this time. Please let me know! <br /> <br /> Acting, story, conversation, music ... basically everything is so very annoying and ridiculous. I want to create it (if the conversation / performance / story is not being done, everybody's shot it out). You are watching a comedy. The problem is that supposedly funny parts are not fun. Plays, stories, cinematography, WAAAAY has everything you need but never has it. Almost every shot changes, but what! This movie feels like a student's movie. No wonder they shot in HD, because the disaster would have to spend more money on the film shoot. <br /> <br /> If you can easily play or play, write, edit, correct, full clicks, what's in your face, and have I mentioned poor conduct? (Well, actually, it's not the guilty actor, he's the director) and then you'd like this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to see a lesson. I would be able to turn it on as soon as possible. If you still can not tell, I've watched the movie. I wanted to get out and I wanted to get back ... I did not pay at least for this litter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum, you know ... The Jurassic Park type / Independence Day is in this movie, but surely it fell when it hit the role of a movie like disaster.
