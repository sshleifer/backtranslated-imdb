When I saw that, I noticed the location of the ads. DHL, Aquawhite Strips, Rockstar and more. On the other hand, it is the sole location of a product. It seems that the film has been funded. Jessica Simpson's "acting" is not horny. No Dick should ever work because he plays the same characters. "The story" is just the backdrop to this long commercial. I can not believe this movie has been thought of as a theater play. The more time you watch this movie, the more you will be involved. Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, on the other hand, are Jessica Screenplay as a cousin. I am very annoyed to see everything. I would recommend avoiding this.
