Virtual film, the potential of computers, the past, the constant struggle to express your identity in a limited society, and Ada Byron Lovelace's fascinating Tilda Swinton. But it's evil, if you see the horrible potential! With Tilda Swinton and Karen Black, it's a delightful and cruel behavior. Soil construction is harder to say - the current programmer is a very unnoticed character, but half the movie is set up by his character, and then Ada's appearance is a telling event of his life. It's not a must-have story (Swinton almost comes out). You have never known yourself as a real person, you just have an icon of the paper of the student's history. <br /> <br /> Digital effects, such as digital dogs and birds, are bad and scarce, taking into account 1997 and 1985. And finally, the script is bad. A bad conversation, often pretentious - especially the conflicts between programmer and his boyfriend, cold and distant laughs, and a mere attempt to surprise me. The programmer has successfully contacted a person! Amazing! But he does not seem to be surprised at anyone, and his boyfriend says, "Well, be careful." (Then, it may be dangerous and it never seems dangerous), <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> /> <br/> <br/> <br/> It is clear that nobody involved in the script does not know anything about math or computers; It is a jumble of any reference message on these issues when any disbelief breaks down. <br /> <br /> A scene at the end. The movie is quite good, indicating the monologue of Tilda Swinton by his sadness for the fragility of life, but his joy in that life. Poignant, passionate, and perspective, it seems to fall from another movie. <br /> <br /> So, I'm disappointed in this movie because it's a lost opportunity for a wonderful movie. If you find an interesting topic, you want to rent it, but warn yourself. See a much better analysis of gender roles in the history of Orlando, with a great performance by Tilda Swinton. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler / question: * * <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Ada demands that her memories not be kept (I thought it was the best movie scene). But it seems that the current programmer still does, transferring memories to his girlfriend (thus, the title of the movie). Is it true that the programmer has violated Ada's wishes, even if he does not fight on it? Or is this interpreting another point that is confusing?
