This is because most people think they are so clear that they have a story that comes in time. Remember Watergate and all the political conspiracies captured by the camera during a while later. The films that try to get into the concepts of "so powerful, or so intelligent" for television, most of all, have captured their own navel attitude. <br /> <br /> I was never a fan of conversation in the old days of other conspiracy dates, but Coppola was the truth of her main character and that Hackman was a beautiful actress. I mean that these conspiracy movies, especially in the starry characters of black hero. Without many questions, many communications ... Well, Bergman creates at least one movie about these visuals. <br /> <br /> The next man is an ideal example of his time: an overwhelming conspiracy of idealistic politics and serving soup squeezed his website. There is no interest in itself and in general it does not improve. In fact, it is said how bad it will be from 'watcha that', from the first sequels of murders, without going through any story. The one that is the most directed film on the road is the most profitable accumulation scene under violence.
