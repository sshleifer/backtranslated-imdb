This movie is a unique Pia Zadora! When I looked at it, they reminded me of a Hollywood star star on the classic cartoon; Another role is urgently needed but to be afraid of writing "B" movies or softball roles; in the quiz session, "Well, of course, I do not play roles that need nudity, but if the movie is artistically necessary ...............". This remembrance illustrated the image of a similar cartoon in Pia's quote: "Well, of course, I usually do not take roles that need a role, but if I give myself enough exposure to improve my situation, I am ........... ....... ". This is probably unfair, the sordid story is the fault of Harold Robbins; Taking into account the nature of the story, the exhibition Pia certainly does not pay much attention, and maybe Pia (when she won the prize for the play, she won the Butterfly Prize) necessarily undermines her part, it prevents her from acting almost impossible. A critic points out the actor for a first time when a movie is disappointed, but this is very unfair; Screenwriters and directors are often guilty. The real problem in "The Lonely Lady" is that scripts, like original books, are looking for sensation and not substance, and nothing has helped. <br /> <br /> The screenplay of this movie is very dangerous, but if the story could have been filmed by a better script, direct directing and a direct competing player, it must continue to be a personal trial. As far as released, my viewers value the following: whether I am evaluating my personal opinions or evaluating what the film aims to achieve. My personal assessment would be two out of ten; but to some extent, this film provides exactly what the sponsor has done, and from this point four decades of quality would be reasonable. Being in a charity mood, and as Pia does not want to reject my despair, I will give four points to the IMDb.
