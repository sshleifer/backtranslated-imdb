I can not agree with another reviewer named Jodorowsky. <br /> <br /> Barney seems to be very boring and "inspired" by the content. He produces sweets (and I like candy), but he is just rewarding his pretentious and basic artistic void. <br /> <br /> I am afraid that many people do not distinguish between Jodorowsky's (but only superficial) works of linear directors such as Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love Odyssey 2001 and I never had it.) Created by M.Barney's art It's a boring art, but they take away audiences that appreciate experimental cinema, a typical postmodern post-modern art, and check their interviews, I do not buy, sorry, and so boring. I never felt bored by Alejandro Jodorowsky- Our films, drawings, 9 but we failed again, especially when they offered something to be something really straightforward in a timeless way (home and choreography, great dance and preparations for browsing boats), the boats "gathering" in the sea ... feces as a valid value object (if it were an exercise). "Pearl" diving ... It can build a great surrealist film that can contain everything, but it did not. a ... What is in vain and false and philosophically pretentious but pure? <br /> <br /> I have some pretty curious scenes, but the movie has been very boring and dissatisfied and it has been completely empty and false for me. physically ill. <br /> <br /> And it's not a good pace. I like slow rhythms, but this is boring because some scenes - it was unforgivable and false - had to be seen for a long time. The scenes of artistic vanity ... <br /> <br /> The kind of films I think is just to kill art and spirits. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
