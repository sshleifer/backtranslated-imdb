I was very impressed when I saw that this movie had a very good rating, when I saw it when I saw it on the IMDb. It's one of the worst films I have ever seen and I've seen bad movies. At first he seems like a good movie, but he could not believe it until the surgery. This voice destroys all! Imagine that you are open and then listen to what you say. I saw the German movie, so I do not know what he said in English, but things like irony "Yes, yes, it does not hurt ..." ... what is this? Thinking about yourself as "something else" and then forgetting your pain about just thinking about your girlfriend ... it's just stupid. And his mother ... what the hell says something like that? Someone said, his son died of surgery (what he expected). He also found some letters in his Jessica Albas handbag. In addition, he knows things about the hospital, and then does he know his "second"? What the hell ^^ And at the end ... why the police fail? Patients died of surgery, all this happened. This doctor Edanki does not know anything else ... and then steal everything, even a girlfriend? Why ??? However, I think that Christensen has done a bad job, but that is not really counted for me ... These mistakes and the stupid things I mentioned are a problem. I watched this movie with some friends and everyone was disappointed ... As I said, one of the worst films I ever watched ... Just not seen;)
