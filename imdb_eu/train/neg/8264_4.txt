The actor is a movie that works well, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a situation that feels like having a great movie in every couple or starting a story. In other words, the movie seems like theater scenes, not real life. Although women who work in the room rooms also come along with their clients, it just does not seem realistic as it is written in this movie. Also, when a character encounters a woman's weight in the film, she feels artificial, arguing in seconds how they look in seconds. Once again, all the actors are good, and the moments in this movie are enjoyable, but in general another writer used some rewritings before they reached the production.
