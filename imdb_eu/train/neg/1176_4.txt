The revolution always presents the possibilities of dramatic films, for, in fact, most of the revolutions are dramatic events. Unfortunately, if the movie is missing out on the theater, it is offset by boredom. Whoever does not take care of, lose, die or live as soon as possible. This is largely due to the superficial use of background technology. Paris scenes and French rural areas have cardboard quality. It might be better to make a scene and leave that way. It is not possible to expect the amazing effects of "Flying Daggers" or "Golden Compass," but ultimately, production is digitally mastered in 2002. The characters seem to fit into a scene, enter a scene, enter so many characters and stop counting the number of times in the room. In my opinion, this film turns the French revolution of 1790 into the "role-piece" world of the "papier colle" revolution.
