The Thinner is a fine plot. And raw. An obese lawyer overcomes the Gypsy woman and loses the gypsy curse and loses weight ... the bone. Okay, the gypsy curse must be entertaining, but the loss of weight would be bad? Laguia. Unless Stephen King thinks this. And Michael McDowell, the other horror writer and scriptwriter of this wicked movie. The lawyer is not only badly careless, too fat, ah! The elder does not have an unhappy piece for a person who has never seen any fatigue. Hey, I can not say: Well, look at the mirror.
