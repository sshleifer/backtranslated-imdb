This movie is a celebration of bad performances and bad designs, as well as sticky lines and a lame one. But it's so fun to watch. Everything is horny. At the base plot, future scientists' team travels over time to get rid of their evil colleague in order to destroy them all. They catch up in 1146. The 2033-year-old scientist laboratory is a "futurist" eighty-style room with a glossy "futurist" button and a capsule of time, which looks like earrings. Actors make the lines with the toughest tests, and this is not very difficult to understand, because the lines vibrators of the earth tend to "double-check twice!" Duplicate twice everything selected? Did he check four times? Not only this, but the whole premise of the film is fed in the first five minutes, and they continue to flourish in the Middle Ages. When Roger Corman's money was gone. He had to stop traveling in different sets of time and as a result. Medieval set, from the end of the 10th to the 16th century. They used any costume they could find. I think that there were no chains on the budget, the boys wear a T-shirt painted like a coat. Fighting scenes are silent, men casually throw cardboard swords and kill them in death. It looks really awful, but I see it. Only the lines are enough to be just as good as you are and it helps to create a fascinating B-movie that's all the rest, if you know the sharp flick, I'd recommend that you see it. And once, read the review Movies Strangers. I love listening to all the fun and awesome bits of the movie.
