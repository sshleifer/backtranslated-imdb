After seeing this in the MST3K section, I have to ask how many movies the movie has requested. Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice, and others seem to combine at least items. At one point, I really expected Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /> <br /> No doubt the director knows the holes in the plot knows what it is. In spite of the fact that gas is not available, many gas stations are abandoned, and stations are located next to the F1 race car in the country.
