Before seeing Versus, I had a lot of hope Alive. The movie description on the back of the DVD was promising. Aliv did not deliver. Very slow development. Many potentials with cast and cool audiences. The premise was interesting, but the profit was not offset. Eventually he could do a lot more. Most of the films are just "sitting around". Clearly, we were able to sit three of us and watch the movie and we were trying to finish 50 minutes mark. There were more shocking current issues. If you are looking for Ichi, Killer or Versus type battles will save yourself roughly.
