There are some wonderful ideas that this violent film, if it is clearly executed, could be lifted from spaghetti-western blandness to something special. Unfortunately, THIS IS A HISTORIC WORLD CALL THAT IS A HERO! The scene begins and ends, they go to long characters, actors' performances (accents) are quite inconsistent, etc. <br /> <br /> Robert Shaw is a Mexican (!) Revolutionary, and afterwards he has been eliminated by a town, becoming a priest (!) ... ten years later manages the mayor of Telly Salavas "the mayor." Stella Stevens seeks revenge on her husband's husband. Colonel Martin Landau is looking for Shaw. They cite one after another and shoot all LOTs one after another. Fernando Rey also exists (blind). The performances are not bad, but they are very different. Savalas sometimes has an accent in Landau (actually a grid that is currently underway). Shaw and Rey demonstrate that they are not able to shame themselves and Stevens seems to be quite insolent (if there is a bit of sweating between them).
