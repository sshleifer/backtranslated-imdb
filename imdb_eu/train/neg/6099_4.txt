This is less than an exciting short film from Turner Classic Movies. While the film appeared with its brightly colored Technicolor, the movie was just moving, and sometimes the plot seemed pretty cheesy. They worked for classroom use and showed the attention of a broad spectator. in mind. Indeed, I hated the number of times they were confirmed in the film, such as when the characters talked with him, when "Clara Barton" was usually called "Ma'am", "Miss Barton" or "Clara" instead. In addition, a sickly confederate said that "Johnny Reb, was a Confederate Rebel ..." was the cartoon Mojo Jojo of Powerpuff Girls. The writing was crazy - the deadline. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later, "Perry White" in the SUPERMAN series) to see the beard of Garfield. Yes, he has a beard.
