The movie was horrible. I was almost impossible with her. I would never again see if this film was paid. In it, horror scenes were dramatically planned and reproduced. There really was not any $ 7.50 worth of anything he could see about that movie, or he deserved it. Do not see, rent, do not read online about it, because one of these things will be a waste of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller does not give up bad performance and should really be ashamed to have filmed her good name with the movie. I am shy about Sarah, horrible film that is horrible about this. A horrible movie without having to watch it.
