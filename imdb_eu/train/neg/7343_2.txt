Ever heard the Taiwanese horror movie? Or any Taiwanese movie? Due to reasonable cause. This was very boring, even though there were black magic in the body of baby babies and people that burst from the inside with thousands of thousands of eels. <br /> <br /> After reading the thoughts of other people, I was looking forward to some violence. and gore, but there is not much to it. If you are waiting for a few pokes of blood and a lot of other coarse things, if you're looking for a graphic or awful effects, you'll be disappointed. They clearly did not burst eel and use other things to be their maximum strength. <br /> <br /> Almost nothing is enough about this movie; A single character was not quite plain and some black magic really like it. The land was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror aspect has no effect, the girl was terrifying (which was not really scary). This horror movie that I've ever seen is Asian.
