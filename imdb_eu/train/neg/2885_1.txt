I can not think of this movie, against instructions, I've seen a lot of movies and it's still the worst, a very small budget, I've got everything to make money. the slaughter scene, why I had a better job with an 8mm camera and a group of monkeys. I was so bad that I had registered to leave a comment, I had to tell something, the place to rent was not enough. But this is worth my 2 cents, I suggest you rent a bad loan and see yourself loan. I would definitely not lose any money again. Now I'll leave you with this comment. I hope that you will not get your money back in your lease. =)
