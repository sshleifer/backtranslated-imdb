Seeing all the negative critics in this movie, I thought it could be another masterpiece. I saw the first two fight scenes, I heard the general conversations given by Lungren and they were thrown out of all the Eastern actors, and the movie seemed so funny that it was fun. Brandon Lee gets into the story and single lines start flying, they fail on plot, writers start drinking, and movies get the best EVER worst initiative. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> for this honor. This movie is the worst performance (see Tia Carrere's face whenever Dolph's scene is worth the laugh), with no-one conversation (she's never the worst commentary about Brandon Leek's Dolph film). and the worst attire of a movie (the whole Japanese costume Dolph). The image "Tango and Cash" finds a worse "Commando", known as "Friday 13" (nonsense nonsense and similar to Jason Voorhees's Lungren screening) in a joke of an hour and fifty-minute movie. <br /> Good shows (not so huge) bad (which still looks like the theater) and Carrere (who is somehow saying without his 5 lines laughing). Brandon Lee is just a contributor to Lungren, and he works very hard. <br /> <br /> A horrible and horrible film. Fear and avoid. If you look at it, ask why underwater shots are as clear as underwater diving. Speak about underwater planes, look at the water-fight scene, until the worst fight scene is over. This movie has a bad fight scene for each version of those who have short attention to those who have long and fuzzy nudity <br /> <br /> A BAD BAD MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
