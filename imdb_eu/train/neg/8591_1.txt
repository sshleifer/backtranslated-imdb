I'm deciding to jump into a wooden gaitero if I'm more fun than this dreck. Once he destroyed a couple of classic movies. Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith are the deaths of Lucas's career. Does Annakin Vader want to swallow nonsense? I never thought it was true. This film claims these feelings. The story is not on Phantom Moron's mind, and every new movie has just disappeared as a toy parade. I have to go. I know where there are new stones to throw. Do you want disasters? Come here Luke and Leia are NOT related. Vader is not his Father. The Duke Countoo should still change in advance. Yoda has lesser oral skills than Yogi Berra. His advice has not been good at anyone. Obi Wan spoke in Luke in the first two films. Annakin did not build C3P0. He found out in the desert and when he lay in his mother he lied. Chewbacca has staplers. With Vader and the fall of the Republic all the mess can be blamed against the stupid Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If he had brains, Annie would not have come in for a light year, but told George Lucas what he wrote for her. For what!
