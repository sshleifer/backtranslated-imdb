I had to be the worst movie I've ever seen, I'm 64 years old and I'm a football fan. I was looking forward to watching the movie. About 10 minutes ago, I started to wonder how the theater could get a bad movie (especially the theater). The way from the middle, my husband whispered to me that it was terrifying and explained the parts of the movie. I was a little sinful (although I can see that some Christians did not feel how I could feel), when preaching in a theater, there was no great deal. However, realistic prejudices and behaviors, and above all, the quality of the performance. It's a perfect movie for the church, but it will be displayed in the church auditorium, not in the theater. Go to the church? Yes Do I want to go to the church in a movie? No Would I recommend this movie? Really not !!!
