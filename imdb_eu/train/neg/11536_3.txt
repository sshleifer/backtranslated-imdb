Well, here's where to start Straightheads presents me with a bit of dilemma. In 1975, directed by Ruggero Deodatto and starred in the role of David Hess in Italy, Labrador would steal faster than summer water. While working with Tarantino and Rodr√≠guez in honor of grindhouse cinema, Dan Reed has made a rape / revenge in England and, apparently with the same budget, had the same budget with Rodriguez McGowan's leg. a machine gun If you want to play Grindhouse Bingo, call me 'numbers': <br /> <br /> 1. A rich and rich flying career will find a bit rude in a false way, in a false way, and yet impossible He gets them. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 2. Free female shooter shooter in different nuances. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 3. Characteristics of crunchy development is very difficult and difficult to create, and they can not be imagined that there are no scenes that do not exist. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 4. A graphic framework of non-violent non-violent rapes by a male group that does not have a personality or background distinction. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 5. The evil and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to round it. Bingo! <br /> <br /> Plotwise, Straightheads are quite basic things: Dyer invites Anderson and invites him to a party at a country owned by his boss. On the way home, three of its inhabitants took revenge on Landover and Dyer put Anderson a good shoe and a team. The couple then wanted to take revenge. So far, "Straw Dogs", "Late Night Trains", "House on the Edge of the Park", "I Spit On Your Graves", etc. Abar So why do not I think much of this movie? For a lot of reasons: I suppose, for the first time, I expect the theater of Gillian Anderson to be a favorite in the theater, but it is a lack of sincerity than what he does best here. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is afraid of women of the 70's of the time of any one and Hess and his men sit down to see women scare. Then, they always know what they can achieve: designing only low budgets for a low budget and attracting the lowest common denominator. They get rid of bad guys and kill them, lovers throw away evil tables and everyone is happy to go home, knowing how evil their violence is, and regaining the order of the world. <br /> <br /> However, as a writer and conductor, Dan Reed strongly believes that Straightheads speaks much more about the state of man's psyche, and desperately tries to keep his film from penetrating with a philosophical depth, There's just that. . For example, when Anderson and Dyer are planning revenge against the attackers, he has two daughters of hearts, a daughter of sixteen years old, daughter of two men with lust. When Anderson finally faces up front, he admits that he has been raped only as a distraction, his two friends have his daughters to leave his daughter daughter out! Reed is a daring and courageous way to make this little revelation a bold and courageous way of falling into the plot, but this simple reference to the pedophile is that it's enough for the viewer to convert the compass into an overdrive and get out of the movie. it's just a sign of meaning. To achieve this, "at this time we will cross the rape sequence for the second time, apparently from the attacker's point of view and his daughter's concern, but Reed assures much more shots. Anderson was unlikely to handle and raped his car's cap. Free money is not included. <br /> <br /> After telling his rape reasons, Anderson connects it to a table, ends with a sniper rifle business (it is full of silence, unless anyone fails to clear his jacksie in the phallic picture, but courage Dyer (who does not have such moral concerns) is "dead." Dyer argues in a different way, and his moral dilemma is presented as something that Wittgenstein and Russell discuss over Cambridges and cakes in their rooms . It's almost impossible in his conduct. <br /> <br /> Anderson correctly carries herself in the film. It's clear that Scully wants to leave behind, and bless her, he certainly does; Mulder asks her a partner would it be that he would run away from the road next to a man with a pistol sodomizing? Dyer, however, is the one who has done all the films that he has done so far, An annoying smile that plays a joke that plays a hat, a joke line and the face that most people will never get. Punching tired. This is especially true in the final scene, after his attackers killed him with cold blood, Dyer looks at the camera, I am sure what will happen, what the manual destiny looks like for the existential anguish that invites us to the sympathies. He had to deal with it and overthrow the moral reasons, but Oliver Hardy recalls that camera disturbed him, after landing on another Stan. By the way, this movie is pretty short.
