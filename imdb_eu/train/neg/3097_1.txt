There is no question of spoil for this film, the director overwhelmed us and this film has deteriorated in many ways. <br /> <br /> The corruption of many things like Critters and Gremlins. This movie fails at so many levels to recover the humor and fear of the best films. Time is wasted, the bad actor gives a bad conversation in front of a malicious director, who occasionally throws stuffed toys. The old Tarzan films are fighting with toy crocodile rubber, while shouting and trying to make a threatening appearance. Watching it is painful and it's not helped by the 80's dressed in the cast. <br /> <br /> Basically, an old security guard arrives at the hamlet for free from some crazy aliens who have been trapped in the film. close the year and start telepathically with people. New guards, left repeating warnings, get their 80's team together and small adventures play together while trying to recover the grem ... Hobgoblins. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < And the young hero is composed of the lack of confidence and his girlfriend, however, would want to put it. " /> First, it's an annoying scene for awesome fighters. There, a former military army shows how he trained him to be a harassment of the army, so that the hero nerd has a few hours to finish the track. Then, they are running a few runners, ending in a real pie-fights style that ends in a loud nightclub that runs comedy handmade grenades, except for people next to them. Then the movie series ends and it ends well. <br /> <br /> It is not. It's like seeing the train's disaster, you can not take your eyes off, it's so bad. The perfect rate for Mystery Science Theater, but you need to be horrified only to see and avoid. The Fashion Police still has a lot of guarantees for cast, and I venture to say that someone does not laugh at the fight. That is, from 10 to 10 points, on a good day.
