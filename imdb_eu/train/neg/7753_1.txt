Everything about this film is cleared up. Mercy, horrible conversation, original ugly girls. This movie has been forgotten !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director had to be a weekend bass player. Robert C. has totally lost himself and does not know what happens. University children are the worst. No active talent is not very stupid reasoning, and just right dumbbells. Special effects are for birds. The security force around the park is in the toy ground: stupid guns, unnecessary walkie talkers; and a computer solution with toilet paper. If the park is being built and nothing works; why invite guests until the end of their potential. writers should be the first victims of confusion with producers and crew. The entire film is in a septic tank shot in front of another planet. What's a curious thing? Crimes have to see this, so they can commit suicide.
