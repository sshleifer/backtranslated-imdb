I can not tell how angry I was after watching this movie. Characters are not the most interesting jewels, and the plot does not exist. So, after seeing how the life of the characters are affected, 2 hours and a half passed over in the past to reach important expectations, what have we achieved? Frogs a storm Yes, yes, I understand the references to the Bible (Exodus) and the issues underlying it, but first of all it was presented without resolution, and secondly, it would lose anyone who did not read the Bible (significant part of the population) or Charles Fort (a larger part). As a reader, I thought this movie was a high security imitation episode of a security episode. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. It would be better to read ... <br /> <br /> ... everything that is honest
