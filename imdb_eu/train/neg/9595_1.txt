The latest film about Asian films in the Americas is the ULMA film that will be published here. Being a fan of Asian movies of all genres, I was browsing the web and I found this soong to be re-released in the US market so I checked and decided to rent it in a local video store. <br /> Confess me ... the action scenes are very depressing, Turrun Wheels and Iron Monkey have completely broke the film from the water. Jet Li would sleep asleep fighting. If you are looking for martial arts entertainment, it would be a better time to go with Jackie Chan! <br /> <br /> Also ... you think you're watching martial arts. A girl SURPRISE A SUCCESSFUL CHILDREN! A good hour of this movie in the middle of conversation, absence of action, lack of drawing tangents, has nothing to do with the premise that we have experienced. He has more relationship with him and his boyfriend, and his boyfriend with his conspiracy team, the producer / director has not had time to hang out and still has a part of the film. It would be much better to cut an entire hour and build the story itself during a film and focus on martial arts. <br /> <br /> In a word, I do not really believe in the Iron Monkey's choreographer, he made the sequence of action by Princess Blade. I criticized the slow pace of depression of the physical agility of the farmer and the rapid change of camera cameras. I just did not buy it. <br /> <br /> Please ... I warn you that with this leak you do not waste your time / money. The premise is intriguing, and the trailer is tempting to you, but I'm glad that this movie is not appropriate for the public (perhaps in Japan but not in the states) and the worst film for the state will be the Asian movie. industry
