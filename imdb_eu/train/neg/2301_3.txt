Does this show really help some people, or do they just see people who see it? When I am turning the channels and I will get to this show considering morbid vision. I understand that Roberson feathers are not all together. I do not know what it is like its audiences, or if they are good people, and if they hear what they say will be a better life. Roberson pat is a small consequence. It's old, think old way. fear of damnation no longer had the same affect (thanks to the god). Now if someone answered my question, the lightning will disturb them for the rest of the days of eternity.
