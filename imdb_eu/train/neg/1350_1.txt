This film, especially Dr. Inspector Gadget, is a Dr. Claw. After a lot of years, Metropolis has returned to a quiet city. Claw Plays Gadget's final "cooler" crime is used to destroy Gadget's reputation. Sadly, the movie fails, the series was wonderful, but 20 years later it was revived with tragic results. With Don Adams, the voice of Inspector Gadget is no longer cut; Dr. Claw is not only a scary sight, but it sounds like a fighter over the cold. It's a movie for children, but it's so painful in the plot (I forbid the sky to mention the animation) is similar to the original series. Someone has decided to update Penny for more than two decades. Nowadays, she has almost half-point outfit for revelry and does not play half of the TV series. Gadgetmobile speaks, including the angle of a plot that focuses on the whole car that speaks. Perhaps I was just a child who loved the show, which I grew up with, but I thought the live action version was more painful than I had, but now they will go and they will present the full irrigation of quality TV shows. with us I can not take it over.
