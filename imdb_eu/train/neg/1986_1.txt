Must be in agreement with the other reviewer. This had to be the worst movie, let alone I saw Western. An immense, unthinkable and pathetic repertoire (much less a conversation that was supposedly completely inappropriate in 1800), and oh, did I mention a dashboard in the back of a character? I was waiting for a boom mike in the middle of a scene. And the end? I can say that at least the movie was consistent with the rest ... absolutely horrible. Yes, he had all the clich√©s of the book, even though he was walking down the slow and broken road, when the main character who remembers "remember when" dies. Fortunately I saw this on free TV. Do not waste your time.
