Well, all of this site will be welcomed, but it's a good ground for the worst movie I've ever seen. It's a two and a half hour movie because it feels like three and a half because it has two movies. The first movie tells the story of a family that needs to move home from drought and famine. Going to the city must go south to find some kind of food or work. They find a pretty bag in their own right, and at the same time they know that the drought is over. Yes, well. Thanks to this knowledge, they return home with riches, and everything is fine and it's wonderful again. <br /> <br /> Well, it's a movie that lasts about half a minute, and at that moment it's not very lively, it has a nice arch. You think it's the best way to end this movie. However, the movie continues for another hour. For the rest of this time, he takes on a simple story about the family that cares about the world and transforms it into a melodramatic melody about betrayal and jealousy among lovers. Oh, old and old, money is the root of all the nasty blah. Because you know how to make an epic movie does not mean that your story can not be more than necessary. I would find the main idea about this movie, and it's good to keep this family and its relationship together. So, why do we spend an hour telling the story of a man who has been enriched with another woman, and why is the last moment of the movie dedicated to his wife that our main character does not care in most films. <br /> <br /> O wait and the movie is not the only thing wrong, the wife's wife does not make sense. He complained a lot about slavery and never wants to be a slave and yadda yadda yadda. After all, why she fell asleep, her only daughter was ready to sell slavery. Although they are starving at the time of this idea, it still does not make sense in the film that 20 minutes later complaining about a slave being unwanted. <br /> <br /> There are other films from the thirties. This is cinematography. The earth shoots beautifully, and the cushion sequence is very impressive. It was bad to say anything in a movie. <br /> <br /> One last thing. I know at that moment that Hollywood focused on most stars and thought the actor could imagine one thing. Most of the film by Paul Muni represents an Asian man in his best ability, but when he gets to the center of the film, he loses and simply transforms him into an old Italian. So it looks like Scarface's Tony (a better movie than this one). Among the main protagonists of the movie, I think maybe three Asia are really, because the rest of the Americans are stupid. Oh, please, Mrs. Rainer, it was a very nice note, but I would not, Oscar would be able to get my hands out, oh. <br /> <br /> Good territory is an epic waste of time. If you want something wasted, seeing a nice evening is Wrath de Grapes of Wrath, a movie that deserves a worthy praise. Mainly because he did not write a monkey.
