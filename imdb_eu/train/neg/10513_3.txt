This movie was lost in my hour and a half. In general, I like the cheap horror monster film type, but this movie was disappointing. The main mistake is missing out. When they got home, he explained to the men of the rent. He really does not say anything about them because they killed their parents and did not lose something, he did not say how he got away ... He does not give him reason for no kidney. He is alive only and basically feeds on his creatures next to his death. It seems he should have left the "cross event" afterwards.
