Well, I'm not sure if I'm going to do so for a while, and I'm going to have a good movie at the end. Since 1999, one of the first five films has been one of Cruel intentions. Everything that had to be a great movie, unless it was an original story, was adapted from a novel, it was still very good. On to Cruel Intentions 2 was one of the kind to open a series based on a manchester prep movie. That did not happen. After seeing this movie I really understand. Before starting, at least Roger Kumble was like the writer and director he did. Well, this 1 minute I was disappointed in this movie. If the opening of the original differs from six to seven, instead of taking the nude photo of her daughter's portrait, the wives of the school's directors will naked. That would be fine if this woman was not 50. And, basically, the rest of the movie is a free copy of the original. What I understood as if nothing were wrong. But you can not do that with a movie. This really was a prequel to me, as they saw in the manner described in section 1, but Sebastian is simply a true story of becoming a prankster and Kathryn himself and becoming a sexually predatory sebastian, not based on the movie. Anyone who made a question about this thing was far away. At least they intended to get people like the original theater, but they did not hire a bunch of good actors. I'm using this term, but I do not know why. Surely they did not make this movie. <br /> <br /> This film did not coincide with the originals, but some of them did, but they were only in section 1, the other point was the involvement of parents' teens who were able to understand the need to take care of the first part It was not because they were in them and they were used incorrectly, because the children had to show why. they are like that. It did not work On the original, however, this cast was taken to chemistry. The screen tension on it was filmed. This is a really long stay away from this experience.
