It's called Kim Basinger Della, a housewife who resigns with an abusive husband while in trouble while doing the last Christmas shopping. The overwhelming note written down on paper and grabbed two car parks in a winding car's car, the car owner Rainbow Coilition is made up of a white criminal. Mexican, a Chinese man and a black man. They face the warning, they inscribe a helpless guardian and goes on. During Della's film, he will be looking for a hunter while his Bronson is blown up. <br /> <br /> This thriller seemed a bit tense. The play was good enough (except for some scenes, "Why God's why" has been bad with his wickedness). It is a bit unholy, because of the crime, because of the stupidity of the head. . If it had not been the intelligence of a "foolish man at home", it would be something that might have the smell of the reaction that reminds them of the recent failure. One of the factors that he believes to be the director and one of the producers is that they are encouraged to participate in the "Shoot em up" screen (a movie that was very funny while throwing credibility in the window). The movie that never reached the heights of the film was good in its rights. <br /> <br /> My grade: C- <br /> <br /> Anchor Bay DVD add-ons: Susan writer / director's comments. Producer Montford and Don Murphy; 25 minutes and a half 'Making-of'; one movie and two TV trailers; and learn the lesser trailer
