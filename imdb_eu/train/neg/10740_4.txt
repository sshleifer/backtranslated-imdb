This movie starts with a certain amount of promise; But, in my opinion, it starts to lose when the protagonist breaks his car when he rescues the good Samaritan. This is a good idea for a stranger who decides to make an outgoing call when he or she starts to repair his car, but there is little people in the country who can help the family's way back. Initial writers' casuality warns them to use their stories. <br /> <br /> I found the average movie at best. The direction of art could be much better, as it could be cinematography. The performance was good, and Eva van der Gucht also sang.
