I can not believe this movie is filming. SO BAD was. I totally fooled the art of Kutxa. NO LIKE! I promise not to be your time. I do not know the positive opinion about this film is a joke or something. I'm so disappointed. :( <br /> <br /> This is not a description of the back of the box, but a voodoo girl with her is a stripper, but in the background, she is synopsis that she is only 17. She is the one who is writing the description of the film, watching over it again? They had to be a joke they should have been. If anyone liked this movie, I lost faith in humanity. <br /> <br /> And do not even start the story with the title. Or the entire movie was made in two locations, or no police They closed the real uniforms ... I mean to watch over uniform cops !? Compared with the rest of the film, the uniforms were in detail. <br /> <br /> This movie insults the zombie genre and all its fans.
