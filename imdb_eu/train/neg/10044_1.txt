This is the biggest Flop 2008. I do not know how to create a great challenge for the director. The songs have been added in a state of affairs, the story has been extended to fill a 3-hour void and the toughest act stunts by actors, if they are super-bullfighters, they are like fireballs that can be run and nothing happens and a person struggles with 100 people. Anil Kapoor's best work has only been the best piece of comic book talking about Hinglish ... Akki works well ... but he forgets the movie.
