Or "Marlowe At Sea". At that time, with Bogey, another ancient antiquated film. Even bad. Bogey essentially plays the same character as Marlow; Always in a state of contention, ever nervous - in spite of a dangerous situation, women call "thrushes" and "ladies" and other nonsense, it's the only "male" alpha male (alpha male only). The man is Gestapo's head, but the alpha is only a male man) and, naturally, all the attractive women who go on his way can not cope with his charm and his penis at the hour of his early entry. All topical characters are here. Bogey is the same as the cynical reform that happened in "Casablanca", and, of course, often refuses to give up money or other values ​​when it is offered - but how does his cynicism fit? He is not cynical; Hawks wanted two ways: a character, "cynical, fresh" and still a sensible humanitarian. I do not think so ... Bacal has his first "rollover" routine for the first time, and there is a conversation between his "Bogot" and Bogey. These conversations are fooled by the current standards. "Just peel your lips and whistle ..." Ticket charge ... At the age of 19, this was done, but it's a lot older and it's much more attractive than a female star of the day. His bony face, with its sharp features, is not at all close to the feminine beauty of the feminine Havilland, Myrna Loy's drunkenness, and much less as Irene Dunne. Bacall was apt to play vampires, not female fatigues. (In real life, the face is very similar: a Hollywood slut). There is a scene in which we cry for Bacal; very inadequate for his character. There are two or three bad music numbers - but my quick progress button was ready. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading "Hollywood" biographies from Bogart, Bacall, Huston and other people, please contact by email.
