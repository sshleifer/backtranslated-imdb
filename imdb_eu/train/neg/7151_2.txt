I can say I'm proud that I've seen three films that are fast and furious. Probably plots are stupid and may be a bit of cheek, but I like the claws of cars and all the beautiful cars and midnight races. I'm glad to see a fourth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Want to know what is the difference between three and the Redline between them? Decisive action, thought of a plot, despite potrobors, and finally the director. They have a clue. The three directors were very competent, all the films were taken in a different direction, equally exciting. Redlin brought her a dozen women to sleep when she sleeps, she slept in the boiler and made extra items. After receiving his own Hollywood unemployment line. Yikes.Its Mystery Science Theater 3000 bad. This is a bad TV movie for the 70's. <br /> <br /> Yes, he had some cool movie cars. , but you will not really see much in this action, and the action is so badly directed, do not be excited about excitement, if you do not d your cars, why would you go on such a movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am an audience with a bunch of teenagers and I can not stop laughing. I look dirty, but this was just a debacle. <br /> <br /> <br /> F & F rent movies. Go to the Nascar race. Go to the karting track and race yourself. Regardless, do not overdo it as bad as Redline cheese.
