Painful Shakespeare's story is a painful way to describe the terrific performance of a fun and interesting theater. I gave him a shot, but I was very disappointed and could not see it. Much like Ado's great concept of how to write a novel, I pity myself and your bored brain. Failure to pay your lies about young audiences can not be lifted. Do not worry about the wonderful and dreadful performance of a performance by listening to the acclaimed Shakespeare theater. You will be forced to kick off and you will be close to the TV you decide to watch, because it will cause unwanted defection.
