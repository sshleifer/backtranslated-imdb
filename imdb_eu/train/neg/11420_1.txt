San Elmo Fire does not have any effect on the post-secondary life of the university (however, as ordinary people think). Why was this garbage made? Who will really connect? Who lives these characters? I really feel the actors have to make a great screenplay. There are talented young actors who have done a good job in "another movie". It must be said that they should have a full discussion. <br /> <br /> My "brainstorm" actually injected my mind. The only joy that came out of it was Sir John Hughes, who waited for him, and released his hunger in the same year, the masterpiece "The Breakfast Club" was released. <br /> <br /> Do not enjoy doing the 80's because of the same error I've seen. It really attacks the genre.
