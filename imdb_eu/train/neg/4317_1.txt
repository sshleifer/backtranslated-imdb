My spouse and I saw the movie very schlocky. It started well, but it quickly got incredible and ridiculous. Most of the performances were poor, except for Abbie, a wonderful little girl. In addition, the interview was predictable & lame - especially Gideon, Angel. Also, without giving anything, if a character has a tragedy, it hardly seemed. At first we thought it was 'shock', but then we thought it was terribly thoughtful. We love almost all Films Hallmark, as well as stories that warm their hearts, but this movie will not be one. There are so many excellent ones: do not waste time with this awesome movie.
