Jason Lee makes his efforts to have fun in a fun situation, but the movie fails to connect. <br /> <br /> Maybe it seems that Julia Stiles's character is an evil person, soon the brotherhood will be a cousin. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, Selma Blair's characters have to reverse the path. (Selma Blair seems to be more conventional than Julia). <br /> <br /> In any case, this movie is a void of Hollywood in the real-world situation (however, if your pants are not caught in your bride's party, your cousin), as long as it promises, it does not deliver. <br /> <br /> There are a few laughs, sure to be up and running (even if it is in the wrong), it works with sub-quality material that does not exceed its high-profile theme. . So, instead of offering a successful race (ie, Animal House or American Pie), we remain in the midst of humor and partial stupidity (or Meatballs 2 or something).
