The statistics in this movie have been thoroughly researched. No doubt! Without a doubt, Al Gore presents his case very well and it is not surprising that he has achieved the praise that this film has achieved. Al Gore is definitely a very actress. Worried But they talk louder than words of action! There are political references to political films during this film and they refer to the political career that took place throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man with integrity who does not talk, but walks. as well. When he thought it necessary to save energy, he dismissed the White House thermostat and heated himself with a sweater. <br /> <br /> Al Gor tells us that we have to generate claims and generate energy. He traveled global warming in his private plane. How much power does jet use and how much more jet its jet generates? How much energy does it need to keep the pool upstairs behind the house? Proper electricity would be smaller by using small appliances and anything we did not use. However, the energy company would reduce energy by 50% by calling "a 50% loss of revenue" and increasing its losses by 50%. So "just turn off" would not be a very good idea. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wonderful header to allow Governments to control everything, that is, to save planet earth.
