This movie had to be the worst movie horror I've ever seen. The play was awful, he talked about a horrible and cheesy and predictable plot! I have never seen this movie and I will not recommend this film to anyone. What time to lose! First of all, as soon as I started the movie I noticed what I entered. All that was done for this movie was a series of horror films that were copied scenes and all that went into this movie. Dial phone calls, Halloween night, psyche and a knife! It's totally ridiculous. When I supposed that I made horror films in the movie I was not afraid. As far as the film is concerned, it's quite funny how they talked about such a great movie and so terrifying. I mean, how do you not realize that movies like "Scary Movie" are cheaper. They will bring you at least good actors and maybe a good horror movie will come out.
