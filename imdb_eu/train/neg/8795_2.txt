I hardly ever saw the movie, the rage of quality. I only saw that Quentin Tarantino was such an absurd obsession ... There were some attractive women in this movie, and maybe it's a decent quality. In general, I find this movie surreal and ridiculous. I have found short films, dizziness and dizziness shot in parallel with the direct movies and other film cells. In general, until the end was a horrible and repetitive music, it reminded me of the psychological war against the US military. <br /> <br /> Some of the jewels that created the film are unhappy and do not meet and fix their content and "consequences". A depressing movie (it's not a true movie, a real art saving term) left me feeling bad. Do not believe that this does not mean that the person who makes the "romantic comedy" does not even isolate the two elements, content, form, and conclusion of this film with its relationship with this genre. <br /> <br /> I suggest that they remain far away from the IMDb and other positive sources of valuation.
