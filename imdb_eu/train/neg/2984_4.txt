I admit that the majority of this movie was not inspired, but I was still entertained. It has a wonderful sense of frantic energy, above average music, and women in the film are proud of themselves, there is no shortage here. It seems that other movies are worse, at least this has been an intriguing drawing with some social comments. They will explain how the military man deals with viral epidemics, because he destroys everything, as well as people. Saving is supposed to happen. Also, what a law that can be dangerous, then democracy does not exist. Fulci seemed to try to combine his earlier work (zombies, beyond, gates of hell) to somehow improve it. Failed, but definitely not unfortunately, as many people think of you. I have a gentle spot. For the zombie movie, so I'm glad I'm going to review them. I'm saying that the movie is good for a moment, so much so that there is no deviation to make this movie. (Leaving Fulci and Bruno (the best I can hack) is to have mattei) which could be much better and more focused. My collection will continue as Fulci Zonbi Swan song. It's a stunning note that there is no 3 scene in the area that really ripped me from the cemetery, I could not believe it, you would be amazed to see it.
