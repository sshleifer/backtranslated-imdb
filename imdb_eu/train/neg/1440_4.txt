Swayze does not make Alan Quatermain very credible. Compared to Stewart Granger; My latest heroine grew up in films like "Scaramouche" in 1952, "The Zenda" of 1952 and 1950 in the "King Solomon's Mines" movies; Patrick Swayze fails. In the portrait of Sean Connery's eldest son, Alan Quatermain, "The Extraordinary Lord's League" was a very good flop. Alison Doody, too, is Deborah Kerren's grace for her main role, and in the end, the Umopa role in Syria is awesome for anyone who is tough to wear his (his shoes) !!! In the case of somebody who was disappointed with Richard Chamberlain in 1985, I now suggest that if you can not get a better hand now.
