Given the history of the director of this film, it's hard to believe that it was a bad movie to make it sit. I was at the European premiere last night and there was one of the Executives of Producers. He still watched the movie, and, boy, he surprised. I do not read this book as a base, and I do not know if I value or appreciate it, but I have read Correlli Mandelli "Mandolin" and how poorly it was in my screen and what was wrong. Think about something like here. The play was not bad, though it was a couple of many raised eyebrows Farrell. Honestly, I can not believe that I look after all the characters in this movie. The situations appear on the screen in an empty sequence of nothing. Some scenes from Donald Sutherland open the door, they say something and shuts it over again. I saw my watch on the screen when I was not there. I have never been in the movies but I was tempted in that. I've rated the movie '2' for the reasons that are very little for me, but they are the best things I can say about this movie. First of all, the earthquakes were very short and the second one was that Salma Hay was naked and it seemed pretty. I can say a bit more positive about this movie. Do not ask anything about dust, it can not be spoken!
