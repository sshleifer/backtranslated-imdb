My husband Robin Williams is a great fan. I like it too much, but I've generally found the best "doing" and "comedy" roles. My thoughts were reaffirmed with this movie. I was completely bored in the whole movie. The story was predictable. I realize that he was inspired by a real story. However, while in my opinion the story remains true, there might be some suspense or intrigue. A character was not well developed. There was a story about the main character and his partner. This relationship can be further analyzed. Most importantly, however, the mother of "boy" would be deeper exploration. His psychological profile could be interesting. Of course, it has a long history, except superficial, untouched. If my husband did not have a great fan of Williams, we would leave 20 minutes. I can not go back to my 20 or 2 hours.
