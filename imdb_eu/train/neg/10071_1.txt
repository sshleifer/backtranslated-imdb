I watched this movie at the premiere of Sundance 09. <br /> <br /> American Beauty is something to say to the movie, I had the hope of Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. Indeed, I've seen several films that I've seen at almost a dozen Sundance festivals, but Towelhead has been one of the only films of Sundance that I wanted to come up with earlier. <br /> <br /> The worst problem with Towelhead is that, of course, it is a collection of "provocative" cultural stereotypes rather than organic human drama. The script is the result of the novel by Alicia Erian. Edith Wharton's famous mention comes from: I never knew it was a good novel if the writer was adapted to the author's political opinions. This observation is particularly destructive to Towelhead, whose political opinions are so obsolete and simplistic. Towelhead black male black criminals, wonderful black portraits, ironic foreign culture treatments, etc. If it was ever it was fresh, it's past. <br /> <br /> For a more detailed review, check out. Many professional reviews are available online. Almost all people misjudge this movie and explain their manipulative tissue based on their base. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, amateur reviewers are more likely to appear. While reading through this site and similar reviews, you will often find superlatives: "stunning", "amazing", "deep", "shocking", ... it embarrasses me, but it does not surprise me. In fact, it seems that many people have found that any book or movie about any race, culture, gender, or sexual problem is full of stimulating thinking, full of insight. If you are such a person, in a safe way, rent Towelhead and move around. On the other hand, if your standards are higher, you can safely go through this.
