I have to say that I had the rejection of this movie. I have never had a great BNL fan, their songs seem like childhood and obsessively nostalgic (that is, I am in the 9th, if I had a million dollars, the life shoe box, etc.). However, I have watched live shows and I like the improvising and stupid nature of the show. In this film, I would like to emphasize this, unfortunately, because the most interesting part of the show plays well, but it is not compelling (in the middle of a lone bass that was totally vain and boring). Although Jim Creegan was drilling. The film only shows a few minutes (and you know how to have a better time, like in Afgahnistan "Koffee Anan" concert, it is responsible, my name is Steve Paige and I'm really great "). <br /> <br /> BNL recently in Europe When I went out, I heard the song "Blue" by Effeil 99 when I heard Godawfull, or 2 minutes later, I came back to Canada a month later, I almost put myself to the song. It's like BNL, a few years ago I recall the favorite souvenirs around the fire on the road in Canada, if "if it's been played by people," I had a million dollars. " BNL was a Canadian worship phenomenon and a great deal of their humor has a specific Canadian trend (Kraft Dinner is a lot for many students here and the name "Gordon" is Canadian. I got into the darkness and I was very happy. Then, suddenly, they become awesome in states, where everyone thinks they're a new team (well, but it's new, but all the decades!) While in the rest of Canada, "O!" Well, I thought boys were bent over the years, should I hear again "million dollars"? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The concert's footage is not bad, but I would like to have their stage routine, the shooting is not so great, and their Boston massive free-show video clips are faster. The interview is surprisingly sad for a funny bunch of guys, I think they are old, they have a family, houses and things, and they have settled for a while. Sometimes Espinal Tap type material enters where the satira gives the running of the bulls, then they laugh and they laugh like that. The dialogues with Moses Znaimer (the Canadian media mogule) and Terry David Mulligan (Music Dude) are very unlikely and they are unwanted to enter the Tap territory. <br /> <br /> This movie does not really document very well; Basically, it's a show and at the beginning of the movie, it's already huge and rotational are very sequel, it's not darkness and popular "surprises", the event is methodically foreseen, so it's only late, half-live concert, half-documentary and Not much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
