... from 100 to 100 times the producers put a lie on their teeth (or someone else) to get rented or purchased *. <br /> <br /> Shock-O-Rama proves cinema This time, it's a publication of "Mass Eating", surely well-invented but inept and bad in the genres of the area. People are not only low budget movies but also low budget movies - I love, I know they love their family - they've never been to Variety in any significant way. This is baaaaaaaaaad mooin 'pitcher, folks, and not just cheap. <br /> <br /> The operation is mediocre but I do not blame the actors; they had no direction. They were not under the direction of the zombie fantasy because the script did not make sense of the real cinematographic story. The characterization is very small due to the weakness and direction of the conversation. I still mentioned the script and direction quite lame? They are. There is no drama, no tension, no great character, nothing. All of the premisses on the media's government have lost a gruesome tale that differentiates sophomorous "leapfrogs" and rational analysis and is ridiculous in its hilarious finishing. Syd Fields would not be happy. <br /> <br /> How would the government put an end to the reality of a huge epidemic of zombies that would appear somewhere in reality? Why would they give more than one attempt? On these days and age of wireless access to mobile devices, what are the expected ones to achieve over a day? Now, if something was being covered, like their culpability ... but "Mass fed" has never been considered. Instead, nonsense and misunderstood events work with laughter and / or meaning, as audiences in prayer do not overlook the total value of production beyond almost basic film equipment. Does anyone pay for this movie? I await the actors, if they lost a lack of careers in blind streets like this; at least technicians have had a legitimate work experience. <br /> <br /> Although zombie enthusiasts will find little "Masses Nutrition". Gore dominates his top level budgets, and there is no distinctive setting or memorable effect. Actually, they have been completely overlooked. The KNB has nothing to fear. <br /> <br /> Even though "rubbish" like Aussie's undead was much more than "feeding" messages. Sorry, you're back to the drawing boards, and take your misleading marketing.
