This documentary (or mockumentary) means that people are a great example of how ridiculous they may be when they're totally upset. Honestly, I hate Cryptozoology. Unscience, it's just destroying it. However, something positive was the visual effects (dragons were beautiful), but some mockumentary information was absolutely false, and this is really disappointing when scientists came, so it's worth a 10th and not a 0.th number. An example of false information would be the idea of ​​hydrogen: it is true, according to Chemistry, that hydrogen is produced by stomachs, but it is impossible to produce it in that proportion, so in this case, you need a good explanation of what happens in the dragon stomach. In nature, there are many substances with hydrogen, but it is not necessary to fly such an animal animal, and hydrogen does not appear, so it is impossible. However, something worse seems to be, the platinum idea: this element is harder to find than gold, and I can not explain myself how the dragons will last. They are ridiculous, they show dragons like creatures that have little power to conquer Earth Planet, but, of course, they explain why they have disappeared. Probably the cryptologist calls himself scientists, but they are not. People like them say this false lie, and the worst thing is people buy. But I do not believe that the people who care for Science believe in the dragons after seeing this. These false scientists reduce their time.
