As a writer, films seem to me to be bad on their faces. Let's talk I wrote the best stories I wrote. Bad operation, bad writing, bad management and togetherness, is a complete failure. <br /> <br /> The only thing that strives to achieve this movie prevents unexpected consumers from losing time. Who would lighten something green light? It is not artistic, clear, intelligent, sensitive, mysterious, scary, dramatic. NOT INCLUDED. <br /> <br /> The characters are flat and boring, with no development. The plot recycles it as an aluminum tin. In any case, they cast some very well-known actors, the work was quite disappointed, or one of the low-budget independent films was expected to be the next "Pulp Fiction". This script was used to use a bird cage line, not a movie. <br /> <br /> Well, and at the end, at least 5.25 lb. a woman has the power to kill more than one male and female size, without a fight and a single blow. <br /> <br /> Avoid this bomb as a MUSI.
