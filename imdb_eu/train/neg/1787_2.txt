Batman: I liked Dead End. Batman's dark movie dark film team was perfect. Batman: Dead End is good. This is not. <br /> <br /> First, let's start with the play. Nothing is really good. The best would be Clark Bartram Batman. But that does not mean much. It's good at first glance, and then you realize what it is, a bodybuilder that is a sustainable actress. But, above all, the problem is that Batman does not put it on a day-to-day basis, as one gets fried like they are in an outfit. The man trying to solve the past mistakes instead of a loud noise. The clear day also suggests a dodgy fear on the face of Bartram, which is never left in Batman: Dead End, probably due to the dark summary that he wants in this trailer. Bartram seems to shake and shake his mind that it's terrifying, not the other way round. It's called posing, something terrible that prevents such horror actors. <br /> <br /> I did not understand anything about why Colloras was thrown out by body builders. It's much sensible to play the role of the actor who manages it, even if he is replaced by a physicist who manages it, but it still waits for COMIC! Of course, you might want to do better if you do not want the dialect Collora. <br /> <br /> The full trailer (yes, trailer, not a feature film). Superman after Batman. But everything on Superman is fine, lovable and amateur. Michael O'Hearn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. She is around and smiles. That's it. Even though I'm not surprised because it's just a bodybuilder, they've hired a few shares and have probably received them. I repeat to Collorari, by ACTOR. Do not bodybuilders. The actors are so believable as we look like a comic book, we'll be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Costume Superman hopes to wear what you want. About Batman Dress. Well, I look good in darkness alone. I say this because it looks like the suit you bought at a Halloween gift shop. <br /> <br /> Superman flies the movie. But that's not a good thing. These plans are especially amateur. This "film" looks a lot and has a backyard with a VHS camera. <br /> <br /> Superman shots are one of the best shots in their hands. And the last two films of Batman and the other end. Trailer for those who have watched. You know what I am doing. The trailer for the whole movie has only been released. <br /> <br /> I finally ask. Why are you trying to show your ability as a director, would you create a short movie trailer? This does not prove anything when he directs the story of the director. Here is the only advice from Collora: being able to tell a story and be able to work on marketing. <br /> <br /> Batman: Dead End does not feel amateur. I do not know where he will go.
