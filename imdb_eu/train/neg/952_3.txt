The happy time and talent of Happy Go Lovely is lost to the audience. The agility of ancient identities and scandalous line lines is completely forgiving. Few people saw these movies for their land. However, usually there were some interesting minor characters in the subplacements - not here. Interesting choreography and amazing dances and popular songs. Not happy, wonderful And the Vera-Ellen female leader played a full-length movie as a second banana-looking second plateau, and instead was called to take the movie and could not do it. The Scottish town was wasted. Normally remote scams are automatically lost. The photo was on foot. Musical numbers were for pedestrians. Cesar Romero gives his usual professional performance, as no other person chewing the landscape, as Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou tried as a producer. David Niven is well and David Niven could not do it like David Niven. At the end of the day, if you worship like Niven, Happy Go Lovely's 90 minutes is unnecessary. Otherwise, skip.
