At the time of writing this review, more than 50% of the voters of the IMDb seem to have been awarded a 10 or 1 punctuation. I can only believe that 10 are given cast or crew. <br /> <br /> They said that monkeys have enough and enough time and enough writing, monkeys, through random keyboard proddings, should write the whole work of Shakespeare. However, I doubt that I have given the same amount of monkeys and the amount of time, you can only find 10 points for that movie. <br /> <br /> I saw the first part patiently, assuming a fool. It would develop a plot, plot, or character, or maybe some social comment or little intellectual thinking. If that was not enough, I was quite ready to accept my act, suspense, comedy, horror or even free sex as a way of attracting my attention. In the end, I was disappointed and, in the second half, I saw it at a much higher speed, I lost a small part of the film depreciation. Unfortunately, there was not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And talking about the cartoon characters, the cast-member's ability to act was acceptable (at best) and cheeky, between Brooke Bailey's portrait of death obsessed with London's death. br /> <br /> I would like to end it very much, but also the second party of contemporary punk rock, even a soundtrack, to make it even less entertaining, and even less to improve a bad movie.
