I just saw this movie over and I found it basically not fun anymore. <br /> <br /> I'm a RPG gamer (computer type, no DND desk above) but I have not found any joke. this is fun among everyone. <br /> <br /> Some scenes seemed like a lot to go out (bend and zoom out over a minute for 5 seconds) and feel like it was the director. Trying to get time <br /> <br /> I think the whole movie I laughed 2-3 times. <br /> <br /> Efficiency was not so bad, it's the standard that has to be the B Grades movie. <br /> <br /> If you did not have any problems with this movie, I had a great DND fan and it would probably be better to forego it.
