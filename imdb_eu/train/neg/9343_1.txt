How do I start coming up soon as the worst director of all season's "worst film of all time". A film that could be developed following worship, "is it so bad because it's good?" <br /> <br /> The critique of approaching analytical film makes no sense and bandwagon syndrome. because all the other humans on the ground do, and like people who like the movie about these flaws. <br /> <br /> The poor quality of the film without saying the universe ... "Alcoholic Sixteen Years" is not leaving the movie worst title unchallenged, it has to sink and get enough title to save it, but I think that this movie can go far . The IMDb does not have enough words to cite all movie mistakes, and it will be much easier for the website to 'keep alcohol' for sixteen years. Unfortunately, at this time these moments are immersed in the shadows of the misfortune of these films, this is not worth the effort. <br /> <br /> My impressions? I thought what I was going to get into, and I was told I could drink some cups of coffee before I saw this (I would like this suggestion to be Vodka mugs). Despite the small expectations, "sixteen years of alcohol" failed me, even if it was a "bad movie". Not only bad, but it was a bad mistake. Jobson intentionally tried to make this film poetic, but to go into exasperation and poetry was deep down in our throats but it was fun. ... and supposedly Jobson tried to make a good movie? Although I have seen literary promotion "sixteen years of alcohol", I have no difficulty believing in honesty in Jobson. It's both endearing and repulsive to the endless predilection / lies (I'm sure they do not deliberately) spiced the movie, and these little items prevented me from turning off the DVD. So bad is it good? It's not enough. I can not believe that this is one of the most serious moments of the film to 'return myself and avoid anything more. <br /> <br /> Certainly, a bad movie to go for a bad movie. movie savvy Get your comments comments. This improved my experience considerably. It's so bad as Mike Myers commented on the accent of Scottish cod as he is running, to convert this piece of wicker into a commercial comedy "Ok aus me man, pass me annuder gliss dat wiskey."
