I heard about this movie and I know it was not very good. But I was watching the movie (in my movie channel) and I was interested. In today's media, today's morale can be a black satire. The small features of each contestant were good. I would not want to miss something I want. But when the show is called, everything becomes inexpensive, inexpensive. Here is what the writer wanted to add something that would help people to think. But instead he picks it up and supposes that people are mute. <br /> <br /> It's a bad ending 1. I give it up, even if the movie starts to wait.
