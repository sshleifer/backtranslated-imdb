Bela Lugosi is an evil botanist who marries weddings on the day by poisoning the body, robs the body with a fake / budget ambulance and a miniature assistant at home makes the juice of the glands juice eternal forever. Some foreign actors try to solve horrible and horrible mysteries. Bela Lugosi is nice, but you can say she needs money. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely terrifying, and most of the actors are waiting to be attached to the tables, but the plot is very hilarious. Tell everyone what happens and they laugh a lot and ask for the movie. I received the DVD at a discount store for £ 2 for £ 1, and I think the appraisal is fair enough, so anyone who pays for it would not take it into account.
