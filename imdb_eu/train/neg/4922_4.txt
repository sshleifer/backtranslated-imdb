The British DRACULA 2000 is a horror film that was constantly appearing in Sky Movies and considering it all three times a year throughout the year, I do not know how it was for the first time I've been broadcasting for myself. television tonight I'm not really passionate about watching horror movies, I thought it was a trio I thought it was right for me. Most of my theory has been adequate <br /> <br /> !!!!! SPOILERS EXCELLENT !!!!! <br /> <br /> DRACULA 2000 is a bad movie, such as the number of guys involved in the script. For example, the films at the beginning of Drakula's London Americas (which is a two-engine turbo prop plane) are flying the coffin flying (and a double-turbo plane!) And only a bad boy will leave Dracula's life on sale. A fight is blown up, there is not a lot of noise but the worst of the cockpit is not heard until the scripts demand it. In this segment it is also evident that Dracula can control the weather, but this seems to have been forgotten as the film progresses. Inadequate scriptwriters, and there seems to be a problem with the structure of New Orleans Mardi Gras characters. Then the characters are in another location, for example, in the police station, in the following scene. In Mardi Grase this scene means that the plot has improved credibility in the absence <br /> <br /> I have something else in my chain here - Product placement. There are several scenes to watch the logo of the chain of recordings / stores. I do not even venture to publish the company's brand (without saying that they are running a national joke train company in Britain), but I think that this type of advertising was against the British broadcasting guides and I'm surprised that the BBC showed this movie in this case <br /> < br /> In DRACULA 2000 there are some positive images, for example. This is really a good theater, with a good looking cast, and the guys were hot vampires, but it's something we've been expecting from Hollywood in recent years - a really good movie with a very good look
