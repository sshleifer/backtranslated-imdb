Mighty Morphin Power Rangers has been the worst television show ever made. There are no plots, clowns of disguised children, who wear martial arts, dressed in spandex dresses. <br /> <br /> Special effects of the 70s, clothing appears as something. It's a bad comedy and the show is awesome. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about TV is the toys, because our kids only have a secondary plastic rubbish. <br /> <br /> There is a much better show for kids! <br /> <br /> Your children try to give something similar to Nickelodeon, these shows have some intelligence behind them, unlike Power Rangers.
