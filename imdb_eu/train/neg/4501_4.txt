Actually, the setting in Paris is great. Actors are right. The story is a theater of morality. Do you think that someone is getting bad enough, that you're going to hurt others? Depending on your true love, you want less love than a man who has bored with your wife and, therefore, a woman that encourages and reluctantly relinquishes. So what do they look for and if Karen Allen reveals his body? The characters are still self-absorbed and disgraceful. Perhaps the moral of the story "is what you deserve". I give 4, a quick scanning potential only through bit of "male interest".
