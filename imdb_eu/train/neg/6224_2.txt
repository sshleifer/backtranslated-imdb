From before and after Q, I could pick it up: an Irishman wants to make some movies. There is nothing special in any movie. So, one night at a party, he heard some ex-roadies tell him a classic little rock n 'roll; LAX stole the corpse of the Gram Parsons, who renounced his loyal roadies aspiring to Parsons's wishes, just like JoshuaTree. Wow! <br /> <br /> What an excellent idea to make the movie! Rock n 'Roll (well, country), stealing robbery, escape, friendship, 70s! I think that Johnny Knoxville can be derived from "Jackass", for some reason, Knoxville wants to make a "movie." Why he thought he had the next "Snatch" in his hand! <br /> <br /> But the story is not really exciting ... Knoxville needs something to fight against a psychotic girl after her money. ! But Parsons was married at the time. This is O.K., nobody knows that. We could also get Christina Applegate. But the viewers do not like the idea of ​​stealing a corpse. Well, his father will go abroad, but we will eventually grant him permission. But Parsons' father killed himself at the age of ten, namely the paradoxical orphaned and tragic childhood Parsons Mythology. Mythology We're doing a "movie". It is a creative problem that creates this problem. <br /> <br /> An uncomfortable experience for anyone who knows little about the subject. Applegate's presence is double. First of all, the character who invented Beverly Hills is a whore in his time - perhaps the whole movie might be in the hands of the mobile phone, and on the other, what kind of man would Parsons have if he used this kind of harpy? The facts are not distorted or left, but vice versa. In Parsons, they found the illness they wanted in STEPfather, when they were trying to get the body back home, the law would readily split the inheritance of the law. <br /> <br /> And music, oh, I love music. The music is hacked (here's a song's bridge, choirs there), forced on the background and eventually covered with a terribly powerful indie band, Starsailor. My girlfriend asked me an unnecessary question, at the same time, after the movie - was there anybody, writer, producer, director, really a fan of Gram Parson? Well, no. He had never heard with Gram Parsons, but of course, I learned to love blah blah blah, and here are some factoids that we have read. Another guy, Parsons's coolness, said, Keith Richards and others were shocked, and they wrote "Wild Horses" together as mixed as off-the-scenes as the movie. He asked another person: is not it morally questioned when most people only know about history when they know it from that movie? Well, he had a real roadie license (though it was established), and allowed Parsons's goods, and all other people who received payments said they were very good. <br /> <br /> But I really wondered what it was and he asked me, "It's really cool, the great voice of a Parsons geek," the movie was so inexpensive (a million), did they not play Gram Parsons as the original fanbase public? Directors and writers did not seem to have an unexpected image, but reading the Mojo magazine, I believe that the country-rock musicians of the 70s agree. However, I invented British bundles, and they did not care about American cosmic music, or even knew they knew it. This is not a fake, non-veritable Parsons, nor a proper spirit - it's not even suited to the legend. At least, it should be a tender feeling for one of his songs. Many people would like to tell. <br /> <br /> The movies were well received by the bunch of stone blocks in the university, on the slopes, and Johnny Knoxville. But if you're a fan of Parsons, you're just a movie for Jackass fans.
