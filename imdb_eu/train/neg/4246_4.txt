Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, the son who dies (Ron Silver) asks her to stop the unusual movie star Greta Garbo, and she will present two of Estelle's good shows. It can be called "Bancroft Talks" as a result of the transformation of the actresses, this dubious comedic / dramatic / sentimental material with its duration. The cold or cold director Sidney Lumet can not get a consistent pace, and Bancroft's constant abuse is not scaled back by the filmmaker: he maintains right away: pretty, lazy and fast. Estelle makes the scenario a lot of risk (but it is not that much thinned land generates much). Silver and Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks are stars with little help to the star, but they crush each one of the oppressed. * 1/2 ****
