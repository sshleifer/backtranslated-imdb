I can not believe I rent my money to rent this movie. I thought it was a movie and never got any better. The cast, the music that strikes the actors. Amazing. Save your money! I had to read the video, I knew I could drown the lines that speak in the music. I never see the need to continue killing the part or killing the cows and pigs. What has it done with the "real" killer of BTK? I understand why there was no famous actor in this movie. The script would be out of the first reading page. It would be better to see dry paint.
