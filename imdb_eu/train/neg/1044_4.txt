"VÃ­ctor Vargas Lifting" is at the same time N.Y. One of the lightest movie families in the Times Times crossword puzzle. And if you want to go to the kitchen with a taco and crown, you do not need a DVD "Pause". Let them cast them out because you do not need anything that is really important to you. No tricks. It's not really an ethnic movie, about a poor, depressing family that is a Latin. It could be an ethnic group. He has made little difference. For the first time I've seen it a million times. Simply connect a Jewish family, an Italian family, a black family or an Irish family. Accents and names were just different. The Vargas family was named Bush or Clinton and if they were Presbyterian, the movie would be a complete repetition. <br /> <br /> It's funny that critics can not straighten it right here. Some said that it was Spanish in Harlem. Some Bronx and Brooklyn. As a New Yorker, I have a vote in Lower East Side. And it seems that the family was not anywhere else. They lived in a small isolated / isolated spot. Some non-Latino interactions might create an impression, interest or tension. Remember West Side Story? <br /> <br /> Now, because of criticism much criticized. I do not know what my TV was or what it was, but all the interior shots looked very nice to me. All ORANGE ornaments, furniture and faces. What did that mean? And apt he looked pretty like me. Here is someone who mentioned the old apt rooms with very large rooms. Well, 50 years ago. The homeowners can distribute 2 or 3 very small people and they can keep them as immigrants as possible. <br /> <br /> And another annoying thing ... It's been a second family movie that I've seen and criticized for a long time, a teenage "round off." Is this private sex act necessary? Please spare me! What are these directors? <br /> <br /> So, the movie "Victor Vargas" is a little nice. It has been a pleasure to give us a chance for a break from the Latin American actors and their talents. The writers, however, abandoned them by giving them a vague and invisible script. Enjoy the show, but keep your toes next to the "forward" button.
