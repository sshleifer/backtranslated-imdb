Well, first of all, if you are studying the rebellion against Zombies, Living Dead (1968) is written very early in the morning. This is about a "zombie" in a psychological sense, where the term is someone who does not control his will, but must follow the will of another. Here, in the movie "zombies", as small as the movie, largely metaphors dominate the state or authority, as in war. We're very fond of a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The film is set in the First World War. A contingent of "Cambodian French" heard a strange story about the zombie - it was believed that Angkor Wat was built. zombies - and there are zombie army stories that are easy to overcome enemies. Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) thinks he's a priest who knows the secret of secrecy again, but he will not talk. Thus, Louque and an international military contingent went to Angkor Wat to find out the secret of zoning and destroy the information on an archaeological expedition designed to eradicate a zombie by "white race". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The film begins as if looking at the zombie / military metaphor, and maybe even adventure elements, but after 15 minutes it changes gears and transforms it into a story of a love triangle. <br /> <br /> It's stuck in the halperin. subordination with will and power (and Nietzsche's "power" power). The film is an interesting level, but the script and the edition are very confusing. This is another old movie and I would not be surprised if there is a lack of footage, especially when some scenes disappear or crash while a character converses. <br /> <br /> Storytelling story, Halperin. He tries to keep trying about the zombie thread, but little zombie makes sense. Louque knows the secret of zombification, but does not mean the audience. The zombie material mechanics is very blurry and confusing. Halperin also recommends using White Zombie film superimposed films of the 1932 film, Bulu Lugosi's high-profile, but never explains what he's doing. There are huge voices on the floor, including a love story. The characters of the initial bobetas are announced for a long time. A potential criminal is dismissed undeniably before doing so much. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of old movies in the old film B, it could be worth the wait of the zombie riot at least once. Acting is not so bad, and if you have a good imagination, you can think of an interesting story to fill in the gaps. But I saw the movie for the second time, since it was only about five years ago, and I remembered almost anything about it - so it's not so memorable.
