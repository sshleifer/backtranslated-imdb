It's so sad Even if you're filmed with this movie, I'm a bit more bad than the drawings like Blood Lake, there's nothing. This is a fun thing I've ever heard of. I like brother and sister in this movie. They both do not listen to sarcastic when they say they hear sarcastic: "My friends will be so jealous!" Hey, what is the killer wearing at the beginning of the mask? That's delayed! Almost in the second half I missed it. The favorite of this movie is the sound effect that the killer uses when using an ax. The exact sound for all steaks!
