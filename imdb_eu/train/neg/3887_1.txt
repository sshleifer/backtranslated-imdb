I got to watch MST3K, and oh, boys, even with riff, this movie was very bad. Imagine being able to make a camera with a camera that someone can do. <br /> <br /> Highlights (what little there were) came from special effects "OK". Acting most often was "OK" Although nothing special, I have had more quality than other B-Films I've seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is bad, it seems that the camera's work often goes down. The man of the camera skateboard skates and pushed him. The story (if it can be called) is to fill holes, it's almost fun, it never really explains why it survived the first and man's flesh needs to survive. The script is poorly written and the conversation is pure shot. The highest point in the movie (if any) is completely threatening. <br /> <br /> If you can not find the MST3K version, avoid it at all costs.
