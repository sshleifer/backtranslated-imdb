This movie was so appealing that Charlotte Bronto's hope would be to brighten up the original classic story. I was very disappointed that this movie, as it seemed to be fast written or shot, did not make the original novel so powerful. Jane Eyre and Rochester had a great deal of dreadful slot in the screen that seemed to be missing in the script or left on the cutting floor. Likewise, Jane Eyre also lacked the charismatic sense of self. All this underwent his agitation and victory. It was the original Jane Eyre hero. The movie was not a big success, one of the great stories that Jane Thornfield and Rochester escape. To find food and shelter, having to ask for its shame for bread, its frosts were a threat to cold death, they all loved it as a man to escape, in my opinion, they were a powerful part of the story, it was simply out of this movie. The title character was dry and inspired. The story was not very enjoyable and I did not imagine those who did not read the book that this story would be more interesting. Direction and Direction made little commitment to the classic story.
