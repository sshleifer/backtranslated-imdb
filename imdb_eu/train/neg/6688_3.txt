This movie is very awesome, but I have interesting information about it: <br /> <br /> Filmed in 1976 at Flagstaff, AZ at Northern Arizona University, and in Oak Creek Canyon in Sedona (AZ). Most of the movie elements are NAU drama dramatics. That same year I was the first educator, the mining in the theater, but for some reason I did not participate in the production. However, I know some people who can give and make some strange events: <br /> <br /> There is a scene in a movie, in which they have to appear two naked bosses within their ritual lifestyle. in the woods They are seen behind the film for that. The thing is, these are not all actors, but I know two people from the theater department. The identity of "Stunt posteriors" will continue to be anonymous, at least on this webpage, if they do not decide on "um"!
