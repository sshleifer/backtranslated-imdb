Nathan Stoltzfus, one of the historians in the history of Rosenstrasse, was one of the historians who worked in this movie, as it was a great historian in the history of Rosenstrasse, that surprised me about this movie (and not in a good way), considering how most current events changed or discarded. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said that von Trotta said that Goebbels did not want Lena to go to bed, but in that case, why did she say that this happened? Why not show men notice other possible reasons, such as Stalingrad was disaster, or the fear of the Nazis' international press, based in Berlin, about the protests. <br /> <br /> Also. Why was the whole story playing in the second half, the story of a weak family relationship over and over again? Certainly, this can be a huge thing to take away his story! In places, the films were not so common as two lines. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie failed in its purpose, that is to say, to pay attention to an unknown action. Resistance, that is, shame, because it has been better done, can have a great impact.
