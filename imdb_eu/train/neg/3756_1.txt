It's really a bad movie. My friend has rented it, well, it's a fool. Again, I must be stupid, I damn all that I saw! The actors thought they went to places like high school theater musicians. The only place to go will be returned to the waiting tables of Lubys. I did everything I thought I was seeing "jewel". I mean, a "scriptwriter" thought that this premise was fresh, original and won. Then, if some money without money earned more money than money, they would return money with pure thought. The actors were thrown out, the locations were investigated, the make-up was hired by artists, the computer animators were brought up fresh from Al Collins Design Design School and began to take shape. <br /> <br /> Of course there were many. I hated things about this movement, but the only thing I thought was that music was too much. Each Flick has been scored for every minute. There was no music broken. And sometimes he was taller than the conversation, but there was no essential plot or anything lost. <br /> <br /> After finishing, we decided to watch Mystic River. 1980 was like driving the VW Diesel Rabbit to the BMW 740il mode. Regarding quality, you can not get two more contraries.
