<br /> <br /> I have seen recently this cruelty in my film program and I thought it was horrible, as I said under my motto, it was self-indulgent, nonsense, low, and phenomenon. <br /> I think all of the movies and films that I offer. If I want to see a documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, I'll see A & E ... and probably will have more of it. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend the period. <br /> <br />
