There are a lot of problems associated with that movie, a small budget movie project that is filmed in a film school. I have to give credit to his camp. I was laughing throughout the film historially. It was so bad that he was sometimes a comedian, and he turned it into a fun watch. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a low-quality slasher movie looking for a hilarious and psychological horror. , then take out a bottle of crisp, invite some friends and have fun. <br /> <br /> I can say that the sound is very bad. The conversation is followed by a large part of time and it's not just a soundtrack.
