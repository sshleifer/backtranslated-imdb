White Snow, published in Locarno, where I could see it, is about a fairy tale around the world. And coke is also mentioned. In the end, he also plays a real snowfall in the Swiss Alps. <br /> <br /> So, all three aspects of the title will be worked on in this film. There are many drugs for the scene, and there is also a dark hair and dark hair - a prince who needs to go through all his problems to save his principle. <br /> <br /> But it is not: a fairy tale. It is a realistic drama based on Zurich (Switzerland) (according to Tagline). <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is perfect. Unfortunately, a weak plot, planned interviews, realistic landscapes and a mix of plays are not authentic. As a spectator, therefore, I was not touched. <br /> <br /> And then there were alternatives, one after another, when I was crazy: Snow White's high school daughter is rich and damaged. There's never enough love to get from them, because they were busy all the time. On the other hand, her best girlfriend is a loving and caring parent. They (flat steel and housewives) live flat, poor and happy; they do not know their daughter's inappropriate situation. A good man (= prince) is a Swiss French musician (!). It is economically less considered, but emotionally by the country's failure. He has problems with parents. They are migrants from Spain, who do not accept wildlife - until the father becomes a serious illness and admits his son to the admiration of hospital bedding. On: Of course, the drug dealer is brutal, the bankers are heartless, the club owner is a playboy and photographer, even though a woman (!) only considers her career in a picture of the art of pornographic art that reveals Snow White. . <br /> <br /> This review does not need a spoiler to add these plots to the clear plot. I like other Samir films. "Forget about Baghdad," I was quite disappointed. Let's hope next.
