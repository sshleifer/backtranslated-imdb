The plot does not offer new emotions, it also begins with the buckets. There is still no other improvement in the cube machinery, except for a solution, excepting a simple one. The characters are not so elaborate as in the first section, as "a flat" as in a telenobia. <br /> <br /> If someone gets a normal outing, he or she will ask a few questions, "Do you believe in God?", it's not really creative or original, and above all I think it's not. It enters the mystery of the cube into a trap. Actually, there's nothing to say about it.
