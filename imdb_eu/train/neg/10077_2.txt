Well, he did my theater group, lol. So, of course, I remember seeing seeing that I was a little girl, although my favorite music or story, it still has a special place in my heart, which is still fun to watch. I've heard some terrible things about Grease 2, and that's why I never wanted to see it, but my boyfriend said it was not really bad and he agreed to my agreement, so I decided to shoot, but I called and laughed . From the plot the first one was robbed in the first and not really fast, they used only the same character, but with different names and actors. Tell me, how have you followed Pink Ladies and T-Birds for many years after leaving the old gangs? The face of the creator, the face of the enemy of the engine, we must mention, the horrible resemblances of the boys of the first film and these T-Birds were stupid and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Another year Rydell and music and dances have not stopped. When a new student at Sandy's cousin gets into the scene, Stephanie is a rose-maker. But Pink Ladies only sticks the code that sticks to the T-Birds, so the new student decides to train T-Bird to win his heart. So, the motorcycle riot cycle is well dressed and you can easily defeat the evil bikers to easily throw them at T-Bird ends. But has Stephanie told who he or she really or does he know on his own? Well, find out about yourself. <br /> <br /> Grease 2 is similar to a television show that looks like it works. The gang did not make any fat, but, on the other hand, Frenchman came back foolish and disbelieving, because I thought he was a graduate of Rydell, but apparently he did not. The songs were not really hard; I'm glad Michelle has recovered so quickly, but probably because he is the only talented talent in this senseless little series, I would not really recommend this film, if you are curious, but I warned him. You, that is, a pathetic attempt for more money for famous music. <br /> <br /> 2/10
