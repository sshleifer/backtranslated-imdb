Complete the worst film ever made by Biker Movie's genre. This offers a lot of fighting, a large number of blood vessels, fighters of the Indians, and a demolished sham and a popular shack. The operation is awful. What happened to Robert Walker, Jr? Sometimes he was in some of the major productions of the studio, and then he disappeared. This movie really hits, but if you have not seen a biker for a long time, it's good to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel a little trashy after seeing it!
