I tried to restart the movie twice. I put on the three machines to see what was wrong. Was Steven Seagal's voice changed? Was he shot in the studio and the studio has to double the sound with someone who does not look like it? Or was the sound of the DVD? After 10 minutes, you've heard the real voice of the actor. In most films, even the sound recorded in a bathroom was recorded. <br /> <br /> I would be ashamed to give a copy of this movie to Goodwill, if I had a copy. I rent it, but I will never do it. I will check the database before we rent their movies more, all (movies more or less) were good. When you saw the movie Steven Seagal, you usually know what you were doing. I think that's not that anymore.
