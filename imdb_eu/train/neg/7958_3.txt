Protect Linearly Doha; You do not act quickly, and we will not find any breath, just there is no seating moment. <br /> <br /> There is no cross, so do not expect any one either. I would not react to events: the show would be much worse than Wu, save the only grace of the film. And, pretty girl. <br /> <br /> However, the humor is weak and it must overcome the spectacle as a drug campaign, the usual tactical blow (esp esp Zhang scene) we already know things - that is, drugs break families, The heroine throws you up, it is not so easy to lose, you will fall into a crossed cycle. <br /> <br /> I know it's a little bit harder, but I think the show is so far away and that it's a bit patch (* SPOILER ALERT *: for example, when Andy Lauk has been taken to the police station: what? Ribbons since 1997 and you have all the evidence, and that has caught it. Nop, it's not a chase, it's just a jump of the scene, first of all, it slowed down the role under Wu's secret.) I think that creativity is missing, at last Mediacorp Raintree Production is a production production in Singapore production.
