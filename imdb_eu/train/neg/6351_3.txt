Some possible crashes. <br /> <br /> Although there are good activities - especially half of the Chloe Sevigny and Radha Mitchell comedy - this was just a double movie. The links between the comedy section and the tragedy were difficult or sometimes not obvious. This spectator initially confused the two different media; I thought about how to open things, people around Melinda would be the same people, reacting differently ("He said," more premises). However, two stories are very different and two women are completely different, as Radha Mitchell plays both. <br /> <br /> Two playwrights in the initial scene - comedian and tragedy - presumably take the same premise from there, but only two stories are related. They do little to protect the theme of debate, that is, almost nothing can be seen as comedy or tragedy. Nice cast, but depressing movies.
