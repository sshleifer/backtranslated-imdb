This is probably the worst giant killer animal I have ever seen. The work that went wrong was the premise of a typical laboratory experiment, and the giant crocodile that grows rapidly grows grows. The monsters are like a dinosaur that looks like a second-legged tyrannosaur, when it has to look like a crocodile. Everything about this movie is not an original and it's always a "joke", just minutes away. Why are two drunken hunters always drunk after darkness? Also, there is always a relationship between the guy and the love-minded friends who live in a state of threat. I said a lot to myself, as I say, and I feel like I'm writing this time ...
