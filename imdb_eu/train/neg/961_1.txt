Horny, simplistic and short, GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: WOMAN HOW MUCH) MAKES Nothing. <br /> <br /> This short story (roughly sixty minutes) does not inspire classic spaghetti westerns. Sam Raimi's THE QUICK & THE DEAD (Spaghetti Westerns Homage paid) leads to today's surroundings. In QUICK & DEAD, the character of Sharon Stone is revenge by Gene Hackman (when he only had a lightning) when he put his father's fortune (Gary Sinise's short) into his hands. he accidentally shot his head. In GUN CRAZY, Saki seeks revenge against Mr. Tojo (who plays with minimalist appeal by Shingo Tsurumi), when he was only a butterfly, he put his father's fate in his hands; His feet slid behind the clutch and his truck was in love with a beloved father. Despite significant changes, does Tojo exclude Saki? Well, I'm not damaging if you decide to see this, in short, Saki? Clint Eastwood's pale imitation "Man with No Name"? to walk in town? Basically, there is a car store and a bar next to a US military base, so I think it's enough for a country? Tojo, a local sin of low vain price, has never explained or explored the reason. While recognizing Sashari's real confession, Saki takes a stir in the local shoot, rather than the similarity of choreography to Johnny To and John Woo's works. Of course, at the end of the film, Sakie has suffered many tortures in the hands of bad guys, but this time has risen? On the knees, in the end of an unforeseeable end ... and defeats all his enemies with the rocket. <br /> <br /> Do not ask where the rocket got it. Just look. Try not to laugh. <br /> <br /> Image quality is average to get a DVD release. There is a short quality in several sequences, but this is not a bad transfer in general. The sound quality sometimes allows the imagination, but it is not a bad transfer again. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie.
