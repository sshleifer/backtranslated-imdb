Two good things to talk about this movie: the landscape is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (depending on the conversation and the direction in which he worked). However, he said, I found this film very arduous. Seeing dry paint would be more entertaining. It seemed longer than 97 minutes. Starting with the opening sequence, everyone is talking about each other and Paul Reiser repeats everything that was said about the phone, the movie is annoying. The film has clich√©s and whistles, without mentioning the Falk's final audible event. The director also seems to have difficulty deciding whether he wants to laugh or tear. There are some who touch sequences, but we all laugh. If you like Schmaltzy, he's sentimental and "cute", you'll love it. But if you expect something bigger, watch another movie.
