Tierney is a real hard-working man, but the RKO team is usually a bad player. The script, that is, OJ Simpson is as compelling as Ten Cmmandments. Please note that the incredible car of Tierney carries out an occasional and violent consideration periodically. In it, the old topic "the only thing that happens in the movies" is here. Afterwards, the guy who plays the watchman appears from WC Fields, who has spoiled the mood of the process. The static set of single rooms does not help, and the director does not lack Feel feelings of material. Then add the last persecution of the car due to the lack of imagination and payment, and the results are pretty flat. In fact, films are only selected in the domestic scenes of stations that know the powers of the stationary petrol stations that are hard-rocked by musical functions. It was a bad Tieney route that never came. I think that this was largely due to the fact that it was a tough guy on the external screen and one that was penetrating behind another. I am reminded of the cold weather and emotion of light emotion in Lee Marvin. However, this project may work as a radio show, but with a promising black title, it's a disappointment.
