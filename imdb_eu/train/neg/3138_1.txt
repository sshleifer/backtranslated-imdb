I've seen how many people wrote about that movie. It was horrible! The plays were mostly sub-parks. It has made a lot of money, because teens have played 7 theater theaters because of the Leonardo theater. Where did the hell get the money? However, I wanted to learn more about Titanic; why it was damaged, what many people were coming up with; maybe even a little conspiracy. Do you know that some people did not even board the ship, even if they had a fire in the boat before they left? No, you do not see all that is a girl that is a rich woman, who falls for a sick boy and paints her nude (at least, that stupid movie that was at least taken for him). But I cried in a scene. The scene in which the ship was in the boat was shown. It looks like a pool of water! Does this movie make all this money and do not know how to make the ocean waters real. disbelief ... <br /> <br /> Ohhh team played during the sinking of the ship. The worst movie was when Pearl Harbor passed to "Nothing to Do With Reality".
