I'm a writer and scriptwriter Michael Chabon. The novel "Wonder Boys" became a wonderful film by Curtis Hanson. The magical novel "The Kavalier and Clay Adventures" won the Pulitzer Prize a few years ago, and the "Spider Man 2" was a feature-length feature of the best-ever movie comic book of all time. <br /> <br /> Rawson Marshall Thurber has also directed the series of short films "Dodgeball" and "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker". And Peter Saarsgard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari, among other things, have not done so. <br /> <br /> That's it. Literally <br /> <br /> <br /> Jon Foster is Art Bechstein, Nolte, a bachelor's degree in Economics. Jon is in a state of development arrest: he works with the minimum wage earner of Book Barn, a close relationship with the girlfriend / boss Phlox (Suvari), less than a small number of sex, other than plans. Withdrawal in the path with zero passion. <br /> <br /> One night at a party, former roommate Jon (Miller) presents her violinist and stylish. That night, they go out and ask a question that Jon tells him about the catatonic state of existence: "I will tell you I never tell you something that you do not know about a single soul. It is impossible this night." Then Jon tells the story of his life and the town He walks around looking at the faces of strangers, but no one looks at his eyes. "I think death has to happen," he says. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The next day, Cleveland (Saarsgard) catches the fairy boy from work Jon and will soon lead him to an abandoned steel steel. Jon, Cleveland and Jane are performing together for punk rock concerts, drinking drugs and drinking a lot. This does not fit well with Phlox, because Jon promotes a more personal relationship, that is to say, with his new friends and his father. The film tries to make Jon's journeys, his father, Phlox, and his endless work have shaken the ties, which finds freedom and expression, thanks to the relationships between Cleveland and Jane. <br /> <br /> There is a problem in Jon to continue the whole movie: he is very interested. It has no intention, passion or purpose. He walks through life, revealing Jane as an invisible icon he described at night. From the beginning, this is not a problem. But he never gets much interest. It is a completely passive character. She continues with Bohemian Cleveland and Jane, but never knows what she's going to know about, or what she wants. <br /> <br /> So, the movie and its contributors have not gone anywhere and do a little bit of anything, having sex and getting arguments. In other words, anything worst. Here's a cover of a good movie, without anything inside. Extensive cinematography, characters that are far more than voiced, a large number of sex scenes, straight and gay, great arguments, more angry sex, scenes of persecution and tragic death ... but it does not matter. Ironically, at one point, Jane, mixed with Jon's actions, asks: "What's up, Jon? What's this?" Yes, Jon, say. We are also hearing the dying audience. <br /> <br /> The title of "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh" must be mentioned by the same character, that is. They are all facades, single-sided stands for real people. The movie never gets in. We do not know what to mark one of them. We see a lot of things, but we do not know why. And "why" a movie that is missing can be a movie.
