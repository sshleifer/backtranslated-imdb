It's a very boring movie. When you grew up in Vietnam, as it was, you've seen and heard the footage of movies and the arguments here for hundred times. But this movie is a narrative of the boring director of Carlton Sherwood. Most of the films are filmed by Sherwood directly talking to the camera about the conflicting era of our national history. <br /> <br /> If you're old enough to remember Vietnam, then you should win 'find anything here. There is no new evidence for John Kerry or another Vietnamese documentary worthy of it. The younger viewers interested in the topic should watch George Butler's Going Upriver movie! Stolen Honor John Kerry's hatch was a job clearly, but fails to achieve this goal.
