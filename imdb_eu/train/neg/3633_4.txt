In the series, portrayed by ten actors, Philo Vance, Edmund Lowe seemed the most enjoyable, but in this script the audience is faced with the famous detective. In the end, when Douglas Walton's jockey looks at the empty space, he says, he says, he says something that says "I'm going to run and die," I felt muted that nobody would die when anyone was killed. He thought the police were suicide, because he said he had done it. After the death of hostage-maker Gene Lockhart, Frieda Inescort does the same, says he's going to die and jumping from the bus. Lowe finally laughed, "I got it", as if it were a revelation. The guilty party, however, was clearly concealed and when the party began to hypnotise Lowe, a great amount of criminal offense had arisen from the roof.
