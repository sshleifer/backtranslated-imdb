Maiden Voyage is just that. Immediately I would say that I had seen 5 minutes before I could not stand. As stated in another comment, this film does not "fall bad" is falling into every thing, it's bad. The play is awful, the sfx are poor, and the story is innocent and stupid. Likewise, the extracts are sucked "police officers" and, as such, weapons seem to be like sun-guns. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about watching this movie, it does not matter. Your expectations are low, you will still be disappointed.
