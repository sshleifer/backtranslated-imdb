View on the first day on 11/7/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-John Bianco): A nice movie about a family in a Brooklyn-inspired family. He says a lot of four words and likes to kill people. The groups that were here were an effort to show something similar to the gang. This is the only attempt to shoot. The rest of the film was predictable and cheaper. The quality of the photos on scenes with bars and floating articles seems to be a problem with your image with DVD, due to bad contrasts, and some actors sometimes made it hard for bad sounds. The plays featured a number of favorite gangster characters, favorite movies from the likes of Vinnie` Knuckles and Jimmie` Tattoos. So go see a gangster movie better before you make money.
