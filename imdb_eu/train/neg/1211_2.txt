This movie is the only exception to the original scenes of death. On the other hand, this movie is a DUD. Kim Basinger is the housewife who is busy in the midst of the first 30 minutes. No movie added. Then, he takes a bit of a movie, because he has a confrontation with 4 points, he has taken 2 parking lots. They begin to provide support to the local security guard who follows him. From there the movie is worse. I know it's the only movie and you have to go, but it's about 5 minutes. Headstart can not hide or find someone who helps. Instead, it divides half of the one that was built next to a forest. In a typical way, it makes everything easier for its fans to continue. But now it's a tough trick. You get the point Do not buy or rent this movie in any way, just like that. It is so illogical that each scene is challenged. Basinger and Craig Sheffer and the other pieces are shameful, as well as consumers.
