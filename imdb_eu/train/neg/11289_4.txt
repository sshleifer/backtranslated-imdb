Elizabeth Ward Gracen, probably remembering Bill Clinton's "bimbo eruption" (for which he has tablets now!) Is probably the weakest element in this show. The Highlander Series formula is tired. An immortal hero encounters the last time they encountered another immortal, but there are some conflicts, and finally there is a fighting sword that has a cheap sequence with special effects. <br /> <br /> Then you have Nick Wolf's character. Basically, a typical hero of the 90s, with the usual "Sexual Strain" line. (Seriously, why do you think the Hollywood type is that tension between sex is more interesting than sex?) This was a joint Canadian / French production; So half of the series is imitating Vancouver in New York, and the other half is in Paris ... just like Highlander.
