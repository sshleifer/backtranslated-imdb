The salvation of Larry Miller was a small part. It seems that the movie was so hard that it was called "Mary About", but I did not like the movie and it was still short of these standards. The actor Paul has been very good, but Selma Blair is stuck with the stupidity of his character Asimo Kruela. James Brolin was great, but Paul's father seemed tough for Lanaldon's National Holiday Randy Quaid character.
