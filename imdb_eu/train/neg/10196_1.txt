As a poker enthusiast, I wanted to see this movie - especially with Scotty Nyugen. <br /> <br /> Basically, Scotty Nyugens is a place in shorts. > <br /> The characters are unlikely and annoying; The soundtrack is horrible and on the plot, well, there is not one. <br /> <br /> I got my head honestly and I got dizzy when I saw the DVD box with the bar code twenty minutes later. In fact, Nyugen means that this movie was in the background, otherwise I would not waste â‚¬ 16 if you buy Ebay. <br /> <br /> Take me - DO NOT COME 7 2 as an imbalance !!! Dire. :(
