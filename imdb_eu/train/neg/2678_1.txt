Nothing positive said. Nonsense imbalance, amazed and astonished by a "message". The new (post-Soviet) films in Russia may be very good (Kukuk), although many have cartoon and donkey flavor (Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example). This is a "sweet" type. The play would be horrible, sometimes, in the face of a totally unpleasant and repulsive direction that detracts from the impossibility of the actress so horrible. Is it possible to make a special award possible for all cameras (if Blair Witch realizes that he's been hungry for a 15-second hunger?) And the attention deficit CounterStrike and masturbation is aimed at minors. Women's lead seams often try to attract and men's anti-hero words need a coach (although genetics are not bad: expressive eyes). An irrelevant (middle) non-art stack. Anyone who reviews this will be the "auteurs" cousin (far).
