As a Hammer completist, I was afraid to see the movie and, next, Holiday on the Buses. I watched the One the Buses movie and I thought of one of the worst movie ever I've ever seen. At the beginning of the 70s, it was full of amazing comedies full of British television screens. <br /> <br /> I have a shame I really laughed at the parts of this movie. I do not know why I now knew the characters and I enjoyed them in some situations, knowing how to react. I found Blakey especially funny, but I did not swear I had a trilogy saying "Butler get you." <br /> <br /> There were jokes that were seen on bus trips. Thoughtful of three films and Dick Barton 's first Hammer trilogy, the second best movie, which is probably the only way to compare it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < They will have the chance and Hammer completists like me. I would say that all of the accessories is not a bad movie and, of course, I can think of Hammer's worst comedy.
