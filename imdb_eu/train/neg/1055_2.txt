* Spoiler alert * <br /> <br /> First, I valued this movie from 10th to 10th. <br /> <br /> It's a good idea, but there are too many foolish movie mistakes, except for the psychic drama. First and foremost, it never fight alone. After a very strange uncertainty about her mother (when she proves her mother and later in her fairy), she is not a victim of rape. <br /> <br /> It's compelling also that naive always falls into the strange traps of Crew. <br /> <br /> His friends are very credible. <br /> <br /> The most mysterious thing I find is that Ethan does not control the crew when they change their minds. Ethan is the leader of the crew (hey, they even say) and people seem to be guilty of another man, but when Ethan changes his mind, he does not even convince a single Crew person. That's correct and his old friend is wrong. Everyone just hates him ... why? The movie does not give an explanation. How to become the leader ever? <br /> <br /> It's a funny thing when my girlfriend was watching Beverly Hills on entering. Two television series were two actors ... cheap way. to get audiences?
