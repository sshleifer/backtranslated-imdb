I gave it to 2 as Natassia Malthek (like Quintana vampiress) because she looks sexy sexy sooooo in the movie. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there is little logic in this film, but most of the science fiction vampires. Lightweight The movie surely tried to get away from the usual vampire stories. Unfortunately, he went too far and the whole story was reasonable, but he set a ridiculous sound. <br /> <br /> Excessive indication and body-wide scene are not too much. Vampire is a great movie because it does not have to see a lot of blood - we all know when a vampire will do it. There are some clues or screams to describe the scene (eventually Quintana, when trying to try sex with Rosa, everything is needed, the rest is your imagination). However, it's just my personal taste.
