My God This movie is a thriller that I think is an absolute joke for me. It seems like a 5-year-old wrote. Plots, playmaking and even the props and shootings of this movie were also unhappy. <br /> <br /> I am not usually any critical movie because every person has their own style. But this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen in 2008. I really can believe that this movie is unknown, and I think it should follow that way, such as movies that are making thriller genres a joke. <br /> <br /> I recommend that anyone who plays Thriller or even movies is far away.
