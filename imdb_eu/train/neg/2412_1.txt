This movie has no budget, without effort, talented movies have not been filmed and a cover film has been rolled out to undo the video game store. <br /> <br /> What you want to know is to watch this movie, take some cameras and red foods, and shoot yourself and your friends around the neighborhood, night girl and "attack." Congratulations, you've made "Living Dead of the Hood!" See if you are going to buy a distribution company. <br /> <br /> I have seen some bass budgets, filmmakers and actors' talents, or at least made some efforts. . Avoid being a real masochist or have a bad movie of horror fun.
