An obsolete movie, horrible conversation, horrible clich√©s and mawkish and very bad construction. In addition, they constantly exceed Cassavetes and Falk. Pseudo "good movie". It takes little time to find out how this disgusting intellectual turkey is. The first scene is completely boring, full of sadness and histrionism. The sound is horrible. The camera movements are unimaginable, as well as the construction of characters. There is no poetry, subtle psychology, or interesting shots. The actors are constantly infected and we will see beer beverages ads. Very cheap, indeed. (only one exception: Ned Beattt's easy and pleasant way to play a man).
