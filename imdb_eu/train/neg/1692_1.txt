Okay, if you saw the Ring, you saw The Grudge basically. He's trying to be terrifying when he has a camera that looks strange and sound, but it does not work. When Earth calls it, it is weak and has a lot of holes, for example, how would you know that Yoko did not work because those who lived in the house did not work? And it is not clear what Bill Pullman's nature has had to do. As it went out of the way to move forward on the ground. He had no sense of what happened with the original family. Who was hanging in the room, boy or father? And was Yoko alive dead? There were no unanswered questions and I was too much bored to think more.
