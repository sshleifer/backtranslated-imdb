Do not miss this time in this movie. It could have been good, but it was one of those I never saw. I must seriously ask that people who perform this film look at it in the last scene and think: "Yes! Now it's over!" and patted himself in the back. For me it seemed to me that ideas came to an end. The last scenes were built to make a cool tour but, instead, the entire construction was left to fall. When the final black shot disappeared and I heard credit history at the beginning of the incident. I could not believe what I see and someone could even call that end. With this film, the best thing anyone can do is rewrite and end a substance. Actually, I would really like to bring anyone closer to that room, look at your face and say - WTF ?? !!!!
