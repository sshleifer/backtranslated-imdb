Brief summary: this movie slows down all those that touch it. That means. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First, let me tell you I'm not a purist, and that may be a few minutes funny. Scams are not bad. But overall, it's very sad and it's not fun. Repeat jokes are repeated. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film only exists in the last few dollars from Laurel and Hardy trademarks. Producers can not have anywhere in cinema in their history or their talent. This is what I liked the most. <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter liked it, so I also failed as a parent;)
