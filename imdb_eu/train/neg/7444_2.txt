Unlike Russians or wild boars, the movie is a snorefest. Actually, I was sleeping for about 40 minutes and I had to fight alone. I wanted it. Saturday the ruins of a wonderful afternoon. <br /> <br /> Although the "Silent Hill" was terrifying. Fish even though "Pan's Labyrinth" was scarier. I still do not tell why this flick was terrifying. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, I'm very far from movies that use "pidgin russian" movies on initial credits. I think it's a shame I've been from a Russian group of my friends. Oh my god. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Fortunately, for me (and probably you too) the movie has escaped already in my brain and I just came out for an hour. So, I do not have any details, the dreadful images that are not anywhere, and the dark hopes that would be expected to die. <br /> <br /> Maybe I've seen a totally mutilated version of this movie because it can not believe it. We have gotten a lot of comments here (that's why I saw it), and so I ended up not only the horror or the recovery but also the overall value of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I gave it to 2, yes, I wanted to sleep and I left after 40 minutes, but I woke up and I did not leave.
