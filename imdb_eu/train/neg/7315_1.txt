Let us agree. The news is about five degrees from the university (above the word F) when you leave a weekend campsite trip. They find someone who needs help, but they decide to go to the fire instead of trying to help him. Beautiful people. Then, some of them start getting ill - they have to stay at home where they are. However, neighbors seem good. Well, when things get really bad, they block an assistant to get help (side by side try a neighbor). Some people do not like it. The race continues at a great speed in the woods, for many kilometers, until the truck is broken. However, ten minutes later he appeared in the cabin (how he could find it and how to get there at the speed of light) is a mystery. A type of surgeon in the cab realizes that something else is wrong, it overwhelms it in a cave to overcome that blow. He decides to return the cabin the next day, believing that he must have a type of shrine. She thinks she survived (she thought it was a 24-hour mistake). Unfortunately the police are not so pleased. The other couple decides to have a sex, because the flesh that is eating is making magic and women realize they need to get their legs (it takes a lot of sore cream). However, you get the idea. There's no point here. I would not have been friends with five people. I promoted meat for bacteria. Other characters were also very entertaining, but they were also very difficult. We've lost ninety minutes of good life.
