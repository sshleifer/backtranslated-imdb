Guy de Maupassant was a writer for a novel about a poor man, without any moral quality. Only people, political men, employers, journalists and women who wanted to be successful were women in a corrupt society. The only king is money. Charles Forestier, the hero of the Maupassant, climbs up the scale of society for seductive poses. He is in love with all the women who could carry on raising his society. At the end of the novel, he married the newspaper's greatest daughter, the daily newspaper, "La Madeleine." It's "Le Tout Paris". He is lucky and more, he becomes a member of the Parliament and then a minister. The "useless" women are out of their own perspective, but there are always beautiful and useful women in contact. BEL MINI's private relationship is a story of "MORALITY". It's all, but not a story in the Maupassant idea. Why did they put them in the "BEL AMI" title?
