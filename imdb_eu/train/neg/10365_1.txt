Scary. This thriller should be buried. What's wrong Awesome writing, less than unbelievable characters. Great Schlock! Paste some B stars to try a few credit crunch on a POS, but fails. If I did not have to write ten lines on this movie, I would review the word, it starts with "sh" and ends with "it". <br /> <br /> Endless, delayed. Who wrote it rough It is as drawn as the end of this film, it is weak with no idea whatsoever with the line of this story or without money. Probably because of the number of cameos in this movie. It's a good thing to get out these actors, because this would be a killer. The good thing will hardly be seen by anybody. No one is at least as important as future investors. It could end up in a thousand different ways, but I still feel sorry for my precious times. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about it, you will feel like you will never get it. back
