I found this movie with an OOP dealer. And surely this is OOP. The Exorcist has returned with this film a year ago, but we all know that Blair's career had never been turned, he never became a mega star. That's why many of his films are OOP. Good performance in this film. He refuses to acknowledge his parents and does not have any friends. At the age of 15, a 14-year-old girl, is fun. The film also rains due to the show show. An experience is full of rebuilding. It is cut in most of the edits, why, I do not know, there is no blood, ok, Blair is naked, but nothing shows, T & A is not so popular. But the movie is slow, very slow. I am not very happy for myself, but I have almost slept. For 14 years he became a rebel against society, but no blood, nothing is done. That's why it's still a strange thing to fear for me. If you're a Blair fan, buy it out there.
