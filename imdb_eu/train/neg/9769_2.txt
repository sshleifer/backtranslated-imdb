Thornton Wilder I read this play last year. I also had to sit down using this weak screen translation. Let me tell you, it's not an excellent game, it's easy to beat, but the man is much better. There was a lack of performance, and God's landscape looked like it had been designed by a group of three-year-old cartoonists. If it were not worse, the sound quality is bad ... the actor speaks every time the actor speaks ... and I could not even notice that chemistry between George and Emily does not exist. In which the actors are very uncomfortable. No music It is in black and white, but it will be welcome, but that's why it will be more palatable. In any case, I think that if you want to see this movie I do not recommend, you will not direct it to high expectations. The play, as strong as it is, is probably better.
