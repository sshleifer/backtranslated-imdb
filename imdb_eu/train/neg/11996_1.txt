I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. Particularly because Juhi Chawla is an excellent actor. <br /> <br /> This film has six stories. It's a new Hollywood concept. So it's not a new item. <br /> <br /> 1. Khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. He wants to become a celebrity and adds a boyfriend to news of news journalists interested in him. But then Rahul (Salman Khan) appears and says he is his boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Priyanka Chopra is not yet a good actress. When he gets upset, I'm angry. Salman Khan can not play comic roles. But it's wonderful in its serious parts. <br /> <br /> 2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla). She gets a medieval crisis and attracts younger women, without forgetting what she really has. his wife and children. Anil Kapoor's actress is a native of Juhi. They are great But this story is about consolidating them. <br /> <br /> 3. Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) will marry Gia (Ayesha Takia), but she gets cold feet and throws a wedding. 4. Ashutosh (Joh Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). It gets an accident and loses memory. He does not know that he loves her husband anymore. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) is a taxi driver. Stephanirena (Shannon Esrechowitz) knows that she is a white woman who is in love with a Indian man, but she is married to an Indian woman. Rajuek has to bring him Staphani, but he falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> I have never liked Govinder's films. It's very annoying, it's not funny. But this movie really liked me, as it was growing in recent years. <br /> <br /> 6. Oh yes! Sohail Khan is there! Ram Dayal Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar) is married. He wants to get serious action with him, but every time he joins his family. Sohail Khan is not a beautiful actress, but it's fun! I like her movies. <br /> <br /> Now, the problem is. All these stories are not interesting. Storytelling from six interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting! Here and there the stories are intertwined, but it is not a significant character. <br /> <br /> My conclusion; Priyanka can not play! Release the woman in the Bollywood industry. Sohail Khan had to make more films, he was a little role for him. Salman Khan can not make comic roles, but real serious films. It's written as an actor. This movie is sucked and missed like good actors and actors, such as Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> You have the ability to make a movie with Amitabhek. Bachchan, and let him sing the invalid.
