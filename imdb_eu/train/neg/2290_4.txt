The ultimate goal of the Great Brother is to know what is to be considered. Is it a miracle or kind of joke when people make their own jacket straight from the head, become distorted and monstrous? Movies, unknown art are not compromised, but neglected effects, dull life. <br /> <br /> "Notorio Bettie Page" is a soft historical case suitable for college-level feminism in new students. His lesson is schematic, rectangular and linear: "See how women are objecting, exploiting, abuse and then throwing them into the trash for a society dominated by men." <br /> <br /> Bettie Page, presumably, was the "Queen queen pin" of the 1950s, to kill millions of men. (All reviewers repeat this phrase, "1950s pin-up queen"), as a monkey song). His story is known as the American sex bomb bomb: Southern, mischievously abused by his father, and so on. Naif knows innocent selfish interests and shameless profits. Although he believes in Jesus, he enjoys the nakedness of the camera lens; Just the girls-next slaves are just sex-slaves Americans fantasize. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron's writing director's mouth. Oxford education and ex-punker (as I do in the combination of smell privilege and "hipness" as I do?): "I do not think of feminism, I would not do it ... I do not do feminist films I do not do anything. Also, I think women make better movies. " What a pleasant atmosphere <br /> <br /> The film only makes the movements of the story of human life a reality, prior to hearing from the subject and the purpose before the movie is started. Mrs. Page has a boyfriend, but nothing is shown about their relationship. In fact, there is no intimate or specific relationship in the film. <br /> <br /> You can not forget its simplicity. New York, where not Page. A man strives to adjust and rest his world, which strives in the black strings that strives in New York, and the black body of S & M, is black and white. But in Miami, where he runs away completely, he removes clothes, and a "liberated" woman takes pictures and turns the movie into color. "Making feminist films" is not "ideology". The ideology has been so penetrated, so admitted, so programmed, almost invisible. Great Brother must smile.
