... but the problem of this production is far from good music. <br /> <br /> Make sure you can not always expect amazing masters like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; However, the music of this piece, Andrew Lloyd Webber, also looks extravagant. It's lethal and coarse (with one or two exceptions) and when I saw it, I could not remember a single significant melody, that is, a tragic someone who learned from three hundred pages from three students. <br /> Theatrical is also curious. It occurs dramatically at the scene (it really needs to be aligned to start the 50 rows of the previous row to the right or 100 to the left to break the neck) and do nothing. When a person is supposed to sing on stage, this is just what you get and all other stages are empty. Being a theater director was almost pain to me. <br /> <br /> Actually, Cole Porter seems to have caught the French culture better in his works than any of these talents can be closer than ever. And I'm surprised by the popularity of this mythological music.
