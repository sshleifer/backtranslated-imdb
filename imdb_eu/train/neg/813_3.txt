In my opinion, it's a dog that takes Zues DUTCH commands. But German speaks to him. The two languishes are completely different, saying "he is well acquiring French commands" and saying they speak Spanish. <br /> <br /> Acting comedy actor James Belushi is not at least a feeling of detective. Only roles fit to comedy comics. <br /> <br /> Various stereotypes / predictable things. Typical comments or revelations. <br /> <br /> If you do not see things, I think the movie might be nice to watch on TV. But I did not recommend renting.
