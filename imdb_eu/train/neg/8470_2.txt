I watch a lot of horrifying films (or try at least) and this one must have been when I was not in a second, bad movie. I never knew the depth of the massacre until I rented this piece of stuffed coated on lead lead counter. I'm Julian Sans, but I'm worse than I expected. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the story was promising and I was very interested ... in the first half and a half. They dropped the credits and I still saw what the pain looked like first hand. Perhaps, some viewers seem to enjoy it and can point it in the right direction, but they know again the viewers who do not remember me, especially when we had to turn off the video, and that's just it. with our observation (of course, we had to make an exception). <br /> <br /> If you were looking for a remake, I would give it an option, as long as 1% of the original is added. That's all.
