Films incredibly terrible, pretentious, endless. The director Bellocchio seems to be the most beautiful and fascinating face of Detmers. And who can blame? Perhaps, perhaps, he would simply focus his attention a bit more on making an interesting and good movie. I hate to make a sex film "as an art film" "respectable". Often, hot sex scenes are the sole reason for the existence of this movie. Whether it's deserving to be seated in the rest of the picture is not a sharp taste. (*)
