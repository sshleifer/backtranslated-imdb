Without a doubt, Frank Sinatra was a talented actress and talented singer. After all, nowadays, very few actors have only achieved a scene, and the Sinatra modus operandi was quite a bit like that. <br /> <br /> Like the 1960s, I felt the quality of the man. The movies really started the tank. Tony Rome's detective series at the same time decided to compete with Dean Martin's Matt Helm series. Maybe a James Bond contest, but nothing has really worked during these Frank years. In his personal life, shameless, his music disappears ... Sinatra saw a reversal in the 1950s. The great Sinatra film of that time was Von Ryan's Express in 1965.
