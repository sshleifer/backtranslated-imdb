I confess - Emma, ​​in my opinion, is the biggest novel ever written. It's as close as perfection as it can be any other kind of mortal creature. Jane Austen's peak of art has come here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a palimpsest, at least. <br /> <br /> The comparison of Gwyneth Paltrow is inevitable - this version is much more. to the mind of the book, and to see it quite agreeable. <br /> <br /> There are a few good things here - Kate Berkinsale (previously, Flora Poste played in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly intelligent from the spiritual twin of Emma) Emma is wonderful. Raymond Coulthard makes Frank Churchill a good decor. The production is beautiful, but the interiors are too dark. <br /> <br /> However, there are many problems. The first is Mark Strong. First of all, it's not correct for Mr. Knightley. This is perhaps because he acts as a Victorian zealous assistant. Badly written <br /> <br /> The second problem is length. Simply the movie is too short: it should be twice as long to get a good feeling. <br /> <br /> Finally, and most prominently, there is the quality of adaptation. Austen is the dream of adapters - all the conversation is already there. Once pruned and properly arranged. Andrew Davies thinks otherwise. First of all, this movie is quite dark and the last thing that must be Emma is dark. More importantly, Davies feels fit for the end of the day as a holiday party. What is this planet or Thomas Hardy's little work? The style and spirit of the novel is totally out of date. And I think it's wonderful to try to make improvements - perfection. <br /> <br /> Check out the Paltrow version, or see Kate Cold Comfort Farm.
