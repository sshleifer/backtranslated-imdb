This movie is weak, the kutxa cover tells the toughest team in the East LA, and it's really Santa Ana, James Cahill plays as a queen from the closet, who puts on hard-hitting hard Chlo groups. It's fake, boring, nonsense, and bad. I tried to get the money back in the video store. The video box was also at a distant homo-erotic point. James Cahill had to do Gay Porno. James is in every scene, he can not save his life. This film has a hot Eva Longoria, but James can not score it with him !!!!!!!!! Sometimes, I felt I was watching Gay Porn and they turned me off the whole movie. James clearly wants to be with the men, and then overwhelms them with their gay desires and makes them become members of the gang again and again. Its martial arts skills are at least minimal. The gang members of the real members would take on their weak capabilities and rip them one.
