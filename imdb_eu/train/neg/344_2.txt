Are you sure about this movie? I do not see the movie because of the drawing, it's about seeing bad scenes. That said, this movie is a horrible goddess, seeing a godly body by Traci Tris (Mandy Schaffer) and seeing my joy as a result of a catastrophe in front of my eyes. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert The first scene of the movie is already kringing me ... you see a woman painting something next to the lake, fortunately and calmly, then a beautiful girl approaches and can ask her to paint next to her. At the end of the two, they saw each other what they did ... and the woman painted a VINYARD in front of the LAGO DEVELOPMENT. What kind of director would this be? And in another scene, Traci gets to kill his teacher's lover, swims with his stomach and then swims, and one of the local police has never suspected. HELLOOOOO I mean? MANDY DOES NOT HAVE PREVIOUS BEFORE? THE HERO REFUSED TO ENJOY THE ENCOURAGEMENT! Then he gets the worst, every time around Mandy, he plays the sound effect "cold", for a sound that is as glittering as a cat. Rosanna Arquette is a real blame in this movie. I really do not have to be a star in this low-budget soft-porn star. JÃ¼rgen Prochnow also has the same, sadly afraid of this film. With all, 2/10.
