The peculiar film slasher of the producer Charles Band. In the biggest hit of Full Moon, the band never said "true killer films", because little puppets and big monster added a fantastic item because they kill people because it's so real and fun. Pleasant Philosophy and True Shame When Bandas destroyed the full moon studio through the wrong business relationships, home cinema profits were so desperate, Blockbuster likes it, and so it began to sacrifice creativity and originality. This group has also worked on 'Delta Delta Die'! and 'Birth Rite' - both equally bland by Moon Full standards. Debbie Rochon is a regular form here, a group of dudes and dudettes who decide to decide a story about a killer club. He, as is known, can join in because he feels that it is a panic because it was not a real story, and Mrs. Rochon believes that now everyone can cover the blood and perhaps kill others or maybe they die. no The choice is not yours and yours ... it is not recommended, but not very bad.
