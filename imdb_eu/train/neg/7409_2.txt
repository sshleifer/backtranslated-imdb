There are some elements that save this movie from being a disaster, but they play bad performances, line holes, deus ex machina, stupid conversations, poor scripts and clown forecasts ... <br /> <br /> Here we are a horror movie with a story that is never-ending. First of all, a group of heroes with black stars (although this topic still seems to be alive in Finland) seems to be trying to get out of a mysterious hospital. There are huge ghosts (imagination), zombies (at one point I thought they did not use zombies, but they came), and the Finnish glam-rock band was made up with demonic makeup. They are also some time-stretch doodles, but it's not a story. Autistic and hobby girls have a deeper understanding of a situation, but they never spell it to the viewer or their confused friends. Their lines are made up of deep-rooted thoughts: "What will happen ..." or "Light can not live in darkness ..." or disturbing "I need a red zipper ... red." Therefore, all the characters (worried father and sweet medicine) are mistaken with dark ground and demons. Occasionally a group of ghost or zombies will appear, and if a devil's keyboard can not see a group that sends six people, they would appear to be flashing and talking, just pretending. And it seems that this demon can not overcome the walls, but opening the door of the lift is beyond its powers. <br /> <br /> In the end, we get a "sequence of a dream" feature. Or maybe it was not. Oh, boy, I want to be this movie, and it seems that the type of time it's moving faster, so it's just 10 minutes ...
