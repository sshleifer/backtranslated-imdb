If you want to call on the attack before ... <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie to see people really 1/10. From where we start, we will start from the beginning ... <br /> <br /> REVELATION: Do not believe in the premise - the movie does not have to do with abandoned cars and understand what happens to the mysteries of people. there are It's a drama that is basic, the intensity of going to the cabin, or "effortlessly." On the screen: I usually give independent screenwriters when you're doing hard work ... but this is crap. The story is flat, full of emotion that leaves the whole movie. The interview is very weak and predictable. "Woah, I am terrified" and "I asked him uh ... if you want ... uh, would I come with me in the cabin?". I want to rip my hair at the same time to feed my head and myself. <br /> <br /> <br /> FEATURES: HOLY MOMENT! Some have described flat characters, I want to take one more step and I can say that they have an inverse character arc. They start working in a parallel universe and they begin to almost go back ... <br /> <br /> ACTORS: Actors are worse than characters. They take bad-guy characters and act as a high school drama. "Woah you total Freaked me out" said so monotonous and slow - as he dumbed down. At this time I only complained the actors. <br /> <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL: LIGHTING: at the age of eight, this movie was disappointed with the lighting. It is also very dark in its surroundings, and in others it is also whitewashed. The director would not use emotion until he learned to stack the basic scene as emotion. Steps for kids! SOUND: How many sounds do boys really need to make a good movie? 9. With so many boys, the sound will be amazing, but the opposite has happened. There's a scene especially, really, these cars are driving in a car and the sound of the car varies with all the cameras ... WEAK! CAMERA: Learn how to use it. <br /> <br /> However, I'm talking about a space complaint ..... I rent it - I dare ... Rent and learn ... Give 1 rating ... it's worth it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Turn off ... Amanda Christmas
