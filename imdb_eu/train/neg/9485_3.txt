As others have had trouble making a plot summary, I'd like to mention a few points on this movie. There are disasters here; I do not like to filter. <br /> <br /> - Given the small budget of the movie, the creature design was pretty good. It's really nice to see that a live video and horror movie is not crazy with CGI. Unfortunately, the quality of digital movies is very high in places, and the white hall of the asylum is remarkable. <br /> <br /> - The ordinary lighting designates parts of this film, the passage of time. I understand that the director tried to simulate dementia, but to achieve this, a consistent flow of time was required. As it is said, it's just the look of the amateur. <br /> <br /> - Plot twists were plentiful, but they could be forever planned. I did not even question the worshipers' identity, nor any kind of lame bad mumble rumors that would be well developed. <br /> <br /> - This seems to be disadvantages, but the characters in this movie reliably fail in any sense. First of all, the regulatory commission would be a mental health center that was unilaterally designated as the death caused by heart-arrest by deaths of all patients and workers. Why would psychiatrist be able to perform autopsy? Why was not this great title or the entry of this strange religious option? What is the background? What would we think of to care about anyone? And more importantly, the place where he or she wanted to get access to the place, seeing that they saw everything so scary that it was still a good place to get a good home. This movie is not enough to respect the characters to give their minds the benefit of doubt. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: View The Wicker Man instead.
