Oh, this is so bad, it's fun. The only way to explain something like that was to get a fun movie that decided to make a pornographic movie. I mean: you will see a topless actress porn, having sex, and then killing human mutants. There is a lot of gore, including classics, "something is wrong with him, oh no, he was the half person" and an unexpected murder caused by terror. But you can find funny things like the intestines during someone's ass and a man running in the woods, who finds himself clipped by a wire tied between two trees (that's why, as cartoons). In any case, there is a market for people who overlook porn, they really need to know inside an actor, they just do not have enough genitals. That is why, the autopsy will see many summaries on the dead bimbos. No conversations Jenna and Chasey have small portions and I wonder what Richard Grieco wanted to accept here. I think that this film looks forward to seeing a button that is a movie that is to be seen, as well as reminding us of the film C movie of the old movie film.
