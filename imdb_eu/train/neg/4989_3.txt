Les Visiteurs, the first movie about medieval travelers, was very entertaining. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but it was more. An unexpected turnaround, funny situations and, of course, nonsense, that is to say, a little over Louis de Funes. <br /> <br /> Now this sequel has the same characters, at the same time, the same actors and the same. traveling in time The plot changes somewhat, since the characters are time-honored travelers. So they go up and down in history, as they continue to be absurd while you're on the road. Jean Reno tries to keep the whole thing together with his play, but his character has been emptied so that he can not do much to save the movie. The Duke's slave / wizard, he really has a great deal of attention. The film is about him and his clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever he supposes. The thing is; This character laughs at the audience, but it does not succeed. It's like someone told you a really bad joke, you already know, but he stressed telling that joke at the end, adding details and making your suffering a bit longer. <br /> <br /> If you liked Les Visiteurs, do not let your taste in your mouth ruin it. If you do not like Les Visiteurs, you'll never even think about it. If you liked this sequence ... well, I think you still have to watch a lot of movies.
