Well, here's another B B film industry. It's sad enough to see some misguided films, but I do not care about the movie industry B or C industry. Show effort in your work. The characters are very bad. This operation is not questioned (surprise), but the line is. How can a narrow group be witnessed by two military commanders who have been witnesses and then proceed as if something happened. What was wrong with the writer was telling the other members about the scene where the doctor's ass was as good about the scene. Give me a break.
