So, 'Thinner' ... Yep ... Steven Bachman (read Steven King) had just lost a man about a man who had family desserts. The story is definitely, but I do not know why I did not enjoy it. I really think what the actors distracted me. I mean, who is the lead? Robert John Burke? Who is? And crying crying, could not someone please hire Mantegna in all the tasks of the Italian Mafia? And while we were all, all the Mafi should have pasta Italian cuisine? The good action here is less than 10 kilograms, the oldest Michael Constantine gypsy. It's enough But the rest, I make "better actors ..."
