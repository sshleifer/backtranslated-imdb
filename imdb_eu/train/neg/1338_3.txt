I've seen the switching goals ... two ... and always the same feeling ... you see Olsen twins playing the same movie ... they like playing different sports, then the boys fall in love ... then the movie. ... first and foremost, young girls and boys do not play so much ... In soccer 2 is not considered playing ... 3. When the game is over, the referee provides extra hours. one minute or more) ... and the finish is so planned ... As I do not know about this movie, I think this movie is bad ... if the European producer is doing it, it would be better ... Direct actors are not the best options ... When they are really missing ... they play at home all the time, but that does not have big stars ... you have to show your talent. ... and that's what Olsen's twins are missing
