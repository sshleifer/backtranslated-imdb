The film is very weak, especially because it is a bad story, but also the poor in the case of Robert Downey Jr, and the irrational behavior of many characters. If you are a fan of thinking about yourself and feeling creativity or acting criteria, you might like this movie. Personally I have not done this drama, which seems to me very little. <br /> <br /> I am particularly annoyed when the main character is supposed to be a smart person. stupid In this movie, if the characters would act normally in those situations, they would not have any movies. <br /> <br /> First, a very difficult action is a successful Magruder lawyer. , By Kenneth Branagh, leaving a party and a girl Mallory Doss, who has played by Embeth Davidtz, is shouting for the car. They came on a tropical storm, because they promised to admit their career at home. <br /> <br /> She tells her strange father in a strange sect and crazy things. In the worst part of the country, when their hut arrives calmly, they notice that the cars are on a road. Light houses are also blown up and some household items have been broken. <br /> <br /> The things are very strange, it's strange (it looks like a walker, breaks in front of it, it's completely naked? yeah!). Similarly, the father is strange, the house is sinking - everything must be told to Magrudere: "that's it, it's very strange for me, I'm not here!" But not Magruder, he slept with him, and then, stating his story and sex motivated, he tries to commit himself, he screams. <br /> <br /> Then be at the top. -Light's a lawyer, late arriving at his office wearing the same shirt that he had the same night (In fact, all in the office's office release) is surely a successful lawyer would play as one of the 16. Magruder has some cases wrong in some police cases; Therefore, he warns the police that his father proves to be afraid of them, the police do not leave. absolutely - not likely! <br /> <br /> It is very difficult.
