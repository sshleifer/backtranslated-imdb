CQ can be good, campy fun. But he does only one unforgivable sin: he is b-o-r-i-n-g! The rhythm is slowly slow and the plot is quite confusing and is so artificial that it is impossible to care for what it is. The story would be acceptable in the creative class, written in the eighth grader, but this video should contain a warning label: "WARNING: Student movie, only to watch the filmmaker's relatives".
