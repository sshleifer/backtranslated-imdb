Looks like an interesting fear / science fiction. F / X is pretty good ... to get what you see. A television thriller, which is not the worst thing. Jeffrey Coombs mixes with scientist cell research and manipula DNA manipulation by a marble shark. The terrible results create a machine that dies. A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited on a remote island to see an excellent new experiment. Of course, after laughter and fear ... The creation of Coombs, by the way, leaves his children confused with a hammerhead, freed them to capture their father's colleagues one by one. Revenge is not always rewarding. Also in a cast: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
