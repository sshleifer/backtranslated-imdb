This movie is a wonderful and unforgettable Sean Connery vehicle. The performances are generally Capshaw, Fishburne and Ed Harris. Connery is like Harvard. The movie is getting worse completely. It is a quarterly mystery that is achieved by the time it's raining. The movie offers great help. George Plimpton also creates a small role in discussing how to add some gravity to Connery as a death penalty. Violence and atmosphere are manipulated by the third level mystery / thriller. Scripts and directions are very poor. Connery's charisma and screen presence are the only virtues of the film. Manipulative, violent and ridiculous. 2/10 Avoid.
