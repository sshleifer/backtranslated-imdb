I have seen it. It's not "good" but interesting in an interesting way. The boys are quite natural, but the rape of the last collective groups ................. is a tough and free scene, and attacking arbitrary models of the second world war is also offensive to horror real the way it tries to compare. It's real real. This movie is terribly felt. However, it looks like the movie is drawing on you. But it seems that "Emperor's New Clothes", but vice versa. The movie looks good, but the last feeling that comes from this film, the content and the last feeling is empty. If the feeling is blank, that's it.
