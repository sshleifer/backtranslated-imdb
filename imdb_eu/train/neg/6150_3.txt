I did not want to see this movie. I'm not sure It seems to be one of the films made exclusively for Oscars: almost all-in-one music on almost one frame, almost without any shame, a long time set, sepia tone images, pretentible title, NO SEXU, and one. This genius explains everything he thinks and finishes on SFX / CGI (stupid spectators). It did fun for me, even if NOBEL PRICE was wrong! Instead, they call them the price of Nobel (in the name of a person named Alfred Nobel) "noble price" ... Jesus! How can such a defect be produced in a large production, presumably based on a story? What a shame! What did you think of RON?
