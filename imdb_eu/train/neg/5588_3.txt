This is an essay by Edgar Rice Burroughs and filmmakers in the Arab Apes of the Tarzan. But this desert set does not show the presence of Burroughs's most successful jungle adventure. Beautiful Englishman Jon Hall ("The Lion" Chatham) and Kathleen Burke are in love with exotic Arabian beauty (like Princess Eulilah) like "Eulilah Princess". They match that revenge. According to the inauguration, despite the culpability of behavior, the boy's mother lives, but never enters the picture again. Unfortunately, "The Lion of the Males" has deteriorated and looks like the missing footage. <br /> <br /> *** Lehoia Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke and Ted Adams
