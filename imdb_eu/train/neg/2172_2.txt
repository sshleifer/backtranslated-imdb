At the bottom of the cannon, just imagine the imagination and THE ROAD WARRIOR. This film continues the exact film of the filmmaker film STRYKER and it's worse! Bad operation, dialogue, effects, duplication, stimulation, action sequences ... The list goes on. Italy in the early 80's made Road Warrior ripped off, some good, some bad. That is the farthest, without competition. The atmosphere of the film was completely stingy and miserable, because the experiences of one of them were half bored. At the start of the movie, 1 (a) was a good sequence of persecution, and a fresh man of a man exploded by hand. But this movie is completely overly thought! To make a post-nuke fun, go to a copy of ENDGAME instead of NEW YORKE, or BRONX PREVENTION instead. It's much nicer than this garbage.
