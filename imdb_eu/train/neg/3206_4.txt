I was excited Cesar Montano decided to make a film in Cebuana. (It's not a "dialect" of most Filipinos as they are wrongly cited. Cebuano and the tag are incompatible with each other, both in French and Spanish.) But I felt a lot when I watched the movie. Being a Canadian citizen of Cebuano, I was optimistic about the revival of the film industry in Visayan when I heard this film. I was more excited, there was no other movie or stupid melodrama that the Filipinos loved these types of films. But I changed a bit. <br /> <br /> Panaghoy travels to Cesar Montano. Montano, of course, is the star of the movie. And when I say "hero" I say it in stereotyped customs; His role is to win the heart of a girl and bring Bolononia to victory against Japan. His character is not a depth or complexity. Only the mold of the hero is fit. The other characters are one-dimensional; They all have to adjust the cookie cut-out roles. <br /> <br /> I'm all moving to slow / meditative films, but this movie stopped. There was really nothing to think about. Since the film is historically thematic, drama and slow movements do not make films well done. <br /> <br /> Philip Anthony, an American actor, is especially annoying. His work was shameless. <br /> <br /> If he wanted to resurrect the film industry in Montano Visayan, he really should have thought it. He said he wanted to take part in the Cannes film and the Toronto contest. Actually, this film would be rich and whistled at festivals. Visayan film had to make a movie that attracts audiences to raise awareness, even if it wanted to sacrifice quality. Of course, he did not think or get information about what Cannes awards at Cannes, so that the film's appealing audience would have at least one foot. <br /> <br /> Now I'm afraid that Film Visay will not be for a long time. However, if I say to a Filipino, I would like to see more films in Visayas, of course, I would answer: "The Visayas do not make good films. Do not you see Panaghoy Sa Suba?" Of course, this is a wonderful example of a movie in Visayan, and it is probably the only example that anyone can see today. <br /> <br /> Meditation films are just one example, slow movement, not just. Blackout film Tagalog or David Lynch The Straight Story. I hate encouraging the Tagalog language, constantly and unjustly driven, and the non-Tagalog philippine is just a thrust, but I call a pikote for the blackout film. These films are due to Hitchcock's "pure film". Unpublished images are used to convey the story. But I'm defining the definition for a bit for the sake of these two films, because these films are not wordless images to convey the mood of the movie. and they do it very well. Panaghoy thinks he takes bad landscapes, when they set mood. <br /> <br /> And what is it that filipine films kill so many mothers or grandmothers?
