I had to give this movie a bad thing, but do not think I did not like it, I laughed and laughed and even asked some questions. So, I laughed at half time, half-time I said "what's the hell?" or "why would someone do it?" ether In most cases, I enjoyed great fog effects, in the 80s, a scene of nude / battle / dialogue / naked scene, and the way the warrior's sword was hanging in the wind. And there are some model-like effects (not supposed to be trees, right?) And I still do not understand the type that they find in the cave, what's the hell? My friend told me about these movies and I thought I was trying to give it up, and I liked the movie, like people like Ed Wood, I do not seem to be a real pleasure in the movie. my ridiculous way. So let's not let yourself distract that if you really thought it was an action movie, I really liked it for other reasons. It's a lot worse than Evil Dead, so you can really think about seeing your life (for several times it came to my mind). I'd like to have the best drinks for many people or have some friends. Maybe this is a little bit hard, but I do not think you'll rent it, and you'll see it. Me
