This is a bass film. It has no real estate. We are never wealth to respond to other motivations. The character is the worst actor ever to be filmed. The threat seems supernatural, but it is controlled by three elderly people. Why they are doing what they are doing; Fear to join other team members? I do not know. There is a fog of a fogging machine that strikes the risk, and everyone seems to be afraid. Does something do? I do not know. It covers heads on its own. I'm always amazed at this in the old movies. These days, things have been consolidated. However, people walk as soon as the hen, ready for the ax. They do not plan; no resources; nothing. There are five strange finishes in the movie. Who are these people and "there" is a ghost or devil. What happened to the rest of the people? I doubt anyone's way of telling each other confidently. What's wrong
