Everything was fancy in orange shades. Oh well, the main character is painted with all orange colored orange people. In the meantime, escaping from these corrupted poverty of the body plays a video game to dive (there are no rules and rules that play no rules). Apparently, he gains money by playing, but it is evident that it is not a game company worker. A lot of stories that are not talking a lot later drags the story slowly. He uses a glitchy orange computer interface with such a visually annoying operating interface and I can not suspect a future version of Microsoft. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I ask the audience why his precious time has wasted. Does the need for life hardly have a slow game? Yes, the game is fun, but what happens when you're almost starving? While piddling his life, he even puzzles some more-more-orange-dyed lame full-immersion video games that goes his dog (probably the owner who pays at least one moment of attention and feeds it regularly) or is stolen from the woman (orange-colored) while the real color is ignored). In the meantime, the gaming group obsessed the game that lost some uninteresting movie. Yawn That's why it wants to be the best, with Ash Catchem (let's all go). Unfortunately, the main character is also a horrible man and does not escape from his physical beauty (to some extent escape from poverty), without the commercialization of his physical beauty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So it will arrive at "real level and, at least, it is not terribly spoiling, and" real "level intelligence- The former teammate dies in a murderer, and finally a boring orange-colored skinned movie is no longer boring, but it's likely to say that "he is trapped in the poor person's computer and is actually in the real world." Perhaps he's going to do the act of murder and live in real life Well, the kid dies and it disappears in the digital effect. Wow! Thank you, the idiotic director., You have sucked yourself so much, you have sucked it, the director. <br /> <br /> The director was able to recover a bit, recovering himself a bit with a philosophical movie buried with a horrible crust. <br /> <br /> The director can say: "THE WORLD REAL is there to help live and improve there and there is no orange-colored leather lands ango "picture. This great movie movie focuses on slowing down the basic pride of city life (1% of viewers who have not found something spectacularly visible at this time or by Masoist cinema). <br /> No, the director. The director had to sharpen his digital crunching effect and he lost the money loss, loss of time and destroy all the unnecessarily incorrect movie of unreliable confidence in the viewer. br /> Then it ends. Good reason I hope the director is drowned. This HACK will be placed on the list of "all costs" for any other movie accompanying the name.
