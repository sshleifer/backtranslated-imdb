He wrote the S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy with the boob of the main character. That was pretty tight. Before and after, the movie is pretty blows. The play is like an E-list and shows the movie well. There is little prediction that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie play the same person. The whole movie seems to have filmed the film with a short film. The only reason I liked the movie was Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper. They told me a lot of stupid things they laughed at me. Also, if you watch this Blockbuster movie, do it everybody to hide behind Lawnmowerman 2. It should be evaluated by anyone who thinks this movie is good.
