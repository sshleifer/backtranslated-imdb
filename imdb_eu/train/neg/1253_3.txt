I read somewhere that the Hollywood movie had to recover bad movies and leave the classics alone. We only expect it. This remake is not a complete waste, but I want to go back to an original DVD that I have returned to six dollars. A lot of violence and one of the worst endings I have ever seen. This version does not add anything new. Only Hollywood reaffirms why he should leave good things.
