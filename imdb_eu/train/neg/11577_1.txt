The director wants to be Quentin Tarantino; The screenwriter tries to be Tennessee Williams, wants to be Deborah Kara Unger Faye Dunaway, late James Coburn wants to be Orson Welles and wants to be Michael Rooker Faye. Dunaway (older version), Cameron Diaz tries to try as quickly as possible (do not ask about Joanna Going). Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to hide their embarrassment with this toy. It offers endless and meaningless conversations and offers very little action. <br /> <br /> Tulsa is a beautiful section of the lift, an art deco church by Bruce Goff and a beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright mansion. Visit Tulsa, do not watch the movie. It does not make the location justice.
