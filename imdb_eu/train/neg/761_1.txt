Absolute rubbish The reason that was so scary was not diverted from the formula, but the land was pathetic. <br /> <br /> The presumed stars did not do anything to solve the case - and no one really did - it was just the usual police work. Very boring <br /> <br /> You finally got yourself seated until you wanted to throw a seat - and you just got a feeling of despair. <br /> <br /> Some potentials have been stable for a relatively apparent kidnapping. Does Lt.'s personal involvement can blur his mind? <br /> <br /> All visual signals are made by an unknown person. Undoubtedly, a genius like Lt C, through a continuous interview with the injured man, gradually reveals a recorder playing in a shower room while concealing the bride's hiding place, conceals the body and subtle traces. It could be good. Time was wasted.
