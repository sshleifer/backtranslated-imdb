I AM A CHILD HAVE been the worst movie I have ever seen in the last decade. It's a bad movie about a wild boy taken by two parents, but later he has trouble. Junior can drive his grandfather to the car. He frightens a person with a bear. It can turn on a room! BATTLEFIELD EARTH is a bad movie. A sequel is even worse. Rent CHICKEN RUN instead. <br /> <br /> * ****** / 1/2.
