When I was watching this movie I was thinking of it, it would get it right every time ... I was wrong. The most real part of this movie was over. 92-minute full waste. Wendigo ended up losing the best difficulty when he finally appeared and could not be seen. And the tail was stupid. The episode was too much in the movie where you thought something happened, but it was left. Wendigo is harder to talk about, Wendigo. To make this creature so bad, you can not tell it to this film.
