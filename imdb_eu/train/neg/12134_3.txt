In front, this would be a great movie, a great cast, a plethora of possibilities, and the first time it would be the best of Hollywood cameras. <br /> <br /> However, it's clear why eight years ago spacey decided to try to re-direct the movie. This movie fails on many levels. The action is not much in a movie, and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of locations, the suspicion and continuity of the director is essential. It's not here, here's a great deal of cast, John Spencer is late, on more than one plot, so it's a plot of millions and you've not seen 100 other TV shows. The character development is so small that you do not care about the protagonists. At least, we know that spacey has a lot of friends and has a huge weight in Hollywood studios to escape with such a small movie
