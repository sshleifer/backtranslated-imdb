Joan Winfield, a wicked man (an awkward confusion of Bette Davis) will marry Allen Brice (a lost look of Jack Carson) with an egotistical fool. The decision to stop the marriage of his father (Eugene Paleta) and the riders of Steve Collins have been kidnapped (James Cagney, Serio). They leave the desert in the desert and hate each other, but they begin to fall in love (sigh). <br /> <br /> This seems to get a great deal of reviewers only by Cagney and Davis. They featured two great actors, but they're known for NOT comedy plays and why this movie shows up! The script is horrible: the whole movie is not a real laugh. In it, Cagney and Davis started playing a joke (this is THREE HOURS!). He saves only his great talents completely humiliated. In fact, they both do the best with bad material. Cagney tries to try his best and Davis fills the line with great power but does not work. Carson's "hell" face over the film (probably because his emotional characters change in seconds). Only the palette, its distinctive voice and its top-notch smile, will make you smile. But, altogether, this was sad and laughter, to be really seated. Cagney and Davis play two starring roles and two beautiful films, but it is not seen. Cagney and Davis hated the movie, later, and why you see it.
