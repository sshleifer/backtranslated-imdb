Yesterday I watched the movie Flyboys and the girlfriend told me that the movie never seen was worse ... I thought it was incredibly wonderful ... what movie I ever saw was the worst film and this was the only movie that came to mind. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I saw a couple of years before, but I remember that Dean Cain was a terrible military man, a terrible military man (Cain's pretty boy does not make a good chip). With regard to the CGI helicopter, it would be a whirlwind to rent a helicopter, rather than hire a CGI for boys, but I believe that food is a CGI program or a producer's son. He liked playing with a new computer. And how was it? Scary. And when passing through the corridors of the dragon complex, they reuse the same planes and look very cheap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie: it's really awesome ...
