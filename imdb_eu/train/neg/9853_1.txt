I think everyone thinks they want something extraordinary and that the film does not have the greatest limitation to exploit all this. The presentation is very interesting, well presented and graphics are in the art situation, but it does not work from a scientific point of view. Do you lie with hydrogen? They should be the size of a Mack truck to be useful. And then the possibility of a catastrophe is always there. I have no problem with fantasy, just do not try to overcome it. Some are always misunderstood. Everything is entertaining, but I've always found myself saying "oh brother, what's the charge ...". If you want a FAKE documentary, see this Is Spinal Tap. Or at least turn off the sound.
