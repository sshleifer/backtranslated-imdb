When I saw the cover of this movie (a giant mistake that attacked some giants) and "Blue Monkey", I knew I was not in any Hollywood movie. I was surprised to see with Steve Railsback in this cheese bowl, always doing a good job in any post that works ... FX is pretty crisp, there is not a lot of ground, and I still do not know why this movie is called Blue Monkey, not because there is a movie with the monkey. But come people, what did you expect? It looks like it's not as bad as it was ... 50-style defect aggression when you watch movies with 50 old styles, which is a fundamentally updated version, without special updates without FX.
