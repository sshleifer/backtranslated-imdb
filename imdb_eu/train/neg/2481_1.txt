I had never heard of Larry Fessenden, but with the intention of writing and directing the effort, he had to keep the day work as a traveler's actor. Like many others like here, I do not know how to classify this movie, it was not terrifying or terrifying, so it could not be called horror, there was no drama in the plot that was not thin, so it was not there. Suspense, so it can not be a thriller, you only need to see a bad movie if you are a fan of the Blair witch's project. People like this movie liked words, like "ambiguity," they were very complex and subtle, but they were not reading something. Like Blair's witch, people feared it was terrifying and thought they were terrifying people. This movie really started with the "local" family, after having struck a deer. It seemed like today's rescue, but in the next 45 minutes (more than half of the movie), nothing happened, a very nice and dandy family, but it was not very fun to write about the holiday home. It was clear that the locals would somehow participate in a moment, but Essendon clearly does not know how to build a suspense in a movie. In the end, when something happens, it's not clear how your father got shot, how he dies ((the nurse said that he was only her liver shepherding), and all the time the wendigo spirit seems an apparent shooter, very clumsy. Level 3 effect With specials, the movie is called Wendigo, but does not try to explain it in a clear way, it leaves the movie totally disturbed and it leaves you very happy, I would raffle it in 15 minutes, but I would like to see if you wanted to retrieve this movie.
