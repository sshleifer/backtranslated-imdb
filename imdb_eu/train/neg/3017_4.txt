Now, I had the best intentions to see it. I like Tony Scott's work, I also said that a friend told me that it was a great movie, although I heard others. But that was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott tried hard on my low opinion. It was too much. Let me practice <br /> <br /> Miss Knightley was excessive and not in a good way. The good people were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Walken, but the screen was not saved in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some scenes jumped in their originality, but somehow they wrote other than the main writer. It was used by a particular melody 4 times after passing it a second time. I'm afraid I do not use the same melody any more than once. <br /> <br /> Also, editing was as follows: the cutting rate is high. Oh, and the echoing of Keira's lines is only a repetitive one after listening to the second, third, or fourth times. <br /> <br /> Basically, my opinion is that you want to see a great and "somewhat" fun action movie, and if you do not take care of everything I have mentioned, you might like it. . <br /> <br /> (A side note: I'm not a fan of Keira Knightley.)
