"Pandemonium" is a horror movie, which is more fun than stupid. Believe me when I tell you, I love comedy. Especially comedic rejection. "Airplane", "The Naked Gun" trilogy, "Blazing Saddles", "High Anxiety" and "Spaceballs" are some of the most popular genres. "Pandemonium" does not feature these films. Most of the scenes in this movie in a stunning silence because the movie was not so fun. Some laughter seems to be in the movie, but you're laughing at watching comedy several times, and that's it. Meanwhile, he had more laughter than "Scream" movies and he was a horror movie. What's so funny? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (fourth)
