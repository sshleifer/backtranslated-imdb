Some might say something like "Geniuses" like some "giant robot" or "dumbo", with its psychedelic drug challenge with the nightmare sequence, to win the most worrying movie ever made for children. That might be said, but it would be wrong. From now on, I'll take you with you: Santa Claus, the biggest helpless girl in the family ... well, never before. <br /> <br /> Initial scenes showcase some of the most untouched songs of their children around the world (seriously, this segment is almost freakin for 20 minutes and has nothing to do with the plot). As a result, Merlin goes out of nowhere and saves her day (she does not care, it's from Barcelona), that is, at the best childhood trauma. And regardless of what I have tried, I can not ... get ... those ... reindeer ... laughter ... outside ... my mind! <br /> <br /> Avoid this devotion as you would avoid avoiding the whale during the season. However, if you're looking for a gay gay demon with a bad flu case, you should try it. Actually, this film does not deserve your time and mind health.
