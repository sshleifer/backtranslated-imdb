This is not a good movie. It is too predictable in the sections and the story line was similar. 3D is fine, but it's not great. I was sleeping almost in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about 3 young flies that want to enjoy adventure. The characters are missing, I really do not care about these characters and I feel that there is no interest in an adult. This Pixar is not. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see more 3D special effects. I'd also like to see the trendy way to see more jokes that he says "fly sir". Sexist and wives of women as quite sexist.
