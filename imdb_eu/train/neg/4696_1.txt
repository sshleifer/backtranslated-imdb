I know people and I have made animation and graphic design and the show is awesome! They are rich little children with no talent and they surely have asked Nick to accept it! Alex plays the battery for a year, I played 4 1/2 times! The movie is awesome and the show is too! This is never a funny comedy that was never fun. I'm so stupid I want to barf! It's amazing that Nickelodeon would never accept such a thing! Soo are stupid and extravagant! I hate them and their show and I think Nick is as mad as he thinks he's stupid!
