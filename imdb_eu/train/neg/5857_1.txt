WWF Survivor Series 2001 <br /> <br /> It was one of the worst events in 2001. Perhaps the biggest mistake was not to continue with most of the previous Survivor Series. One match that came alive. And the Survivor Series lasted 45 minutes. Also, anyone who works with the brain should know against The Rock against The Rock versus Austin and The Rock. And do not start before the event preview. Anyone who wins, it was obvious that no one would die. There was no need of any nonsense. Whatever a story, it was just a fights event. <br /> <br /> And like the rest of the matches: the first Christian game is defending its European title with Al Snow. It was a good rhythm match, and it was good to win a pretty watch. William Regal's Tajiri versus it was boring and we saw it 2 or 3 times before. Edge versus The test was good, but it's not great. The steel cage title tag was the best of the match. The Royal battle lasted 10 minutes and nobody really liked who would win. The match between women's qualifications is not very good. No, not at least. The main event in history has been a hypocritical match. Lost Alliance but invented what, after 5 months, the Alliance Superstar was only one. The match was inadequate. He eliminated 3 of these Rocks and Jeriko 2 was missing. Rock was overwhelmed with his behavior when the invasion started. Jeriko put the whole game at risk. If I want to eliminate any morning, it would be them. Everyone knew Kane, Big Show and Undertaker were just guys who fell. 7 matches are not enough for a survivor series. A new series still exists again
