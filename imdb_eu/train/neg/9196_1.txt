I have seen one of the worst movies. The only positive thing to say was that it was so bad that it was comical. First of all, there are no plots. The actors seem to read the footprints, and they do the most strange things. Just like the deceased ones, but wanting to find friends and go out. He was also a horrible zombie, as funny as Romero's work, where he enters the film. And in all of them, they showed the glittering of the video game in the action sequences. Unlike us, video games shoot zombies. Likewise, all 20-year-olds can learn how to use automatic weapons and aim at targeting guns. And how does death kill people? Ammuses run out, so they are waiting to be upright. And when they slip in front of the house, their dreams come to an end, instead of shooting the door open, so muted. with a second chance. Undoubtedly, the worst movie I've ever seen in years. Cinemax's B is a better movie.
