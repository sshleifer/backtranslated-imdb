Where to start ... If this movie was a dark comedy, I would say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me, with free time and everyone else (however, I paid the price, from Wal-Mart), the movie meant that it was a thriller. I got THRILL just to see the incorrect interpretation of Kirkland Anne Wilkes in the field of Misery sans snow in the forest. If you want a good laugh, on Friday with rainy nights with friends, this movie is highly recommended. But, at least, if you want to see something in a good way, do not worry. <br /> <br /> I enjoy wonderful movies, in most cases worse. But Wow ... I said WOW! The only film that the film did not swear was Vincent Berry's boyfriend. Even though the only reason they gave them 3 stars, it gave me something.
