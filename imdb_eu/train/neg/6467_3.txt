I still do not believe this movie. There are so many unbelievable things in it, it is hard to believe that those who believe it. <br /> <br /> The story is a joke, but in the sense of being funny, but unlike the story. How can you mix a comedy slapstick with a train robbery, prison movie, village conspiracies, sex jokes and the FBI agent? You can not <br /> <br /> Right next to the unfortunate, the most prominent is the actors. I watched this movie and thought: "Marlon Brando really is? No, it can not be. (5 minutes later) Is Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is true. (5 minutes later) Donald Sutherland can not be. (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino, this movie is very bad for all of them. (At the end). No, no, no, it can not be Martin Sheen! There's no such movie for 10 seconds. Then it was over and I went down with nerves. There were so many good actors, winners, commonly convinced of stupid, dumb and stupid movies, I rarely wanted to know how to play around. They could not get that much money. <br /> <br /> A compelling movie just like a stupid stupid movie It is not. <br /> <br /> 1/3
