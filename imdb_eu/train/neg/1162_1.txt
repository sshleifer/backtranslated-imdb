Thirty years ago I saw this movie in our university theater, I liked Bruce Dern Silent Running and Family Plot. Nowadays (I feel Jack Nicholson), it's the strangest movie I've ever seen. It goes on further, there is no distinctive one, and then it's over. The lights turned on and everyone I saw was scrambling. Was the coil lost on the projection? I have never wanted to get out. What is remembered about the film is not a dramatic pitcher of the college football player and his coach. The most pleasant part of the movie was the voices that were mystified by the audience. Fortunately, Jack, Bruce and Karen Black were just an exception.
