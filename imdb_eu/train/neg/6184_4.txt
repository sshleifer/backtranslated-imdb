A brilliant Brainless movie, but with a headless couple, who decides to live a dream and drive them to diving. The couple almost immediately make the wrong choices of their clients and confuse them in the credit sequence to open certain people who want to recover items that fall into the sea floor. If the videocamera could have been a perfect live look, it was much better, especially if he was interested. The plays are useful and the plot is not really bad, or the director and the producer should not see a lot of clothing that would redirect to the plot (or what I guess I am). "A few untrained breasts." More than the level of a tension movie that generates a movie does not create tension. If you put on the ropes to watch it, you do not throw your eyes on eye candy, but we really have to pay the producers to make movies for paid holidays. .
