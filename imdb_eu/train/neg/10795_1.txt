Someone would tell Shaq how to stick to good basketball. This movie was not entertained at a stupid level. In this movie, Shaq plays a genre that lives in boom boxes, that is, instead of a lamp, the boogie box does not create an original present. The little boy played by Frankis Kaby must help him. This film had the slightest story of the water world; The performance was horrible and I believe that it will be fearful for anyone who likes it.
