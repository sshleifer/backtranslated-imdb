I think this series would mean an improvement over Batman's animated series, especially if I think it's a huge mistake. It's a bad drawing of the character ... (Catwoman, for example, looks awesome ...) But I'm really angry at how Batman looks like a wimp that looks after him. Two assistants, even three friends. I mean, Batman is for the sake of God! I know comic books, I know that they assume Nightwing and Batgirl Batman allies, as well as Robin, but still ... Telling Batman that he needs help ... What, can not he manage some punches? In BTAS, he could face a dozen opponents without any problems ... Is he getting old? Ahead ... <br /> <br /> And one more thing: I do not think that Batman would have the chance to soon let boys like Tim Drake go without hard training. One is irresponsible (and Batman is everything but negligence), and two, it's not what happened in comics, if we want to be loyal to them. <br /> <br /> Batman - The animated series has made history. his animation, his stories and characters ... That's the legend of Batman. The New Adventures series has transformed the legend into another Batman movie.
