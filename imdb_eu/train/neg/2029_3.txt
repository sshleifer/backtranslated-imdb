I do not know enough about television show shows to show SHOW ME THE Money's appeal, but I assume that it is a non-visual appeals. The question show is incredibly visible, providing a large amount of money to meet competitors with simple questions. However, the quiz elements do just a small part of the procedure, which is a complex torture. For example, before answering a question, a competitor chooses the question selected from "A," "B" or "C". Do you want to play another goal? It would be much faster to start with "A." The participants can ask questions, but they should answer one of the three questions in each category. <br /> <br /> After answering a question, the competitor will ask "lock" - delay other tactics. The next task of the contestants is to present a card that indicates a question about the question of the woman about a dozen dancers. The correct answer will be the addition of the dollar card image to the races of the total competitors; An incorrect answer is removed. This much-needed time has the value of entertainment; For audiences, dancers are dressed up and uniform. Meanwhile, the competitor reminds us that the "killer card" selection is going to end soon. This, of course, makes sweat and causes further reverses because the nervous competitor analyzes losses of hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. My suspicion is that the sudden catastrophe is an appeal to the audience of the show. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the entire process is further slowed down by William Shatner and competitors as well as empty spaces. Traditional routines by Cage Dancers. These delays all play a great deal of time for the viewer to overlook the time when the answer to the original question is correct. <br /> <br /> The typical 30-minute chapter of JEOPARDY is included in more than 60 questions. There were only six questions that I saw during the first 30 minutes of SMTM (many of them from other TV shows). No one would have to consider watching this show because it is fun to answer at home. This gives three possibilities to see the show. A. /. <br /> <br /> A. One competitor to respond to more than one million dollars, only losing all that. <br /> <br /> B. Analyze beautiful young women who practice dancing habits in suggestive sex. C. / <br /> <br /> Enjoy the brilliant gesture of William William Shatner. <br /> <br /> The selection is "B", but women do not have a camera for a long time to justify suffering during this conception.
