If you really want to see this movie, because your girlfriend is in a romantic atmosphere, leave the boy. But prepare yourself by putting a hp radio with it. <br /> <br /> Having watched a good movie like Arisan (2003), what they see is again what they see in Indonesia. Apparently it seems to be the only idea to make money, but nobody seems to be an Indonesian image in the world of entertainment. That the world is "global" does not seem like those that make Indonesian films. When the Indonesian people tossed their western flavor into "Made in Indonesia," they fled with him. <br /> <br /> Okay, at first, the story is nice. And it could be a nice movie. Has the director ever thought that playing direct music requires first and foremost direct music or at least a good reproduction, and secondly, good choreography? In this movie, playback is SO BAD, so you can cite it in the movie. Each one of the words you hear is the second one that sings the actors or reproductions, and it is very annoying to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Choreography is as if it were planned to make a movie about the morning gym. But eventually it would be nice to become a musician ... Choreography was forgotten. You can hardly dance, they jump here and there, they spit their legs in the air, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> Well, at least there's a happy ending ... But you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlestick dinner is so romantic, DO SO!
