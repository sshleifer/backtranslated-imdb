Over the last 20 years, most British movies have been in poverty in the UK, and our youngsters do not have the chance to live a good life while living in the average city of British cities. Britain's film industry is obsessed with the 'broken Britania'. Trainspotting, England, Kidulthood, Football Factory, Kes and London are Brighton. <br /> <br /> Bullet Boy is just another British British film. The main character is keen to continue straight away, still stays in the hands of teammates who join gunfight and gang members in the fight. I never persuaded myself that he wanted to continue straightforward, that continuing education or trade did not stop him. In fact, it would have been fresh air if he had to go directly straight and we had a character that activated his life. Instead, he helped his friend kill him. I did not feel sympathy at the end of the movie when another teenager could shoot, because it was sad, at the beginning of the film I liked the whole family and the desire to succeed. I believe that authors have lost a great deal of opportunity to show off the world, among those who want to succeed (Pursuit of Happiness). <br /> <br /> I know that this film has been designed to be a realistic picture of teens living in the UK, but we do not already have enough movies in the UK. with the same plot? Is not it time for talented producers and writers to focus on and showcase to young Britons that a better life is in the corner? <br /> <br /> I'm not greeted with the Bullet Boy's responsibility to load the whole boat. The fact is that the film has not seen a huge list of feature-length movies in the United States, such as the Kidulthood, Football Factory, which has led to a breakthrough in the pursuit of an unbelievable breakthrough. There is no happy ending in this movie or any other I mentioned.
