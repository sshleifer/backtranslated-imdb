Many of the slashers that appeared at the beginning of the eighties stand out because of the start-up of Pranks Daphne Zuniga (The Sure Thing, The 2) His character has died quite early and the rest of the films are completely unforgettable. <br /> <br /> During a Christmas break, a group of students volunteers to clean their condemned university building. A crazy murderer, on the other hand, casts a key on his work by knocking the young in a methodical manner. <br /> <br /> Taking advantage of every definitive clich√© of the Jeffrey director's director. Obrow is terribly afraid of praying for the characters to die, so it's also worth seeing. Most deaths (that is, really, why we see this film in general) are short and not that gory; The really awesome picture remains only if the victim finds the body remaining alive (the corpse that is there, in general, is bloody and can make movies more). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the last moment, the film itself keeps the slightest possible score for me, unexpectedly, when it suddenly falls. This is really true for slasher only.
