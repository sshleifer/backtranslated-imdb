This is the worst movie I've ever seen. All those involved must be ashamed. Everyone Ice-T is pitiful, the conversation is terribly terrifying, and hokie is not going to describe it in single-acting performances in this movie. Land decides to land the decision makers, but compared to Air Rage, Executive Decision is the Academy Award material. I never felt so disappointed when I saw a movie. Air rage must be burned ashes in a vault so they can never see the light of day again. Anyone who watches should take a shower and clear the scent of the movie. The best part of this movie probably comes from the end, after throwing off credits. This is the worst film ever I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T must be Law and Order, and other people in this film will retire or commit suicide. In any case, they will never try again in a movie.
