* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I am sure that it was released in 1958 when it was very appropriate. At that time, the movies were slower to keep track of the story and the audience. Here a man moves to the property of his last wife who died mysteriously with his new wife. Mickey (a garden-oriented garden by Alex Nicol) is really a character. The skull gets indirectly, because Jenni warned that they had problems, because she knew that the death of her first wife was wrong. He can not tell Jenni what happened right, so he threw him off to scare him. Jenni, aware of the fact that his parents died, and therefore caused serious mental disruption to institutionalization. Like many of today's viewers, I've slowed down very slowly for my tastes. But if you like terrible horror without a lot of gore, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
