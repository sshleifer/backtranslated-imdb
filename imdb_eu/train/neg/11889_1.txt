Very fun to watch "Beretta Island" as a natural trash. It's like the answer to the b-movie by Jess Franko. Bodbuilders retreats (! Face-up!) To Pushers. Strike very stupid! Action: bad scenes with credible imagery are better than apparent manual struggles. The scenes are hilarious. They save a very beautiful scene. The erotic escargots are very unerotic. t miss: Arnold Schwarzenegger's joke at the beginning of the new movie and at the end of the list of relatives of Franco Columbu. Special Attraction: Nude Armchair. Almoust forgotten - Franco can sing!
