I saw all this movie about something about it ... or me. It's not a good movie. It's horrible But it's a terrible thing to keep my attention from keeping it from seeing a tragedy and could not look like it's a similar one. MST3K could do a great thing! <br /> <br /> Most of the wonderful things that make up a wonderful movie are here: bad conversation, inadequate music, similar stories, ridiculous pseudo-science. You will approach the marvelous death marches, faces with the agape of poor victims agape and too much time to see ahaaaaaaaay their love of the near future, delivered to their outturned contrived deaths. Your heart will be warmed up by topical antics, when two women fight for a gun and, anyway, Who has the vote? Both look at themselves, then the other, then themselves, then (apparently 15 minutes later), it eventually goes down. You will sing songs (of course, in Latin), with the humorous humor that turns the choir of death into a coral, which threatens to become a musical movie for a moment. <br /> <br /> So, as you can imagine, as movies get worse as they get better, then it may be a good choice for you. It's not fun with Rowdy Roddy Piper, "My direct" is just as fun as my favorite science-fiction schlock, but it's more fun than Luk-hot movies like Omen II or III. <br /> <br /> I gave it from 10 to 4.
