We and Girlfriend watched this movie as "Premiere Surprise," when we bought a preview of a movie we had opened in Denmark. We sat for the first hour or roughly and then we left! The film was about to be a portrait of the time (and the club 54), but this was the case with the development of the characters' development, and there was little or nothing in the plot. <br /> <br /> I have rarely been very indifferent to the characters in a movie! <br /> <br /> It was a good music. So, if you want to hear good music and get this 70's solution, it's okay. But do not expect credible characters to get a plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
