Describes the ideal idea here. Is that the problem not? The concept has a fresh and potential, but the script and its implementation do not contain any real substance. It will take you from the beginning and then you will have to get some emotions out of it, be interested and invest in the characters. This movie does not need what it takes and keeps it, and why. First of all, you do not really care about the characters, because they are not presented as people are not present, I mean, this is not a Superman or Mission Impossible here, it is supposed to be a normal person that stresses stress. They are not as incredible as they play and interact. For example: Jeffrey Combs is a police chewing gum, the eyebrow looks at the forehead and intensity all the time there is no way to go here. I mean what that is? It looks like it's a toilet or something. I loved the re-animator and it was the correct measure / neurotic and the way he considered the doctor's genius. But this is not why he tries hard to compensate for so hard and looking at the edge, but still in a mild neurotic measure, it's not natural, I was surprised that he did not shoot his jaw. The film basically focuses on life protection; It just has a pulse and I'm waiting for something that will ever come.
