I remember when he left the trash, how he watched Barbra Streis's diaries and movie years. Well, he could not take many years; The play was only opened in 1975 eight years before. Tovah Feldshuh made a star of the Broadway actress, who probably had to throw it in the film, but NOOOOO ... STAR BARBRA had to do a great deal. AND MUSIC Nothing less! This movie is from the beginning to the end of the disaster. For some reason, Barbra made it to HAMAH EKIN and looked every minute. No one was swallowed up like a young girl to learn Torah. And then, when he got his boyfriend, he got a camp. Streisand does not seem to feel attractive to me, when he played with make-up; Girl is younger than younger. And as it is not enough, Avigdor takes part in both (Mandy Patinkin, the best moment behind his naked movie) AND his grandmother (Amy Irving, who makes his usual sleepwalker routine.) The poor schtick woman always directs when she directs it and She does not know what she does.Yentl has even got married to the little girl, I do not like to mention the scene of "wedding night". <br /> <br /> Then there's music, unforgettable songs by Streisand singing over voices (probably her as an inside look of the head) and each intrusive and irritating on the nails of the leaves. <br /> <br /> I do not say that Streisand does not show here the promise of clear promise: some visuals are beautiful (especially in Patin's back) and have a good balance. The problem of this movie was not taken out of its own way. I did not believe in the second place, NOW did not add songs and on it the whole mess lasted two hours and fifteen minutes has du. After fifty five minutes I was mixed up, <br /> <br /> horrible, horrible, horrible.
