Before seeing "Dahmer", I thought the movie would be "worse than Freddy Got Fingered". I was wrong. To say "Dahmer", it is a story about a homogeneous killer series that almost does not die, and it almost completely meets Dahmer's gay men before they die. There is no need to find a plot, and it does not have any purpose to say "Dahmer". Seeing this movie, everything you learn about Dahmer was like having sex with men. Awesome play, awful direction, awesome writing, everything awesome ... If you have to choose "Dahmer" and a three-hour pedestrian observation, go vomit ... it will be so painful ...
