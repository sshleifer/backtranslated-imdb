When the youth group "St. Elmo's Fire" graduated from college, it's hardly four years to get to an important university. In most cases, these children are careless, selfish, tough, and stupid, but writer and director Joel Schumacher appear as a touch of a generation. Now with an old cast of "Up and comers", it's very similar to "Endearment conditions," and writes generosity about this circle as "Fire." When they go through their years, they become even more insolent. * 1/2 ****
