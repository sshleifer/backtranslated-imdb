Fulci films like me, I really do it and I'm not bored in an ironic way, but I know that a lot of people are missing out and they're mistaken. <br /> <br /> The Fulci conquest is the place where his hand is fantasy epic. genre and not successful. Actually, they are like most Fulci movies you've watched. Some things happen, other things happen, and occasionally a scene may be linked to one another. It's really like sets like Conan, no script, no real actor (Arnold Scharzenfartz is not an actor), no budget, stupid dog looks, soldiers and a bunch of gore. This was a tough crossing and I lived without an inch of camouflage on camelina, to give the Hair Metal music videos look.
