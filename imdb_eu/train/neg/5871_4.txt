For me, the only reason to look at this remake was that it was bad and fun. Undoubtedly, it was funny and bad because I saw "Voyna i mir" (1968). Do we start? We are here ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Pierre Bezukhov: a member of the original lack of depth; Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison's Natasha Rostova: a scarecrow, her image can create insomnia; Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison, Andrej Bolkonsky, as a classmate (see above), lack the depths of a Russian soul and the "inner struggle". Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison in Napoleon - was a bad head; Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison's Prince Bolkonsky - an English face; Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison's Count Bezukhov - a show-free show ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are not much better. <br /> <br /> Actors' movements and the way they look and talk, often atrocious. They act like a modern European citizen for a masquerade of one day. Everything seems cheap and never gets closer to our XIX. Subordinate Russian men and women's standards. <br /> <br /> Pleasure to inspect and have fun. We had some ordinary radio stations in our office, remembering the modern product that they showed on the previous night on our TV. <br /> <br /> "User rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - I think many young people have never seen our movie ("Voyna i mir" 1968) or "Tarantino-Spielberg" have a strange sense of quality . Remember the scene when our Hussars save their friend, rolls, shoots, and the bridge goes boom? It seems CGI explosion. <br /> <br /> There is no sense, or a better version of the craftsmanship, once it was successfully screened in our country. But I would be glad to see a Russian remake called "Windshields". Hey, the director, waking up and busy, instead of ruining our classics. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm sorry to come back. Aside from that. What I have just mentioned is not new, but the deadly one is excessive. <br /> <br /> Trying to try Russian runners-up (if it's a lot of drama and serious plays) is a flawed mistake and the director is making this mistake again and again. It causes a lot of reasons. Above all, Clemence Poesy is very funny, and she thinks dance and singing as a Russian viewer: "This is so horrible!"). <br /> <br /> <br /> Something new to say, I would like to mention the movie pace. In my opinion, this new version is very wrong. Narration and scenes are not heard in a natural way: they are like like modern video games and they are rising. I must remember once again that "Voyna i mir", where action is so natural and that simple story, you can sit and enjoy "going on the flow". <br /> <br /> Maybe I thought maybe Borodino would be a great fight (in some way, some disadvantage rehabilitation), but there was no match for war scenes in 1968. And there it is. Actors are working hard to work. Initially they did not have the chance, but still "loser groups" were introduced. One additional point for this abuse. She is uncomfortable with the Russian audience. Some scenes are ridiculous, ridiculous, though they are very powerful and they make the best of their cast. He remembers all the fault, and sometimes laughter. <br /> <br /> This series is the last part of what I still like about this series. It is very vivid that everyone gets "salaries and taxes". In addition, according to the movie sites, I thought it would be a scene for adult sex movies that would kill the project altogether. But, fortunately, it does not litter. And that's great. "Voyna i Mir" is not "Harry Potter", and today, in today's Russia, we do not have enough craft to shoot well. Did I say that the moral quality of our lives is horrible? Fortunately, a good movie was given during our wins. In the 1950s the American version was justified in some measure - we did not exist yet. As a result, strong circumstances existed. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 4 (one point from the beginning is one point, the wrong way leads to one point and the last part of the series is 2 points. Thank you for your attention.
