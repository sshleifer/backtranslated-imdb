The original "Cube" is a fantastic B-movie, paranoia, meat characterization and top performances. It's creepy, cryptic, and cool. And it's very well on its own, without the stupid sequence of "Cube Zero". <br /> <br /> This third movie in the Cube series (!) is restructured (most of the trap volumes are unfortunately recycled), partial aberration. It's bold to explain what's going on in the Cube to explain something that was never in the first movie. However, because this explanation is faded, I would like to keep a secret. There are some interesting references to the outside of the Cuban society, but they never develop beyond the advice of a totalitarian political-religious state. So what a small social comment is flat and inadequate. <br /> <br /> What works for you? Basically nothing. The play is only for amateur hours; It's a slow pause (it has two nerds watching two of these two films) and the effects, however, twisting them, did not persuade them. In short, "Cube Zero" reminded me that "Cube" fan-fic, a dirty clone of a good movie that does not require a good fiction.
