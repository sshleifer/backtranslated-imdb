I hated the way portraying Perez Raca! We are not all ghettos - and we speak Spanish ... not Puerto Rican! I can not speak of people you know about. But our language is intact, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is better than any other island in the Caribbean economically! Are we glad that we were not in Cuba, the Dominican Republic or Haiti without any American influence? Free real poverty, not the standard of US poverty. We are not the victims, we are resistant, humble, honest and intelligent people. Our ancestors have strong African roots, but not "black" roots, I have nothing to do with the Black Americans with 9 research). Pedro Albizu, Che Guevarra and Martin L. King were no longer marked by analogy. <br /> <br /> MLK was a great hero, it was a real revolutionary ... It was a honest man who saw a day we would be free one day. Do you want to create a Cuban day? That's why Cuba's Cubes endanger life in America, because Chek made them a better place? The idea was excellent, wonderful and bright but you politicized too much. We have many things to be proud of as a people. Do not shame to victimize our people. I'm not Nuyorican and that's why I can not share your opinions. I am Puerto Rico, I speak Spanish, I am not a victim and I have achieved many goals in America. If there is a second part of the future - there are a lot less politics and more history stories of victory. <br /> <br /> Damaris Maldonado
