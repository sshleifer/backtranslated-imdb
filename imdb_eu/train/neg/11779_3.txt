I do not like this movie. If you have read Puzer's books, or if you have seen at least the first movies very close (especially the first one), you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> Compared to the Corleone saga. With Puzar's novel, the script of this film is sometimes ridiculous. Characters and their relationships are distorted. The story comes from nowhere, although it seems that the direction in the film has been. <br /> <br /> It is already expected in the 1990s that Corleone's saga is expected a few times and we can not accept that things were found as before. But, on the other hand, I do not know why other films had to copy some conversations when they did not fit. Why? They are like sequel to trying to copy the features of the original movie. <br /> <br /> You never understand what Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino have come together to achieve that. One of the things that directed the pieces such as Apocalypse Now and Godfather, almost all things that make up the movie must be pardoned until it is dying. Al Pacino too, being an actor. But Mario Puzo would not have to write. How are you? He damaged all his previous works. A pity, my friend. Puzar's novel "Azkeneko" novel is a story about the underworld in the 90's and is very good. We can never talk about Godfather III's plot.
