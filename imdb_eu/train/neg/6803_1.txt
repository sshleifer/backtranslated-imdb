When I enter the board of the IMDb, I'm always fed up when I see a post "the worst movie ever". * After watching this * Film, I think I will soon create my post! <br /> <br /> Opening titles: brilliantly, a sharp zoom on a gas oven (yes, light-emitting = explosions = great action on the film!) <br /> <br /> Actors: I think Ice T rapper is cool and it's a nice actress (sometimes, I emphasize "sometimes") but Steven is like the police who play the margin ... beyond words. The rest of the cast ... well, I do not know where they hired these actors but I did not! I bet it will be a better actress than my dogs! <br /> <br /> Plot: Hijacking. Is not the origin? <br /> <br /> Action sequences: The first shot in the movie is an explosion. I said it, well, cool !! At least pyrotechnics will be nice ... It was badly dead. The rest of the film has a lot of low-lease flatbeds taken by the Air Force ... <br /> <br /> Conversations are hilarious, it's pure music, it's happy at the end (I was finally happy because the movie was over!) <Br /> <br /> My cousin was watching the movie happy (I was 22 years old, 42 years old ... well). I was about to take the movie and burn it. Maybe I'll see next time ... (did he ever say?)
