Scrooge was inspired by an African American woman, a modern and struggling city, but nothing in this film. Here, Mrs. Scrooge takes advantage of employees and clients in the black and poor neighborhood. There is no doubt that there are good intentions for the people involved. Part of the problem is that the roots of the story do not translate into the urban framework of this film, and the script does not perform updates. Similarly, a continuous message about sharing and delivering is constantly repeated; The audience will be tired until the end of this film is known. This is a movie message that you do not want to leave. In the title, Cicely Tyson has a great talented attitude, and sometimes it is difficult to understand lines. Charles Dickens's novel has been adapted so many times, a struggle to adapt it to the fresh and important, although it is a very important message.
