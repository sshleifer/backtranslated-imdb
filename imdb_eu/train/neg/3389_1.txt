I watched Broadway's original "Broadway" God knows how many times and felt the passion, despair and joy in the theater comes from this live experience. Michael Bennett knew that he should re-imagine "The Choirs" on the screen, but he never thinks how to do it. If the show appeared stumped by the man - he should answer your question. There are some shows that can be watched directly with the audience. However, Richard Attenborough worked with the music of "Ghandi" and "Doolittle Doctor" with animals, and directed this film that did not resemble the theater's theater. Amazing songs have been added (Surprise! Surprise!). Great songs were taken to or transferred to other characters (this did not make sense). Michael Douglas was my cast. It was not possible to try to dance the people and they did not sing, act or dance "Landers" sexy woman. I think that Ghandi's wife was over. Jeffrey Hornaday's dances only look like "Schlafds" on flashdance and nothing works. I was sorry and emotionally something that could have been emptied. If you really love this show and go back to Broadway in 2006 - do not think about the long musical event "A Chorus Line" that has nothing to do with that movie.
