It's something like the genre, whether you like music in the 1950's or not. If you do that, you love this one. Personally, I prefer most musicians of the 1930s and 40s with the dance group Astaire and Rogers, and Eleanor Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keeler, James Cagney, Shirley Temple, etc., but the songs of the 50s are slower. Dance numbers and soap opera melodrama decades out. <br /> <br /> This movie is a case. The first song is okay, but the next three did nothing. By that time, the story had no appeal. Deborah Ker's presence is another matter. I do not think I saw the movie that I liked, including, where he portrayed a good English teacher of two shoes threatening to leave Siam in the middle of the film.

Indeed, it's a kind of great music that you have not seen after that generation. Unlike today, we also get dubbed singers. There, the actress is not really singing, so Marnie Nixon Kerr's rescue comes along with Natalie Wood, "West Side Story" and Audrey Hepburn's "My Fair Lady." <br /> <br /> Yul Brynner " Mongkut is king "and the traditionalist is stereotyped, filmmakers always negatively represent it. It's not "progressive", as in the case of the left parties, but the teacher of education (like Kerr, "Anna Leonowens") will be correct. Today's progressive seculars are always taught by senior teachers who are trying to cure cancer! However, Yule plays a good role and uses some comedies with her skin. True, this is the main protagonist of this film. Brynner had magnetism. "The Magnificent Seven" was also a cowboy hypnotized by the audience. <br /> <br /> In short, today's beautiful movie and millions enjoyed it. I'll leave
