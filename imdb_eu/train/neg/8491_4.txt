Although the original touches of "virtual sets" that create Ada Lovelace and Victorian interior of his circle, this film is short and, ultimately, disassociates. Francesca Faridany, a beginner, seems to be talented, but is lost as Emmy, if she looks at a midfielder in the movie, she will only tell Lady Ada an autobiography. The concept of 'Ada Concept' begins when Lady Ada (Tilda Swinton) appears; Face-to-face expression of the camera, which maintains Mannerism, even if it looks bright or invisible, showing Emmy's "virtual rendering" scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ada Lovelace would be a straight-run biopic, but this film, unfortunately, hash of Lady Ada's life, and current computer scientists (and her cartoon marine ) drawing.
