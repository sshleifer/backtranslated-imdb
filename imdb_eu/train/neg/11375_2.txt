Are you talking to me? (1987) is a pretty bad movie, as I am the protagonist of a neighborhood character who has never seen me as an actor. He's a heavy taxi driver, because he tries to use that shtick. When he learns of life's hard facts, he does what he does, he changes his image! She goes to the dancing surfing throughout the night. His friend can not believe the change (he gets it with Faith Ford and he gets a nice concert). Can young Punk keep his street jump? <br /> <br /> This is a real lame movie, trying too hard to access too many things at once. An interesting idea that falls as a result of the execution deficit. Who knows, maybe someone will receive the ball and the filmmaker will run because the ball is stolen. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. If you do not want to see a young Faith Ford and a Bubba young Forest Gump. Xx
