I can not believe the likes of Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger! The script is so handwritten and the management is so weak (the same person) it is difficult to find more single-sized characters in the film. In conversations, the thriller is so honest that he laughed at some of the idiots who came to the theater. Configuration is difficult, you think you are going to watch a thriller, and it suddenly becomes stupid movie of persecution. Bassinger's character is so muted that he has really stopped crying to God, "Where are you!" So he can follow his followers, and then he fled! And then he introduced the smallest wood in the world, I mean, he goes all over the place and the killers have never lost his career, which is happening in the middle of the night. I'm really wondering, the best Hollywood writers can find millions of dollars of money.
