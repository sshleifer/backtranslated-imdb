This popular film was probably a story that moved quickly, a sense of humor, a bad character that closes all rumors, and so on. It's a funny thing, you probably can not make a movie with this title, but "white", like anything else, PC police would be racist. <br /> <br /> However, if Woody Harrleson is not better than the best black basketball player, Wesley Snipes is a very good white guy. <br /> <br /> Snipes had a lot of fun lines, offering a lot of humor. The bad part of the movie, which is hardly a matter of people, is the insolence of all the characters here. Here is Woody's girlfriend, made by Rosie Perez. In this movie there are no good and nice people. Therefore, I can not recommend this film to the cinema, for those who are not at least friends or fraudulent
