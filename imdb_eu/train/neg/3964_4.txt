For all the events in this film, I kept an open mind about what I would have thought about at last. And sometimes even a bit slow, 90% of the first movie is pretty good, it's been jumped out and overflowed with more than a few "old" ones. I really thought it was an excellent cinematography around many of these scenes. However, Dark Remains fails, but at the top of it. At the end of the film and the incident, it seems that it's a thousand miles from his body. Does the language completely fall into the face without a conclusion and, what is the most sought-after answer, what has really happened to Emma? - it was not clear! The reason for the negative energy was very good, and in the end I was very deceived. It was a great horror movie that could have ended up in the end.
