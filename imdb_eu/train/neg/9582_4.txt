Fecal things have thrown away so many playful scenes, and in the end it is an absolute illusion. Very bad, because the premise is promising (as it often happens, it's in Duhllywood), but it's still in the hands of the scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> It's time for Lowe Prison to kill Mrs. DUE. We're going to become a nightmare, which is why we feel it's really real. Then the neighbor of her cell friend hangs herself. Or has it? Lowe has some suspicions, but it quickly drops. His suspicions are so weak that bad boys do not worry about. So why do they set it to kill? Oh, that is, this story might be interesting. In it, it falls from the rails and, after removing them from the rails, the viewer may be overwhelmed with attention when deciding. <br /> <br /> <br /> ************ **** SPOILERS ***************** ********** <br /> <br /> I did not realize an endless story. the irrationality of the future, but looking at that end. Lowe caught the bad guys. He already wants a tape, this tape will be their boss and they will lighten them. So there will be 3 police officers, drawn by gun, ready to save Lowe. Bad guys kill the police, before half of the passengers ... Lowe continues to get the tape. Hello !!!! 3 kills in the public police will take you to a deeper doodle, to hell by the ribbons. However, they go to a shopping mall, as if the people did not exist as witnesses, and eventually the Lowe caught up and the guy still wanted the tape!
