A man is aware that his father is a part of a 50-year nuclear experiment and now has power. <br /> <br /> I was really correct for this movie, under Mr. Toby Hooper's direction and watching Brad Dourif's wild cards. Unfortunately, it is not rising above average average of violent powers with average violence. Spontaneous Reaction has an interesting premise behind it, unfortunately, it seems that its potential is never lived and it stretches longer. The special effects are not bad either and they help bring the movie to an end. <br /> <br /> Cast is not a bad thing, Dourifeu steals the show. <br /> <br /> All around, it's not classical, but it's not that worst. <br /> <br /> ** outside ****
