I was so angry with RISK BY FICTION to write a review on the IMDb. RISK FICTION is a surprisingly complex, touching and thought-out movie until the end. Having suspended a lot of logic interruptions (why did not Will Ferrell hear the voice of Emma Thompson ten years ago when he began to write his book, "The phone was called, the phone again called ...), about mortality, fate and sacrifice It reflects. <br /> <br /> A brief history of literary themes by Dustin Hoffman must be entertained by English-language masterpieces, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is always enjoyable, though Will Ferrell could be a murderous ax as a bumbling soul. His rapid confidence is a huge leap of faith. <br /> <br /> Oh, but ending. I'm going to give it to 9 of 10 stars to finish the movie. The movie as a metaphor of the life journey, as a tribute to the concept of "writing truth", a great literary comedy or As a reminder of the tragedy, but not both, it is clear that the viewer takes the whole film to understand and accept Will Ferrell's destiny. And yet, what is it? If you are a character that is more agreeable, we know why we accept the end. The last act takes place, the white screen, the credits are thrown. The deep and powerful ending of a perfectly perfect film. The weekend was debated. <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!! No credit was cast. It's not said. Hollywood has not been attacked for another 10 minutes by totally undermining the integrity and heart of the film. Dustin Hoffman said: "He's no longer a masterpiece, he's fine." Appropriate review of the movie. Except for me, it was not good. "The truth of the writing" I felt the rejection of betrayal, about the decision written about the melancholy movie, that is, explaining the route that comes out of the movie. I do not often cry. I looked after a few films, but I'm still angry about it. <br /> <br /> Zack Helm asks the writer's questions: this is when the original movie came to the end of the white screen? Would you have been forced into a passionate filmmaking power as opposed to the core of the movie? Or that stick that ends you to yourself? I have read it perfectly. I hope your original script has finished for the first time. <br /> <br /> I know Zack Helm will never see this review, and I could not find the contact to ask myself. But, please, filmmakers, do I feel this way for LIFE-FREE SAVINGS? It was a good thing to see when I watched this movie: I duplicate LOST IN TRANSLATION now.
