First of all, it allows you to start this review to RECEIVE COLLECTION AND RECEIPT OF PERSONAL RECEIPTS! <br /> <br /> It was one of the worst bins I've ever seen for Hulk. The story was a preview of absurdity. If you expect more than 24 on the big screen, wait until the toilet is cleared, along with the money you would use for a card. That way you can enjoy it. The play was awful, the plot was not realistic (in the end called "twist"), I must say this, it ended up surprising me. I was not surprised at the plot, but instead, but trying to make the whole scene of the whole action of the whole movie, They even dropped it, although I did not notice until I finished reminding myself of the credits I found out I could think of burning the coil of the film in the screening room. <br /> <br /> The casting was terrific for some reasons: first of all, perhaps characters They had to change the assignments, because Michael Douglas played the rolls by Keifer Sutherland, while Douglas was acting as agents, hitting the telephone lines, getting in touch with the systems and the people that followed him, he always has less agents, the mood of the ad, Even if things are not bad for that, it's a very stupid agent u, Jack Bauer likes nothing more than loving his 24 fans. <br /> <br /> I can swear that this movie will be empty in all areas. The innovations of "Fugitives" or the "In the Line of Fire", written by people with mental disabilities, may be better.
