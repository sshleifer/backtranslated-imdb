Well, so I found out about this movie and I saw the preview of almost all reviews and I had a hard time seeing whether or not I should see. Although I watched the movie before I was emotionally strange. I was so sure to see this and for a long time I was worried. So I wanted to risk it and I saw it and I thought what happened: the start was good. He seemed to start making a decent money. I overcame the scene of rape and I could not imagine why people were disturbed or bored. I am not mistaken as a sad and terrifying scene of rape, but I did not worry dramatically. Then I understood the boring thing that was happening when I went into the middle. It was about 5 minutes that people could barely say or do not show anything. The only thing that a person has is a shot that shows a type of emotion, but this movie does not have that. There were about 3 of these stunning scenes, where Maya could not control the main character, but he did not want to see me wanting to go forward. Then, when the hardcore party was playing, it was not so boring, but it was still quite modest. Notice and Rosario Dawson still did a great job. I went well in the middle of half an hour and then this revenge is focused on Maya. That is disturbing. I did not feel bad for him or he did not deserve everything, but the whole scene was really disturbing and I felt after it. I can not really say whether or not to see this movie, so that's why ... I do not know I can not find a word to summarize it. But if you only have to go see it, do not think about it.
