By Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> a group of airplanes. Perfect plan. Everything is wrong. They have problems. The police are away. They are tightening. What will they do now? <br /> <br /> Are you familiar? <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be a theater workshop, "indie" and a combination of theater. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of actress that loves it - it's a workshop or theater, especially because it's strangely focused on the actors ... angry, tense, afraid, engaging in conversation. In order to verify, they will be given a free offer of planners to bring them to a bite. <br /> <br /> A trio of birds, a leader, a goring, a brother, with a great scheme of agitation. ... and the monkey is a key to throw it at work. To get rid of things, a bit of "protectors" and a windshield are taken to the back of the windscreen. <br /> <br /> Police are in the tail and they meet in a bar called. "Dino's Last Chance." <br /> <br /> Spacey, as a director, attempts to keep performances and dialectal attention. He placed a buzz of Bogart's sharp and noisy draft. Actually, it keeps the whole violence on the screen. <br /> <br /> I think this was a mistake. Seeing intensity and violent scenes would give the film a film. <br /> <br /> The problem of the movie is too slow and it almost mixes in almost all the roles. Matt Dillon ("Drugstore Cowboy" and "Wild Things") is too young and idealistic to be the head of this gang. <br /> <br /> It seems that Gary Sinese is a joke and a deeply thought-out tag. Together with these guys and Joe Mantaga is an effective routine-curse dog that's crazy police lieutenant who is all thumb, but nothing really is done here. <br /> <br /> William Fischter is just one of the actors who is credible in his brainless grunt just like a blood flow eminent. <br /> <br /> And the crooks have a strain on the situation where they go to jail or try to think somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Spacey does not have the ability to create and maintain many volumes. Most of the characters are away, trying to think a plan ... and they are quiet and articulate. There is also a scene where the rebels are ready to strike for the full swarm of armed police officers. At one point, one of the rebels also calls a bar outside police. Oh brother. Disregard <br /> <br /> These police will blow or block them. Would not it be a little afraid of infected dreadlocks? Meanwhile, all real action is happening internally. <br /> <br /> Someone is attacking a gun, a baseball, that is, a screen goes out a ugly opponent and another accident happens ... well ... sad. But ... <br /> <br /> Faye Dunaway also had to spend a longer time with a dialect coach, improving with the New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is very good in a smaller part. <br /> <br /> The police look nice when a police officer listens to a bag. And also, someone is a scene that is directly through the wind of the back. <br /> <br /> Of course, the dialect is trying to make an approach to David Mamet and it is very common, but never realistic or thought. <br /> <br /> It's too much in the movie. really ... a small budget film that directs the actors behind the camera for the first time "is not bad, but it needs to be rewritten for others." Spacey shows that he is not a great director, but there is nothing like a feeling of "movie-making", and it seems to be just a filming of actors. <br /> <br /> All these actors can work with talent and material. , but everyone feels the place. As I said before, the movie is very confusing. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that they cast out bad guys. I think they found the right cast, but put them in every wrong role. I think changing some roles would be very helpful. <br /> <br /> The actress Joe Mantagna was the one who played the old actress, police officer Gary Sines set before her angry lieutenant and barking her office. His soldiers, Fischter, takes part in his "blood of the savage" and keeps Matt Dillion as a sacrifice lamb. It would be a great improvement. <br /> <br /> When some actors are directed, it works. The Oskars will be able to win this. For a long time, when the actors play live, they tend to pay tribute to their performances. Filmed shooting actors. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it works ... but they need a good showcase. An excuse <br /> <br /> Hate situations happen the same in real life, just like the age stories, so it is natural that movies about them also go from point A to point B. . <br /> <br /> There are some great introductions in this genre. "The appearance of Spacey himself appeared in a similar movie:" The negotiator. " <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This will undoubtedly become a cult classic, much less an AFI 100. However, it has nice moments. and personal touches, but eventually it will be forgotten and the most popular type of film that would play on television. Watching is not worth it. <br /> <br /> I provide approximately 3. <br /> <br /> <br /> Spacey's other credit checker, "Beyond the sea", felt better. effort Hmmm ... maybe it's true. You must fail before you succeed. By Dane Youssef
