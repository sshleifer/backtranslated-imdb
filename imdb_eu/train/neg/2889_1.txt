The case is the best part of the movie, but only the price of the purchase is not worth it. When I took the movie as a "real story", shorts filmed on home video are linked to bad plays and related slaughter scenes. The scene of the videos had a lot of delay, they were probably used to lengthen the long length of the function. I started reviewing the movie before midway through, and I had hoped for a better end to the end, but it only got worse and worse. If it were marked below, ten would be negative. Learn from my mistakes and save your money and this time.
