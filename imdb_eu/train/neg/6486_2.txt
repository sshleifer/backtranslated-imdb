If there is one thing that Disney can do, it's a great ability to take a story and tell it again and again. The commercialization of Lady and The Tramp II was a great experience. Disney will destroy one of the most amazing classics ever. Spaghetti meatball scene also had. It's been done before! And this is what I think is a video intended (the whole concept is forbidden). Everything is just a refurbishment of the original film, as well as some of Bluthen's film sciences. The pair of Penguin and Walrus (forgotten by their names) is a poor copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana Ursula is another. They also repeat all their old lines. The songs are pathetic, really amazing. Until now I have never heard so bad songs. And the conversation is atrocious. It is pathetic and simplistic. In the positive side, at least the animation was a little bit decent. All common characters are not as annoying as they were (or maybe the Little Mermaid is less for lovers). Neglecting back, Melody just is so sickeningly cute that you can just vomit. I did it almost. Make yourself and your little Mermaid a fan to go. Do not waste money for that. True, it's not as terrifying as Jafar or Pocahontas II, but that's a little consolation.
