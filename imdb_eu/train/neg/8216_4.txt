And maybe Fred Sandford said "a lips." This released a film about an unknown public. And perhaps the name "Rue Morgue" was called "Fender Hellbender" and it was good. <br /> <br /> Five young girls, apparently cutting a house of a second football match. Get lost and stall in a small store that runs in the middle of the direction. In which the driver is parked in a SUV and suddenly there is a clear focus, but every girl decides to leave alone and not for a driver. But it comes to the driver, and there is nothing more than a dinged vehicle focus, the girls do not understand yet another reason. When the driver gets caught in the first place (yes it is) he enters a gun and disconnects and cries out, "how much did you see?". Of course, girls are afraid of death and I do not know what he's doing. <br /> <br /> When the girls throw up at night, they will play cat and mouse with the dreamed driver, who manages. so that girls can cause all types of harm, because they did not want gun blows and converters. In the end, he realized that something happened that happened in the store, which is why it is the motive for the psychotic rage of that woman. And finally they have the opportunity to revenge and go among themselves. <br /> <br /> The elements of this film are disturbing and terrifying, but sadly, bad moments are a bit of a bad moment. , bad conversation, and transitory credibility. A girl has been shot by a gun and is injured and feels cold, she is going through the eyes of her life, but has it got better? And how far can the mini-van come when almost the gas is almost empty when it's 80 kilometers at a speed? I need one of these things, apparently it's still a mileage. <br /> <br /> They should end when the girls got their revenge, but the film continues a bit, that is, the top spot, but at least they learn something about women, and the driver is still worried about "her shaking my mother's van ", this is definitely the concern of anybody. <br /> <br /> So, this isn't the worst film I've ever seen, but it's very amateur to make it good, and it's still very scary and terrifying to be absolutely horrible. But it takes the cake with plenty of empty hysteria and you want to put it in your ears if you see this. Which, by the way, I do not necessarily recommend. 10 to 4
