This movie is horrible. CGI blob tiny gray CGI is very cheap. The crocodile looks like a big gray color. It's the worst, it's not striving or looking alive. It's mostly a CGI that sells photography, awaits the scene and expects to see almost the handheld moving on the CGI screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI I have ever seen, and I've seen very bad Sci-Fi Channel movies. <br /> <br /> Exceptional shortage of special effects, throw away. They are commonly used by ordinary people with low-cost people who work like waiters, because they put them at some local tables waiting for their big leaps. Perhaps the most horny scene in this movie is that a little boy tries to attack Kate sexually and the giant crocodile jumps out of the water. The second floor of the Villains Residence and the balcony overlooks the bad man. Instead of breaking directly into the bottom of the chain and the building (and crushing Kate), Croce goes back to the same angle. Physics laws may not apply this film or special effects. There is at least one honor among crocodiles.
