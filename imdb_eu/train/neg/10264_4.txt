The head of a typical New York family works with Jane Gail (Mary Barton), a smaller sister, Ethel Grandin (Loma Barton), in "Smyrner's Candy Store". Mrs. Gail and her Moore police, Matt Moore (Larry Burke), have rescued a young threat of virtue after being seized by sellers and prostitutes who are selling slaves as a slave. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < it's very different. Perhaps, it is accepted as a film that has worked with an extra unusually long topic (originally ten coils). Over the years, New York's location scenes are the main attraction. The panoramic view of the prisoners behind the bars is memorable, the other camera seems to be something capable of moving cameras. <br /> <br /> **** Arima circulation (13/13/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
