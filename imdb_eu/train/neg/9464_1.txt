Well, the previews looked fun and I usually do not go to the movies at the opening night, especially because it's with my kids ... you never know. Here's a movie that looks like a child or an adult. Jokes are very wrong for kids and they are totally flat for adults. I was really ashamed of having been with my 9 or 6 year olds and I had to explain my 6 year age to what S H * T generated. In essence, the total conversions of the classical Seuss doctor is here. He adds an evil and naughty neighbor who wants to marry his children's mother. If it were a sub-plot, it might be fine, but it would be the main plot of the whole movie and the role of the "cat" role more plays for the neighbor to really show the mother for her. Take my advice and read the book and give it to the movie.
