Unfortunately I do not remember the book, but I remember I was fascinated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This film is a typical German production of low quality. He does not care - even if the story itself is fine, it is wrong. In the center of misery, they are exaggerated and exaggerated characters; They do not have any hint in their interpretations. Joachim Fuchsberger and the well-known and well-known German actresses Eddy are not saving their bad shows. However, hope is ... These films are said to be better and better. As a result, I must say that this film is not a movie screen, but it may be enough in a quiet afternoon.
