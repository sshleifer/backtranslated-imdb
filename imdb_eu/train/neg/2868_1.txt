This is really an insult to BTK killer victims and their families. The events in this movie are not very close. Why they could not make a movie about real events, it makes no sense as true events are more interesting as they make up a festoon. Do not waste your time watching it for free. A shameless description of a low budget and a joke, this is really a movie. I would give 10 movies if I had permission. The play was sucked and it seems that they shot a 80-year-old VHS camera. Save your time and money if you do not see this movie.
