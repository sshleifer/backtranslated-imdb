Want to watch this movie? I would say: go! It can be a good movie / documentary without narration. But music, narration and some storytelling lines make it very difficult for a skeptic like myself. Following some animals, we are seeing animal soaps in their lives as an animal soap. But the melodramatic point of view is only cut to me, as well, when a predator finally captures a predator (there is an exception left) the camera will increase or jump into another scene. I wonder why it happens, if they are to show reality, why cut scenes still remain a melodrama story? I think morale is important for people's masses, after all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
