This movie was very clear. There have never been rhymes in all horror movies. Valentine will try Zero to make it an original. What is San Valentin anyway? A bunch of people came together a year ago to people. There is nothing original in Valencia. <br /> <br /> I only saw it once and there are some of the films that I've seen here. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3. Scream 4. There is another horror movie that someone else kills someone. <br /> <br /> I know there is more, but in my mind slowly it turned into a silk well. They could not catch him as fast as he could. <br /> <br /> Valentine did not have a good chance to be a good movie. Without a doubt, all horror movies must be "incredibly" killer, they do not care if people make their emotions spin on any scene. For a moment the friendly girl B-ch becomes nasty, then the woman is unstable, and so, the children. Valentinik is no longer. They tried to make the PG-13 but failed, so they stopped editing. <br /> <br /> Do not see this inspirational source if you do not hate yourself and want to kill yourself. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.
