I can not recommend this movie as a date movie. Gary Oldman is a semi-autobiographical life that lived on a South East London home, Dante is a violent and abusive account of one of the hell's circles. In the middle, it's Ray Winstone, but it's like that, but never. He opens the movie pub that he drinks. That's it and you feel the frustration to show in different ways throughout the film's career, self and barbarity. It's a play class masterclass. <br /> <br /> Of course, he disrupts and breaks down a paper, such as a drama, and Winstone is his wife who is paired with Kathy Burke, who is absorbing and denying her unbearable behavior. . Charlie Creed-Miles may turn Billy's fuse-illumination druggie son Billy, even if he sometimes asked him exactly what he left for himself. Gary Oldman directs the actress to maximize the claustrophobia of his crazy council. 4/10
