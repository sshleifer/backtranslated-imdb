In a movie in Africa, an actor was kidnapped and taken to the jungle to recover it. The producer has hired and recruited someone. Everything confuses the jungle canaries, who worship a really ugly "god" who wants to eat naked women. <br /> <br /> This movie is compelling. There are many levels of headaches and violence to mention violence against naked people. It is an exploitation film that is like the darkest part of our tradition, and if the movie was not so boring, it would be a classic movie. We look at it, despite gore, malignant sex and abuse, and this movie is a snoozer. The rhythm is far and away. There are multiple lines of land that are separated from each other, although, in the end, it has only one story. Worst, hardly anyone says anything. Most of the minimal dialogues say that a cruelty or a character says "I want to". The movie is calm and sad, if it were not the usual crash of the victim, I would recommend you to stay as an assistant. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to avoid, unless you have to sleep or if you do not have to watch it on all Euro-camel films. <br /> <br /> (Additionally, VideoAsia has released it in the Terror Tales series, which is an amazing printout from letter boxes, printed from a Japanese cut-off label for subtitling (it is cut to delete subtasks). Print does not have an open title .
