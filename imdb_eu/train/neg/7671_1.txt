The movie starts with a scroll text that lasts five minutes. What happens is a basic summary. This could be easily illustrated, but you'll get a text scroll effect. After bombing a bit with the characters you are studying, keep in mind ALL of them will learn about them. The plot begins on the ground and then goes through the whole movie. Not only does it change the land, but you also ask if you watch the same movie. I have never played video games, but I know people. I understood if you played this game, the movie is no better. Save your money if you do not want to sleep in theaters.
