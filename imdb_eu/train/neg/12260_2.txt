Sometimes I rest in my mind and I think of the movie about killing sharks and / or crocodiles. Since the 1970s, they have made copies of "Jaws" and they do not like the likes. The idea is still the same. So we have an animal that begins to die. First, it leads to some secondary characters, and then the main characters begin to attack, usually someone who is more pronounced than the pair, except someone who is usually expert. One of the main characters is killed before others kill animals, usually with an explosion. Then we get a final shot where we live animals, or eggs, etc. "Krocodylus" basically uses too many ideas, and it does not change anything. If "Specialized" is not the captain of this variant, in which case your standards are quite small. Duncan Regehr has played fun, but the Portfolio remains.
