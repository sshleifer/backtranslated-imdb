Interesting? Barely The film that proves its "scientific evidence" (that is essentially Jewish) is so stupid and rugged, it is almost laughter (if we did not know what happened at the time). <br /> <br /> Important? Nah. I can not imagine the Germans (even in great times) wanting or believing this movie. Compare with Riefenstahl's Triumf des Willens. Now I was surprised by the movie. This is a junk. <br /> <br /> The 'Best' section is one of the M (all of my favorite) scenes (as the Jew reminds us as eloquent) plays a Lorre child -molester and murderer. In front of these filmmakers, only a depressed savior can do this. Uh-eh. I do not know that Hitler's movie was a favorite, right? <br /> <br /> No, it's just STUPID. Native propaganda genres too. 2/10.
