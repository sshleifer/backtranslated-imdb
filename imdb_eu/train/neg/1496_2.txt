Evil Breed slasher is a very strange movie, unfortunately, not good. It seems promising at the beginning of the film, but in general it is a disaster. The conversation is pretty bad, but it's not as bad as acting. The act is brutal and unbearable. The characters are there horribly delivered to the line and, even if that is the purpose, the method does not work because the characters become annoying. Some dying are innovative, but it's been a lot longer. We get the first death (other than the beginning) and then all other characters are burned in the next five minutes. Then, the movie became a sort of hateful character, with characters that are hilarious, realistic karate, like fights and scene. A man pulls his intestines * sscrack. Nobody's funny it's just ridiculous. The film, at the same time, turns ultra-thin and ultra-amazing. Most of the characters are even sturdy though they are as strong as the standards. 5 day check-in. Evil Breed is also not laughably bad, so it fails its main task. Watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Just Before Dawn, or See Evil a real slasher.
