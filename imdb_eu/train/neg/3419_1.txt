OK, so Chuck Norris found some way to get this sort of way. I have a question - why? Who read this script and said: "Very good sound! Original!" This movie is crisp and I do not screw my toilet in the colon. Of course, another story, MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force tradition, etc. Chuck Norris, of course, is the only man who can be the same man as America is. It does not need a journal too. Stupid patriotic jargon exacerbates the mind. It's amazing that Norris's only film is Chucken's son Eric. Eric Norris has worked on all of his father's films and TV shows. Is not this as a sign that does not direct talent to anyone? Then, he directs the same old people as before ... the same story names of the characters. If the United States supposes patriotism and happiness, I think our country looks worse than ever. Fortunately, this will be the nail polish Chuck Norris coffin.
