Well, so funny is a fun lingo that is so busy with the coffin that kills anyone who is horrified at the movie. So, the first "cranial scene" is so funny and unpleasant. The real graphic of the film is sensible, at least in the minds of the characters, there is little real food for thought, and the plot is a decent imbalance for horror movies. The operation is average, not really bad. <br /> <br /> In total, this movie does not fall 1/10 as a movie. It's not enough to score the smallest or the second lowest score. If I just read the script, I can say that this movie is decent. It's just the direction and production that destroys the movie. So the movie is bad, but they are much worse.
