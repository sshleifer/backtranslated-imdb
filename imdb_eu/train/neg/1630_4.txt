Mary Pickford becomes the leader of a Scottish clan after her father's death, and then has a love affair. Commentators of Snow Leopard said the movies would start off. Some are fun, like Pickford taking his family to the church, some of them there. In short, the story is weak, especially the recycled and invented love line and its highest point. The transfer is so dark that the landscape is thankful, but that's why Maurice Tourneur does not seem to be the best work. Pickford and Tourneure collaborated once again in the book "The Little Little Rich Girl" in Pickford's child.
