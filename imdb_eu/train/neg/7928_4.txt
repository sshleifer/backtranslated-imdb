Actually, the movie is not horror or science fiction. With a very strong Christian theme, this movie contains minimal content and suspense. The secondary actors perform beautiful semi-laborious work. Sydney Penny's only good result is ... The mother is not ruining the movie, it is Christ or Anti-Christ. Do not try to watch this movie unless you are a Christian fanatic fanatic obsessed with apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Not because I was a Christian, because I wanted to write the review I needed to watch this movie. It is hard for the Sci-Fi channel to give this movie during the night.
