I will try to use words to describe ... <br /> <br /> I found that the original was a good way, but I would be afraid of a sequel. <br /> <br /> And I was afraid when I chose this, but now I have seen that, I must say, when I thought it was worse. Why still money I'm still making money in my head. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the actors, they are not good, but it must be said, some have their heads alternately. But what can the actor do with scripts like this? It's trying to be a copy of the original, this time the places have changed, the story disappears and the attempt to get something out of it is not successful. They try to make them become exciting in the empty attempt to update the day by taking advantage of the "big-brother" theme, but it's been released for a long time and is only available from the beginning. and end. An attempt has been made to save the movie '83 originals by making a ton of references, but it's just plain fun and sometimes sad. As a result, if you have nothing, and I do not mean anything, do ... go see or play Frisbee ... with DVD ... only. It will offer you the same amount of fun. I promise
