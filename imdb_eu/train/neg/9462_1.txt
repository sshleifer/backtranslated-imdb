Inadequate The PG classification obtained by this film is a huge misstep of MPAA. Whale Rider gets the PG-13, but does the film get a PG? Please. Parents do not get deceived, it is a mistake to take a basic school in this movie. I felt uneasy at times because humor was not suitable for children, but it was not blue and it was useless. <br /> <br /> But aside from all this, the Cat the Hat in the Hat movie is still awesome. The casting of the film and the passion for saving the overall look. Kelly Preston's beautiful and always enjoyable (or in this case Alec Baldwin) are both good in their roles, even if Preston was just as nice as this. The children are well-known actors and they show, above all, with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is keeping track of the film and not throwing away the only human aspect that kept things on my screen. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there was a big cat in the movie? Mike Myers is totally daunting. I did not like Shreken's voice mode, and I truly believe that Myers would not allow nearer children's films. The Cat's portrait is a bit of a fake version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. <br /> <br /> In the end, the cats would not come, it should stop, but it only came, even one day, it damaged 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of anger and personal conflicts. <br /> <br /> Hat in the Hat may be the worst movie ever.
