Originally I gave two points to this passage. Now, I'd like to think more about it. I also want to have negative rating choices. <br /> <br /> Looking at it, I was surprised at the beginning that everything in the end was poor. I love Ron Pearlman and John Carpenter ... so what happened? The last episode of episode 13 emerged when the abortion was handled by the problem. I think it could be something gray that this year's season Carpenter did. Immediately it is not possible to see pro-choice or abortion. When I first thought about it, I thought it was an abortion, it is clear that finally 'Mother' is shooting and killing the baby, for the "Father's" confusion. disgusting, leaving his mother damaged. But you also see what Ron P. looks like, I hardly believe that if someone has proved to be a threat in the past, it would not be possible to immediately call the police as a restraining order against him. . Instead, we take care of the guards almost sympathetically (only to pay for the end). It does not matter if someone has a strong vision, but I do not agree with anything, but I think that by avoiding the appearance of sitting a little bit in the middle, do not be in front of that view. <br /> <br /> But apart from political problems, this passage was beyond the poor. The music was retro-70s and it just did not work. The effect (not even Ron P.) was inadequate. The effects were terrifying: it would be better to not just show the monster, than to show excuses for a boy. <br /> <br /> That's all, I'm happy. I have not been a master of horror - I do not like to find good seats through some poor passages. It's as little as renting horror films at the video store. Sometimes you get a good and worth it. I accept that the name has to change from the Masters poster. Some of these people do not deserve the title. (Let's emphasize that when I hate this passage, John Carpenter is worthy of complete title, through this master).
