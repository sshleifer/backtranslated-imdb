This live video is another nail in a Moranis coffin coffin. As with Disney's tradition, quality is sacrificed on behalf of a cash-in; Moranis himself and some relatives may bend over the best scenes of the original movie. Immediate visual effects and crummy conversations are numerous in this cheesy lamer, which does not just pains me for me in The Incredible Shrinking Man days, this kind of thing was done correctly. An exciting one is directed by Dean Cundey, general manager, who should stick to the work day or the next best thing.
