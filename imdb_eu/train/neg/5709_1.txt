Nick Cage Gates is a treasure hunter (pardon me ... the "treasure" treasure, that is, whatever it is), a treasure trove that comes from a long line. One of his ancestors found the founder of our parents, most of them not all of them, hiding a huge treasure hidden in them, because they did not want to finance all the Independence poorly. <br /> <br /> The first track indicates that it is hidden in a hidden cave hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his team, Ian Financer (Sean Bean), Movie Dork Riley (immortal "Gigli" Justin Bartha) and a faceless face. They come in the ship's bucket. Directly they throw the volume of gunpowder on the ground, and it is not in any way significant. In the end, they find the track (the skeleton is above) and the puzzle is often written ... on top. Order Do not ask for explanations. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < In this frozen burden, the crew are empty. I mean it. Someone should have a little voice until they reach the Arctic freaking and find no interest, but they remain when Gates enters his world, fixing the riddle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The next thinking will be in the Declaration of Independence. Ian has decided to steal it. Gates is surprised. Many characters reveal themselves clearly (accustomed). All of this by the hand of Ian draws a cannon and a great explosion of gunpowder. Ian and his azaleas fled, and Gates and Dork Riley take nine kilometers of unfamiliar temperatures to an Inuit village to stop them. <br /> </ p> <p> After finishing the Gates stop, after the FBI and Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) Super Archivist try to steal Gates and Riley themselves. Riley then told Gates why they could not steal the Declaration, because metal and laser eyes and a high-tech security are protected by Blah blah. After Gates, tell Riley that he can steal from the care room. He knows what Riley is in the conservation room, Gates asks? "A place where jams and jelly do?" I'm not joking; It's a real line. Barth makes no jokes. So, Riley does all this research on the Library and Archives of Congress, and water and sanitation, fercryinoutloud, but he does not know what conservation room is. This pretty much explains what level of the script has. <br /> <br /> To make the rest of this short, Gates starts with D. a movie (I also hate the way the computer monitor technology is shown in movies - graphics and typographical fonts are improbable and non-practical.) Abigail Chase labeled as a comfort and an angle of "love interest". At some point, three illegally discussing their plans in the clothing store, surrounded by people. <br /> <br /> Some clues and Gates' father's kidnapping. Jon Voight is a dispeptic and directs good and evil to a great Indiana Jones restaurant underneath New York. An exciting thing in the subway was that thing that was ever found. Gates and Gates Senior will lead Ian to a wild goose. Ian thinks they are trapped in a ravine and leaves there. However, after he disappears, Riley asks how they will come out. Gates ... <br /> <br /> ... oh boy ... <br /> <br /> ... presses a button and the door opens. No, I'm serious. A button, like in an empty drainage of a building of the office. Well, I knew somewhere. However, after several generations, they find a huge treasure trove (remember, under Manhattan!) Has many gold pieces of history. Riley is really stupid. Again. And the FBI official Harvey Keithel forgives them, seizes Sean Bean, and no chemicals get married. <br /> <br /> For anyone, I think it is difficult to make all the explanations, jump. Logic and highly stereotyped characters. Even though some of his exhibitions include a pleasant story, the lesson involves random moments in conversations. My life would like more dialogue like that.
