The time spent watching this movie was wasted. I do not like science fiction. I do not deny any kind of genres, because it can do good work in any genre. This movie, however, is not a good job. I can not get the worst image (it's not alienating it) and the special effects are awesome. The story was not BAD out, to make a comic trekkish. But fx images were, of course, the interests of the makers / attention / money went. The direction was changed in a direction that was slow and confusing (no one accurately explained what he was doing and what he or she was at least in a crucial part). "Act" was very bad, especially. The base of most online readers was not "far from this page and the director told me that I thought he was crazy / dull / afraid, and that's why he was a pilot series SF. Since then, this is an excuse to make a direct elimination of essential areas for dramatic support. Is it that the rider sells the series, or is the money in the hands of technerd?
