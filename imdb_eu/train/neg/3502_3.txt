Sarah Silverman really is "the flavor of the month" right now. Is it really worth it all hype? Yes and no. Sometimes it's fun, sometimes horny (its usual rhythm is very interesting, but it's not always fun). In other cases, the media is misled by the removal of too much other interpreter. It is one of those really beautiful comedians who are very fond of them, saying they are drilling their minds and minds. But if you refuse, most men will recognize that they want to sleep with him, and that's why they see it. He reminded me that the men were marching by Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, because none of them were "very hot" now in terms of popularity. Sarah does not drink or smoke (at least carved); so it must be hot at the age of 60, so that its fans (especially males) will rejoice. <br /> <br /> In this show, it's a lot like his comedy. When it works, it's horny. When that is not the case, it is boring and very boring. AIDS episode is the best here. It's basically fun and has a very good satire. The character of Brian Poeshn has a healthy episode on Taba in a section, and it's fun to see Tab Tab) in a shirt. But they never go anywhere, and end up wasting their well-being. The Sarah character of the series is annoying, the pair (Brian Poeshn and another man) seem lined up and never does anything for the show, and companions (Sarah's real sister, Laura, among others). it's not like the same look). When jokes play hard, they are great. If they do not, it's horrible and really awful. Here too, coprophilia is an obsession (aka poop jokes), it seems to represent the true intelligence and comedy of today's mind. So you should see this show? If Sarah runs, go. You can look and pretend to yours. As for the show, it's good from absolute zero.
