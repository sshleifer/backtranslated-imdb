Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley's husband and wife team had a great star at the nursery, but they did very little film. In the case of other interpreters of their time (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence), they make Biopik about them, Fields and Seeley's most accessible footage, as they are portrayed by other actors. 'Somebody Loves Me', along with Betty Hutton and Ralph Meeker's starring song and dance. <br /> <br /> When Fields and Seeley were very fond of it, they also talked about their husband's wife's sleeve. - Jesse Block and Eve Sully - practically similar to almost similar stars, making Fields and Seeley a "second team". Offstage, however, was a great deal of difference in the life-size of couples. They lived in apartments in the Fields and Seeley apartments, paid for room rates for food, and eventually they had little money. Block and Sully lived the shelves and spent profits wisely, when they retired conveniently. <br /> <br /> There are two piano outfits in the first 30 seconds of this short Vitaphone. Apparently, these two men had their own name in value in 1930, although I never heard of it. In the end, Fields and Seely are starting and they begin to play. Both have a lot of peppers and quite attractive. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed as if they were dancing with two angry dances, but they never did it until the third. these three songs that are performed in short. In the end, when the hoofing begins, the results are not spectacular. <br /> <br /> I am pleased to see this opportunity to see these two main performers perform their faults. As I have seen, I understand why they never became a star in the musical films. My rating: Only 10 out of 10, and I'll join Block and Sully.
