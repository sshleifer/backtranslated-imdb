This is not the best of Arbuckle or Keaton movies, surely. Fatty's wife is tired of drinking it, and therefore leads to a healthcare provider claiming a cure for a psychiatrist (Keaton). Well, once there, Arbuckle accidentally eats the thermometer and leads to surgery. Then he runs away and he will meet a pretty girl who tries to escape. In the end, despite the fact that the staff continues, they escape and, of course, it becomes obvious that the girl is crazy and Arbuckle is soon recovered. However, he wakes up and after all had a dream surgery - he was not crazy girl sexy and Dr. Keaton is not as big as the dreams. <br /> <br /> Unmatched humor is the main problem in the film. Surely, mental illness is quite low, but that day they laughed. I would laugh, too, if it were just a fun thing to answer! It's a lot of energy and that's it. <br /> <br /> FYI - During one of the Chase sequences, Fatty takes part in a race for over 200 men (wow, what are their options?). And shortly after, the new number 5 was added to a post recently painted. As a result, he is at the back of the five Fatty T-shirt and is a regular contributor. However, the numbers should feature Fatty's shirt back, but the front ones have appeared - a mistake, they should have realized that it could go back to the mirror 5.
