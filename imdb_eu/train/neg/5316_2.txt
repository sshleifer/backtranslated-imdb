Take a reason. Bad thing ... you can still see it. Kol (Ross Hagen) is a type of bad intergalactic that evaporates by a buzzing commander of the space (Jan-Michael Vincent). Kole steals a falling shark that flows to the ground. An irresistible Andorious killer is sent to bring him to death or fast. John Phillip Law plays a knight in the woods / park, although he is required to face these two remotely remote visitors. The outfits are outrageous and the script is lacking intelligence. Vincent surely took the money and ran. Law shows only one sign of effort. It's badly comical. Also cast: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Suns and Dawn Wildsmith.
