What a horrible movie. I love monster films, but I can not see half of the performance, cardboard characters and special effects. There is nothing to exchange about this film. The characters are endlessly supplying suicidal stupid little cannon, or they are sneaking and sneaking. The drawing is a formulaic one, cut and paste, the standard of science-run masters. CGI is also horrible. You know you're not able to offer sweets when you're under the movie. It is not surprising here, the same old man. This is the worst film ever made. The director Roger Corman must be hanging in a clear position to use as a pinata for children.
