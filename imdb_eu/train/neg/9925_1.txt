Blazing Saddles's 30th anniversary DVD, very excellent, but this was not. I will never see the name of Mel Brook here and why I think it's a lot more not to be associated with this rider. My gawd, who would find it fun. Surely there may be a race problem, but it's not fun for me, but it's not just fun. Writers also do not want to be fun, to be bound by Blazing Saddles. Did they expect this show to go for a few seasons when they made this rider? Flat, they did not care. The charge was a fast cow, who did not thank God. I think it is useful only for historical purposes, or just to prove stupid and not thoughtful Hollywood writers.
