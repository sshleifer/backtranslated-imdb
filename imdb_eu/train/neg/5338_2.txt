Elvis Presley plays "Native American" "Middle-breed" ("Indian"), who needs to protect him from the evil typo of his reserve business. Everyone likes to drink, like to fight and create children. Fighting, fighting, and "punching out" to replace each other manually transformed manual expression "How"? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < probably, he was preparing his famous "return". It was not possible to excite the script of this movie. Joan Blondell wants to fascinate Elvis, and Burgess Meredith should be ashamed of "painting in war." <br /> <br /> The best song is "Stay Away" (actually with "Green Sleeves"). The most shameless song is Elvis's "Dominic" bull. There are some surreal scenes, but it's never been trippy to succeed in that genre; Although "Stay Away, Joe" you can offer some laughs if you're in "mood". <br /> <br /> <br /> Otherwise, keep going away. <br /> <br /> ** Stay Away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
