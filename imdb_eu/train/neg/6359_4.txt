Woody Allen, at its best, has one of the darkest feathers. It can perform sharp observation and gather around a punch line like any other person. However, his worst when blowing his films pretentiousness. Unfortunately, this smell of "Melinda and Melinda" closes and closes. The set is a bit one of its most interesting ideas. The four-person restaurant sits down saying essence of life as a comedy or a drama. To help solve the plot, a man asks him to start a story and two other men (one comedian and one dramatist) as a comedy or tragedy. Both men follow the story and show stories that weave on films. Now, when I heard about this movie, I understood how the story tells, how the genre (comedy or drama) looks at how it changes. Now that would be interesting. However, the stories are only part of the main element and side elements. They are different stories with completely different stories. The drama is so sharp and memorable because it only works as a self-parody. If this happens, these elements have failed because the audience prevents any emotional investment in any of the characters. Comedy is a story that has success-moments, but it's still short and fleeting. Will Farrell wants to be Woody's stand, but this character can be much more entertaining without the rumors and hands of Woody. Woody Woody is the best. When someone else tries, they do not play a character, they are modeling a popular actor. This sort of thing comes out of the audience. <br /> <br /> My favorite Woody Allen films leave me the spirit that stops me from dancing just as I did. The money that I could get could get my money back.
