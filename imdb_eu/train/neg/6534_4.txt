This science-fiction adventure is not the best and is by no means the worst. I agree that bad science fiction is comical. Bright and bizarre colors are special effects that are a favorite for late, late and late-night audiences. Space explorers on the Mars planet fight huge ameba-like monsters and other strange creatures. Pretty cool <br /> <br /> Throw Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Get comfortable and enjoy. Do not feel bad for a moment flashing. I do not miss the addition of adding to the classic worship list.
