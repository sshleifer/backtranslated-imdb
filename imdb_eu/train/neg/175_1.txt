Today I saw Cabin by the Lake in the US. Considering the film made for television, it was interesting to see the episode. So I go to the night ventilation and I was very disappointed. I did not know how I'd like the movie, but I did not expect the DV (digital video) to be mixed up. The film would be tolerable, as it does not seem to be from these nowhere digital shots. The ground line was expected to be linked to these planes, but there was no logical explanation. (NOTE: USERS OF USE!) On Lake Lake by Lake Lake was acceptable, but the end of the sequel is ridiculous. I can only see the return of Delay by old, unless you show the movie, but four-hour ads in the morning.
