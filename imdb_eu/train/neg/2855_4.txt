"Mad Dog Time" ... Everything you want to call "Happy Agree" ... just will not reach the mark. Maybe I just do not, maybe I do not like Gangster comedy (I think Oscar, Johney Dangerously and Mafia also sucked) More likely "witty sharp wordplay" than all comedies, which is not as cautious and sharp as. or other reviewers) Make it. <br /> <br /> Rick, Mick, old Vic Thing was old to watch a racing tournament. <br /> <br /> There was not enough location or feeling for the time they wanted to enter. Most of the movie was "Dreyfus's Club" or offices or dark rooms. .. (Goldblume was sitting next to Gun Gun?) <br /> <br /> Paper support ... Excellent paper (excellent Silva and Drago watching) but the characters died earlier. they had time to develop. and Richard Pryors was a joke! The Romance and Love of the film has also fallen. <br /> <br /> 4/10 I do not think I'll be back soon.
