How can a big German television channel make such a mix? It's amazing that the main actors avoid all the acting talents. Famous Gottfried John is playing bad - especially the scene of double murder - how amateurs .......! The screen plan is very, very widespread, maybe 2 parts of the movie. Be careful when you sleep watching! The set is often a blue screen, for example. Unreal ship on the back of the ship's scene ...! In the German version sound and dubbing are very bad - probably the reason: different actors' languages ​​- but other international productions are much more professional. Tips: Do not see - the loss of time is diabolical!
