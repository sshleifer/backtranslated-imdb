... well, write on the DVD, lose an hour and a half of your life that you never came back and know. <br /> <br /> Do it? What caused? <br /> <br /> Production values? ... Production? ... Values? <br /> <br /> The story? Do not start with me. <br /> <br /> After many years of publishing on the IMDb, I never thought that I wanted to see the movie so badly, the only thing I wanted to see so much. I have always found at least one or two reasons to see merit - only the effort or effort of a writer, director, cast or producer? <br /> <br /> In this case, 'It's really sensible (!) to be aware of himself, at least as a video tape waste shows, that talent does not. Intelligence would be reasonable, if this was a "second generation" of its first film class, but this twentieth-century "artist" was behind this dreck during this warning. <br /> <br /> How did they get that? Who wrote in his head a right check? Also, do not let the box cover fool: there's nothing remotely like a good sex scene or a "good" exposure to the touch of that cover. <br /> <br /> The last two elements: there was no second, when the "film" was recovering, the aforementioned "talent" was wounded by her lover. I was cheering! And I learned something from this "movie". Sometimes something is very bad, it's really fun. But not in a comic way; unfortunately it is humorous. It's very funny.
