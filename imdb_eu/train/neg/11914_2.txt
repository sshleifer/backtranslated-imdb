Shiri Appleby is the smallest appearance of evil, beautiful girl to demonize Buffy clone, Elle. But I anticipate myself, you will see the first divine woman as a friend of Lilith Adam. But she got an evil female feminist, God exiled her from Eden. He fights the clandestine order called The Fath, but does not kill him, so now the amnesia (which does not really appear well) has to fight with a curse of Lilith (now Elle). Lilith's blood injected the scientist. <br /> <br /> If the previous paragraph is hidden clutter, that's it. The film is dull, general and with a plot with a plot of land, it seems that it does not know about it. The CGIed basement film on the screen was a series pilot series. What I do not receive is to say Amen Amen. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> DVD More: Writers / Directors Bill Comment Platt and Chris Regina; and Stills gallery; video effects samples: before and after (there is also a "available" selection THINK would take you to some tuna, but not for other DVDs on DVD covers, it's a stupid idea) <br /> <br /> Extra DVD-ROMs : the latest shoot script and the transcript of the deleted scene in PDF format
