"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) brings together a group of high school, where Wes's twin brother was in the place where he was missing. While there, a man-like reptile (a large part of MY CROSS CULTURE remembered me) will be waiting for you in the desert by choosing the right moment to select it individually. The motorcycle, Ellen Ripley's coins, undergoes Kat (Chase Masterson) underground military bunkers and also has a safe place. Much more than what Kate says (she has also suffered loss), but another novelty is that most of the team do not know. It is possible that this creature is more than human than understanding ... and the old identity can be a scam by a person who has just been killed by Wes. Kat has the key to many mysteries that unlock the cabin. It is near the cabin. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a large part of the film jumps in the air and we also see it. When the screen looks at the clouds through the eyes. The film has melodramas of Dawson's Creek, which often hinders the real tension that needs to be built in a monster. Management is very soft, and experience is rather dull instead of fears. Work has less life and no interest. Maybe Pretty Maggie Grace (THE FOG remake) could be the only draw for this movie.
