Several films have been based on the same subject. A pretty girl loves to be pretty, she pays for it, and then (what's up?) She falls in love with her, following a row, everyone is happy before the happy ending. It has been done several times. <br /> <br /> The thing is I know it before seeing it. However, however, I went ahead. In this hand, it can be a nice way to spend a couple of hours with a good cast and a good script. <br /> <br /> It was not one of them. <br /> <br /> This was it. <br /> <br /> Women's lead charm or spirits, without even making the slightest spark for me. I really did not care if he had "gotten the man" or whether he was lonely or unhappy. <br /> <br /> A male lead, after endless words of his wisdom, wanted to kill me. To get boring eyes. I did not know how to make a living for a male bitch was the path of illustration that everyone knows. <br /> <br /> Realistic films full of realistic people. none of them seemed to have a job, they made more money than everyone, the husband and wife still continue their marriage, after learning that his best friend was having a good time after sleeping ... plus "never met" !!!!! Keep up I realized, but I noticed that I was wasting more time ... I could only add a character to make a very cheap laugh of "woody", but this was the only mood that happened in the film.
