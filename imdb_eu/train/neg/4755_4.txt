The start was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the film were good. The first 30-minute camera angles were strange and I did not like them completely if they did not cover the actors. <br /> <br /> In the last 25 movies we did not really expect much in the movies we expected. <br /> <br /> The dialects did not make sense and I did not think they were very exciting. <br /> <br /> I felt that they were trying to copy phonotypes in conversations, but miserably failed. It seemed a lot of scenes among actors. They came for their sake and did not make sense of the story. <br /> <br /> The entire film shows only law and deceit. <br /> <br /> I do not think it was a waste. In time, OK is a movie, but not gr8
