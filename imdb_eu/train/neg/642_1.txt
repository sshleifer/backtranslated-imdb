First of all, if you are a fan of comics, well, I'm sure you'll be very bad! Low budget movie !!! It's a Serb long in the comic, and now it has suddenly become a Croatian, pfff! chicken producers, spoilers and gigs (incidentally, in the film the Serbs speak and their father in Croatian ... Lol). N.Y. The huge Winch building is a medium-sized small H.K. Long look into Tzigan / Turk's pretentious guy. Freddy's cool scarface becomes a bit of fat, apparently dull, average. Simon, long good friend, does not exist! He gave some peppers! Largo does not throw a knot, but a snake looks at it ... The whole story is mixed up and seems like a TV fan. If you do not have the money, if you do not have the money, if you have the ability to adapt the comic or technology, you will have some love in Paris. Very bad movie, the good thing I have rented, do not keep track of me (if any!).
