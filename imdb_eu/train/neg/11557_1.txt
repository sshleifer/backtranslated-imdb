SOILER * is false! The whole thing is false! There is no ghost or area, Alan is Lord, and his cousin or brother or half brother or the like wants the castle and his title. So, SCOOBY-DOO invested a very complex and absurd plan to encourage Alank to commit suicide. Most of the films include redhead and attack them. He does not die too. She sleeps and she thinks she is gone and buried in some place. If you look at the so-called Evelyn Phantom, he could say he's wearing gloves! God, the loss of time. Do not worry if you do not rent or buy and still do not see, sell. Fast! Stay aside and follow the remote EVELYN CAMRE THE GRAVE. I'm giving this crab a CRAP-O-LANTERN.
