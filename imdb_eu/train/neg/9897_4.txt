I found this good movie to overcome your time, but there was no historical value option. Thanks to the portrait of Cleopatra, they reminded me of a cheap TV show. <br /> <br /> It's an event tour ... fun! When he was born he fed his people !? Oh, please ... Egypt's pregnant queen (especially this one) would not have trouble moving from one room to another, that's why! He tried to appear a saint in the name of God! And it was a way of preventing her killing her sister ... beyond the description. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra was the main politician of his time. His decisions were exceptions to his feelings and morals. It only made two reasons: power and self-preservation! He lived in a family in danger of survival, something that he did very well. Everything on his way was killed (his brothers and sisters) or fascinated (Ceasar and Mark Anthony). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Octavian was powerful to kill Octavian and too ... to captivate gay. So the end was ...
