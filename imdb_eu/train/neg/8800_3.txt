Deleted scene and other alternatives, jointly edited and added to the voice, so that it happens after the first events. A pretty quick idea, but the eliminated scene cutting room floor remains a reason and this is more proof. Since it's not as funny as "Anchorman", and let's actually say that the movies do not have a golden comedy, so you get "movie" worse than a fun one. In my eyes STILL places one or two points on "Kicking and Screaming" or "Bewitched". Your left hand is "The Wedding Crashers" returning to the old school (without any mistakes) <br /> <br /> My grade: D
