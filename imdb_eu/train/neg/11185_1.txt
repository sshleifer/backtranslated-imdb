Yes, MTV is really a way to market Daria. He started as a nasty young teenager who was "chained to the audience's teenage life" and said that he was "chained to your problems". I saw Daria all the time and I loved it. Now, seeing the "movie" that is called here, I am here to ask what is going on. How does Daria lead us to university? Sorry? Was not it a good idea to do everything that Daria wants to do in every part, even if it does not do well to you, what is it that thinks the rest of the world's illness? All things reminded me of the scenes in the movie "Reality Bites", which shows the first movie documents for the movie.
