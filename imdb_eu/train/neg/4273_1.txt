There's nothing in the TV series or film. What is before the TV show, which has not been found in all life and entertainment. Two before David Lynches, story teller, and then. <br /> <br /> At one moment the wrong girl washed her body on the beach. Going into the harshest nature of the giant and darker Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> The head of pedophilia is almost insolent, it seems that the film destroys human beings by means of random ones. Psychedelic phenomenon Movie Peak: Fire Come Walk with me. <br /> <br /> I saw everything, they did not guarantee me anything. I did not. It's just a hilarious pornographic movie over a man who has spread over a long fetish sex. Keep yourself awake and look at at least the ability to tell the story, but it will captivate you to a type of mental thinking movie. <br /> <br /> I've heard a lot of reviews and scams. and how great was David Lynch. Defining misery and tragedy as a capacity for becoming a wonderful thing. This is not an imitation of life art, but an evil twisted version of art that strives to inspire everyone without a headless life. <br /> <br /> Get ready and avoid this garbage.
