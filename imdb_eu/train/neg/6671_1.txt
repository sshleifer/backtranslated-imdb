I thought this movie started well. The performance was in detail and I felt the status of all the characters, although the real family unit was not fully revealed. We never had the effort to really feel pain about her father for her total involvement or the construction of her bizarre Tobe. I mean, in a scene he admires with admiration for the tension and in the other scene he comes out of his head. Another issue of the movie was clarified and eventually he lost all the focus, and I asked him to finish. Any movie that is too long and painful can not get an automatic rating of 7 points or more for playback. We look at the whole quality of film experience. In the case of this movie, the end was so bad that I just got into the theater. This movie threw me at me and then dumped me.
