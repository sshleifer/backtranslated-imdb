After watching some of HBO's great things - Band of Brothers, Rome, etc. - I have to say that I have had quite a lot of hope before seeing the first episode "True Blood". Jeez. Often, writers who seemed to be 8-year-old draft, shot a few episodes (bill), I mean, it wakes up the meaning of "scene". It gives the chain a guy and ow! It stings at the neck and magically! This was quite embarrassing if you wanted my opinion. Or, at some moments before that scene, when the pair has gone to meet him, he listens to hilarious things and 5 seconds later, magic! 3 of them disappeared and they did not make any fights or noise or anything! <br /> <br /> I mean, the idea of ​​the show seemed interesting, mysterious, interesting. in our modern society ... but to be honest, I do not think that they really wanted more than just a soap show, that average teens see all the time, but no one cares ... Unfortunately, the script is poorly written, In the best case, it is superficial and very predictable. I often thought that this was a joke or something. <br /> <br /> The actress gives bad performances, if you like my opinion. It seems that the show is very light, if the low-budget family television was a regular show-perhaps, perhaps, what it is, if you take away the family. Stephen Moyer's role was Stephen Moyer's unique role as the only actress, considering short misspellings, "What are you ...?" Do you have a call at some time ... "I think someone needs a vampire I think he's reporting to the terrifying mysterious person. Anna Paquin is fine, but not anymore. But the boy, though he plays his brother, is horrible. The deceased scene is just the shame of modern TV. The act is bad, the construction site is barefoot, and the other two men "Why do you arrest him? Uh ... I do not know ..." This was quite embarrassing. <br /> <br /> I think it was completely overcome, something that Sookie's psychic power presented. People listen to what they think and at the same time they speak and that is wrong. It often seems vain to me to be chaotic, as if it were an abusive box of people's opinions, and when it comes to it, it gets a good level of frequency and everything that one thinks will be heard. <br /> <br /> And, finally, sex scenes are clearly useless and this vampire sex tape was a totally awful thing. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it - I wrote all these comments because I thought it was a BAD, but I was very disappointed. I expected quality things. I did not think it was like that. Certainly not a good show. In the middle.
