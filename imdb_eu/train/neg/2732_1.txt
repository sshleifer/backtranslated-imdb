My Leaving Vu, My Leaving Vu, when I was released last season, I was happy. Scrubs, I thought, in the concept of clip-show, is doing something fast and special. Instead of reproducing the footage, they joke, consciously, and I really liked it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I found it was really wrong. A year later, almost all the sitcoms fled to the one they did inevitably, the clip show ... and the work experience seemed to bring the boys together. Dr. Cox's headshift shows how the editor put them together, as "My Long Goodbye" does not appear after four episodes. I can not imagine a wig when there is much effort in maintaining the continuity of what was once a built-in sitcom. Who knows why he was there, seemed lazy and out of place, reminded me of the episodes that appeared in the air last year (largely). Extra DVD (very) for rainy days, not a first episode of television.
