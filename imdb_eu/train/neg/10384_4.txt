... This is it! A very elegant premise, bat. <br /> <br /> It has an excellent first scene, because it has credits to give credit. <br /> <br /> Strong characters and strong enough script for the ghost story. But here are the things that worry me: every time the ghosts appeared, I really liked it; how was it done, how to look ... the only ghost relationship was. As things went down in the first scene, you would think that the dynamic would be different. <br /> <br /> I felt the things a bit slowed down in the middle, and the crab or spider scene was just not good. BUT, then the end is really good! Of course, 'The Grudge' basically told the same story with a polished lens, but not samurai, and I liked this movie quite comparatively. <br /> <br /> Please, someone has renewed the style with a tempered style <br /> <br /> This film would be very much liked by fans of 'Silent Rage'.
