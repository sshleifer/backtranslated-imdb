One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The rhythm was horrible for both children and adults. Most people did not show little or no emotions. There was a frightening illumination, and there were too many blends around the day when the movies were shot (when the ship was destroyed, there were 4 shots, the sheriff and the father on the afternoon aboard, Jillian and Molly swim at night, the rest of the day by the children * afternoon by the river, and the doctor, Beatrice and Simonton is supposed on the night, but the afternoon are not taken off the boat.) The best actress of the film was the Sheriff, Cappy was probably (although the character is a pulse detector *. When people die, the sound signals * shows that Cappy has died, it still moves and listen to the beep, while the nurse stretches the pulse to the other hand, while again releases the pulse and eventually dies.) I think it will not be perfect because it is an independent film, but it may be better. It's not worth watching, honestly, even for kids. Also, you could watch something good, if you remember those like Lion King or Toy Story.
