I'm a great Western fan, but this ... I, what a stinker! I think that almost the lie that turned me off was a different conversation. I think I had a better conversation than I was in eighth place. And the actors! In this terrible conversation, none of them was ridiculous. Actually, I'm not joking. All this is a little better than what Ed Wood has achieved. <br /> <br /> Sterling Hayden is the biggest tragedy. Most likely, this was the "big star" of this movie, if it was called B-West, it would be full of praise. This is called B-minus Western. Pity Sterling Hayden appeared in other times with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra and other great talents. In order to be able to appear on a vehicle, he had to try to reduce the poverty for the rest of his life. Weeks and faces are greasy. I know western guys did not always fit in well, but this film for man "EWWWW!" It's just you! Really, this is Western Western. Denver Pyle also had to live, especially after appearing a lot of Westerns. Bad movie, bad
