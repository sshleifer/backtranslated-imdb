This is a male boy who was very inexpensive. The video is dark and badly lit. Audio is different and poorly recorded and mixed. The script looks like a cloth of the costume, with the usual characters that shoot the usual gun shooting man. [of course matching silver bullets]. The play is as wood as character. FX do not exist, extreme cheeks and bumps come close. The only thing that is shown is the soft-core T & A. Instead of dropping 30 dollars for this crew, see the latest white man picture: "Dog Soldiers" with Sean Pertwee.
