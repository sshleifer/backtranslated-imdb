I love John Saxon in the store. At the moment of taking the camera, "Please, do not watch this movie, it's a movie called zombie death". The $ 1,000 dollar Shock Insurance Certificate is Fred Olen Ray, a beloved 70-year-old, a fun way to spend on a landfill filmed in a 70-year-old cheese legend. Ray was in front of RetroMedia. Ray performs like that on the Ford Falcon Falcon stucco floor. Now bad, both now and boring. It is very good that Ray is creating old things and in some cases is a public domain, like the rest of the videos of the dollar, but in the case of Zombie Death House (the word "Zombie" is part of adding sloppily property and interest) to this unique SERVICE ON THIS SERVICE It's DOLLAR MARKETING FOR DEVELOPMENT COLLECTION AND SAXON'S DOGS! If you want to see the authentic Saxon, pick Black Christmas, Nightmare Elm Street or The Glove.
