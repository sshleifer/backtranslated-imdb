movie was banned in England? why? tom savini, george romero, dario argento, lucio fulci and others have done so much worse, since they have continued ... <br /> <br /> This film has all the basic elements of the early 70's or 80's. film beautiful girls (they can not save their lives, by the way), a terrific storm with a golden storm, a mule, a crazy brother on the family's property, and eventually it will be pretty bad. . but is it forbidden? serious When the Parliament of England prohibited the movie, the Italians probably laughed at their collective donkeys backward and the wise men were really British. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < there was very little). There was nudity but not sex, although there were referrals about sex. but there was nothing to be forbidden. <br /> <br /> I would like to see if filmmakers could have a decent budget for working. As it stands, the movie is entertaining, but the quality of the image and sound is missing out on the final result. <br /> <br /> banned ... what a joke ...
