The original is not near. The copy is quite accurate, bringing nothing new in the story. Management is very poor. Basinger is weak, without good management. Baldwin McQueen is just a second league. I saw curiosity, being a fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I thought what I got. Second film directed and directed by B B, second film. I was not disappointed, I do not know what they wanted to do. This remake does not try to play with the original material, it's not a tribute and, in fact, it's a good actor of his time. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a bad copy of Xerox with wonderful photos. br /> <br /> This is a waste of your time. Save 2 hours or view the original (again :))
