This is a movie about men thinking about women's love. A woman does not describe nightly sexual encounters and declares a love story. <br /> <br /> Of ten monolays, I only felt three really through these kinds of truths. I was waiting for the movie to improve, and it did a little bit, but it's never better enough. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting concept, and I wanted to be good, but never got it. Maybe they really love stories, he worked.
