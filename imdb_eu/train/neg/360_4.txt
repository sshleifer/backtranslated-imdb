I read the book and I really enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. However, when I saw the movie I was very disappointed. First of all, there was no hindrance to Deborah Raffin, but she was a 24-25-year-old woman. Mr. Christopher Reeve had the same reasons. According to the book, Will was 30 years old. I would like to see a bit more about his military life, his friend Red, to explore the Elly journey, a major part of the development of the characters' history. Also, Miss Beasley did not write badly, as the book said she was one of Plus Size. I know the movie has not been released on the budget of "Brison Of Madison County" at the same time. <br /> <br /> But for me this was very bad, it was a small budget, a short film. As someone said, Miss Spenser would retire and would like to write the scripts of his books. He knows his character better than anyone else, I hope he even makes a question. Leave me in the movie!
