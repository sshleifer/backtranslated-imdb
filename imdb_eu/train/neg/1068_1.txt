My wife and I finished the movie and came to the IMDb, to find out about the movie that was just enough to meet with the reviewers. However, in 10 review pages, only a handful is negative. I think this movie is an incredibly awesome concept and I would like to warn those who want to see the movie in the future. <br /> <br /> I admit I have more inspiration to write opinions. I do not like a movie as I do, so my reviews are a bit negative. However, this does not mean I'm not going to enjoy the movie, but I often find more eloquent reviews in movies I enjoy. seen in years Using an "intelligent" story and adding great talents among many great stories, the movie ends with the worst of all the world. Art is for art, but a 2-year-old boy is something to dream and fulfill. The free 5-minute minute watch director demonstrates task distribution and entertainment. Writers can not write, writers can not correct. (I'd like to get Clint Eastwood overburdened, but that's because the actor turns into a director [which rarely works]). <br /> <br /> What finishes on the screen is what it is. The story disorder that does not make any sense, ends in 5 minutes and is generally damaged in Paris. Why is Paris je t'aime calling when he proposes more titles for the cluster f * ck? There are only unbelievable stories, a remarkable piece by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, but everything else will fall into the darkness. Coen's brothers are short, but can not you call a movie called the guitar? All the directors decided to do everything they wanted, and Paris was chosen to make the place. As we all like Paris, like today's company, we have blinded this film because of SUCKS. In fact, I think that the names of the directors were placed on each of the short films, because the directors considered that they were a movie's poverty and they only guessed it for 5 minutes. Serious SERIES <br /> <br /> People, Natalie Portman is NOT a good actor. It is not your dream that awaits a little girl with a dream come true. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, why?!? Are you bouncing or bouncing on other people's shows? I look at Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), Elijah Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full). <br /> <br /> A last comment on the activity: I give double Nick Nolte can do it happily if you play it and you will be more than ever in humanity. Find its summary in YouTube for 5 minutes that are quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Writing short stories is very difficult and only a few authors have been adjusted. I think Ernst Hemingway, Raymond Carver, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and John Cheever. It's much more complicated than writing a whole novel, and only talent can only be achieved. The same can be said of shorts. It seems that one single story director will last. <br /> <br /> If you protect yourself from your story and protect yourself from your Paris lens as a treasure that reflects and reflects on it, let's not expect it. enjoy this movie The managers did not care or were lazy. In both situations, when you are reading this, it means you have rented it. Fortunately I was not paying $ 10 in theaters.
