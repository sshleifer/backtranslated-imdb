Man oh man! Crispy movie! But this is the culprit of childhood pleasure, even if he wanted to accept it. This movie was shown on my basic cable system all the time. When I grew up in San Jose, California (grown on the Cupertino border), we called G Channel in our cable system. And they essentially showed the same film and again and again. Wanda Nevada was one of those films. I fell love and love with young Brooke Shields, and I loved the adventures of her lovers in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The scripts hardly make sense, the direction is inadequate, they hardly underline that Henry Fonda looks like a lot of conversation is so bad, it's good and Carole King's sweet singing over the final credits. Maybe you should be surprised to really enjoy this flick. And yes, everybody knows that there is no gold in the Grand Canyon!
