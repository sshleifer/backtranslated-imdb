I've seen bad movies. In most of the time I can enjoy a terrific horror movie. But this really leads to new horrors. <br /> <br /> It is not at all what, what the plot does never go anywhere and it takes its time. No blow, no fear, there is no suspense, it's just a load of boys and girls that carry half an hour. Then it's a fast finish. <br /> <br /> Avoid circumventing a horror genre, avoiding it accidentally. . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
