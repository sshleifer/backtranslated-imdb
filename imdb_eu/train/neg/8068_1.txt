I did not have much hope for this movie while renting $ 1 in a video store, but the box showed at least a small promise of "More gore! More sex!" Can not go wrong! Well ... there is no need to say it, it's a cheating box. How was it cast by the actors and actors for this movie? <br /> <br /> Everything opens at a rabbit home with a drunken man in such a building. his boyfriend (?) unnecessary havoc (a steadicam wrong camera continues). Then a guy follows him in a clear plastic mask and another has caught him. They will cut bracelets for no real reason, and you will see someone say "cut", someone who drew them in their drunkards with a masked look. <br /> <br /> From there, repeat the same subject on the little girl. / Two boys have died dead for about 84 minutes. Add a chip Soul Survivors da. <br /> <br /> I would not have had a problem with renting the movie that cheated me with this movie. I rent a bad movie about violence and having sex ... I want more violence and sex! A child is not afraid of cutting a 85-minute shotgun that does not fear a baby who does not fear a baby. If this is a Killer Cut, what is the Theater Cut? Of course, I would first doubt that this junk was put in theaters. Honest actors of this film. I saw the screen debut because they did not do anything before, but all were set before it was released. I do not know what to do before filming and sitting in the studio when the names were half-lengthed. But what do I want to know ... did they actually spend $ 14 million in this movie!
