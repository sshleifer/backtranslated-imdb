As a critic of many websites in Holland, I have to watch many movies and not very good ones. Some movies are so bad, you're not surprised that the video will be released live. With Taboo, IÃ¡m is surprised that it has been posted on the video. Bad budget is a bad quality and a low budget. <br /> <br /> A young group plays a taboo game. They write their desires or their most evil behavior, and then they kill people for their taboo. The question is: do we need to believe what we see? <br /> <br /> The movie plot may be of interest and I will not give it here. But what can be interesting is keeping the fool, the bad, and without any reason. <br /> <br /> Some actors have previously played in larger titles, so why did they register for it? If you see anywhere, try avoiding it. There is no logic, there is no human sense of quality in this film.
