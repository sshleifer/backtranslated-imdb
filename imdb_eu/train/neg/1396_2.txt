Experiments on Secret Governments and a film about films that routinely and secretly utilize the inhabitants of the people was a very interesting movie. But he failed me. I'm not going to work on rough lines much, but if you're looking for a specific explanation, the comment made by "reluctantpopstar" gives a good overview. <br /> <br /> But he did not work for me. I was slow, that is, I would feel well, but it did not seem anymore. The viewer leaves in the dark about the many things that can be said about this movie - in some movies, we can argue that filmmakers wanted to think about it and that's why they brought ambiguous things. I do not think that's happening here. <br /> <br /> As for other long-standing buildings mentioned by other users ... I see that they have a point. give the audience the time to lose a "drink" without getting any other drink. And I suspect that many audiences will have the opportunity to have many drinks on board.
