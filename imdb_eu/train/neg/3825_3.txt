This weekend I watched the movie and I was amazed at the beauty and dirt of the films produced in the Church, I was so disappointed that this was so short, without leaving the information to the members without leaving many unanswered questions. > <br /> Films with 70-minute drawings by Joseph Smith. There is no truth biopic, there is no real coherent narration. Most of the episodes make good acts by Joseph, playing baseballs, running races and laughing with children, often with movement. What a big, just kind of people was Joseph, huh? Look at Emma, ​​look at the rugs in front of her. Well, how about her 33 women's plural carpets? There is no mention in polygamy. A neglected look. <br /> <br /> And they're unknown, such as the movie blurs. It gives little information and the audience asks for critical thinking. Why is he eating Jose and his featherweight? Why do he throw himself in prison and why do he want to kill people? The end of the film is, of course, a journey through Joseph and Hyrum's jail in Carthage (the real faces of the United Nations, seen from the Nauvoo gates). But he never mentioned why. Smith's Nauvoo Exhibitor's newspaper and his removal of the press did not undermine the secret teaching of polygamy. The viewer is strangely or unfocused in the Church's basic attitude. The betrayal of Joseph to declare the crime law is not mentioned and he called Nauvooko militia. <br /> <br /> Of course, I did not expect this film produced by the Church to present the latest biography of Joseph Bush's Richard Bushman Rough Stone. Rolling, but I was surprised and surprised by how much substance was actually presented. <br /> <br /> And, even worse, what was presented in many substances was incorrect. They jumped two examples. First, the translation of the Mormon Book. The movie reads directly from Joseph's two lace-ring bundles, where the actual plates are hidden away from the site. It is known that Joseph had buried his face on his hat, and he had a look at the rock. This second accuracy occurs in the jail of Kartaga, where the mafia comes out of the cell. The history of the church has been reported to have had six shooters, and even shot several times before leaving the window and giving a masonical signal of distress (published in the Times & Seasons magazine). <br /> <br /> Perhaps showing Live reality would cause the tricks of heart by the filmmakers, but the reversals were unbelievable throughout history and failed, as José really was: he was able to defend himself with a gun. In fact, the impression that the film could have said could be sensible to Joseph, but something that was slowed down by all, even thrown into jail and eventually killed by cold blood. He was far from afar; Joseph was a sharp and decisive man, suffered many pains and believed that he was fighting for opinion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See the movie, but find out what happens with cotton candy. Then take your flesh and potatoes when you read Bushman's Smith, a copy of Rough Stone Rolling's biography <br /> <br /> PS: The films produced by the Church have no credit, but they recognize some more elegant eyes . Rick Macy is superb Joseph Smith, Mr. and Bruce Newbold, the beloved Thomas, who found himself in love with Christ to find Faith, had a bad Christian methodist who did not show Christian love to a young descendant of truth.
