This could be a strong candidate for "The Worick Flick Ever". Without John Hurt's presence, it can be tolerated as a child movie. However, all this effort is TRAGEDY, John Hurt, one of the biggest screen actors, thus decreases ... I gave him two points. Hurt SHOWED UP ... when I got 8 points, it did not start quickly. It's as frightening as the rest of the cast. Janine Turner, as pretty as she can, can not save her soul. And the main actor is AWFUL for all purposes and provisions. If you lose that embarrassment, please do it. It's so bad, it's almost complaining.
