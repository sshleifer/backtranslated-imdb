It's a matter of fact that Mr. Agrama's company (which is included in a bad business by former Italian Minister Silvio Berlusconi) created a mighty mish-mash by a Mr. Carl Mace. <br /> <br /> What is this mighty mash? I'm talking about that? Well, Mace picked up three similar Japanese science-fiction series (Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada) similar to that of believing in the narrative and artistic virtue of the American public. There was a lot of violent content, a metaphysical mumbo jumbo, dubbed by some of the worst voiced actors in Hell (which is still a Reba West song that is still unstoppable and especially Mrs. Mari, Iijima) ... And the result was a plot of hundreds of hundreds and holes in the series of 85-episode continuity. <br /> <br /> Of course, the guys look cool (especially those "Macross Saga") and the unproved parts were good. Everything good about Robotech was not when Macek's work or "voice talents" were hired. Sharp and effort (not credited - why would I be accused of plagiarism in HG abuse here?) Japanese creators. In the end, we got winds for real dealings and when we compared Robotech to the originals, we would never be in front of Robotech. The originals are much better, of course, and they are much more meaningful. <br /> <br /> Robotechek, however, deserved something: Leiji Matsumoto, the anime anime, launched the campaign to protect Japanese anime creators. Works by talented people such as Carl Macek who create unauthorized and pre-made work.
