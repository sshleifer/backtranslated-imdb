This is the worst and I mean the worst computers on the computer I have ever seen. The whole plot is completely impossible and stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean ... <br /> <br /> The movie boy can talk to a computer as a real person. Now, surely, you think you have to be a great computer technology, but also with a weak and weak computer, but it does not have a graphical interface. <br /> <br /> And the main idea of ​​how to overload the "super" computer by connecting to a computer game is a fool. My mobile phone lighting will close to save energy, but apparently this computer may decide to use its resources to deal with national security or to load computer games. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are others too bad. Things about it but I do not have time for that. <br /> <br /> I just do not believe someone would actually shoot the stupid movie.
