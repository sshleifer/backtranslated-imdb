Tim Robbins is a strange man who has thrown himself as a mechanical garage in the New Jersey jersey in 1950. He is in love with Perkin's blonde nephew Albert Einstein. Although much time is on the screen, Robbins overrides its inner life functions and disappears in the background (it's easy to forget the picture too!). Romantic romantic comedy with a gimmick, which Walter Matthau Einstein plays with (he does everything he can with a cartoonist). Otherwise, it is sugar and sunshine, which Fred Schepisi corrects correctly, not showing intelligence or brain. Meg Ryan is his usual feeling and is a charming chemistry between himself and Robbins, like his love sister and his older brother. ** ****
