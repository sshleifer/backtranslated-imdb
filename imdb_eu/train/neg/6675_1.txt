This weekend I saw "28 weeks later" very good. Then I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> I will tell you that it is one of the most boring things you will ever see. The scenes were realistic, there were no script and no plot. The alien nature was real. And fight mild scenes compared to the battle in the yard of the school. And to make it worse, the guy named Cody had a dirty, loose control of the language and the focus of the main film. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie; But watch 28 Weeks Later See. <br /> <br /> Animate, Mesake C.
