I have two important claims about this film. <br /> <br /> 1. My local leasing store in the "suspense" category has left a very soft core porn canyon. (No doubt, I did not waste renting first. Yes, the movie is a soft core porn.) 2. The title has nothing to do with the movie. In this movie, no one is forbidden or obsessive, as well as the combination of both. <br /> <br /> Actually, make three main complaints: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No doubt the movie is the second number in this list I saw enough movie. I will regret the boy. Keep it from this movie. Learn from my mistakes. This movie is not nearly at all levels.
