If it's a smell of rubbish and it's like rubbish, it must be garbage. This is the worst film I've ever seen in my life. Tony Scott's embarrassing style puts Domino Harvey's hint as an impeccable and fake story as a hunter. Stopping and seeing the story is confusing. Some of the plot's ridiculous and completely incurable aspects. It seems that all the scenes of the action were tied together with the serious dangers and dramatic play. Keira Knightley completely shrinks this year. This is the only film. If you want to see her naked, move on to the movie for an hour and a half and get a lot of nipples. I think this movie EVER! </ 3 that no one has seen
