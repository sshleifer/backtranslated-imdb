"The rebellion of the zombies" proves that having the same director is an upgrade and recycling is not necessarily a lightning striker twice. <br /> <br /> Halperin brothers, the "White Zombie" classmate of horror, did this. Thousands of garbage a bit a few years later to win its reputation and to make Lugosi's eye budgets even in the previous film. "White Zombie" was a court martial lawyer who was not able to use the zombie word title Halperins. It was the only thing that could help this movie, because, as everyone knows, bad films can get much more money by saying the name 'Zombie' in the title. Victor Halperin was able to insult this interesting film just a few years before. He never seemed to direct a horror movie after this debacle. Here it seems that these zombies are not a real dead traveler, but only victims of hypnotism. <br /> <br /> Remember that you want to create an army of zombies? Ready to break some eggs, even yours. <br /> <br /> CLOSE TO THE FLOOR: The man falls in love with the sad woman who strikes his heart and loves his friend who loves him. jealous This makes the man a spiral of madness. This tries to use the techniques of zombie intelligence control, which aims to change things, to try to win a woman worthy of a toy. <br /> <br /> This one includes one of the most remarkable developments in the land I have ever seen. You could see anything that you should be blind or stupid. The operation is not good. This movie, called "Zombis de los Reyes" (a double billed double-billed DVD that I bought on DVD) seems like a masterpiece in a horror atmosphere and reminds us that all black and white films are not classical. Atomic age science fiction area seems like a young alien drama of "Invisible Invaders". That is to say, a great melodrama with such a sharp ball, probably, can make a lot of different rumors of Korean film (South Korean films are often known for melodrama use). Credits list ironically called Favorite Films. I do not know what the favorite movie is, but, of course, they're a fool. <br /> <br /> They are not recommended for lovers of zombies, amodions or classics.
