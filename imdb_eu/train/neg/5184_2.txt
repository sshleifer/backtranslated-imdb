I was hoping to enjoy the romantic comedy Hip Hop, but I was disappointed at many levels. First of all, the story is very poorly recycled to be almost unbearable. Second, setting, acting and story are not very authentic or credible. Thirdly, there are many black actors out there than the standard chosen. What is an originality? Thirdly, there were very few Hip Hop songs in their entirety. Nobody seems really central. In general, the film was very disappointed, but the editing style was very interesting and almost deserved.
