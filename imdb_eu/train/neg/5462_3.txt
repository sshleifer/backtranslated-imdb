This program attacks me! There are no moods and they are very serious to call "fun". My favorite education is far away! The character is very stereotyped and unpleasant. The plots are redundant and the customs are repeated repeatedly. Where's fun I also think it's too long in the BBC and it's too much. Do you have a trick in two or three months on some episodes? I think that the BBC of that time will bring back some of its older shows, such as Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, the Raccoons and Count Duckula, with newer shows than newer shows. I thought the BBC brought Danger Mouse, so what happens with that! 3/10
