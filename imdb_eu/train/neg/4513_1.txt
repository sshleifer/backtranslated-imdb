Although Japan did not describe the book as a specific state of affairs. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in making this movie was Japanese, because it was not Japanese. Almost everything was almost horrible. I accept the actors as a whole, but they can not save you. Before starting the movies, I was surprised to see only ten people in the cinema in cinema soon after the Japanese film was opened. I was surprised at 30 minutes. I stopped so I would have the right to criticize. The whole movie was aware of my stupidity and the laughter of my Japanese girlfriend's credibility was removed. Everyone who saw me outside of that cinema faced confusion and despair. <br /> <br /> You owe two hours to the makers of this movie.
