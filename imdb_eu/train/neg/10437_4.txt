Stunning stunning, dramatic comic dram, about a curious young man who wants to fly like a bird from the Astrodome Houston. It has almost curious curiously directed by Robert Altman, which is so common that starts to crunch at the beginning of the weight. Some film companies are suggestive, Shelley Duvall is the first driver of a guide, and Sally Kellerman looks at him from the perspective of a "mother bird" from Bud Cortez with glamourpuss (imagine what Altman and Lou Adler did for her role). !). Previously, Bud Cort is once again called "Harold & Maude". Michael J. Pollard, for example, does not make an imbalance, Cort has been horrified and inefficient. Unfortunately, Altman is a mistake. It can pick up a piece like a play and a play, but let it push it with an inspiration and go down. ** ****
