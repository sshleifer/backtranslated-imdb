I found some mediocre characters and an interesting story. I never had to read this book (fortunately), or it would be painful experience. I have received free preview tickets, but it's still not my time or worthy of my friend. This story is not worth saying. Old people are like saying the past is old (unlike). Considering the pain of life of the main characters, a generation was not better than the next to avoid stupid mistakes. However, I think the actor made the best possible with a lame story. I've always been a fan of Ellen Burstyn. I am writing this review to face up to the positive opinions it has given. Unfortunately, I'm convinced to try this movie.
