"I know about people" is a good thing that Al Pacino is an excellent example of movies to be avoided. The first second round attempted to represent Pacino's Georgia accent; Sometimes it was weak and non-appealing while other segments seemed to be excessive. There has been a great interaction between characters and characters with a weak plot. The work of support made a very great job of keeping an interesting movie, and in an hour I still did not see a solid plot. The story is generally boring, and I've had to face myself a few times, to be awake. <br /> <br /> This movie will surely get bored ... whatever you avoid.
