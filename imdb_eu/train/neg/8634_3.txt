When he saw a picture of a man attacking a zombie, Lucius "Zombi" Fulci gave me hope in his old tricks. Unfortunately, though they are not corrupted by the corpse, it is not highly recommended for a murderer of a wealthy man and his wife's daughter to be killed. A character is not attractive as well, and at the time you know how to do it (bending, at least it was wonderful), you let it take care of you. I can say good things that makes sense of a nightmare!
