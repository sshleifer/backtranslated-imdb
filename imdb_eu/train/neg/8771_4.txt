Okay, I was bored and decided to see this movie. But I think that the main thing that has resulted in this movie is that footage will be one hour, and, above all, it is repeated at the same time 4 times. 1. To collect troops and discuss attack plans, recover 2 male wives Approaching 3-line troops approach 4. Men climb up and shoot, usually shoot first in the head. Then he saves another three men with him. 5. Call the enemy's victory and tell the successful base. Men return their wives and sing 10-minute songs. It was a basic movie, and the order of events happened about 4 or 5 times. And each time he made a flashback, the man would then show his wife and himself. There were about 10 men or more, they could have a flashback, so it took a long time. In addition, men could not kill their enemy with bayonets or grenades. I liked music and did a lot of action, even though it was a repetitive act. Overall, I probably will not see it again, but it was not horrible.
