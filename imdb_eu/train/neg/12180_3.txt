This movie is totally horrible, but it can be a hilarious moment, even if the humor is totally unwanted. <br /> <br /> The land was far beyond ridiculous. I do not think 2-year-old innocent people persuade them to film storytellers trying to create stories. However, in the positive side, some of the most inane plots in the plot are humorous. For example, "Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her backyard!" It's worse (and even more fun), but I'm paying for it. <br /> <br /> The effect is stingy. Most children's roles are very nice, but they are not very credible. On the other hand, Annie is totally horrible. Adults do not take roles seriously, but that's fine. If they want to be incredible, the movie would be worse. What is difficult to imagine? <br /> <br /> After overcoming the overall weight of the film, there are very few moments missing. The scene of the escape from the maid with the daughter of Lady Hogbottom is surprisingly ridiculous, even though it's been annoyed by the police. Although the Butler character is very small, a ray of the sun almost never goes through the darkness. <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie caused me a physical pain. However, there were approximately a few parts without hemorrhage internal bleeding. Only by evaluating his good works, the movie would be about 5; unfortunately, the rest of the films is hardly worth it. 1. So I give it 3. <br /> <br /> That is quite generous, I would say.
