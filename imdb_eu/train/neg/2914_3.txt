The top title "Gen" is used for filmmaking to present its audience. Gen is about a young doctor (Doga Rutkay) with a sick mother. The film leaves his mother to start her new job. While driving, we realize that it is not a very close home because the hospital is in a remote area. When entering the hospital garden, he sees the death of the patient's body. The next day is the beginning of a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Two policemen will come to the hospital to investigate their suicide. Actually, they must be in hospital, because all roads are in bad weather. All communication with the outside world is also cuts. There is no solution! In those few days, the more murders will be bad. Now everyone suspects each other. <br /> <br /> I think it's a great idea. It could be very scary. Of course, there are positive aspects of the movie. I really like the movie at the beginning. Especially when driving the first moments of hospital and hospital. Acts are good. Some try hard to be mysterious and terrifying. I think that the last shock should be spread outside the film. What I say is: it was a good rotation, but instead of showing it as a parody, we realized what we are doing when we see it. I had to explain the director thoroughly to work well. The most dangerous movie star is at least 48 years old, but his body is so young and it is someone who passes through the hospital throughout his life. In the end, I would like to say some things about the director. I'm sure it will improve. This is his first attempt. I found just 21 years ago. This made me feel more positive about him and his future movie. I will not rate this movie anymore *.
