This movie can be a good idea, with a 2000 year old witchcraft and totally destroying it. Nora and Jim are alcoholics that will go to Ireland to dry. They keep watching Nan and his uncle. Uncle discovered a witch kept in a 2000-year-old bog. It revives and takes Nora shape. It can not be conventionally killing (more is a fault). Nora, however, develops a way that way. <br /> <br /> This is a horror movie Gothic, it's cheap. It's a sprawling mess. I have to ask a question why you want a bad movie. I'm tempted to learn witchcraft to eradicate. <br /> <br /> NO LOWER WITH NO
