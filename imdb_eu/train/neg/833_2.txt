There's really no story in the movie. The lion departed from the events of the first film. It is believed Timon and Pumba how to unite through their loneliness. But there is much more than that. <br /> <br /> It mixes some scenes with the original, and then this movie has changed a bit how to change it. But still, is it? I expected something more. Instead, the mere explanation of all this is a small explanation. <br /> <br /> If you want to see other places in the Lion King universe, that is. But in addition, the animators do little justice. Disney should stop these live video productions directly. It was very boring and could be used by Jason Statham. "D"
