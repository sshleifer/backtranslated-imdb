This is a North East Florida production, mostly filmed near Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Planting. I was surprised when the company could overcome the main street of Fernandina, while the streets needed to get scenes. The movie is pretty and pretty bad. Tami Erin is nice, but it's over. Eileen Brennan goes even further. It's good for kids, or for those who like fluff for a great dose. From a Miller-Movies formula 4.
