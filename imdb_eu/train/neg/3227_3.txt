This is a variant of the series called Guinea Pig. When a psychopath admitted that he had been inspired by the murder of a young research, he abolished Japanese television. This short series, like all other series films, is almost untouched. A boy catches a young woman. They fight and kill death in their video footage. They threw it on top of boiling oil, using pliers on it and finally "in love", push the needle through the eye. This is the direct and most direct Guinea Pig film. Probably this movie, like any other, is a rumor of being a Guinea Pig champion. Without a doubt, Nicolas Cage's 8 mm movie was inspired. These films are very popular in the circles of fear. They have more flexible but more advanced graphics like "Naked Blood". The movie may just fill the void left by the movies and probably became reality TV. It is not recommended, but those who will surely attract them once and wonder why I know later.
