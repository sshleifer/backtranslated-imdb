1st View 12/24/2012 ?? From 10 to 4 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): Christmas emotional fluff does not really get enough to explain the work that happened to a real man who is trying to imprison the true story. his family for Christmas. Three family families fled to the house when they went to Washington DC to join the US President Herbert Hoover. This trip offers some side stories with a hobby and positive encounters with a puppet, which is similar to Disney's "run animals" movie and is not included here. In the end, he has not been able to help the president to give details about his family, which is another point in the movie. The film finally brings tears, but it takes a long time. The movie is not a original television movie (by IMDb), but does it have an obvious disappearance in that way? So I'm not sure about their exact information. After all, this is a simple (more complex) movie like a happy happy Christmas story, but without a blandy and substance-free garment.
