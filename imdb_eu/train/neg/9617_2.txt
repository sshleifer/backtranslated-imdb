Three years ago, when his friend Rachel (Therese Fretwell) was lying with his friends, he fell from his boat and drowned. Rachel's friends think that it's time to quit themselves and do not have any control whatsoever. So take a brew and chew something back and get Rachel his constant nightmare back to the same lake. As it was expected, the two friends who are already starting a blood bath started when they started off. This Flick has the feeling of a high school game, everyone forgets their lines and "wings" ... very bad! Marcos Gabriel was the roles of Leon's boyfriend. Outside Fretwell and Gabriel there are bad harassment and some whistling characters before being "offed". Attention was made to some players: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This will not be missing MEMORIAL DAY.
