"Snap Drawing 9" loves or hates a type of movie; Fortunately or not, I felt that I was wasting time, and I let myself be "full of dead whales" propaganda. Aesthetically, the movie could be nice, especially in the first part, but it is not clear that all portrayed acts are the allegory of whale hunting. Until then, it might be a bit fun to watch everyday business in Japan, but later it becomes obvious that everything on the screen is a propaganda is not the only exception. I use the word "Propaganda" because the film essentially uses the old old morale device, where "good" and "bad" have not been concluded in an action, but they are included in the stones. Probably, I am nothing but myself, but I find that this type of art is superficial and pre-thought, even when it comes to looking for a noble protection environment (when it's an invasion here). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's a cardinal sin. when the film material has been extended without justification, for the simple extension. In my opinion, "Drawing Adhesions 9" could be easily adjusted in 75 minutes, but 2 and 1/4 hours long is tortured. Yes, they were interesting planes, but there were not enough of them left without leaving a 15-minute gap. The movie does not have a standard scenario, and there is no evolution of the characters, but it is not a documentary, but a conceptual installation. It is an unusual form for a movie, but art is still visible, as simple and na√Øve as the concept. OTOH, I also think that the director should have a bit of sincerity and only deliver it in less than 135 minutes. <br /> <br /> Yes, music scores look like whale sounds. How wonder <br /> <br /> 2/10.
