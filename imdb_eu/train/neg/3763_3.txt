A group of forest guards and scientists enter the forest to find fossils. In the end, Bigfoot's burial is on the ground (it is not noticeable in the dark). CGI Bigfoot's scenes are horrible, but never endless scenes. they seldom rate talking. I thought Bigfoot would be a good movie. But now, after sad sad movies about legend, I have serious doubts. In order to get the movie rolled out, the good little girl is not naked. And this may be better than "Boggy Creek 2" (no event), but Bigfoot's still-not-a-good documentary film "Harry and the Henriksons" is still sad. <br /> <br /> My grade. D
