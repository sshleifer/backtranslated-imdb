Gung Ho was a good idea. However, much Americans need to understand the audience's jobs in the United States and the external competition. In this film, the main character of Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) will go to Japan and a Japanese car will come. Help Americans and their dying people in Pennslyvania. Two things have come to you. First of all, why would a Japanese company come to the Americas when it comes to making cars and so well? Secondly, can anyone understand that American companies of all kinds go to third world nations to flee to cost American products for their products? The film's premise would make the world's car manufacturer one of its main competitors (not only Germany) and a realistic plant. Keaton was still in a comedy mode. However, it seemed to be the same performance that proved to be in the comedy and theatrical segments, but although he was still not embarrassed, director Ron Howard could not make this a television movie. However, they have to put an end to the unfortunate story, because the politics and problems of Japanese and American relations have not been happy. Gung Ho has Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley feel like two television producers have made the movie, and then they also made the television version of this movie, giving the film a slight feeling. Americans and Japanese people feel that Americans can learn it. His Saito man 2, which Americans do not give to all Americans, does not think. They were Japanese characters. This film would make it more interesting.
