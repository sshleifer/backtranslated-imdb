I found this movie on IFC and it seemed interesting to me. For small love-tales, this movie can really drag some stories. Not one of these women even claims that almost the actor was talking about their true sexual life, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I have to admit that I want to see some romantic views of some first sexual encounters, as in "Strike! (1998)," when Odette Sinclair's acquaintances began to wonder for her first time, and Tweety asked: "Was it beautiful? ? <br /> <br /> Some alternatives and flashbacks might be thought to improve this movie. I think things will be even worse. It does not have to be hardcore porn to get my attention, but somehow I expected more.
