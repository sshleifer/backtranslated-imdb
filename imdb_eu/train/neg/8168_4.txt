He was really upset by the psychoanalista cannibalist, John (with Gary Kent, Michael Brody's pseudonym), who lives in a cave, who make a misfortune in his desert. Steve (Dean Russell) and his friend Charlie (John Batis) play their playful arguments, Sharon (Tomi Barrett, Gary Kent), and Teddi (Ann Wilkinson) are expelling in the woods. alone To prove a point, they decided to go to the desert in the hut in the hut to travel outside to help them worry about their partners. John falls prey and soon dies as Sharon goes to life, when men get into the desert because the truck is getting warmer. Fear, tired and paranoid, Sharon receives a very unusual help ... John's ghost children! It's true, John's children are left in the desert, the spectral spies that are spying on the woods, helping a certain taste of Sharon help guide his safety and his friends. Meanwhile, Steve and Charlie soon drowned in a shelter and found the night gloomy John Caves very much alive. Boiling on a stove, the meat is really cooked to wife Teddi! Undoubtedly, John eats flesh outside the home of John! In any case, soon after his wife was worried, Steve and Charlie began to rest in the morning. Meanwhile, John fights Charlie, Steve and Sharon to survive. When Steve is suffering from compound rupture between two massive rocks, he will only make it difficult when he goes through the river, when his nightmare increases, Sharon fights his fantasy ghosts with the potential of safety ... points to some. father is not to die. Charlie, unfortunately, does not have so much friend. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < National Park, California, where tall trees were tall tall towers and basically hinges. For some strange reasons, I did not particularly play Jones's atmospheric atmosphere ... he was afraid, even though John is worried about using his knife ... (in a clear shot, Jones's camera suggests more than actually on the screen , in any case, it still gets what John does with the victims). In a picturesque landscape, to see a mania attacked by the innocent, such fear increases. Trying to spend some pretty days in other towns, to enjoy the fresh air and fresh air, enjoy a beautiful view, only to encounter terrifying predators with a dreadful prey. By giving a backdrop to what John's monster is, Jones reminds us of his memory retrospectively to find out about his wife's adultery and is therefore reacting to reflection. Being "twisted" (both in bed and lover in bed) (a refrigerator repairs). The children, sad and depressed, have been sucked and now the monsters are "terrified", still interacting with their peers or anyone else. I understand that the only novelty in some of the fantasy children's slasher on the back is appreciated by some, but it seemed to me to be very hokey and stupid. They help our heroes escape in some dangerous situations, but it has been very difficult for me to take a huge wave of uncontrolled remedies. 80's music and plays are not considered. I could react to the situation I wanted to say, because it was terribly terrifying, finding someone in the territory in an unknown and well-captured territory. I think that the movie is similar in many ways to KNOW THE LIFE ... FOR SAVE, except for ghost children (... their voices resonate with Sharon, his father or when they speak together). Gary Kent, George Lucas is like a dirty man with ruined clothes and he has lost humanity. As I have mentioned above, violence is not just because of the humbleness that justifies the director who proposes Jones to escape the effective penetration of the knives, however, the way that the set is guilty will leave you involuntarily (for example, Teddi's murder over a large stone formation Violence was silent, because John wanted to stop him and, once he squeezed it, he tried to end his predator until he was far away: I've seen better and worse about this type of Slasher film, he's an expert at that, at best with a well-landscaped landscape. to be memorable except for ghostly children.
