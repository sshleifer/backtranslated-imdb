In my opinion, I have been nominated as the Oscar-winning "my dearest joker". There is no decent story, theater, humor. In every way, if you have little respect for yourself, please do not waste your time watching your movie. Although the actors can play the CAN, it gets puzzled after watching. Precious values ​​are dying to die when you see it ... <br /> <br /> I warned you before <br /> <br /> Do not watch a movie.
