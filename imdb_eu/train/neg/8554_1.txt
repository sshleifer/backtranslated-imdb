The film image was created in 1930 and was published in 1931. However, it seemed to me that the cinematographic cartoon was very difficult to transition from silent times. However, this plot of Zane Gray seems to be very weak. Likewise, Gary Cooper was probably learning to play. It is a result that would not be acceptable according to current regulations. Maybe for 1931 2004 is not acceptable. Some actors played well. Unfortunately, the Indians always get a short end to western children. The lands that lived long before the white earth, but in the wrong history, they did not have the right to defend themselves.
