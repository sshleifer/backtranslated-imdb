When released in 1970, I released "Man Man Called", but Return played as a sequel. All this - quote, script, drawing, foundry and performance was lower than the original. Gale Sondergaard, Elk Woman, an elderly large man, is not like Indian, and even half of the "Indians" who played Italians, Mexicans and Latinos with little haircuts. The old boy, who considered the chief, looked like an old man, rather than a hard-headed man. He gave the bow as a woman! In the end, Richard Harris, a brilliant original work, seems to be marching this time. I think he could not repay his horse's payoff. <br /> <br /> There are some exciting moments in the movie, for example, that Horse's debut is suffering from a painful ritual. "Find His Perspective" and pick up yellow hands with yellow hands and white opponents, but the overall return is uneven It's boring, crisp and predictable.
