I am not sure who is writing <br /> <br /> who writes the bright opinions but trust me STKINKS. I watched horror movies and a hundred slasher movies, which is LAME, it's only 80 minutes and I took everything I could believe. The plot is horrible, acting is even worse. And there is no development. <br /> <br /> Even if David Cocteau was better than this. Escape Jigsaw. I hope to hate the performance of the video movies directly, if it's a good plot. <br /> <br /> This was not afraid, very little Gore, <br /> and really inactive cast. <br /> <br /> I saw this with three other friends <br /> <br /> I still expect to talk with me! <br /> <br /> They wanted to push me back. in the disk window. I do not think anyone could have a good review of this trip.
