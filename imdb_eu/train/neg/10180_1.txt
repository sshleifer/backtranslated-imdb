This movie is the shame of the Major League Franchise. I live in Minnesota and I can not believe that Cleveland spilled. (Yes, I realized that the real Indians were quite good at that time, and twins were in the bottom of the league in America, but they were still consistent). However, I loved the first Grand Prix, I liked the second and always. Looking forward to the third, when the Indians eventually went to the whole series. You can not say that there was no plan after the second movie. What happened? However, if you leave your real fan of the original league and do not see this junk.
