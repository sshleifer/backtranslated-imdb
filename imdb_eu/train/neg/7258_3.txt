This Pikotx film worsens and one of the functions to be seen. Maybe it's hard to believe, but there is a rural community in Southwestern Arkansas, Fouke, who knows that the story is true. This story is told in documentary style documented by Vern Stierman and filmed in real locations that speaks to real people in it. According to the story, this legend has changed, but at the end of the 60s and the 70s, most of the surrounding Fouke area crossed the Boggy Creek by a similar Bigfoot being visited. A long limed with three toes and 7 feet tall, this damned creature spreads damages and "scrubs" in most communities. I crossed the small bridge Boggy Creek in 1974, and yes, the back of my neck rose. The sun came in the sun. When I arrived at Shrevepe I laughed.
