Annie Potts is a totally sad film that is totally unique. Mark Hamille is really an adolescent who is angry because someone steals the corvette and becomes a flute with his classmates (probably the most exciting car to appear in a movie) and goes to Las Vegas to follow up with Annie. the evil genius who stole his pride and happiness. <br /> <br /> Looking at my eyes from these eyes, I did not have fun when Annie Potts was very early. Badly Hamill was not given a performance. Danny Bonaduce also makes the script.
