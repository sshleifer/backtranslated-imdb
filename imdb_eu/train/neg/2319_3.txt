The empty holes of the movie. First of all, we see that his master is watching kung fu, and we will die in his midst of practice. It's ok with me And then, at the end of the film, we will see the kung-fu that he learned when he was a teacher when he was old. Is that possible? I do not think so. This exhibition is exclusively for lovers of Jay Chou, and the film does not deepen the development of characters, cinematic styles and plot. > Anyone warned the captain of the basketball team (he forgot his name) and that the idolized Li Xiao player is apparently similar, he thought it was the same person? Long hair, sunny, tall and powerful. Teenagers screamed at orgasm as they seemed to have emerged from the mass production factory that was designed to produce products. It's not these two actors that were so valuable to film the film industry. <br /> <br /> The jokes were not bad and they were not fun. The scene on four masters returned to help Jay Chou's basketball singer, lined up on a wireless plot, shaking rival or Royal Rumble style. Worse, when the four masters fought, people began to cheer up, and the game continued. Was it really a WTF? for a moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the show, when they win the game, all because of the excellent kung fu abilities of Jay Chou. How did the kung-fu abilities get the mystery, the show shows in some way that it manages to master its masters skills. <br /> <br /> And then he lost his long-lost father to recognize that Jay Chouk, his lost son, seemed to make his film faster. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a Jay Chou-flick (instead of the usual "Chick Flick"). . See if Jay Chou is your only fan. If you are one of the 250 featured IMDb IMDb movie directors, then this movie is not for you.
