I usually do not say it's worth watching the movie, but it's definitely a wonderful situation. The only true reverse of this film is Cornelia Sharpe, which is quite attractive, and this movie really is BRIEF. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is very boring and it's almosthere near the movie. A character is not remotely interesting and there is no reason to look after it. I do not know what is going on, Sean Connery has agreed to make this film, but it will definitely be sent. <br /> <br /> If you kill only one reason for seeing this movie - Sean Connery fan and just want to see everything he did. Keep this one as the last one. <br /> <br /> Well, if you end up seeing it through a miracle (or some other website reviews), I hope you'll enjoy it more than I will. Thank you for reading.
