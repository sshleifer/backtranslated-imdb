In the title, the word "1st" has a lesser sense for the viewers of this film, for those who are victims of their crime. At least they do not hang up and their death will be seen in an endless film. <br /> <br /> <br /> First is the first draft of the script; 1 is used in each film in the latest film; First edition in post-production; And so, while you are suffering through this uprooted film, your misery can be set aside for the 2 hour mark you want. In 160 minutes, it can easily be edited for less than two hours. <br /> <br /> The details of rigorous writing and acting provide little purpose. Also, it's terribly terrifying, Bill Plank and Bill Pullman, and Bridget Fonda, created at least for generosity, have had enough nuance to laugh at the movie. In the first month, it ends at the end, only one time that is awaiting what happens after the appearance of a female suicide. <br /> <br /> The bad edition is never entering. One of the main characters, I think (I do not mean them anymore) DA In the middle of a dialogue it appears in a single scene. Of course, the scene that goes into the viewer has dropped to the floor of the editor. And nobody noticed that a character who had appeared from nowhere was a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> In a word, do not miss this time. I wanted my wife and I. But at least we have made our diversions by commenting on various parts of the movie as it was in the Mystery Science Theater. "Meanwhile, in Cleveland ..." !!!!
