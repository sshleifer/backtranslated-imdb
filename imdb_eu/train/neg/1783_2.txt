There's no spoil here ... There's no disaster. Madchen Amick is a living proof that she's a bit like a life-like face - talent is not necessary. The only spotlight is that some of the liners that are very well-known by Alice Krige are very good, but it's again Alice Krige. The only hint of his nightmare is the only advice that can be seductively dangerous to these strange creatures. It's compelling to be terribly awesome, otherwise incredible on this plot. The mystery of how to achieve this project remains the same. Scriptwriters had to heal when they sent this script. It has major problems of continuity, stereotypical superficial stars, writing horror formulas, and it just has never been meaningless. Although the creatures, despite their narrow abilities like "darkness", are never analyzing the question and what they are coming from. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this time.
