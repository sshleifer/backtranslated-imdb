Perhaps one of the classic horror films ever made, Halloween features a memorable Michael Myers and a great performance by Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> However, its rehabilitation factor is very close to zero, the unforgettable time and sadness of the incidents. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is far away from the microwave popcorn and you have not lost anything. <br /> <br /> I did not understand it so much. <br /> <br /> Thanksgiving Rob Zombie is reaffirming this. And, in general, I hate remakes. <br /> <br /> Surely a temporary filling gap will compensate the originals with strange points of no interest at all. <br /> <br /> This is a movie we like, it's like we're going to enjoy Dickens. <br /> <br /> Do not think it's classical.
