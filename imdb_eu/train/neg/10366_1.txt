They had a boring no less than 80 minutes. First, I asked him how to produce something like that. Then, it came to 70 minutes to convince myself that it was just a few minutes, and I am very proud that I continued to finish, I think this movie is an excellent proof of human patience and rude tolerance. Did you recognize it? Well, as I wrote earlier, if you try to try yourself, try and if you're hard enough, you'll come to the end ... The movies do not make any sense and the characters do not make sense. all. All movie events are sure that you have seen it somewhere, and it seems to fit into this movie to fill the movie coil.
