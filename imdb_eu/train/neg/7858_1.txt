I have to hire the unknowns for "horror" for these films, but at least they should hire the best actors. The sergeant is mainly guilty of using each line with his monotonous bulldozer. But the truth is, the lines are not really important. No plots are known, so most of the writing contains words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and the correct dialogue with other languages. <br /> <br /> 'The story' is mostly a randomized gore and death, with a couple of "surprise" feelings, and it takes about 10 minutes to happen exactly after what happens. Not only that, but there are some flawless plotties and continuity flaws (why they are there? Did not he have a weapon? He was not dead?), So it seems the whole movie. cut by a few trimmed times. <br /> <br /> Another film, which uses blood and whirlwinds, instead of a true cinema experience.
