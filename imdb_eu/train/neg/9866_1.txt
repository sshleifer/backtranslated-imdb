Dead Gentlemen Productions wants to see the movie "THE GAMERS". This is not that movie. This movie is not fun. Time is lost <br /> <br /> The good comments that appear here seem to be not written by false (disguised) third parties. People who make this movie seem to try to synthesize false interests. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a well-made mockumentary. "Spinal Tap" or Christopher Guest are insulting. <br /> <br /> The film is so wise, I can not imagine that the knowledge about it is fun. Causing yourself is an important quality, but if you're working like that, you should enjoy it to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The movie is not offensive. The great satire of the taboo subject, but its constant pathetic vat.
