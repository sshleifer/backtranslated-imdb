My favorite Martian was boring and I thought! It was not fun. The viewers sat across the movie and did not laugh! The kids also did not laugh! That's the dull movie of Disney! I thought someone was playing better, to play martial arts than Christopher Lloyd! He was very stupid! And it was not fun !! I thought the assembly was really mute! In the original TV series, the suit does not speak and move! In my opinion, they should not miss this movie! I give them two fingers! I'm wasting time and I do not recommend the movie anybody !!! Thank you!!
