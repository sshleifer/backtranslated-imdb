I'm going to give this movie two stars, because it's full of gorgeous photography. Otherwise, it mainly has clich√©s and stereotypes: the people of the mountain are a dumb white dirty fanatic or racialist religion or white wise man. Indians are the magical people that move without sound, they can disappear in an eye gesture, talk to animals and read minds in great distances. And so, etc. <br /> <br /> I asked him about the movie at all times (beautiful images of the mountains, log lines, forests, and I did not even say a bunch of animals, free of charge). People living in the mountains and strangers in the church. <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot touched upon various issues, but one of them was thoroughly examined. This was not a story that is growing in depression, not even a story about orphanhood, nor a fight for personality. They wanted to be all these and more, superfluous and inadequate. <br /> <br /> Although the movie was in Little Tree's education, we hardly ever learned anything. A brief summary of his town's history (short and brave) and a distillery show was given; He tried his hand with wood (he failed) and whiskey running (literally); Learn to read (and maybe write) with the help of Grandma and her dictionary - and that was it. Apparently, he learned that he was locked in the classroom while he learned many things he did not learn. <br /> <br /> However, grandmothers and grandparents and Graham Greene's characters were sure that Little Tree had become the main goal as an adult, and then I am paraphrasing, "Navajos and" Trapped in a pair of wars "- Grandmothers and grandparents and Graham Greene's" names "were" catching ". In heaven (but say the girls, instead of getting married, getting married, children or other nonsense). <br /> <br /> Finally, I found the grandpa's grandfather to be offensive. Why did he still have whiskey in all things? To face the "drunken Indian" stereotype?
