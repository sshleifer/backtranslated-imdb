First of all, the animals have emotions. If you did not know that, you're a fool. But let us suppose that nobody of us is. We all know that animals have emotions and now we want to see emotions in nature, right? <br /> <br /> The tedious and ridiculous document that attracts these animals is simple. "human". Filmmakers seek out footage of animals based on human and similar behaviors that are high and low, and when they say, "the monkey is almost human". (that is, a direct quote). <br /> <br /> Everything is in human terms. They lose their time around what makes their dogs "smiling", but does not refer to what the "tail" means. The pride of these researchers is like it. Although they are dressed in human dogs and wearing a cowboy hat, they also show chimpanzees. <br /> <br /> I expect a deep documentary about animals. I wanted to learn how to enrich animals in their own language. Instead, the researchers continue to drop pedagogical, anthropomorphic and hypothetical remarks. Add a plump sound and chimpanzees "Celebrate Christmas", which was enough to turn my belly. <br /> <br /> But it does not end there. Half of this documentary is not shot in wild, laboratories and experiments. All shots of the camera camera are passed through steel bars, and we see how monkeys are filled in concrete barrel cages. A special beginning occurs near the beginning (you have to warn yourself clearly) when a captive monkey tells us in the sign language "Do you want to hurry." <br /> <br /> Hidden references are "stress tests" and I suggest psychological experiments. The baby monkeys are distinguished by their mothers at birth and their baby dolls are shown to prove that monkeys want a "mother image". After 40 years of experimentation, intelligent researchers are in the background until they reach their most excellent results: monkeys have emotions. <br /> <br /> Sparks called "Washoe" have a cage concrete since 1966. , and it remains until today. We make a short look (again through a bar) against a concrete wall, with its pure expression. Personally, I do not see any more experimental data. Washoe, sorry for my whole species.
