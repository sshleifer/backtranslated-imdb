I really do not understand all the positive opinions of users. The movie I've ever seen is the worst and I'm not going to be pessimistic. <br /> <br /> Eva Mendez is very hot in this film. But I do not think that the director is his fault. In any case, it has an artificial look; their play, idea, make-up, everything. <br /> <br /> The only star I made was directed to the idea behind the movie, it was very badly executed. <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not watch this dog, see Fellini, Woody Allen or David Lynchen.
