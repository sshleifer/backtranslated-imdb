Seed was set in the 70's by Max Seed (Will Sanderson), a criminal killer, who killed 66 people for 6 years. He is sentenced to death, but he does not die in the electric seats, even after being shocked three times. <br /> <br /> Matt Bishop (Michael Par√©) detectives and other officers cover this secret by burying their lives in Seed. . Seed continues its people in his coffin. <br /> <br /> The worst director in the world (Uwe Boll), "Seed" is not trying. Extend the cover of decent society and not any party that generates the story. And he said that this is based on real events, after a person has survived the electric chair three times, they will be released. It's a legend of the city and it never happened. Like Bollen's other abominations ("Only in the dark"), "Seed" is just terribly awesome.
