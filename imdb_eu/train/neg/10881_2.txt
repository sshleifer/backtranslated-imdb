The mother of my friend worked in a video store, and before they came to see the movies, so when I got home, the convent, the horror movie, I could not wait to see. They suppose it is terrifying, but it's really wonderful, I can say this movie oddly. <br /> <br /> Yes, the play is a bad thing, and yes, the cheapest movie I have ever seen is very fun! "WHAT, DOES NOT DO YOU?" I did not know this movie was ever published ... I thought it was bad ... <br /> <br /> Yes, in general, the movie is pretty bad (you should admit it much at least here), but I promise you to laugh you'll get a good one about that. <br /> <br /> * This movie is bad, but it lacks good ... especially it has a dummy of despair. ... DISCOUNTING AHEAD!
