The new North American version of Robert Altman in the West of Edmund Naughton's book, when it was wrong, was not taken into account, but in recent years it was very critical. Apart from a booming urban boom scenario, here the characters are not worth a lot of interest, and the images (deliberately) look unparalleled and unpleasant. Bearded Warren Beatty is a late-business entrepreneur who is struggling with a community outside the outside and helps to organize the first farm; When profits begin, Beatty naturally threatens cities that want to participate in the action. Altman creates a wonderful atmosphere and a winter in terms of time and place for the audience, but this is a limited action of this bad little town - a story that consists mostly of bichos and altman. slow There is hardly any expression (contrary to the fact) and weak agents look at each other, without much mind. It is a self-defeating figure, and, nevertheless, in the style of Altman, it is a fabulous defeat. ** ****
