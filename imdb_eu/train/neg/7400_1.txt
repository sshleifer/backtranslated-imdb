I've seen bad movies and it's there. There's no need to give any word, it's like one of those episodes of commas in a soap opera. I just wanted to knock that little girl, because, let's just say, she's really suspicious. The monsters that were dressed in some outfits were fun. There I saw somewhat "Silent Hill". And I read that and Lord, Lord, he saw a Finnish movie. So it's not surprising that he did not make sense. It seems like a vehicle for promoting this group and nothing more. FX are very good, like movie, monsters and even theater. But there's nothing more to tell about it.
