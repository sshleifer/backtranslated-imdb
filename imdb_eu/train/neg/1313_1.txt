Do not worry about seeing this minimal series series. It's an agitation of six hours, and it's an amazing triangular love triangle between three non-chemists. In this story there is no heat, real passion, true love. It is dry, boring, dull and disturbed. And it does not even predict the level of technical competence. Take these six hours of your life and use them that deserve something more.
