A young scientist, 'Metamoprhis', is a story worshiped at local university, investigated by university financial providers. In this way, it will force direct access to Hollywood's usual melodrama. <br /> <br /> The first thought of this film is this. "It's not good, but not bad at the beginning of the eighties". Of course, I noticed that it was made in 1990, it almost promoted it to 4, but decided to keep it "5" on average. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it does "Metamorphis", it seems that the good movie is trying to get rid of it desperately. It's a matter of being competent, you can also see occasional glittering low quality, the rhythm of the movie is a serious problem, after realizing that I was watching it at ninety minutes, I realized I had an hour, the special effects are not stars, but the directors work on this weakness It seems to be the ability to predominantly. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise and Christopher are a light man trying to make a routine routine. Reeves reminded me, above all, of the character of 'Wild Things' by Matt Dillon. It does a good job, but it does not distinguish itself. It is the role of "bad boy" here, and the actor does everything he can, but it does not seem too much. The director of the child is the director who can not A lychee, cheerful or strange bee. <br /> <br /> Pacing, as I said, is the worst problem in this movie, until Power Ranger's bad man would blur with a last battle. It is convenient and incomprehensible, until the last scene is supposed to be dramatic but ridiculous, and it's full of unlucky cameras that can compress around thirty seconds. <br /> <br /> Suddenly see 'Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack'. You will not get anything, and you do not need to buy anything.
