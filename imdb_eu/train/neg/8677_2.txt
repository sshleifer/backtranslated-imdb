I liked Chiba on Street Fighter, and it seemed to me that I'm going to tell you how stupid this movie is, at least I can see it a bit, right? Wrong The messy talk is dull, half-seated and a meaningless structure. There are few scenes of any type of action, as well as less martial arts, and a few are filming and publishing, so bad, you can not even write about what's going on in the world. Duplication is very late, and perhaps the best stupidity in this movie is that it is supposed to be the Italian mafia ... Japanese SURGERY! Avoid the plague: you will see martial arts more than five minutes from your local preschool carat class.
