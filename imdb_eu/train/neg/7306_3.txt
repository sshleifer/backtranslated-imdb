Actually, one of the most sincere films ever. I never took time to write one of them, but this feeling swore to me after having witnessed that affair and felt that it was a bit worse for me to be honest for my time. There are so many sections with courage and sense of sense (for example, when the police would never shoot them with infectious diseases) When hospitals never had such a cure? Why did he see the boy walk away from his wife when he wore a dressing gown on his bed around the bed? As we expect in these films, the characterization was horrible (for example, Blondes - I do not remember his names and I do not give up litter - he turned to his girlfriend completely and fled to leave her) and I wanted to finish them all to meet the silence! The production was enormously imbalanced and there was nothing to write at home cinema.
