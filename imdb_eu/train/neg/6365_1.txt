Wow, I knew this movie would be bad, but it's not bad. <br /> <br /> Roddy Roddy Piper, a retired man, has been very ill (a puppy!), who is helping everyone - a post-op lobotomy patient is coming out and lamenting his dead son. His adopted son comes back from the Armed Forces "Special Ops" and looks at "things", if it narrows something about the past when it comes to teeth. It's time to clear the streets of another guy who knew Piper and his dead son (who killed a bad boy) and another of his adopted son. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's a beautiful young man who decides the interest of love. It's no good reason to jump on the bones of the former Army block. This takes about 1 hour for 2 minutes. <br /> <br /> This action could have been saved, but it's even worse than storyline and acting. Previously done, it's been a lot better (Ong-Bak is an excellent example). This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and Waterworld has seen it twice. <br /> <br /> Erm, the film is called HONOR (an incorrect written by the Americans) and the line tag "has the Bloodsport and Kickboxer makers" - look at other David Worths director movies and you'll soon realize why they put these 2 movies and have more than 10 years. The classic ones like "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" really say so. <br /> <br /> <br /> I'll give you Â£ 10 if you do not want to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> PS - Excuse me because they do not know the names of the characters, but they tell you something.
