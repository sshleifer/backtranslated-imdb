At the beginning of the 90s, I remembered being a girl when I was on the TV, with which she was riding with furious clothes and riding on plastic dinosaurs. He was called Power Rangers. I remem- ber that little children go from each other, and then t-shirts and show things were forbidden in many school neighborhoods around the country, this show taught the children to fight each other to solve their differences. <br /> <br /> I never thought of it as a show, especially better shows, such as The Tick in Fox Kids. The oldest teens always looked at power rangers, in a hilarious and disdainful way, and it was not difficult to ask why. The footage is very ridiculous. Color-dressed costumes are the things to be worked out and the dinosaurs seem like plastic nonsense. Then you enter the play and, of course, hair is really flattering. All boys wear earrings, half of them are dressed in 90 marble, and always wear the same clothes, and then put on the cabinets of bottles. <br /> <br /> Toys are also particularly hilarious. and it was a joke for many of the night's talk boards. And, actually, the two bad films that have ever been made, and I mean that one of the worst film ever made is based on this show, almost all critics, as well as films, film-based shows, and shows based on them. <br /> <br /> Power rangers is bad television merely a bad thing about commercially available toy merchandise. As an adult, I do not look nice, but shows for children in the 1990s, as a shame for fashion and boys earrings.
