Anyone who has the ability to sit down and enjoy a movie as good as this movie does not accept quality movies. This movie was insulted, the direction was quality and cinematography of high school classrooms. Blair Witch Project had a better cinematography and I hate it! Storyline could have been a very good film but it was flat during the first 10 minutes throughout the movie. Someone mentioned that the movie was an imagination of the children, that's all good and fine. But they could still do better than they did with this script. I mean, at the store, Indian. Did the kids look at the little idol and suddenly thought about a Indian story about Indian and Wendigo? They refer to the store staff, and has said that there is nothing here that nobody works for me, so you think it's a great fantasy scenario, but then it's just a barter about the idol and this boy has seen this boy. That was so pathetic lame goes beyond. In the end, do not miss what happened at the Otis hospital, but also the OMG feeling! Why did I ask for this time! The recommendation I do not want to see is, without a doubt, high-quality films that do not insult your mind! Thank God I never paid to see this movie, I would urge my money back! For those who were easily entertained by this movie ... it's really sad to say that your standards made it a short film for this film.
