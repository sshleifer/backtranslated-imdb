The film has a naked scene: a man sitting on the edge of a bed, who tastes at the center of the screen with his revealed genital organs. The scene is long. What was it? I think thinking to be fun, but we saw it with my mother, and it was not too funny to look at everything that looked like a whole minute. <br /> <br /> The film is cold. No character is nice either. Audrey Tatou is pretty, of course, but his character is an unfortunate girl. <br /> <br /> I would not really recommend the movie. I was charming and cool, but it was disappointing. I asked the director, who was very subordinate, looking at the French educator and those figures. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
