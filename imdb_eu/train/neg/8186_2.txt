Anyone read the script? This should be the worst case of writing and correcting throughout the year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson could not throw it. About two-thirds of them, Giamatti seems to be saying, I can not believe I signed the contract. I have never seen the worst movie I've ever seen, but the Christmas movie list is really bad. Not enough lines, but what else can be said? Okay, the movie that is not moving with Vaughn's men's conversation, is nothing more than a horrible man who can not pass by his nature. It was just a doubtless walk, no one seemed to enter.
