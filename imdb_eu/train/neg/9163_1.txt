The Leap Years and local and regional television scenes have shaken. And yet, they can not save this movie. It contrasts things so much: more than acting, excessive melodramaticity, scanty guides, the opposite direction; and in a few things - decent music, good cinematography. This commentary is especially true for anyone who sheds in a single movie, after seeing this movie, all the local movies are bad. Please do not judge the rest in this movie. A TV series is a romantic feature film. My expectations were high when I bought my card and my expectations were five minutes less in the movie.
