It was a painful example of cheap, boring and plain spectacle produced by Australia's television station to fill local content quotas. The writing was really awful and I do not like the writers who are honest Wally Norman, responsible for the last memory of the worst Australian films. <br /> <br /> There was nothing fun about this TV show - ever - not as nice as it was. He was tired and bad, and, worst, he thought it was really fun. It was just a shame to see. <br /> <br /> It seems that this show has been shown on 10 to 10 exhibitions on the IMDb. Try to find (real) Australian (real) viewer show (not many) review and it is impossible. Or crazy There are bread pieces that are more fun than this show. <br /> <br /> Avoid the show without price and it would appear on the DVD, that it was worth remembering that laughter was not intentionally.
