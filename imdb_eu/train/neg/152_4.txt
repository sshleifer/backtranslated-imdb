You might think that a couple of discussions are spoilers. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but Spielberg did not deserve any win for this Oscar, and I think the reason for the Academy. vote (I do not know, for example, other Oscar nominees for other best actors, but it would be hard to justify, what you have to do and see what you see in the final product) Spielberg's way so guessed, so confusing. As I was watching this movie as part of the Art Course film, I cried out: "The feeling is honest emotion, honestly. This feeling is superficial and unreal, a false vision of life." This is the highest sensitivity. Do two people start reading real life sometime, overcoming the Nettie's letters found when they sit down on the bed when Celie and Shug Avery are sitting on the bed? There are some examples of this behavior throughout the whole film: they are gathering people around the Miss Millie car and then take them to the flock of birds to go, when they drive; Harpo is falling into the rooftops of Harpo; The whole group of religious groups that went to the massive chamber Jook Joint, the chorus of the choir ... Nothing true. I also asked the name of the harpoon, because it is the real name of his wife Sofa, "Oprah" backwards. Spielberg does not "overwhelm it". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <! The Schindler's List was amazing, very profound to me, and I admired Ryan's highly-privileged resignation for his realism, even though the story gets a little bit closer.
