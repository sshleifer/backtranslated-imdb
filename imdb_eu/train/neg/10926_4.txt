While the idea is more original than most Sci-Fi movies, execution is not as usual. The practical effects of Mummy are not bad, and the "Gun Nut" is a giant character, but the real drawing is unique to Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin. I think all this is the idea. They make the most beneficial, but the moments that I saw were about 40 minutes after the character of the Morena with sporty socks on Tomb Raider. I do not know the high-profile cinema, but you can not deny it when you see real beauty !!! And Adam Baldwin once again hates the type of hatred you love. If you want to see a couple of your Firefly favorites, you'd like to have fun with submachine. If you want a good operation and character development, we recommend you somewhere else.
