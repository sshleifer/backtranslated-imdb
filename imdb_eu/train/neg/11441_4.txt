After waiting for the first 25 minutes you feel inside, you are pretty convinced that it will be a great romantic comedy. After that, the movie is worse than the turn. <br /> <br /> The hot feelings may still be, but others say: the plot is so unbelievable and artificial that it is almost impossible to see. <br /> <br /> The movie rises faster, and it seems to me that you're fast-tracking twice or that producers have decided to adapt to less than 1h40m and cut a lot of scenes. . <br /> <br /> Realism is not a purpose, but as an audience, I am quite sure that this comedy is not a realistic deliberate, it just happens. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < If it was only evaluated for the first 25 minutes, I would probably give it an eight. As of now, he gets four. ... And that's nice to be! <br /> <br /> If you are selling romantic comedies, then you will probably have a good time. Otherwise, I would recommend watching something else.
