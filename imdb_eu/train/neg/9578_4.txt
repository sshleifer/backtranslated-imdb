Can not A-Pix ever do anything? To watch this movie in the TV mailbox format. A-Pix does not even think of scanning and scanning, we will see whole scenes on the left side of the screen with a shoulder on the right shoulder. Of course, there's not much left for you. This movie is very bad. It is very difficult to enjoy a film of crying at the top of the lungs with 80% of the film without reason.
