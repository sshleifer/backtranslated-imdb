Bela Lugosi, as a mad scientist, is using steals to steal bride and groom using rocks to steal older women. The minest of this movie is the horny one !! Many freaks, as well as many paddings and plots make this movie a nightmare. All the pieces fell together, they liked me in Hollywood fashion. The story never gets interesting, and you see it unprotected. <br /> <br /> Normally it would get minor offenses like this, but it added a bad, boring, entertaining add-on for two more points.
