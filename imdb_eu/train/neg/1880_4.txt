Although Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have been a fan of the show, only 6 years ago saw 'Continue to fleet'. I've heard all the songs from an old Astaire / Rogers record (vinyl), but I do not know about the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the songs are enthusiastic and Ginger Rogers's character is sweet and fun. he could not like 'Peace Baker'. When trying to face his partner for a long time, he is constantly sabotaging his career. His character does not have the usual humor of the Astaire characters in other films. <br /> <br /> It's worthy to watch Ginger Rogers's songs and solo single-stroke routine.
