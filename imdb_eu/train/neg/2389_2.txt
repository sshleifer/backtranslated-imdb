Uma Thurman plays Sissy; A young spirit (and a great giant) is a young woman who crosses the country she makes herself. In the end, he has found a real place in Peyote's illustration vectors, which is holding the Whooping Crane in the ranch; Rain (arch) Phoenix is ​​her lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who is in love with Sissy. Gus Van Sant has directed and adapted the book of Tom Robbins, but his satire has no main purpose and only performs on the map Sitter (Sissy) (perhaps the purpose is not for the audience). The office-flop flop was not so slow, because it did not stop, and it is possible to see why looking for a plot looking for a plot, and performances, direction touches and changing cinematography. The Thurman highway runs smoothly, trying to get on a walk, but this has made it much more in the Kibosh Fenix ​​route. Buck Henry's writer (who did not write, but might need it) gives the performance he most likely does in a doctor's thumb. <br /> <br /> Two fingers down.
