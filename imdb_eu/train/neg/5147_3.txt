It could be 'Blue Desert', even being a central character with a semi-plausible and enjoyable thriller, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox) is not so stupid. When he attacked the streets of New York, American artist Roberts takes him to a small West town. In the first days, Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer, who plays this part well) Randall Atkins will face the crash. After stealing his security twice before, Steve Smith (DB Sweeny, who is not convinced enough of the character, would expect others to think otherwise than believing in a friendly relationship). They persuaded the red lawns to be cast by writers. Smith needs Roberts' collaboration, as he says, Atkins is guilty and guilty of sexual assault. But the police did not try to expel them beforehand. <br /> <br /> The movie was enough to make an interesting movie, as soon as it was soon messed up with Roberts. However, a large part of the suspicion will also be forced to react that Roberts' nature never reacts to simple things, as some reasonable people believe. And delayed responses allow a large part of that suspicion to be easily and unfamiliar, especially in the end. Maybe Sweeny had a bad chance for this role; Too much the baby was reminiscent of the character of Kevin Anderson on the face, the "Sleep With With Enemy" is obvious. Or, if Lisa Roberts wrote a stronger character, that would be enough. In the meantime, the movie is not very good, as a low-budget B-thriller.
