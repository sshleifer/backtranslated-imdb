It's not my fault. He showed me my girlfriend. <br /> <br /> There is nothing positive about this movie. For many years Madonna has been thinking about this idea, but she can not believe it. It's been an idea that, for many years, Guy Ritchie has been a brilliant director, but it's only a bit of a mid-end. Shame inside <br /> <br />
