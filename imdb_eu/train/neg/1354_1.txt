I watched his film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I'm a student at the University of Michigan, so I know something about the movie. Crispin Glover's films are very demanding. Basically, he uses the mental challenge. Shirly Temple is not only ignoring the anti-Christ, which is a bit funny, but also mentions the challenge of intelligence among others, but slaughterers are dying. Crispin also loves one of his actors, and he also plays with the idea of ​​an intelligent challenge. PETA and Human Rights should be above all. It's not as 'counter-culture' as Crispin stated at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, his exploitation.
