I once visited one of my relatives, and we came out as a theater and thought we would give this movie. What's wrong! This film is horrible in every department. I've never heard the movie before, and literally everyone has not yet. It's not surprising, as this level does. It's a comedy, he says, the only fun thing is to make the director's films or be fair. Getting closer to Christmas, this one was cooked under a turkey for half an hour and a half or, however, as long as it was, it was necessary to be a title while I was out. At the end of the movie, you will feel like you are poisoned by your turkey, and you'll regret it as you like to spend your time. Who knows why these things are done. Some people got out of the theater before the movie was over and I was much more than guilty of it. The great thing is that we make good money for me to see something decent, and everything you see is a poor TV, which should show at 2:00 a.m., it's a bad day TV. should not be shown. What else can I say ... it's probably not enough to correct bad words.
