Most Columbo fans accept that this movie was a change in formatting change. Columbo is the only police officer with unorthodox methods. This film has another review of ordinary detective plays in the past. And that is disturbing, because Columbo is not an ordinary detective. <br /> <br /> There are two parts in this interesting movie. First of all, I can not know the title of this movie. It's misleading. Perhaps the title would be better "The Vanishing Bride" or something similar. Secondly, Columbo hides a proof for why it does not offer (at least to the viewer) the reason. <br /> <br /> I do not feel betrayed, disappointed. I'm glad that Peter Falk had returned to the usual Columbo. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
