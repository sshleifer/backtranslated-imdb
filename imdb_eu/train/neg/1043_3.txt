Bad and bad film! I can not believe all the hype that is a pretext for a pretentious and amateur excuse for a real movie! I went out before the theater, because the direction of the movie and the mischief of the camera work! And when you say that truth and reality in truth and truth in this movie is true and true is true and true, it is a daring attempt to be cheap and inexpensive for reviewers and festivals. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. You want your time! I know
