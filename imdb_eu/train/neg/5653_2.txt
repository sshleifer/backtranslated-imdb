That's how we put it. I really got this movie. I get the writer / director to do what he wanted to do. I understand that conversation is dry and emotionless. I understand that the plot was not climatic and old. This was the writer and the director. Very humorous / comedy very dry. With all this understanding, I still think that the movie has sucked. The writer / director seems to try to regenerate the following with Napolean Dynamite. He had the same characteristics. Although the main character was like Napoleon. But Napoleon Dynamite was really fun. The script worked. This movie is not. It has no purpose. Well, let's re-write. Napoleon is intended to extract Dinamita and try to capture the look and feel. Bad it did not work
