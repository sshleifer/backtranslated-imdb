David Lynch's "Brain Dead" worse than the worst "confusathon" is no sense. Bad talent is being wasted (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton), in a cartoon "Tom and Jerry" bouncing on a cartoon. Character development is inadequate. The "strange scale" begins to rise until the end of all chaos. Do not suck on such actors. They do nothing for work, and ask what happens over the whole 85 minutes. I recommend that you avoid any "Brain Dead" if you do not scatter your brain with complete nonsense. - MERK
