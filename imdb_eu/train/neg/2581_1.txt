First of all, leaving my personal sentiments, when I call comedy, all the characters are so annoying that they are writing and reproducing, saying they're annoyed that they all come in. /> <br /> I'll tell you now that I have watched the first three American Pie movies and they never saw the most amazing movies I saw (and the masterpieces on the three sides) "American Pie Presents", I still feel what they thought they asked me When they made this movie? <br /> <br /> In addition, I have other questions. <br /> <br /> Who has thought that using studio funds and production resources was acceptable? <br /> <br /> Who approved the latest script (and what was this person's consent)? <br /> <br /> And finally, why he thought that anyone should merit in theaters, the average cost of the entry is between $ 10 and $ 15, depending on where you live, when you should go directly to discounts. Blockbuster or Wal Mart? <br /> <br /> There's so much trouble in this movie, I can not write a very comprehensive review because it exceeds the maximum words in this forum. It's wrong with the big things. <br /> <br /> The plot does not have generic and stupid inspiration and the characters are so interesting as the paintings are dry before eighty minutes, but this is the biggest thing I can see with this movie. performance <br /> <br /> While most bootlegs do not have much talent yet, they can not be overlooked for a few years, <br /> <br /> the only name in this movie is Eugene Levy. all the time on the screen, with a wise smile on his face, he tells the viewer "I know this. It's not fun and I'm wasting my talent, but why do I pay for the caregiver"? He does not try to joke too much (better than this garbage it really deserves it). <br /> <br /> As I have already mentioned, most of the rest of the pieces are awful, although some of them have been on some great television shows, Tyrone Savage (from the classic Wind At My Back's classic series) An unbelievable and stark character (Some things that can be taught to tropical skin diseases), if you want to kill the desired death and want to die, Christopher McDonalds (NCIS, Law & Order) just hangs on the screen and asks what talent it has in its movie. <br /> <br /> The next movie in this series, perhaps, will be a core soft porn with a story line to surround and get the MPAA. The evaluation of this movie is not at all void with vulgarity, and sexual content is absurdly incorrect that he should get grade X (when reviewing the table or reviewing the movie was about drugs). <br /> <br /> It's interesting that twenty-five years ago, when Wes Craven presented Nightmare On Elm Street to MPAA to get a rating review, he was forced to shoot twenty-five seconds (I think he was partly) shot in the death scene, chest silicone clay casting) An X rating and the movies that could not have another option or film would not be released, but such type was not <br /> <br /> but this is what is currently done in the name of the comedy R- As a result of the fact that this movie has a theater or horror film, this type of content would be more scary than content. X rating. <br /> <br /> The final thing that is really annoyed is the handwriting, written as a dream written for a twelve-year-old child, very sexually imaginative and quite young and terrifying. The corpse, almost all the situations of alleged exposure to the corpse, is called a plot of land in which the smart viewer is telegraphically visible to one kilometer, and the characters are stereotypes of stereotypes, never taking sexual references and the usual unnecessary sex scenes. This movie seems to have been written by some first hackers in the first year, written in the writing script for the movie rental. <br /> <br /> The time to kill the series is long and short. Severe and abusive, this cake fills the road apples.
