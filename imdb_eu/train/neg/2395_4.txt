Can the director himself not look now or a bad time? <br /> <br /> It's wrong, edit it clunkily. Here is a need to compare the various types of disaster scenarios. Do not look now to see how much Roeg loses. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although it was generally trusted. Teresa Russell (now looking a bit sharp, afraid) I can not save this. The earth is pure pseudo-religious hokum; The play is made of wood and Roeg has a great time of its time period. <br /> <br /> Avoid pestilence.
