The idea was horrible, the actors were incredible, the story could be very scary, but the writing was inadequate and there was no depth. I can not access this movie. I can not feel for the characters, there were not many kliffhangers, and the movie is very strange. Was the end happy? I do not know. Is it sad? Once again, I do not know. The theater is not happy. He had to give so much film, but he could not. Because you just change it does not mean, right? I would not really recommend the movie because he can not say that you feel like you've finished the movie. You will be confused. Believe me, you will surely be grateful if you did not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
