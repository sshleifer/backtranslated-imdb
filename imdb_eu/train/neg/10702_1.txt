Interview: sharp, topical; Cast: hammy, topical; Plot: predictable, topical. <br /> <br /> What is Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski doing in this "B" garbage? Plummer was established a few decades ago, after Kinsky had "Tess" and "Cat People" masterpieces behind ... He must be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Bad boys all have bad accents. - * bad * evil accents! (Especially, Plummer!) Where did you learn "German"?) And most of them are bad. The innocent audiences all abuse to laugh. The guy has survived, including: * A 5-inch knife-on knife inserted by the shoulder, which just takes a few seconds to turn the arm and complicates the arm; * a person who names 50 weapons * covers a bandage around his trousers and does not a slight rumor; * it can withstand several punches in front of the fists on the face and skull. - The first door is covered with wood; * fall, back, third floor, on the pavement, without a small signal of twisted ankle or any other such impediments. It has clear lines, the rest, the time is totally dull and boring. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not bad, Plummer brings in a certain class, and it's definitely the best actress in this movie. He can do evil by using criminals who use the most ham techniques without generating their "Ve haff vays and meance" types, But you always realize that you're playing Christopher Plummer. <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste of time. Plays, for example, are the distribution of wooden lines in the 70s in the 70s, since the battle against Bruce Lee is quite fake, but it's not as good as Roger Moore 007 or Bruce Lee. Do not worry
