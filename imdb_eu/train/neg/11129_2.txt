See the 1936 version. Personally annoying, I find Charles Boyer's voice, more cosmopolitan and depressed Rudolf - Omar Sharif tries but is not very nice and passionate. In addition to being old, Catherine Denueve (sp) does not look like Marie. Nothing! It seems too sophisticated to think of killing himself as a man of thinking. <br /> <br /> The only actor in the whole movie that plays the role is Ava Gardner's only impression as Elizabeth's. On the screen, a short one (and the search for more images than the past of the empress), historically Elisabeth's empress did not involve much in Rudolf's life.
