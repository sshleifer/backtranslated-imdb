Francis Ford Coppola had the brain aneurysm when he was unable to create a good movie under the direction of "Apocalypse Now"? <br /> <br /> The director of "The Godfather" and "The Conversation" has asked you what he was thinking about when making this flask. Kathleen Turner finds herself a leading vehicle, she is a woman traveling over time, and she will get back to the teenager, who knows all the things she's learned from an adult, and what Turner is doing with her. But the movie can not be saved. <br /> <br /> It does not have any style, and in the manner provided to the director, no one would expect it. That would be. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
