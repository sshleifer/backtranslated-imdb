The play, other opinions, was very well done. Brad Pitt is well managed by a mischievous and wicked Austrian rider. There is another good similarity. The story may be wonderful, but, to some extent, it fails: characters that are never really understood or cared for, so the story can be quite dramatic because it does not draw the audience. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and cinematic landscape, a dramatic real story, important events that shaped the world of life, but I could not, I tried to involve myself in this story. As Brad Pitt is a great fan (I think it's one of the top 5 of his generation), I'd like to love this movie *, and it's still cool. <br /> <br /> It may be a mistake if I fail, but I point to the end of the movie's creation - direction, script, production, editing - somehow lost me. It's a pity, because it could be wonderful. <br /> <br /> Good day, dramatic, beautifully shot, should be excellent. It was not. Probably, seeing what you deserve is to do it yourself, but do not expect too much, and may not be as disappointed as you. Mostly, it gets bored.
