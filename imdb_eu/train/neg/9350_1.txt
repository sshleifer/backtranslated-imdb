This movie was horrible. Half a half a day so much ... well, forgiveness of forgiveness, but just a bad version of an orange watch. First scene almost copied from Clockwork's first frame! Apparently, it was a tribute, as it appeared on the wall of the clock on the wall of the protagonist. However, the word "ripoff" is correct. The movie was torn by the classic Kubrick, shot just from the eyes of a new director. Blind director Unfortunately, when the work of Kubrick stops the massacre, the movie is even worse. As one comment says, the depth of this film is just thrown away. Arrogant, absurd and ultimately nonsense nonsense. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the revelations of the protagonists would touch a nerve if it were any real development in this film. I did not feel nonsense. And I'm so alcoholic, so it seems to me that if anyone could feel anything, it would be me. Awesome character development, dialogue and line. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is the title. In the case of a movie called "Alcohol 16 years old", alcoholism is hardly a factor. See the first paragraph - A Pink Clock could not overcome it. A more appropriate title would be "16 Years of Violence", or even better "Clock Banana". <br /> <br /> Please, do yourself one side and avoid this movie. If you reject my advice and if you get it, drink it. Believe it.
