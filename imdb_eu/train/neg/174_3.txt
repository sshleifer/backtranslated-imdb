* Spoiler possible * <br /> <br /> 'Lake at the Cabin by Return' is an unnecessary movie. The play was not good and the plot was not far from interesting. <br /> <br /> 'Lake by the Lake' is a good TV movie. There was no warp. Judd Nelson was very good at the first film and much more than he did in his personality. He seemed not to be interested in keeping track of it apparently. His performance was good, but it could be better. I really do not want to comment on the rest of the pieces because, in my opinion, they are not relevant. But I'll do it. Alison's character is hardly shown in the first part of the film. Suddenly, it is the center of attention of Stanley Caldwell. The role did not make sense and it was a little better to think. Dahlia Salem was absolutely terrible. His performance was a decent way out and the interrogation people could find someone else, anyone else. Mike's director was a confusing character. It seemed to be his intention to stay there, but his death was not necessary. This role was good, nothing better, but better than Salem. Stanley, who is supposed to be dead, enters her own film based on "Cabin by the Lake". He falls to the director and in a short time the director dies and Stanley directs the show. Yes, nowhere, the unknown crew will get into the picture and end up finishing the movie itself. There are some murders, not many, and the ones shown are hilarious. One of the actors is electrocuted when shooting the scene. Another character throws it by a motor boat. And it mixes in a plant before drowning. These writers were enthusiastic about their enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say that I was shooting the movie. The way that the small budget was going back to normal was a very fast one. There was also a new booth next to the lake. We do not show them, but the scenes are only a few, and the entire chain of basements is not useless. We worked in the first film, they showed us many more rooms, but he did not do that. <br /> <br /> The character was too much in this sequel. Except for a few of them, there was no reason. The little show was very bad and ... they did not have a goal in this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's the 'Back to Lake At Home.' since leaving the first one. I can take "Lake by the lake", but that was not just spectacular. Judd Nelson should avoid this and so you too. It was not the same as the first and it was too slow. In the first hours nothing happened and the second continued dragging. Not without mentioning writing. Put it only if you need help for sleep. <br /> <br /> So, we see that Stanley is fighting against death and is still alive. As it does, it seems that only a third part of a good movie is possible. Leave a session and we can stay there! <br /> <br /> (Did not they tell filmmakers how they shot us the first scenes of the lakes? They all got into a garbage. Never, never revealing the secrets of shooting. <br /> <br /> <br />
