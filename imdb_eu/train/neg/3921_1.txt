This short rumor can be found on DVD's "Night of the Living" on Elite's Millennium Edition. I would never want to see it better. Replacing bread with bracelets sounds like fun and dangerous on paper. Execution is another thing. This is not a laugh. I never thought of what I would say, "Night of the Night of the Wicked Child's Night, Back to the Terror of Evil Attack, Mutant, Alien, Meat Jan, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: Shocking 2-D" was a MAISON parody, and not Almost lame or boring. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
