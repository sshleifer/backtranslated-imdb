86 lazy minutes of my life. I first dreamed of watching it, and I must say I have never been sleeping in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I've never seen such a huge plot so cramped and so-called. the forced mode and the actor can assume that it can be as hard as the protagonists in the film's own film. <br /> <br /> This adjustment goes beyond all. And if there is no wooden representation, as you can see almost the telemapperter, then the set is the same, as it interferes with unnecessary overlays and is unfreezing, so it's enough to get the whole bunch. . <br /> <br /> Anything that does not appear before a disguised detective, anyone who does not see it, and all the rest of this playful plot, before years of telegraphy, should immediately observe his sight. . <br /> <br /> Bad guys, and two good actors, along with the hyper-coddled abuse of the Branagh brand, need real bullets rather than gaps. <br /> <br /> Above all, homoerotic is a very dangerous tone at the end of it. Everything I can expect is that people will not try to emulate the film level anymore.
