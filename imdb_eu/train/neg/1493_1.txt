I do not really know how to make this movie and think it was worth the work it has done. Even more puzzling people who have watched this film have deceived themselves for about 88 minutes, as if doing something valuable on the couch or reading Levy. <br /> <br /> First of all, surely 2 Irish people can find it, and good women would give them better lines than half-bush stars. Okay, we do gore, but surprisingly, it's not so horrible that the cold star of pornography (first) left and right to see the bodies covered by stars. Probably, he just wants to be something painful after the fear of being human. <br /> <br /> So, if you do not care about: <br /> - act out (seriously, I sucked everyone. I never saw it before. EVERYONE sucked). The movie does not make sense when you refuse to write the writers. <br /> <br /> - subject (it is not necessary to learn about this movie. There is no need to worry about anything in the bed at night, to see or understand anything, or to explain to others). <br /> <br /> - soundtrack (Crap, crap, crap, ordinary and dull music as a script). <br /> <br /> - the landscape (the grace of this film could be saved, but not ... here, not only enjoyable, but also rocks). <br /> <br /> So yes. You do not care about it, you are just a ridiculous teenager with no music and "women", this movie is for you. Positive comments: sometimes interesting cinematography, wasted in other items. Gore very realistic; again, wasted. But the intestinal scene is classical. I agree that the mutation-disembowelment is a fake error problem.
