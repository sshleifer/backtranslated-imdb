What a disappointment! <br /> <br /> This movie came up with an "avant-garde" comedy but was trying to copy the direction, and the script was rude, hurt and sentimental in cinema in the worst tradition. Jack Black's play / role was enjoyed by himself and he responded to himself ... and the other characters were identical and unknown. The soundtrack was boring. We are Black (fans), but no one has survived the forced crash. Why did he feel that he should do this mistake? <br /> <br /> We will not see one of his films without reading more reviews! <br /> <br /> If he read, read. Before signing this script?
