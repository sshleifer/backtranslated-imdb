I'm not a fan of horror movies and I've only seen just a few of them (and not one of Halloween's "thirty-three days"), but I see a terrifying horror film, not for sleeve. And I'm pretty sure it's not terrifying. <br /> <br /> <br /> What happens when a small plastic head is produced everywhere? There are distant plans in all its appearances, so there is no surprise in this film. (It's not a skull but it's terrifying, but ...) <br /> <br /> Soil Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson) worries about it. (Peggey Webber, the worst ever), starts skipping his skulls and hears the mysterious fears of a group of her husband's domestic horses. Did I tell you the first wife who lost her husband in a mysterious accident? Ooooh !!!! Ask who did it !!!! <br /> <br /> This is the same plot about a boy who is rich, who wants to kill and / or give his wife. If you want to see a good version of this thing, try "Fortune Reversal." And BTW, Jeremy Irons has more talent than John Hudson a hundred times. <br /> <br /> MSTing is ok but there is nothing special; It's paired with "Gumby", but it's easy to see. <br /> <br /> Two stars called "The Screaming Skull" Eight stars for MST3K. <br /> <br /> And now, to paraphrase Mr. Von Bulow, "What's wrong with this movie?" "You have no idea!"
