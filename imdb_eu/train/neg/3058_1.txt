When I was a kid in the 70's, local theater was played for children on Matinei on Saturday and Sunday afternoon (do anyone remember them?). They showed one thing a year around Christmas. We saw some friends and myself. I expected Santa Claus to be a beautiful movie. I got the movie was terribly duplicated (you can say) and really amazing. Satan (the devil is full of clumsy clothes!). The images made me lean to my seat. I've always found Santa an incredibly terrible, so that's not helped. Satan's attire did not help. But REAL was scared for me by the wooden carts thrown in Santa Santa sled. He picked up and played the amazing sounds and movements - I remem- ber about having nightmares about these things!

This is a horrible and disturbing Christmas movie that probably scares many little children who see their pants. Avoid this - if you do not want to punish your child. This gets 1
