This movie is no good at all; humor is trying to be fun, because it is so dry and boring, it's only 2 hours of torture. Throughout the film I thought one thing, "when this will end". You have to give them something, they have some very funny little moments, which is why I have given 2 full stars. It is original and the book's whistle blouse is used almost everywhere, although it was not fun for the first time. Blondes is just about a movie and it's basically a joke to record a giant's story. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is a moody blonde, it's not worth the money. See, it's just a bad thing.
