This Italian film of the seventies is also not in the class Dog Soldiers, The Howling, or even the scary wolf in Paris, BUT ... it's fun to watch. I'm looking at the amazing blond girl who directs the actress, making fun of her birthday suit. We are talking about a graphic nudity ... it's clear that it's a real blonde ... humma humma humma !! The story is a joke, SFX children, and actors (mostly) sour. The only redundant value of this movie is (and there is LOT) nudity and sex scene. According to the Tame HBO standards, but you still find it fun to find yourself on a Saturday night without a date. OK ... HERE, THE VENDOR ... There is no young man (except for the heroine (??) ancestor's initial scene, this girl thinks he is a man's lup ... this is clinical Lycanthrope.
