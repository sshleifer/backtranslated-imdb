Annie's wig did not look good. It's not nice and Annie is just enough to play. Annie is released as her costume looks like Halloween costumes. awesome performance and awful plots. This movie is a 1982 release. I think the girl should be younger and smaller. Ashley Johnson represents a very young Annie. It is not attractive. At least the casting director got the right with Daddy Warbucks. Mrs. Hannigan was also wrong. Camilla Belle played Molly well. This "Warning" movie can embarrass your QI, so you just want to show off to your kids. 8 and younger. Plots are fictional and they can hardly happen in the real world.
