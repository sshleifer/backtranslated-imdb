OK Director LOVE activates after making his debut with Nikhil Advani with KHNH <br /> <br /> 3:30 hours + he is making a movie that loses patience, time.etc The viewer looks like they have spent 3 hours watching this movie /> <br /> Okay they had 6 stories, so it was necessary, but why? 6 stories? <br /> <br /> We have an incredible story of Anil-Juhi, but is it boring to tell the stories of the TV series? <br /> <br /> The story of Govinda-Shannon is fun and works well. <br /> <br /> Akshaye-Ayesha story is compelling again, but soon gets bored and a comedy story and comedy are more boring. <br /> <br /> Salman-Priyanka is a story. The worst conditions are not only meaningless. <br /> <br /> Sohail-Isha is a story that we can laugh at and it works in some tricks thanks to the boredom of most other stories. > <br /> The story of John-Vidya has a good story in all stories <br /> <br /> But when the stories come to the bits twice the viewer gets bored and sleeping. above all, the rise of the Salman-Priyanka story is well positioned in Nikhil Advani's management, some stories are handled well but in weak places Music (SEL) is good, but too many cinematography is good, each story looks different, looks and works < br /> <br /> The cast of the actor Govinda, after releasing BB, really laughed and loves you in this movie, despite his age and weight, Anil Kapoor's performance works well. looks empty and John is tired in his party, Akshaye Khanna for a change <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is too much - Ishak has nothing to do Anjana Suknani's release <br /> <br /> Priyanka and Salman shocked you Are you worthy of this film? <br /> <br /> Salman Khan does not only play, she speaks as she sleeps, and this false divine Priyanka accent achieves this. You feel like you want to throw something standard, finally it improves Vidya Balan's good, Juhi Chawla is okay Shannon is okay
