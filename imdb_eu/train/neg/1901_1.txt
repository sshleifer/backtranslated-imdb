This review may contain some spoilers. <br /> <br /> The 1974 automobile harassment movie Gone in 60 Seconds is a good movie version. Actually, it works well and the plot is moving quite well. But a big Hollywood budget did not change that the original plot was more credible. For those who do not know it, the original plots were robbers as insurance inspectors. Who would suspect. Almost all aspects of HB change to one. Halicki's original, the version is a very good movie, until it reaches the final scene of access, that is to say, great part of the 74 version. This version only has watering up to 10 minutes, and ends with a special monstrous effect to attack all credibility. When the original persecution was incredibly credible, the star made his stunt a stunt driver, the remake lasts four minutes. If you would like to see the classic harassment of classic cars, I would like to save the original goods on holiday at your local lease rental and leave the new remake.
