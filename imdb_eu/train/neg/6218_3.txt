Reflection on the film, 9 <br /> <br /> Not good, it's not good. It was a great sight. I was very happy with steps, camera angles, and so on. However, the characters? eh, some kind of bland. Plot? It's sucked. <br /> <br /> This movie was more like older than anything else. The organized religion is cowardly and terrifying. Science is not better represented. It creates a monster weapon that kills everything ... but "souls" have the power to destroy monsters and bring life? Really <br /> <br /> That's what splits my butt slightly. Here is a CGI film ... created by science ... and they use science to give the world a message that destroys the world, promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they asked for a character, "Yes, and now what?" (or something similar). I can not hear well, people get up and make a quick break. "Okay ... it was just a bit entertaining for the whole movie that sat here, but now let it be as fast as possible!" output type <br /> <br /> This can not be considered if you want to enjoy it. Look at your eyes and bend your head. To any thought, "what's the point?" You will suck off credibility and look at the exit sign. <br /> <br /> Ok ... SPOILERAK continue. <br /> <br /> So, basically, a scientist creates a "machine". That is, another life capable of creating a smart robot. They use evil men as weapons. However, the scientist is aware of the blame. He gave the machine intelligence, but gave no heart to him. <br /> <br /> The Machine Skynet is placed on a human donkeys of humanity that completely eliminates the earth's life and eventually slowly extinguishes itself. However, the scientist creates survival and shoe socks. Each one has a part of the soul of the scientist. <br /> <br /> Last # 9 wakes up to say nothing about the world. It looks like a strange nearby device and it takes it. She finds herself like # 2. <br /> <br /> Well, she catches a robot that is the last surviving machine # 2. # 9 itself is similar and starts # 2. <br /> <br /> They have success. <br /> <br /> # 9 warns that there is a hole that suits your device. Inserts and Returns Machine Life ... He pulls out the # 2 soul when he comes out. <br /> <br /> Then the movie continues with # 9, trying to rescue his soul-yanked compatriots. <br /> <br /> In the end they destroy the machine. They drop their fallen friends down the clouds. Then we see rain and life return to the planet. <br /> <br /> Hunh?!? <br /> <br /> That does not make sense. None. Why did the scientist want to incorporate his soul into 9 homuncules? What did he get? They stopped to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why worry?!? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why did not expect anything new to the success of nine small creatures? Why not create the second intellectual machine but fight with the "soul" first ... it seems that at least it would be a sensible option that could be reasonably successful. <br /> <br /> Why should the machine use suction souls by means of devices and then destroy the machine and release souls to return to life? Why do not you wait for life without a machine turned off and life-long?
