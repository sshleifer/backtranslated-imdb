This movie is another propaganda Christian propaganda in the Omega Code. This is not necessarily bad, but most propaganda films want to deliver honesty and realism for the message to be delivered. If you enjoy the polychrome portrait of street life and the life of the Gospel, you might enjoy this movie. Say, save your money and rent the Cross and The Switchblade or Mission. When do Christian learners say sometimes people are saying bad words? Frustrating was depicted as criminals who do not want to swear to see (criminals say bad words?) And I could not really relate the flat characters. Also, it would be good if the film showed some T & A. Now it would be something I would like to pay. What was this guest of communion, compared to the thin story of a movie made with Boondock Saints and The Sting?
