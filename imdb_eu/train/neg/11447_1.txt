The worst movie ever I've ever seen; I'm ready to spend the first ten minutes. The only people who were laughing in the theater were the strangers. Do not get bad writing, I love absurd and stupid movies, but like the next ones, but the whole premise, writing and humor mix. It seemed to me that they felt "Napoleon Dynamite", strange and random scenes, to worship audiences. Instead, it was compulsory, strange and strange. <br /> <br /> I was the brightest of the island's Fisher, and I felt terrified (and Sissy Space) to do this very thing. /> <br /> Thank you I have not paid.
