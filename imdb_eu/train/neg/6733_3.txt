In the title the exclamation point is appropriate, even though approximately. This movie does not cry; It breaks the glass just enough. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers made Andrew and Virginia Stone the most vibrant and most suspenseful suspense that they felt half-documentary. Here, the real locations of New York were filmed with "real life" acoustics to raise the veracity. But the natural sound recording technique is the Stones' maladroitus dialogue and the great effects of histrionic butterfly on Inger Stevens torture. <br /> <br /> In a full modulation performance, Stevens plays electronics as his wife. whiz James Mason (looks slim and bored); The Rod Steiger Strabutics (one and bored) are captives and both captive and their colleague lines to make a scheme to get them out of the air with Mason trying to get out of the air. <br /> <br /> Here is another credibility filtering. to be aware of the unfortunate cancer of all the details, but being sufficiently knuckleheaded enough to be a drug addictive as an underner degeneration. The Stones wants to capture the strain of strained volumes only with Stevens's hysteria with rapist rapist Neville Brand, drawing her sweating and smoked sauce. But the camera's work is so green and so Brand (not so much) the effect is almost smooth, much less. Stones, double-minded couples, do not even brave their credibility. <br /> <br /> Steiger, a movie that ends with a stunning Steiger that follows a bulk carrier's train. The track is as bad as it is bad. Angie Dickinson Steiger's love, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey and Barney Philips.
