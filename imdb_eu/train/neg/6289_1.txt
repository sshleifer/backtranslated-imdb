This is the worst romantic comedy I have ever seen. Every scene is worth it and the two protagonists - Corey and Danny are very annoying. Corey is very silent and naive and never heard Danny's fake promises. <br /> <br /> Neve Campbell and Urban Legend killers are the only features that are saved in this bad attempt by a movie. Danny (Dean Paras) looks like a girl who is thirsty in the late thirties. Corey seems to be still in college. <br /> <br /> Here's the Australian movie Too Smooth; There's nothing smooth about this movie. 1/10 Avoid
