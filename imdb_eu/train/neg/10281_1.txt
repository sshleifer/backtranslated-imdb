Carly Pope plays JJ, recently promoted by Food Critic, which is why his horrible and vigorous mother moves with her. JJ, due to this horrible event, he directs the restaurant owner Alex to "entertain" his mother in exchange for his restaurant. Alex, on the other hand, daughter falls in love with her mother. There are many problems with this film, the characters are universally two-dimensional. JJ is to serve himself, hateful nature, his mother is superficial and superficial. Journals, JJ's colleagues, are wrong and opportunistic. There is no bad, bad, bad message under a woman with no more than 50 years of age. The play is uniformly dull, without scriptural inspiration. Films that save only the film are located in New York. I'd recommend this movie.
