Cinema was terribly bad. Eat your heart while you see it. I'm grateful: do not watch the movie! You want to lose 1.5 days of life! You can not watch and enjoy some movies that are so bad ... this movie is boring ... it's just as boring as this movie. You will hate yourself after watching this movie until it's over. And you will hate yourself, do not listen to me. <br /> <br /> I hate myself. I tortured myself and saw this movie at the end. Sorry, I'll shoot myself. I've seen all. <br /> <br /> Please, please. Read this carefully. Do not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Please!
