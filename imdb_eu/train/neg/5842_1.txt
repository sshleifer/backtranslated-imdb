What a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> It starts with the title sequence, but it's just as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> The movie, the rats is something that turns monsters into and going. in a murder group. The play is not so poor, but the script does not make sense and the film is not afraid of being in the atmosphere music. <br /> <br /> It's really amazing to have a group stone and think this bag together. it would make a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie. It's a trash and I do not need to waste a minute of your life! Ten.
