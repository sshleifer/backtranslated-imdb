Now, I will not deny eBay when I bought this with great expectations. So, it was an incredible work outside the master comedy that I enjoy. However, I was soon disappointed. I apologized for those who liked it, but it's hard to see Compleat Al. I got some smiles, surely, but most of the fun came with music videos (DVDs I got) and the rest were full. It could have been said that this was not the greatest achievement of Al video (this honor was UHF). Honestly, I doubt that this will jumping into the DVD, so that Al's is ultra-hardcore and you need everything, eBay bought the tape. Just do not pay too much.
