MONSTER - It was great; I loved the special effects created by this monster that looked like "Lago Lago Negroa". With the people who walked on the floor and the crowd, the beautifully drooping scene began to fall. <br /> <br /> SOCIAL COMMENTARY: a large part of the story is carried out in the quarantine of the doctors (with the instructions of the government). state that there is a SARS-like illness. In short, we get the story of government coverage. You know, I expect this to be a liberal paranoid book with Hollywood movies that are in the future for our government to be corrupted, but it seems that Korean is copying the format and it is very boring. Here, the excitement and suspicion of this "monster" is removed. Drag the movie The main feature of the film must be seen from a distance from one distance to another, while the allegedly deceased youngster, while removing the creature. <br /> <br /> MORAL: the typical "does not infect the water." Because this message will happen: the monster of monster mutations. This was the message of the Nuclear Bomb of the 1950s, the radiation of giant ants, spiders, fishes or other such science-fiction films. Now they are the focus of their "environmental issues". <br /> <br /> HUMOR This was mostly stupid. I usually laugh but it's not fun. I do not know whether it's a shameful corporate humor with humor, or when the movie tries to deliberately an ultra-modern "Godzilla" old movie. Let's hope the second one. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER - The video transfer was good. There was a sharp image and the sound was very decent with a hobby noise from the back speakers. I saw Korean with English subtitles. That could have been wrong if the Koran's hateful voices were half annoyed after half an hour. <br /> <br /> GENERAL - This was a promise, but it was bad and it was even boring in many places, that is, today's monster movie is impossible. Two hours passed for this story. I do not know how filming has filmed a record for the crowd. They do not have the way of enjoying and protecting movies.
