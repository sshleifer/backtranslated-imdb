This comedy has some fun and entertaining things surrounded by many uncomfortable things. Every scene of the officials of the castle and all its ancient idiots is a waste of time. And the graphics are so noisy as you ask them to be surprised to be able to read a script, or just as they did while doing so. (* 1/2)
