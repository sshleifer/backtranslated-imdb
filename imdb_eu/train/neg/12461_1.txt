The other comments on "Syriana" on the IMDb website, I and my family, saw this movie on DVD, losing time and space at home. <br /> <br /> In the end, this was what the scriptwriter based on the movie was very far away. Instead of trying to say a complex story intelligently and clearly, it assumed that it was mostly blurred and the other 30-second lines that were thrashed together with stories ranged from a dozen different lines, so that the "vision of the story" at great sight and clear . No, sir, no. An excellent view is clarity, precision, plots and story lines - and initial, middle and final characterizations. <br /> <br /> The cinematic presentation of this type - Dim Sum's experience at the Chinese restaurant - is extreme insolvent and incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Father, then, for the presentation of DVD and DVD presentations of the Hollywood and British decades of the 1940s and 1950s. The director and the actors knew the value of performing, talking and acting, they meant something. <br /> <br /> This family is no longer sitting on this DVD.
