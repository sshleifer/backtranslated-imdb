The biography was shown on the channel and was just as much as a comic book! From 2 to 2 I have given the attention of the details, most of them from the 70s, and the three women who played the three angels of origin looked good, so make-up was good. <br /> </ br> This was supposed to be a biography of the biography channel, but it was generally annulled in all its biographies. There are no interviews with cast members, crew, members of production groups, and even their friends, families and their biographers. Actually, I know a lot about this program, now I've done this book (presumably) before seeing a bio-based movie. Actually, nobody knew he knew something about the software and did not know what happened right.
