Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck play at young students at Middleton College. Four teenagers make up two love triangles. They ride a slippery and twisting road on a busy night. It does not look right to another car and one or more of them die. A ghostly nightmare begins ... It shoots horrifying and politically correct action without gore and nakedness. "Arima Carnival" has an impact. Unfortunately, there is no sense of 10 hope.4 immediately for any unprofitable trash.
