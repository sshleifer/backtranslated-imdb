<br /> <br /> entertainment: writers wrote about a thousand times written trash script by bad guys. Improper practice, frustration of the story ... good production value, good including set / location and gorgeous girl .. -rating 4/10 <br /> <br /> social message: the movie has no social message. it's untargeted for free ... but if I guess I was 10, and my intense intelligence was 70. I think it's a message: do not you love being afraid? -Gaia 0/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> faulty things: nothing special, a stubborn stubborn and arrogant stance presented by the writer / director. overall, good, nothing is decayed -8/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> overall 4/10
