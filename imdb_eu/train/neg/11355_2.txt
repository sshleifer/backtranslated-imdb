"Nat" (Trevor Gagnon's fine), "IQ" strange friends (as Philip Bolden) and "Guitar" are always hungry (David Gore) with great dreams. They want to fly first in space. What dreams of their dreams is the first spacecraft in the moon, Apollo 11, waiting for three historic itineraries, where it is nearing three places. <br /> <br /> <br /> First of all you notice the animation of the movie. I found it very well made. The landscapes were deep, like remote things seemed like. I did not watch the movie on 3-D, because it was broadcasting on HBO. However, I saw that there were no scenes to take advantage of the 3D effects, except the battle between final characters. Also, I was not surprised by the design of the characters. For me, they did not look like something, especially in color. The sun was gray-blue, unusual, it could be very attentive to me. <br /> <br /> Cast performances were not bad, but it was not good. Several times I focused on my computer rather than the story. Writing was written for young audiences, with comical moments that laugh at younger children. I did not see anything for adults, because adults get a sense of understanding. <br /> <br /> History was not followed in this film. In fact, I think it was totally excluded because it was the main fly. I also hated when a well-known astronaut appeared on the screen and explained that their story in the movie was a fictional work, and they did not explain to me the Apollo 11 bull. their life for space exploration. <br /> <br /> If you're coming, this is not for you. It was not for the whole family. This is definitely for kids. But keep rain a day.
