(BLOOD CASTLE or SCREAM OF THE DEMON) <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> It was billed with VELVET VAMPIRE. A Spanish and Italian co-production, some of the women in the country are dying at the same time riding a local number called Yanos Dalmar, a dog that follows her. <br /> <br /> Citizens already suspect that everything is behind them and wants to burn their castle. The murder of the Count of Yor for the first time, the oldest brother, Count Igor Dalmar, was attacked and killed in the laboratory. <br /> <br /> Afterwards, a woman Ivanna (Erna Schuer), Igor, contracted to help her die. He appears in his experiments. Yanos wants to hire his brother instead and they seek formulas to recreate the dead cells together. Yanos wants to bring back the body that kills Igor. <br /> <br /> But, of course, Igor is alive (even if he is terribly smokers) and killing and killing women in town. We can see that face faces appear in different parts of the film, so we still know that we are still alive, making everything clear. <br /> <br /> Igor finds himself at the end of another. Fight against more than Ivan Ivanna, when the smoker's candles fall into the same bed, Igor spoils him with another ending. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD comes out from a VHS source. and looks pretty high and bad. Even with the exception of a scratchier trailer, there is no extra one included. The Spanish castle, which is pleasant and horrible and has good atmospheres, seemed to be boring and predictable, without any illusion or mystery. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 3.
