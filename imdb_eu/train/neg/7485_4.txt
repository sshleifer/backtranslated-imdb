What is given seems a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese Neil Simon in a comedy. Where can you go wrong? See the movie and you will know. <br /> <br /> Actually, Martin is the lead, mis-cast. He is currently working on a movie called "The Jerk", but does not create a character that works. Here, without having to play, it's horrible. Cleese is even a partially funny member. <br /> <br /> To finish, the plot is pretty stupid. I can not say how much it might change, but it seems that the characters do not have the smallest bit of wisdom. They disturbed New York, they do not direct anything, and sadly, it's not funny. The whole premise is completely incredible, but it seems that people who live in New York do not seem to be very bright, a theme that is repeated throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In short, instead of seeing this, rent again the original "Odd Couple".
