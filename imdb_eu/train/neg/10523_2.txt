In the first fifty minutes, the Empire actually fits itself: it seems that the gangster film is hard, confident and quite unknown. At that time I did not know why I thought it was good - but now I do it. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems in this movie is that it is purely and completely unpleasant. I do not like movie movies and things to do, to prove a point ... Get Jackie Brown, for example, but they are incredibly small, but it's obviously because of entertainment. You literally feel the knot in your stomach. Another important problem is the protagonist. It is a pride, proud, however - ironically enough ... not so bad. It does not seem to be narrow enough to be a woman of drug abuse. In fact, in the end, this film is completely pretentious. It's not black, it's not light, dull, and nonsense. You should keep it clean as long as you can. <br /> <br /> * outside ***** (from 1 to 5)
