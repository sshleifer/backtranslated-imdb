I saw this work at the CA Film Festival. God, what did the director think? Film-makers should use this film as a case about what the short film does. First of all, this project does not make any sense. The movie "The Waystation" is made partially, the stupid bar in the center of nothing, where anything really happens. <br /> <br /> The operation is bad. So bad, I thought it was a comedy. Julia Reading is one of the main actors behind the pornographic amateur movie. There are one or two different shows, including boys and girls including Jacob and Fenner, but the director is like a trace that does not work or use. Conversation was worse than playing, a nonsensical limitation. The writer (I think he is the director) writes each character as an audition for a bad comic. <br /> <br /> The overall value of production is quite good, but it may be a good thing to do with this film. it's easy to forget. The production design is pretty good, even though it looks like the standard Waystation bar. Costumes and make-up are good, and I understand how to work with low budget production. When they talk about characters, or they try to advance on the plot, they get out of the movie. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is divine. The director / writer watched numerous science fiction films and threw all the pieces he had included in the blender and it was created for that purpose. My hope is to use the money of others, by themselves, it is a total balance.
