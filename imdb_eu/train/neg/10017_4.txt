The "Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" happened in a world-of-the-art country, a time of high age, where a child's most committed sins would be to challenge the law and get a traffic ticket. He begins with a young self-fanatic who gets an anti-business architect business, which is pushing for the car race. Drag it for the race - this B-Flick rock'n roll, man! The people of American International, of course, liked the liking of squaty teenagers and they did not like those who were still adults. There are a couple of entertaining fun and some fruit exchanges (Necking Kid: "We thought we would get a little fresh air" ... Father: "Where do you think you've found it down in your throat?"), But the ghost is just as late. About a short time of about 65 minutes, the movie scammed us out of the screen without the harmful cars and the "Scooby Doo" before hanging out. However, for nostalgia buffs, some mindless fun. ** ****
