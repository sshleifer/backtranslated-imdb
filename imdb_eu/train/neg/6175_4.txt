Was it a thriller, when I saw the cover of the video library as I thought? No. It was "thoughtful food" that the author might want to do? It's not really. So what was it? He was a very mean movie, with great potential, and was well-aimed but with a sturdy story that had dropped off without a strong point, midway through the end, because he expected poor performance at some moments. gave the best performance provided overall. Cinematography was nice, with good colors, high technology, beautiful scenery but asks where you are going and where it is. And let's finally get back. OK if you do not watch on TV.
