Well, let me start telling me that when I say this very hilarious movie, I just could not laugh at myself. Do not write it wrong, Bassinger works fine, but it's just the script, the head thinks well. <br /> <br /> It is a good premise and up to now it is a joyful art of witnessing the murder, but it encourages it, but then it goes down. In the middle of the film, the protagonist leaves his box and, of course, instead of arresting the boy's head, he decides to turn the converter, the car, and then take a relief (like a dead ship) to kill the victims. . <br /> <br /> Then I have the last line I promise, if I do not have any points, I eat my left foot. <br /> <br /> I'd recommend this movie. all those who want to make an old fashionable and incredibly demanding one. Also, I would recommend that the wood I recommend to see the scene in the yard of the scrap, with what falls from the height of a footstool, gets me every time.
