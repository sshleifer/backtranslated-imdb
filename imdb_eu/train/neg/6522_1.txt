This is not a comment on the movies, but the American RUSCICO DVD release. I do not know if there were different versions and updates, but we rented the discs with a 2000 copyright, if that means. However, the sound of these DVDs was absolutely horrible. They often go down the level; When the scene was cut off in a panorama of a battlefield, I would not have known the first ringing of the orchestra track, which was my first earrings or my speakers. When the conversation was in time, the volume would be reduced to something that was almost audible. Sometimes, the orchestra and Foley would interfere with the works while overlapping the conversation. My wife and I discovered that this movie was the only way to watch them from these DVDs so that one of us could move the volume away from your hand continuously. And, another user has already commented, when the selected audio in English was selected, the dialog changed between English and Russian; and occasionally when the characters speak French, duplication was made in Russian, so you are not understanding SOL. Finally, we stopped watching after the first album. Before you shoot your DVD in the library for more than $ 50 + in your library, I would recommend you take a copy of your hands to get a copy of this epic movie if you're worried about the bad sound, especially if you never read the book and really want to understand the line.
