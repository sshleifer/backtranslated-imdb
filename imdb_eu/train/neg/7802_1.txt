The chemical spill causes people to become zombies. Both doctors overcome the epidemic. Andreas Schnaas is a movie to find out about the course. A bad operation, a terribly frightening special effects, and a quote for not talking. Doubting is ridiculous with a R major and it is a sad thing to write a word about that noise, by writing less than ten compulsory lines for the instructions given by the IMDb. My original review with a single word: Crap should not fly, so I have to review it and I will go further. But I do not know if I can, so ... I think I have enough words, or lines, but to overcome this review. That's it, I think. So a summary: This movie absorbs the balls, do not see it. <br /> <br /> My grade: F
