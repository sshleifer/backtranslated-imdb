What was that? A King of Fisher King? Why do we deal with Sandler's nature? What a slow, dull, boring movie, who gives this evil! Simply just sitting painfully, before I turned it. It is so obvious that Cheadle needs as much help as Sandler; As I said: can you say "Fisher King"? And how does this psychotic character work in his daily life? We do not think you think deeply, I think. Why does Cheadle continue to allow Sandler to become an aggressor? If they were good friends, how did they grow up? If Cheadle, then, controls it, why does he continue to advise on removal of the street? We never say it. That's why Fisher King's film was so much better on so many levels and why he sucked it. Average score of about 10 about 8? I do not agree. Totally The top films are also lucky enough to achieve a high average score, and it is not worth it that this dirt is in the same universe.
