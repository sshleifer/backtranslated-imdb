In theory, the movies must have a kind of entertainment. This excludes other experimental forms of documentary and film; Most filmmakers, especially genre movies, do not have to tell the story or the message, they must somehow entertain themselves. All of this, in my opinion, is that the bad movie is not a low production value or a low budget movie, a bad movie that is boring. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" or "asylum of the Damned" as it is known in the U.S., bad film is simply because it does not involve, and boring and boring. Although it has a very good premise, it is poorly developed and the performance is not better. In the other hand, probably, film B could be a classic or classical movie, but here it's just a bad attempt to make movies. <br /> <br /> Philip J. Jones tells the story of James Bishop. (Matt Stasi), a young resident of a psychiatrist, the work of his dreams. Andrew Mental Hospital; But it seems that an ancient secret asylum is hiding. After the mysterious death of some patients and the ongoing rumors of satanic practices, James decides to find out what happens. his boss, Dr. McCort (Bruce Payne), who believes that he is only going to be as soon as he feels mad at the madness of his patients. <br /> <br /> Although the premise is quite interesting, the execution of the movie leaves you a lot. In an attempt at psychological thriller with a supernatural thrill, Jones moves easily and generates a movie full of genre news. Of course, feature films also have a lot of topics; But in the "Hellborn", each one has been wasted and the cheap jump is moving away by moving things, causing a boring and predictable story. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is pretty rowy. Exceptional: Bruce Payne gives a superb performance, which plays the role of not being so good. Matt Stasi is very weak as the main character and the rest of the country is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Notwithstanding these errors, one must write a thing called "Hellborn"; The budget looks very impressive and very similar to the "afraid" budget of today's Hollywod budget. Likewise, makeup and prostheses are very well done and the main antagonist designs are quite good. Unfortunately, the other special effects are evil and outdated, making makeup and prostheses a great deal. The movie "Hellborn" is much bigger than big mistakes. tremendous result. Hardcore fans or b-movie enthusiasts may be interested in their premise, but the experience is boring. 3/10
