The animations were good, the images were good, although not quite original, however, the story was long, very confusing and dramatic. For an hour, I could not wait. With lots of non-contributing characters, they have not gone anywhere or will not go anywhere, the movie was not really a single movie and a short series or two movies could be. If you liked this type of typical story, you might like it, but to tell the truth, I've ruined some of the most creative stories, they have a really good message. Going to a movie by Joan Miyazaki twice and watch it, you will get more out.
