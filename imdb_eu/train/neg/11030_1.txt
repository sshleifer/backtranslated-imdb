I recently saw this movie at the 30th Ghetto-Gothic Film Festival, and it's been honest that one of the worst movie mistakes I have ever seen. I will not go wrong, there are funny and entertaining bad movies (for example, "Manos ?? fate hands") and then there are bad movies. (This goes into the second level). Cinematography was incredible and not in a good way. As everything was being forbidden by the cameraman (as opposed to the double-nipple shot), the lighting was something between "a guy with a bulb that was running" and "not existing". They were just as bad as actress soap actors, but not as bad as porn, and they seemed to be totally shocked by each line. The only characteristic feature of Masker's murderer was Jason Vorhees's classic appearance on Friday 13th. The land was very bad, and the end was worse. This movie would be recommended for anyone who needs an example of an absorbent that does not look like a horror movie or maybe not sleep.
