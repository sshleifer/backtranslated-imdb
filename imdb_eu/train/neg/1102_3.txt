First of all, I must admit that I have seen the two films that I have watched by this director without title, so that I missed the points. My check was not bad, but I was sitting in two films, although I did not try to learn. Samothari is cool too. Kind very cool Ten lines are together and put together. This is not so unusual in a sized village in Prague (tiny, really.) The main characters are between 20 and 30 years. They do jobs and studies. The best character is the Balkan girl. Her feelings are repeated by immigrants every day. That's it. The only awesome character. The others make themselves in hell. How can I sense it with such a lack of clarity? You might have extra curls with Japanese interests, but do I need a stereotype in the movie? If you like good music, watch this movie. If you want to laugh at the stupidity of others, watch this movie. If you like irony and humor, see Jarmusch is not an original imitation. And do not even miss the movie Ondricek, Septej (Whisper). If you do not enjoy homophobic stereotypes.
