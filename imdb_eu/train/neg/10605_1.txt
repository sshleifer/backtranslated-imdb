It was atrocious waste of my time. No earthquakes The plays were in parallel, this should have been used as a model on what NOT to do. Universal Soldier is just an awful commercial past, which is also underneath the theater's banner. It's sad that VD has to confirm his ego every year, and still more sad that people should pay good money by sitting. This type of Schlock gives Martial Arts a bad name. In contrast, Segall, Norris and Arnold are almost talented. <br /> <br /> Maybe VD should take Laslie Nielson's track and send her gender. At least then we could laugh with him instead.
