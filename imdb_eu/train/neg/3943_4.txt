Not even me, but this movie is unbelievably good and good to be such an incredible film, which does not make any sense and waste of time. There's nothing more interesting than a fake movie, and My name is Modizia: whatever the subtitle leads to a new mediocrity level. It's full of B-actors, but it's not serious about it. It sets itself as a thriller, but then the drama becomes more and more, flashback style. The beautiful Alexandra Staden, without underneath the make-up, resembles a sort of Top Model, more than Modesty Blaise. I am not one of those comic book commercials to make the adaptation of the most precious "graphic novels" perfect. In fact, I have never read anything I want to read about. . But that was not that. The film feels half finished, with a weak and very weak composition. Likewise, it is stupid to listen, show us all the small details of the plot and we show the flashbacks of things that happened three times ago (all of us being Alzheimer's). <br /> <br /> I love the good B-movie now: is it better to turn your brain off and swallow cinematic equivalent of a Calzone? - "Modesty" is directed by Scott Spiegel, bringing us a bright sunshine at dusk. 2 Sunset: Texas Blood Money! I love Dusk Till Dawn 2, which has brought all the contribution of B-movie bad on the table - it tells you nudity, rumor, and guns. "Humility" is boring. The flashback on Modest's life is not interesting. The operation is not bad enough. Actually, I like Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (hey buddy, pseudonyms your friends!) As a nasty performance. <br /> <br /> So it's generally empty. Weak Uninspired Call what you want. Ignore anything because Tarantino presents people. This is a very daring, semi-hearted thriller and never tries to be more than that. Let me go round with a sharp review (seriously, I'm still cringing): My name is a modesty: a modest waste of time - 4/10
