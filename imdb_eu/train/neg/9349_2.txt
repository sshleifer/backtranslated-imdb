This movie was horrible. I scored a score of 2, as I saw worse, but very little. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, clicking the beginning of the beginning and the beginning of the beginning. This film uses all the boxes of tricks used in cinema, like a child with too much toy. It was not endless, boring, recurring narratives, slow movement, frosts, flashbacks and unmatched images - one of them was not a sad movie anymore. <br /> <br /> It's called "16 years of alcohol", but there was little drinking or drunkenness, and there was no withdrawal image without jumping to the whole movie without a coherent sense. The story was poorly written and very unforgivable and the director himself was poor and shameful. People have made more money for Mr. Jobson's movie. It is known beforehand that he will be in a rubbish team and that he is as sensible as television. It's a movie <br /> <br /> I found an important fight to end, but in the hope of being better, I continued bitter but it was a waste of time and I would not worry.
