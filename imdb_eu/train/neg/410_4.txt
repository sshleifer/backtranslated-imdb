Unfortunately, the greatest efforts made in the field of special effects have been completely insignificant, along with heavy, meaningless and meaningful parcels, and making an inadequate and ordinary script. The Hollow Man movie is useless. <br /> <br /> Everything you see here has been made to death - characters, ideas and action sequences (especially the axis of the elevator!) - a really interesting item that only one film has special effects. However, it is a special effect that is repeated, and at the end of the film directed at death. I expected Hollow Man to see if the Invisible Man was hardly an original, it would be the basis for something newer and more interesting. This is not the case. It is not a long film that turns into a well-known blood bath and becomes impossible until it becomes a mass of histrionism - the topical hill is so fast, almost spectacular. <br /> <br /> More than all, Kevin Bacon does not do anything to work and his cast assistants are hardly trying. Good points could be a good score for Jerry Goldsmith (but there's no greater competition for her efforts), a pretty interesting use of thermal imagery and special effects. I was tempted by three of this film, but the effect encourages Hollow Man's merits. <br /> <br /> 4/10
