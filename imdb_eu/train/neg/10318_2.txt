Who likes "comedy" shows weeds Little Prinsen's Mosque on the Prairie? There are two types of people who can see this: one of the liberal defenders of Muslims and self-proclaimed ethnic groups is a conception of Muslims, even if the show is good. or it's fun (that's not it). Comedy idea that is very predictable, written and obsolete, both elderly and old people. <br /> <br /> What CBC really is doing and whose viewers should take a look. If they continue to write a comedy for the elderly, guess what will happen, and the audience will die soon and they will not see it. Would it be funny to write to this show too? Do you think they really are Muslims? No, I can say that they are old guys who were writing black jokes on the CBC in the 1960's. <br /> <br /> CBC is in comedy shows. Air Farce was just over the air, but we've got hours, hours, hours, for example, 22 minutes and Rick Mercer, but we're paying a little bit of a "comedy" Little Mosque on the Prairie. Should it be unexpected and fun? CBC would only think that this bad show is not so funny or funny. Shame CBC could only see a few people from the removal of our tax dollars.
