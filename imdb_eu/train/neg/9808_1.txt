The worst show ever I've ever seen. This story, for incomprehensible reasons, is about a group of teenagers with superpowers and when they use a special device, they become rare and poorly-designed outfits. It is worth doing when you are not retired. It's definitely not good, but I'm never the worst actor. However, dressed in costumes, the actors get worse. much worse. Hyper-animated bugs have many unnecessary movements. When they talk, they seem to be in crisis. Rangers are more stupid than criminals. In every section, evil and idiotic, it is intended to destroy Rangers. Then a hyper-animated alien sends a force to attack Rangers. Then, Rangers launches a 10-hour animation transformer and then exterminates foreigners. Then the malignant diseased, it can be an evil armor that looks and acts badly, with an apparent gesture of humans with trumpets attached to his back, showing signs of mental retardation. Power Rangers fight for the villain, then the wicked becomes Godzilla, a cloud of rain or a nuclear missile (they shoot fire creatures and become giant creatures). Power Rangers spend 5-minute hypermarket animation and called Zords, of course, show makers used special effects to make their toys look real. Power Rangers wins, the mad mad, they teach the lesson "valuable" and the show is over. That's it. Twenty-five minutes brain-cleansing, fight against kung fu.
