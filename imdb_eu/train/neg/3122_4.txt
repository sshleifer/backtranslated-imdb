I can not give this film a bad score or a bad review for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The movie is the power of being a thriller and some disturbing elements that are directed towards psychology, could focus on film. Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon as a storyteller for personal matters: his lover moves and Gabriel seems to have told the block. One day, Pete Boland (Rory Culkin) reads and reads a story written by a 14-year-old boy. Pete tells the story of his life and the abuse of his parents. She lives with her adopted mother and Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is captivated and begins a friendship with Pete, but it seems strange that Gabriel tries to know him and that Pete Boland may not even know it. I do not want to make any details because I want to ruin the movie, but I will tell you this: it is predictable. A brilliant atmosphere to tell Robin Williams and Toni Collette's good performances, I thought it was the main character of the film. Collette is definitely the most talented and most beautiful actress. His ability to attract the psyche and personality of the characters he portrays is incredibly amazing and I hope to see him win an Oscar (hell, I think he would look for the best supporting actor, if the script is a little bit better). The film begins as a psychological thriller, but face to face. If you are curious about the end of the filmmaker and discover the naughty, watch the movie otherwise I would like to rent a preview of another "Thriller Hide and Seek".
