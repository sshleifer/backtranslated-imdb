The wreck of this review is offered as a public service, this is the only way to enjoy this melodrama, Lady Barbara Skelton, who will be raped and eventually thrown out. And not a short moment. I booked myself on the screen, but I was afraid I'd hit James Mason. <br /> <br /> <br /> The original 1943 novel, "The Lady and Death of the Wicked Lady Skelton" (people did not invent it). When they were losing out, she wrote, "Women, English, English or Cynic, or Both." His heroine is terribly beautiful, and if the author seems to have a beauty, he does not care. But other things are concerned, for example, that Lady Barbara's immediate response and the response he gets on his way is a murderer. It kills three men in five sessions. Serial Fatale faces a case of disorganized personality disorder that landed on Bedlam or Newgate. <br /> <br /> Lockwood plays her as a narcissistic outfit, wearing so many makeups, at the time of restoration at Joan Rivers (or at a time of restoration at Joan Rivers, ha!). However, Lady B. All three main characters can not get any doubt: Michael Rennie, James Mason and Griffith Jones, all work well, such as Patricia Roce. Of course, the three admirers find out in the short term that a psychotic bitch who plays Barbara, but keeps the plot in orbit until one of them eventually guns, unexpectedly, irony or dessert. With the scene of death and the dramatic death scene that goes down from the camera windows and from the sky, I think there is a need to condemn her death. But he did not like the first corpse.
