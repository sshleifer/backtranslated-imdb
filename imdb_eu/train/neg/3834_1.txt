This movie Gregory's Girl liked it a few years ago. This was drivel. The plot was very unpleasant with his teacher and friend with a girl with 14-15 years of age in a very short skirt. The previous comments seem not to matter, but I found it quite wrong. If you have children at the school, you want to finally think that all young teachers are keen on their students. We were so surprised by the censors. In addition, the movie is just a waste of time. The script was inadequate and John Gordon Sinclaire shook his feet to recreate the image of his classmates, somewhat bad and from the wall. Everyone who wants to see this is why it is amazing. This movie has failed for all of my mistakes. Dreadful Please do not waste your time watching. Life is short
