This movie was really disappointed to me. For a long time I was a fan of Gramsons, and when I was making a movie about it, I got the movie when I got VHS and I saw I was ill. The film was not about his life, due to his death. I thought that Grams would be a movie about Life and Music, but they had to make a movie about his death. I am tired of listening to death in books and movies, I wanted the movie about her life, not her evil death. I was very wrong. People should look after their life, more than their death. The soundtrack was good about this movie. This movie is fluoride to Gram Parsons Fan.
