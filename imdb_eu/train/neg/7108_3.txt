After seeing the credits that I had seen with a name I had known and was a preacher in this movie (Russ Conway), I did not expect much from this movie, and I was not disappointed. A man believes that his new wife will die, other people convince him that he will take his life due to insanity. Her husband is unknown, on the other hand, the appearance of a plastic skull that uses a ghost of an apparently female wife of his dead wife retaliates and uses a true skull. A simple drawing, finally with a double irony. One night you are too tired and you have to sleep, that sleep will help you.
