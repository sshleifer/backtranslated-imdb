He has his merits; Morvern Callar is merits and despair. It's so enigmatic, so original. Is the method of coping to be lost so far and to become unknown? Or is it the revolutionary called the only reviewer? I would call it a dysfunctional person. <br /> <br /> Morvern is getting away completely. Excluding his boyfriend, not thinking of using the money to give his family or not to spend the funeral, he stumbled to himself on a Spanish trip. It seems that there is so little man's enthusiasm. The only thing that allows the viewer to see the human being is the only thing that makes his or her friends a holiday. Even though he eventually spreads his friend and nothing that Morvern links with mankind. He may even die for himself. While Spain was one of the most successful directors in the UK, the lights and colors made the movies look stunning. br /> There is nothing wrong with the movie. It has been running for approximately 90 minutes but is much longer. Morvern was a bit of an interest in attracting attention, but it only takes away from you the points you do not care about characters or movies for you.
