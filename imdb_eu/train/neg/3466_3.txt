Slasher Flick, a slave on the 80s, has a curse that will kill anyone who tries to finish it. A few years later, a group of film students tried to complete the movie, reviving the curse of the dead movies. The great idea of ​​a movie, but unfortunately 'Cut' is just another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia does not have the best world record in horror. "Razorback" (1984) was an American film, "Holwing III" (1987), but half of American film. Regarding comedy and horror, "Body Melt" (1993) is forgotten. Cut ''s problem is that those who are trying to create a horror satira (' Scream ') (1996) but do not understand or understand what they are doing about gender. And yet, it seems strange to me about a movie slasher, but 'Cut' is really a "heart". It's sure that the "basic" rules set forth by "Scream" continue but do not want to play with this formula, it's just a copy of the previous one. It is probably the most boring and charismatic evil in the history of horror film. With its endless difficulty slowly, the lame line-ups would resemble a porn interview in Shakespeare. Throwing will never appear to be fully involved, and it seems they will have to wait for a shot to receive those who pay the salary. And the intent of the movie is not to be compelling intentionally; A neighborhood like "Neighbor" or "Heartbreak High". By the way, the MTV style essay, in the "research" sequence, seems like hyper-cinema sessions, dated and out of place. <br /> <br /> If we still get a terrible fear of Australia, we still expect: we should get the leaf in "Mad Max" (1979). Instead of trying to copy it to the U.S., we should try our genre's behavior.
