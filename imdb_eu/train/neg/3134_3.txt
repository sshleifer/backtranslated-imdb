"Fallen" is included in the category of Loss of Life (WOL). I'm sad that two older hours were not entertained. My family members also saw this movie and dropped sad comments on the screen and rooted in mummy. I felt the sadness of the actors (Wagner). I have read other negative reviews and I can not add anything else to this movie for another 25 minutes, so it could take a 30-minute slot on the TV without losing ground. They remind me of a dish with good ingredients, but when it's served, it does not taste. In my low opinion, a 42-meter mummy should be 8-10 feet and replace the mystic my plot and replace it with several people who wanted to recover it, and bad guys wanted DNA samples. The heroes are unequivocal and their institutes pour into their ear. Then, when the evil people break everything. The hero would save days and they all proved.
