this is the result. A piece of trash that is not classified as a movie is just a piece of a movie that has no meaning. Well returned to the actors, who thought they would make a short film that would make a small amount of money and would try to make a great horror movie. However, it is a great fear, however, that it is never a film. "Hobgoblins" is an awesome performance, but worse is Richard's main boss, who is so weak as well. Well, when you throw the batch of friends and try to make you dread, in the smallest and smallest budget, no less, this will happen. Well, at least MST3K version was the horny one. However, this is still a terrifying movie, bashing it all worth it. 9 for MST version.
