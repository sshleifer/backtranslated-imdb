"Delirious" Eddie Murphy is completely and completely rude, raw, bold and fierce. That is, in fact, the only way to describe this horrible and trashy piece. Eddie Murphy looks terribly valuable, but laughs to win her track. She has a fun occasion, but she's mostly lost in bad language and bad jokes. <br /> <br /> Forget it! If you do not enjoy Eddie's bad style. I do not think I will work with "Eddie Murphy Raw". I prefer Eddie on the boundaries of a movie script. <br /> <br /> <br /> January 17, 1998 video
