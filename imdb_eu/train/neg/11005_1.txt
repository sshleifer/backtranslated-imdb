This movie shows a row of sketches, they pass through each other. I realized it was late in the movie, it only annoyed me at first. <br /> <br /> Many episodes of this movie are known without punishment and simply try to go around this event using nonsense and lust. No attempt to stop comedy strangely trying out. <br /> <br /> My employee and maybe a subjective result after seeing this movie (My God, pissing me in my head every time I call it "movie"): A brave attempt to make something great. But it failed. At least the director did something he did. But it's not okay. <br /> <br /> Many films were not very fun in the way they predicted, but this goes far beyond this. It is a true expression of film production's worst case. To correct myself is worse than that. Badly so gags a movie, that's not fun. It is not fun to even see the principal actor, writer and director (all the same as video games), drowning in the sea of ​​movies. It's a bad movie for that.
