"Boom" has earned a reputation. With Taylor, Burton, Noel Coward, Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey heavyweights, it might be a temptation to think, how could it be bad? Actually, it's much worse than you think. <br /> <br /> The worrying and disturbing event of "Boom" is the decline and fall of the aforementioned heavyweight. Only director Joseph Losey has been deeply immersed in "Modesty Blaise" and "Boom" (some want to add the "Secret Ceremony"), and he recovered and created his best work in 1970, "Go-Between". . <br /> <br /> Tennesee Williams's work is sadder among all.

Taylor simply has never been worse, by alternating the behavior of the incident. Although his face is getting well, he is delighted. In addition to physical decline, this time he lost credibility essentially as a serious actor, having completely forgotten his (and worse) challenges for his credit. <br /> <br /> A lot can be said about Burton. After the famous live star, Hollywood won the reputation and luck. But this time, the body of his work (1968) should not be mentioned at least. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward left for a while in the theater instead of being a force in the comedy of his room. He likes Williams and the British "young angry". It seems that he is enjoying the camping, but he does not know how to manage toys, the man who claimed that talent. <br /> <br /> Only one member who maintains his dignity is Joanna Shimkus.
