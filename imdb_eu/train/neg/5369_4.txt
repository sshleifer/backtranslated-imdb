Does this Shonda Rhimes group seem to be writing offshore somewhere, maybe MediocreLand? The "PP" reminds me a lot of boring, initially but a foreseeable season by David Kelly (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal and now Boston Legal). The crazy cases they get are so strange, they hardly remember the sympathy or sadness. And that is what marks the good medical drama, that is, the dreadful state of fear that this may be "for me". They are not fun too. <br /> <br /> The actors are pretty good, but the plots are dead and can not be re-lived. I am a therapist and I will tell you - Amy Brennan is a non-prestige therapist, a non-coach. He has written Stanford's ethics and transfer / counter-course courses. Someone should read an Ethical Code (Nose Bleeding with your wife and therapist). There is nothing wrong with the therapist. <br /> <br /> Those who are bored by the women who go forward - have been killed, we graduated "Sex and the City". Addison's aggressive attack on the man he likes is very unparalleled, a female over 40 years old is so unparalleled as this other talented actress does not believe and does not deliver well. The only successful / delightful development is struggling with the decision to go to Addison LA, and "Voodoo Dr" and widowhood. <br /> <br /> This concept would be with all the writing groups.
