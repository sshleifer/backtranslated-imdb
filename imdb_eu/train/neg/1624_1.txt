I watched a couple of years. I could not sleep and there was nothing. So I looked. What really gets me does not make sense and that's why it's worrying. Richard binds him into chicken wire and starts with Jarvis with a little girl while Richarden is an unconscious girl. Then Jarvis's friend Troubator plays his guitar with stupid songs. The next day Richard shows a girl talking to Jarvis and Trouby, and then plays Richard and looks at him as he is still. Then they play a happy music and the movie is over. What do I mean? Have they broken off? And what did these 2 boys say (Trouby and Jarvis)? His puzzle and the poorest. I can not bear worrying movies and they do not make sense. I was the worst movie I ever saw in the 90's of Lord of the Flies.
