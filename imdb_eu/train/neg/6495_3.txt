This film, I rented about the merit of the trailer, and, of course, with Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> Jackson Pollack teamed up with David Lynch and Timothy Leary to create a movie. result I do not think that a LSD trip I saw in this movie seemed like a part of Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> The character is a series of sets that penetrate reality and exit. or different realities, and the movie does not take place for the last 5 minutes, since it is suddenly sensible. I wrote a review on my movie review blog, basically everything they do, and I will not do it here. The film is a well-made piece, and the sound written by Sir Anthony Hopkins and I could tell if it's a feature of this movie is music. It fits perfectly. Some interviews are incredibly good and at the same time disbelief. <br /> <br /> I really liked a large part of this movie, I really did it, and once it's over, I really know what's wrong. It is unfortunate that you have 2 hours of hard work until you get to the point of exception, minimizing the effect of the whole film. <br /> <br /> I give 10 to 10, in fact, the real problem of this movie is not acting, it's all.
