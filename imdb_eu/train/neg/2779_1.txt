Of course, the actress will do nothing when you offer enough money. I do not know how many John Rys-Daves got, but most of his money should go to his fans, such as a riot to link ROTTEN to a movie. Special effects were worse than the B movies of the 1950s and the rest of all, even worse. As the performance was about how bad the baby was, I think it was the second best performance. The English was incredibly accentuated and I did not write in English any way of writing, because words need to write sounds, rather than learning the script and trying to become a "character" and a true character.
