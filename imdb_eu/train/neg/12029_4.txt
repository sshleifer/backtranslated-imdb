In general, if you do not hear about a movie before watching it on DVD, it will probably be a good reason. I did not hear this movie again in a blockbuster and I saw it on a shelf. All the good films were already rented (however I wanted to see), I thought I would give it to him. <br /> <br /> It's really not a genre of other films, such as The Singles Ward or RM Films, you might enjoy it. <br /> <br /> However, if you are not a Mormon, surely this movie will not appeal to you. There's no way to avoid a religious message inside it (and sometimes it's sappy and cheesy). In the end, if you do not fall under the demographic mormon, you may see something better. <br /> <br /> Instead of confessing, it was a very funny time in the movie, but I do not think this was enough to recover the whole movie.
