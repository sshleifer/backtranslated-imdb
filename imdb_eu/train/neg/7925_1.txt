Do you want an excellent recipe for failure? Take a line, add all the weak and developed characters, and throw them into the worst special effects known to the horror movie. Leave the stew for a week (probably the time spent in the trash). The result is Corpse Grinders. The short film includes dangerous and exotically low films. <br /> <br /> The movie was awakened. My words can not see which one to see. This is not one of those worst films you and your friends can sit and laugh at. This is not part of Plan 9 space. Time is in vain, it is sad and sad. I have seen the bodies T-shirts II as one of the greatest energy and talents ever. I became depressed when I realized that people really took the time to act in this shutter of their lives, if you can call them. Rather, it is the last thing to be criticized for the bad direction, poor writing, everything in poverty. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a fugitive one. It may seem like a friend or a loved one. Actually, I am also due to the destruction of all the copies of this movie, so it will not infect the thoughts of the filmmakers. Thank you, Ted V. Mikels, you have given me a new respect for each movie I have ever seen. It's really terrifying to me and why I'd like all the likes or boring movies.
