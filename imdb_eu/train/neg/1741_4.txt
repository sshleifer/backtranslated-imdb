The Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal combination is gilded with HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA previously; So I went into the movie (in an Indian multiplex) with great hope, especially after a sharp promotion. Unfortunately, before HULCHUL, this film was a great despair. <br /> <br /> Like the rest, the premier premise of the movie is nothing more than developing the premise of the film. or additional layers. After a while, you want to finish the movie so you can go home (if you were watching at home, it would be much easier to cut losses). Akshay Kumaren's interpretation is average and John Abraham has never tried the comedy again. The movie's comedy aspects were quite weeks. I only remember that it was just as big as a double movie. Certainly, at HERA PHERI or even less AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA consumed me, they laughed at the stomach. Paresh Rawal had some of her classic moments, but, in general, because her role and nature did not grow, she did not have much effect on this film. <br /> <br /> Neha Dhupia, who only makes the appearance of the film, looked fun while on the screen. Some songs are fun. Mostly, the songs of ADA and KISS ME BABY are opened and closed, respectively. Otherwise, it is better to send the movie.
