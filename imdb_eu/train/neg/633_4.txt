Good Earth lives in a slave and poor farmer in China. The movie is Pearl S. Buck. The story is very good, but I hated that Anglos were playing the main roles. Walter Connolly is like a farmer's father. He has a heavy American accent, like most of the actors, I can not hear you speak. <br /> <br /> It's pity that Hollywood could not overcome their racist beliefs. Asians cast their heads. Making Anglo-Saxon and Chinese Similarities in Anglo-Saxon are similar to African-American shoe wigs.
