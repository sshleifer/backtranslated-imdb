Okay, if you miss two hours or if you really hate your life, I could watch the movie. Everyone laughed. Not only do you have native topless but also bad effects that are likely to be unlawful in most states. Actually, the rating of 'PG' is also quite fun, if you watch Native Porn Extravaganza. I would not give the movie back to my nephew. You can not show this to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Agreement. The plot is tidy and topical, silent and stupid. The performance is horrible, and the end is so painful that when I see it, I slipped salt in my eyes, to burn myself with my illusion of my TV screen.
