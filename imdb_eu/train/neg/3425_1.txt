As written by the writers, I will send this review a lot of time. This is the simplest LUZATU sequence EVER has been made. <br /> <br /> They killed Navin Johnson. Mark Blankfield's GOD-AWFUL performance was not only. Physical comedy was forced, flat and predictable. The monkey mongoloid scripts were written with names like Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. In my opinion, how producers got rid of this cinematic effort. Ray Walston, a veteran actor, got a tale of lesser talent. Michael Schultz has to shame himself. <br /> <br /> I wanted 96 minutes of my life to see this great memory of a great comedy, to convince everyone involved and to this cinematic cinema.
