In general, the movie is horrible, and it should never be done. One of the problems of this movie is that there is no connection between the audience and the characters, for example, if he wants to attack him, "O God, no!" You want to feel it, but you do not need it in this case, you do not care to know the character. In the trail, it seemed to be a great movie, but there is still no suspense. It might not have been a mystery, but there is not. "Everything is an instrument box." She was told at the back of the DVD, thinking that you thought this movie was carefully planned, and you would think that it was actually done, but this was not the case, "End" was horrible, very straightforward and useless. The operation is below or below the average, perhaps lower. In my opinion, one hour of my life was lost. "Special effects" and groups were also average, and nothing special. There is not much bloodshed, or blood without violence, there is little blood. This movie was amazing to announce it, but it's not really worth it, but I do not recommend anyone, unless they are so happy, do little fights and a boring story.
