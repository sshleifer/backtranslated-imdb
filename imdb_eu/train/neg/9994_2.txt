Hmmm, a sports team is in an airplane crash, the decision to kill her friends on the snow and kill her friends is hard to survive. Anyone who knows the sound? I refer to "Alive" in 1993, I taste them better than gizakiak yakak. <br /> <br /> Stupid: The first scene does not have a reliable firearm in the Yeti hunt, and does not have a backup copy. <br /> <br /> The plane crash is completely false. It would burst in the air either when it fell to the ground or when it exploded. People did not survive, but science is a fiction. <br /> <br /> The stupid ones: they survived and they are cold. Some nearby smoke-free residences may be used to freeze death. It's like hot fire ... <br /> <br /> WTF: The pilot is frozen on the face while still alive, but in a strange way, no one else. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Stupid: a boy tells others to search quizzes and candles, but the parts of the aircraft are scattered around them. <br /> <br /> Stupid: they find coats and hats, and yet there are bells in the cold Himalayas! <br /> <br /> Stupid: they're looking at sticks, I'm saying, the parts of the aircraft are already burning. <br /> <br /> Stupid: Himalayan storms stand out. It would be sensible to collect waste to strengthen their structure rather than sitting outside their heads. There are many pine trees and their branches are excellent insulation. <br /> <br /> WTF: Certainly, use a deceased arm as a cover. <br /> <br /> WTF: The guy knows so much the habits of Himalayan squirrels, bears and leopards, why not know enough from the beginning to shelter and make traps? <br /> <br /> Stupid: when trying to catch wild animals, the stupid conversation about this trap always helps. <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how difficult it would be to cut the freeze? body with a glass part ?! <br /> <br /> WTF: The party was ready and armed to fight against Yeti while two others stood helpless. Yeti pulled the heart out of the heart and stole the girl's head and the team did nothing. It's love <br /> <br /> So, we think two Yetis and a comfortable shopping test to bury the sun ... or do we? Mwuhahahaa! The story continues even more stupid, but in the last 15 minutes the most common acts occur, as usual. With good thinking about the javelin and the chain, although this is little intelligence (with a magic chain), they were not able to fire, even though they were still at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < ). <br /> <br /> The last one, however, is not a quote.
