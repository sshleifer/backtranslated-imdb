You know Jason, Freddy knows you and you know Leatherface. Now, prepare: Safety Pin Killer! Reasonably, in Killer workouts, when I've ever seen a huge slasher movie, it hides the killer (or?) The victim with a novelty safety pin. The best option is the type of thing that deserves an explanation. Of course, the film does not even try to clarify what the murderer has achieved. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, an aerobic gym attacks a mad murderer and everyone is suspect. In fact, the film gives a series of hints about the murderer's identity until all the movies kill a potential killer. And all killers die, but it's just a deletion process. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, after losing all the names, the aerobic classes continue seriously. In fact, there is nothing to stop the dance. Three men will die in the next room, but the training progresses. Death is not a factor either; a character dies, but it is still visible in advanced training sessions. David Prior knew what he did when he named the Killer Workout and not a logical workout. <br /> <br /> The police are following it, tearing explosives, and hundreds of women's skin meat are disposed of in a timely manner. As a woman getting tired, I felt very uncomfortable at the end of the Killer workout. Finally, luckily THE END started flashing. What happened next? You have got some shots for women who work. The end of the movie can not be stopped! <br /> <br />
