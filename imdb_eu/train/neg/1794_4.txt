Not your usual story vamp, not bram stoker or anne rice here. a real, original story. These Vampyres are genetic mutants that prevent sunlight. evil is pure. <br /> <br /> The movie is not perfect. Many actors are clear fans. Even though two directors who play van helsing and ramp vampire are pretty good. The film is very violent and it may bother some people. Besides, it will be understood a lot and will have scientific details that would get bored. I sold a good storyline and a pair of good performances. It's not that this movie has a lot of success and has a bigger budget
