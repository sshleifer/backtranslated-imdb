I must admit that they like the first half of sleep. It looked good, the performance was better, the story of the childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. Hollywood movie bigger But ... until now nobody has mentioned (at least in the last 20 comments), when he came to court and Brat Pitt's character, his two friends, allegedly accused of murder after rescuing them. felt cheated. This movie is insulted to my mind. <br /> <br /> Warning! <br /> <br /> Why did anyone accept his false coffin, the priest witnesses? If both men were with him, why would they not tell in the study? Amnesia If you are a member of the jury or jury, have you believed? Is it sensible to take away the murderer's motive? <br /> <br /> Sorry, but in the end, the story is very weak, and it overwhelms me. This movie had a great potential. 4/10
