I do not see a lot of TV and I found this show. Show reality I'm sure this is not true. When I was a man and married with such a joke, it would be a reason for divorce. I think that a loved one is a bad example of a person who needs to be treated. One thing is that our world is bad now, many people with bad relationships, who are selfish and love what they really do not know what they are. It is a self-sacrifice and not something that must be on the merritt. This does not give us a good feeling to see what it takes to have private advice. If the identity of his show is true, then he deserves a worthy person, who loves true love and whoever he or she loves. Is this exhibition a reality or a rating? I would like to know Goodbye, GB
