When discussing a movie called 'A Flat Snake', we should point out clearly that snakes are very important in the plot. <br /> <br /> What we here is not a very bad snake. like real snakes. The snakes are terrifying, because they are seemingly slimy, they dragged on. These snakes do not like that. They would be played as a video clip. They are cartoon snakes. In my opinion, I would say that one of the greatest phobias against real snakes would not be too scary because <br /> <br /> why would CGI be the next? why not be suspensely trusted. Full 'less is more' ethics. or even better, why not, first of all, look good? and then you might not even use them <br /> <br /> you can see john carpentry 'things'. Here we have real slums and impressive proportions. They spend 20 years and we get sfx crap putin 'flying snake'. When will the people wake up with the smell of coffee? Special effects go back! <br /> <br /> You can surely say ... but the movie is a joke, get it? I'm sure this idea, but I'm fine! In addition to the above, the movie is a crap interview. and music and sound effects are not great or memorable in any way. <br /> <br /> I could meet all the other actors that are part of this movie, except for jackson. what did he do there He was the star of Pulp Fiction 10 years ago. is career advancement? Will people give you money at a good price? no I would like to know what Tarantino thought was when he was in the middle of a movie <br /> <br /> current generations are very small expectations. and it seems Hollywood offers them what they want. After leaving the cinema, I've seen some ads to make future releases awesome ... DOA: dead or alive, (another) cgi animal movie called "flushed away" and another "crap looking comedy". Also, I've seen some awesome trailer, for example, a British horror / comedy (other) crap. I really do not watch movies in the theater industry for a long time <br /> <br /> I hope this movie is sold on DVD for Â£ 1 for 6 months. and if you expect a black comic, a great snake with ton and a good story, good conversations from samuel l jacksons lips. forget it
