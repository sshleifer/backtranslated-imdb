Sogo Ishii is a talented filmmaker in good condition, but tells the story of a Gojoe monk and a rival of his warriors. The film has the main features of a low-budget production, including dark fight scenes and bad mounts (you will find it in a dorama produced below). Benkei monks informs his spiritual teacher that his fate has defeated the mysterious spirit of the Gojoe bridge overnight, but he did not realize that this decision is going to conflict with all the elements in society at that moment. He could give him hope. <br /> <br /> However, there is no ambition in the representation of the conflict between saints and conflict between the world. Artsy helps with photos and photos to compensate for the style of making movies. <br /> <br /> Disappointment.
