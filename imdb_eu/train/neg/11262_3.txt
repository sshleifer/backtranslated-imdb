Adrian has left his asylum, rich and without parents, his life seems empty. One day, he meets Gonzalo, a prostitute mother. Desperate to win money, Gonzalo Adrian helps his life and who helps his parents. It is a new director's movie, and it is very clear in most films: non-direct scenes, necessarily interviews, some incoherence of the script ... However, the end is unexpectedly well (well, just a bit), which keeps the movie somewhat . They are well-known actors and of good quality, but they do not have enough inspiration to make the movie interesting; They all made better papers in another movie. The movie is boring and you will probably spend a lot of time until it's time to go. Obviously, movies are worse, but they are probably much better.
