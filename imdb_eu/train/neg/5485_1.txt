Without confirming what was said about this previous film, I would like to add that I wanted to see the movie ... the role of provided / positioning and the excellent director of Michael Winterbottom, etc. ... had a dark evolution. The story of 'Do not Look Now'. Stay in different environments (Italy again) to cut the hair loss heart ... or maybe I saw that way? So that's why I sat down on the story that started to open, and we put the hope that would have happened to that family in a European foreign country ... and I sat down and sat ... and what did I guess? nothing happens! and I do not mean anything! You're never given the chance to make characters, which are dimensionless and insignificant ... The rhythm of the movie makes you believe that the whole movie would turn itself on something that would happen ... Flirty children with their older children flirting with their children, had to get the feature length in the other direction, daughter The younger one's vision of the dead mother ended fruitless and unnecessary exercise, the father tries to fascinate a female student. he was ridiculous for his age. He felt that the script made a last memory and at the last moment they decided to delete the story's guts and eventually did not go down. Credits kicked off (unexpectedly) you can not help, but when you've been stolen your time, you sit down when you see this garbage stack.
