The movie is described as action / comedy. In the first 15 minutes and James Belushi's presence shows a humorous gangster movie. <br /> <br /> However, the introduction of a hilarious headliner begins with some gigantic rough plots that do not hide in the end. The comedy movie (the description is used roughly) and moves between surrealist drama, with adult scenes with external contexts. Women's lead (the title's angel) is misinterpreted and the actress is not an incredible scriptor who asks for her. extreme characters must be portrayed. James Belushi is the only one who manages his part, but also loses his script. Avoid one.
