In 1975, FLYING GUILLOTINE's MASTER movie is spectacular and wonderful. This is not because the battle is especially inspired or because the film does not make sense. Because cinema is so absurd, and therefore the classical outdoors is bad, but nice. The film has a Frisbee-like device, in a chain that captures the crowds while throwing it on its enemies. Who cares that physics is impossible or that the movie has silhouettes, 12-meter-fighter shields or the guy who is blind! It's just the ball to be seen from the beginning to the end, and one of my favorite "bad" movies and friends. <br /> <br /> As a result of that film, I was looking forward to seeing FATAL GUILLOTIN SUPPORT. (1977), unfortunately, it was not a sequel, but it was a bit of a knock-out: it took a lot of original ideas, but rejected the film's coherence or view. Surely, that's funny, but it's never closer to the value of bird's vitamin MASTER entertainment. Like the original film, there are extravagant wings that separate heads, but they are very different: circular saws and almost intelligence. In addition, there is no blind man, but a group of wicked non-profane people, and what the viewer does not understand is similar to what happens in this English-language version, because the plot is completely incomprehensible. However, at the same time, some martial arts actions are very good. Although Bruce Lee or Sonny Chiba are not a high standard for most films, he deserves a lot of fun in the plot, though it's often confusing. In general, it is a movie that fans of martial arts would like. Its many shortcomings, many, many, many), but also others are likely to turn off or laugh hysterically instead of acting because the movie is so ludicrous. BUT, most importantly, never approach or watch as a GUILOTINA GILOTINAREN MASTER. Bad.
