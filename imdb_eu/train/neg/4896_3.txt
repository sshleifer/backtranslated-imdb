I like it. <br /> <br /> I liked the songs, everything about them was great, costumes, music, letters (when it was a good translation) :), choreography, everything was. . <br /> <br /> I love scenes of karaoke and cooking scene. <br /> <br /> But that's about it. <br /> <br /> I get it, art cinema, blablabla, but it's too much. Too much silence (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours of listening and sometimes crying, really ...), boredom too much (it would never be a boring movie, what it was like!), Too much pornographic scene (I actually get the movie I got a shot there, but really, really, it's really too much) I think it's really about watching movies and that's it. Without a doubt, it is not visible at all. <br /> <br /> 3 star songs.
