Sick It's really incredible that I killed myself. It's not entirely talking. The best part of the entire production was the work on the cover of the box. The budget for this movie was enough. Shooting was sub sesamo. The production is like submarine shoot for hits. They were stolen in a props clothing store used in this movie. The end was so predictable that you needed to move faster to the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there's a book for this movie, it's sure to be better. I would like to avoid all this. I enjoyed intimate scenes because it deserved the whole movie. I'm joking.
