For me, it seems that the face of the movie fell. The main problem for me was thrown into Glover as a serial killer. I do not know this by the type of growth, or just Glover could portray a convincing flower. He is a good man, which is always evident in his performances. On the other hand, the movie is the story of your series killer story. Nothing is very innovative.
