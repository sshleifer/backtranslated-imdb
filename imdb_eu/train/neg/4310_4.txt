This movie is about a very sexy sexy Olympic track, hired to train high school girls' basketball team. It's similar to Goldie Hawn's WILDCATS, Cathy Lee Crosby has the title role, and she does it as she does. I think that Racquel Welch would have been a better option, but given the quote for the film's television movie, they probably did not pay. Cathy Lees looks great in all movies, but we have never seen naked. The story is quite predictable, at least, it's not a surprise. Michael Biehn is a young man and lucky man. The star of the group and the interest of Cathy Lee's love. Keenan Wynn has some fun scenes like a rich man who runs the sports program and does not believe a woman needs a sports coach. This point is generated during the film and, of course, dated. Ironically, Cathy Leek does not practice putting his team through unorthodox sessions. A male coach does nothing that does not do anything. A highly talented and not-so-hypnotized player is one of the most entertaining players to overcome his classes and play Sydney Wicks as a basketball player. Everyone seems to have enjoyed this movie, but Cathy Lee Crosby is the only real reason. He is not a great actor, but he has a brilliant smile, beautiful hair and a shiny body.
