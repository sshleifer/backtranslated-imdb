This is the first of these "8 Films To Die" albums and I do not want to see any of the rest ... but I have heard at least a couple of honest ones. I do not know, this was not horrible, but it did not really do me much. As a child of your basic cannibal family, the mother and father died, the family that sold the family and moved to San Francisco (?). The best part of it was the witty sister of Goth, which, of course, never let you invite a friend at school. However, of course, we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on. This family is like the White Bread version of the Sawyer clan, they are evil and bad things, but they do not have a soul. I see a lot of opinions from people who liked it, and I think I do not know what I lost, but I was very harsh and I do not recommend anyone really. 10 to 4
