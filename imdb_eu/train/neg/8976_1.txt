The first point that calls attention to "Mozart" is not a summary of the IMDb. The description is easy, because it remembers a story, script, plot, or something that reminds the least structure of the movie. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most pretentious and honored director of the film industry, and his vain filth is between his hermetic films. I think he does not understand what this is; But there are intellectuals that justify or explain this nasty movie, and it's fun to read reviews. <br /> <br /> My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Para Semper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
