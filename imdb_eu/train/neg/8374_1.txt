What is the review of this movie? It's bad and cheeky, it's a bad thing, even though it makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> I'm depressed by films like "Little ones". Films can be thrown out. This film was made for boys and girls from 18 to 24 years old, for those who had hoped to get out of the studio, who had just seen the opening of the word before opening the night, so that the films can be quickly retrieved. investment <br /> <br /> The great ideas with some filmmakers and other filmmakers probably could not do the movies, if they were going to throw away these resources to make this puddle. <br /> <br /> Grade: F
