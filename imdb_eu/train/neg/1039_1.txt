This "movie" is one of the most feared things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Please, take a favor and avoid this generosity. <br /> <br /> Shaking your camera and having your actors. The creditors do not count "direction", which is what the film requires in the mastic. It's not that writing is wonderful, but we were left with a totally artificial, totally artificially-targeted character (the style of the pseudo-documentary of those who do not know how to direct them). > <br /> This cinematic film has made cinematographic cinematography (that is to say, most of them), which does not know first and foremost the imagination of the critics. <br /> <br /> Just terrible. He says a lot about Sundance and what happened to Victor Vargas.
