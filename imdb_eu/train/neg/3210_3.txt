There's really no way to cross bush here, Lady Death: Motion Picture is just bad. The main character, a well-functioning blonde in Hell, enters into a casual bikini leather bikini scene, but the movie seems to have taken place in the 1980's with a cartoon-based image line. The wicked guy speaks as a skeleton wannabe, who has a mandatory killer, and lives on a Saturday guardian who looks like Blackstar's old cartoonist. Do not expect humor to be in conversations. Other times, it looks like a story that best suits your minds. However, there is no sex, no tentacle rape (Thank you!) And very sex appeal, that is, the physical appearance of the title character. There's only no adult edge to this material, if you do not count the bloody heroine and bloody deaths. Basically, here we have a section of She-Ra, Power of Princess's feature film, but with skimpy clothes and more gore.
