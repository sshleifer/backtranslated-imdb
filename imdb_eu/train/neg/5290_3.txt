I'm not usually decorating a movie. I see good points and do not pay attention to the wicked, but there are no good points in this case. In my opinion, if you want to be something bad, why worry? A part of the film is taken deeply with Anne's face, while she breathes deeply, and the violin plays in the background. The other one is full of wood and wood. Rupert Penry Jones is out of print. Jennifer Higham plays Anne's younger sister with modern ways. Anne is meek and self effacing, which is initially well depicted, but she keeps it throughout the film, and you do not see the reason Wentworth falls in love with her. Generally, production has no sense, and too many mistakes need to be made, such as the exhausting of the concert, kissing the street, walking through the streets (why this scene was in the film?) Was one of the most romantic scenes in the book scene. In short, a horrible movie, very depressing.
