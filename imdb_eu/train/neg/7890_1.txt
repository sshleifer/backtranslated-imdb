How sad it was that there was no possibility of sending less than 1 mark that I saw this nonsense and I barely believed what I saw. Every part of the movie was awesome. Music, theater, story, everything, everything else. I really found myself laughing at several points in the movie. Especially I loved the slow strange movement that our heroine was moving through the hospital, and blows his clipboard from the hands of the nurse, ... well. Because it's just Product location? Cross (Cross?) Everywhere. If you are a Christian persuasion and would be very happy, you would like this movie. If you like this movie, you need to get more out.
