I'm sure that MST3K is a kind of IMDB that likes fun-like movies. Yes, and after seeing "man bushes" and reading dozens of comments, which are explained below, I would be persuaded that this is happening here. There are people who say what people hate "just fear", "I do not know horror good" or such things. Well, I do not really care about gore, but I want something in a movie! Most women are just sitting and looking around! Or walk around the house / garden! The movie requires something to give the atmosphere, you do not get it, just someone walks and looks at it. Oh, and "Do you think"? Yes, I thought "MOVE! YOU @ # $ 0 &% !!" I've never seen one of the worst movie horror ever! <br /> <br /> For P. Disk, Dracula, Frankenstein, things like that are hobbies.
