Simply, it is not available when trying to glorify a part of this film. <br /> <br /> Trashed straight to the trash. Initially, you might think that you are a visually stunning cinematography ... and shortly afterwards you will find a great FAIL sack! Fights are barely a martial, the performance is at the edge of the edges and music is not worth exploring. A story is enough to create an excuse for this movie. The decisions made by the characters are weak, and the way they face the situation, and I have not failed. I think the only reason for this film was to act as a fanatic service through Yumiko Shaku.
