Fourth of the Oscar's fourth girl received the second episode, giving her the same performance as Cinnadella Liberty. 73), Agur Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and Only When I Laugh (81); This time he does not have to drag a child.

Caan is wrong, they are mono-dimensional characters, the conversation is very analytical and there is hardly any detail.

NYC locations and Joe Bologna, and Valerie Harper's painful thrill are not important, but at least they blend well. And at the end, at least, there is a huge song singing over credit.
