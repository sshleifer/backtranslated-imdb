I know some critics and viewers say it was a satire, there were many political and social messages, names were related to other names, etc. Maybe I can not realize these things (but I do not want to), I'm interested, because I'm interested in cinema. Regarding the same film, it is once again said that the movie is fast and powerful. I saw nothing we saw in the monster movies except for the scene in an office in the second half. Yes, this scene says something about humanity, but it does not make it a great movie. The movie momentum or scene is sometimes entertaining (gradually), but more than that. As regards the biggest mistake in the movie, they are visual effects. It was moving, I could not get together for some time, because I expected a realistic monster, because it was not one of the oldest films in Goji, it was made in 2006 but it was not. If you do not believe in a mystery, you do not care. If you agree with this, it is highly recommended that Cloverfield is very realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting, but the effort is at least foreseen. Sharp critical They talk about some critics as if it were a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it's a drama rather than a thriller or action, but it does not mean it's terribly powerful. I do not want to host a host with other monster movies, but I mean that the host is not doing something other than monster movies. By the way, some people may be called movie masterpieces because they have sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes, I like Asian cinema, but that's it.
