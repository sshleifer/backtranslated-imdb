As a Dane, I am proud of the best films in Denmark over the last few years. It is a shame, however, that this rise in quality has helped most of Danimako film critics lose their sense of criticism. In fact, it has become so bad that I no longer trust any of the Danish films, and that is why I have stopped watching at theaters. <br /> <br /> I know it's wrong that any development misfortune is a movie, so let me emphasize that "Villa Paranoia" would be a horrible movie. As claimed by critics, the flame of fire of the disillusionment of the Danish film was added. He also waited until he appeared on the DVD against the healing sensation that was wasting his time and money. <br /> <br /> The successful director of Erik Claus works for social realism in the city of Copenhagen. Especially I liked "De Frigjorte" (1993). He is a fun actress, though, in general, he plays a special role in all of his films, that is, the part of a slob worker who holds good luck, largely because of society's motivation, and above all in society, and who because he regains his head. Making something good for his community. <br /> <br /> This is the problem of "Villa Paranoia"; Claus is considered to be a chicken farmer, that is to say, a bit of rules, which is ever credible. <br /> <br /> It's much worse that movies need to be rotated and rotated, and telling a story how to break all the rules to make the audience understand what happens. For example, using low-budget effects and a bad camera work experience with the death of the main character is very sad. After that, the character tells his best friend suddenly feel the desire to throw himself across the bridge. The whole movie is a symptom; The actions of the characters have little or no motivation, and it contains the smallest way to communicate with Claus's motivation: show instead of telling. So, in a moment, he listens to a person who speaks sensibly about a catatonic person, how the script would not feel his feelings; and later, the voices are reinstated, probably as a thought, the audience transmitted feelings to the public for the impossibility of the director. Fortunately, at this time you are watching over an hour past characters, and even less so-called tales. <br /> <br /> Clausen's movies have often been a problem. It is summed up in a sad statement: SÃ¸ren Westerberg Bentsen, the only other amazing star, was Big Brother's competitor, not a cast actor. <br /> <br /> I give this 2-out-10 rating.
