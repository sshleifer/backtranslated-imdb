I am convinced that people in the Texas and Louisiana community should have had one or two laughter at the Paramount B image unit during the war period. The area surrounding the Sabine River, which is open to the film, is only a cotton country, as a Southern depth or, at least, a civil war in the Southern Depth was sent. There are not many cattle there, far away in Texas, more than Richard Dix and Preston Foster are far away from building their empire. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a partner on two boats. and when Leo Carrillo tries to rob his services, they pay for their cattle, they keep cows. And that begins at the beginning of the great Ponderosa. <br /> <br /> On the way, Foster's Dix sister will marry Frances Gifford and feud with smaller neighbors. In addition, they also have other races with Leo Carrillo. <br /> <br /> However, Western-minded people are not disturbed by geographic features and are still a good western man from the Harry Sherman production mill. West Hopalong Cassidy in Paramount. The vowel is bright and, literally, I mean the gun fight that should be used in A production. <br /> <br /> But I would not look at western fans.
