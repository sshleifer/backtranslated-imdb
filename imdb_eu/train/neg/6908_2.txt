This series had a potential, but I think the budget would not have this chance. An interesting configuration, like "lost", goes through the 1st. The whole series, 6 episodes, could make a compelling 90-minute movie, but the makers wanted to go back and they wanted him. Many scenes have been overwhelming and long before the action is carried out. Music was very annoying and did not work in general. The characters that cared for some people did not grow during periods of time - well, it grew a bit. It was as huge as the final series. The only management here is art and clothing, they created an interesting appearance, it was very bad for writers and directors not to make any predictions that would make something interesting.
