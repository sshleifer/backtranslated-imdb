Hello I'm from Denmark, and one day I went to the movies with my friends in the afternoon. This film brought the film "Russian" and it was very horrible. After seeing less than half a minute, I would have to say that the breakthroughs that we decided to move forward were to stop at "highlights" or the "lowlights" movie. I was surprised to find out that this movie was my homeland made in Denmark ... this has been the biggest mistake ever.
