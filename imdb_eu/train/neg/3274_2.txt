Again, Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds make the TV series a feature film and have seen hundreds of people. In essence, cousins ​​Duke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) are in the county of Hazzard for a long time running fast within "The General Lee". But their actions must be achieved jointly with the family farms, which is destroyed by the entire town, to make a huge coal-fired Jefferson Davis 'Boss' Hogg (named Razzie Burt Reynolds). Daisy's sexy cousin (named by Razzie Jessica Simpson) and uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), but also Rosco P. Coltrane (Lost's Gainey M.) and police officer Sheriff Sheriff. Joe Don Baker, governor Jim Applewhite, as deputy for Jack Polick Cletus Hogg, as David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, as Michael Weston Enos Strate and Lynda Carter as councilor Pauline. The only reason I gave myself an additional movie star is that the car is a couple of stunts, of course, because of the beautiful bodies of Simpson (my legs are not quite Catherine Bach, but still!) I think it's pretty boring. Razzies was named Worst Picture, Director Jay Chandrasekhar, Worst Remake or Drama, The Worst Screen Simpson and Simpson "Daisy Dukes" and Worst Screenwriter. Pretty bad
