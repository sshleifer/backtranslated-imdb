Cinema was really bad. Michael Moriarty's "Cole" character was the main reason, but the actor believed that the draw of the South was a disgrace and that the character would be more evil, but not. After about 20 minutes, I wanted to appear a therapist, which would add a bit of sincerity. <br /> - <br /> - 1) misconceived - 2) simple character - 3) fixed line <br /> <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
