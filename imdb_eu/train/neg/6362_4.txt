I am a seventy-year-old Italian film and I would not question the beautiful Barbara Bouchet to list my favorite actors of all time. So, with some hope I got into this movie. However, soon it is revealed that this is not a movie that will make sense anywhere. It's clear that no-one would enter much more, but this is not a sensation if you think it's more annoying if you think it's sad and that the character is not interesting. As the title suggests, the movie is based on a 'rogue'; In this case, he robs the woman and smugglers. This is basically the plot of this movie. The film has a real "seventy-style" style, all of which is very careful. It seems some times that the managers of Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to put some point on it, though this is not very well. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on the screen is always enjoyable, and this is also the case here; It is the best cinematographic film and the sequence of the naked car is the best part of the movie. In general, Rogue will probably appeal to people who love the 70's style, but unfortunately they do not offer much.
