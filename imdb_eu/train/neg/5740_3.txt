I found that darkness is just too dark. They had some good ideas and ambitious ideas, no worst-case scenes and some shining moments! But the disorder was under. You do not know what's going on in a dark scene and a movie that is filmed in the Super 8 movie, you're already glad you face. As with Nathan Schiff, it's too much. Leif Jonker seems to want to make an original movie, but he does not have any knowledge. The camera never points to the right place, such as basic basics, such as shooting simple scenes of conversation and even how to hurt a movie. The actor is completely different and hammy. Although negative, music is good, there is a lot of gore and plasticine is incredibly wonderful. Is this a classic? Do you deserve it from two albums in praise? NO. The first attempt is good. Now these guys will stop playing in the back of this movie (as I understand here, the only one I've just finished) and try to do it again again.
