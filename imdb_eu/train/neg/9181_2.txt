When I criticize film, I try to be professional and constructive, but God! The movie I ever saw was worse. Bad operation, bad effects, bad script, everything is bad! <br /> <br /> Land continues to be a group of teens who are rave on a remote island on the ground (who happens all day). However, when the band arrives, the dance floor and bloody clothes are found. When deciding what happened to the rest of the parties, the group of clans went to a mission through a forest of zombies. During this crusade, a police officer and a captain is helping each child give their weapons properly. They meet Jonathan Cherry and other survivors. In essence, the movie is a collection of sequences of actions that do not direct the rest, including a fierce shootout outside the "house of the dead". This fight was a tough Hollywood strike, hotdog rotation with HotD video game redundant and camera matrix. The character is also a volunteer to save others. Why? He was not noble and courageous, but because he parted one part of his face with an acid, a zombie exploded until he had stirred up a quick creature after the imbalance! Should I feel this sense?!? <br /> <br /> <br /> To sum it up completely, seeing this movie is not a doubt to see how horrible it is to see yourself. They were dead in the theater on the screen more than zombies, and I am sure I'm going to cover the lost costs to make the piece that I see easier. GAIA: F
