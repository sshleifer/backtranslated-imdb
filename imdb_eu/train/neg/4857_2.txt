I liked ZB1. I really did I have no problems with low-budget movies, and I enjoy movies that have worse production costs than ZB3 (you can think of something like this. Check out 'wiseguys vs zombies' if you are interested). I prefer lower zombie movies, I am suspicious that the Hollywood director does not understand what zombies are. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But ZB3 was just so bad. Back He did. I did not bother to be honest in my criticism. I wanted 90 minutes earlier, etc. It really took only 80 minutes, because I was partially moving forward 1.4X. <br /> <br /> Ok , therefore, some criticisms. <br /> 1. The abilities were TERRIBLE. Everyone talked with monologues. Someone had a single line, including camera and editing and a F-bomb set in all the phrases as a FEEL monologue It turned out to be about 90 minutes early in comparison to 70 minutes of ZB1, but there were fewer 'events' in ZB3. It's all talking. <br /> <br /> 2. Gore effects have been shameless. Simply You can be immersed in the wombs. <br /> <br /> 3. An epic explanation In spite of this, there was no real plot. And it's an epic explanation! I do not spoil it, if you want to see it. (Do not observe.) But then, a bunch of lame people just walk around and bickering about 80 minutes. or less, if you like.
