I'm sad that the story of such a fascinating and so rich material in the film can become a ho-hum event. WM C Quantrill has hardly appeared in the film, probably the best image of the time. Frank James was never mentioned, Cole Younger, the director, and Bloody Bill Anderson, who would cry for his sister's death when the battle was once completely absent into the script. Instead, we had to watch the never-ending fiction characters we looked after. how sad The costumes were great, however, at the location where Missouri was thrown. I hope that Ang Lee will take on another movie from that era and try again, or explore a huge wealth of material from other filmmakers on the screen.
