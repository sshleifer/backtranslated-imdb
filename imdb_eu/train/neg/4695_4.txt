I watched this movie several times and I never thought it was fun, but it's still fun to watch and scatter some laughs. <br /> <br /> It's a women's business and their boss. They will give him a jerk and finally the taste of his medicine and they will try to obtain a respect worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Efficiency is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of those stars of the 80's, it's just not difficult, not really bad. Dolly Partin is lovable and fun to watch the comedy and she really shines to the bottom of the south. Jane Fonda is so much and does little to me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this movie, she has the most fun lines and she has been laughing a lot, I would love to. I like the movie but I do not like things. It starts great and has a pleasant flow, and then everything starts together and I care less about the characters. Everyone has the fantasy and "nice" ones about what they would like to do, I thought the movie flow slowed down. The film continues to be chosen again and the funniest things happen, and then it is slowed down again, which can be quickly retrieved. It's true very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> stars, but try not to see them. In my opinion, according to love, it may be roughly liking.
