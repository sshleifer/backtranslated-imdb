The series, based on the book of "Queen", by Alex Haley, tried to use similar formulas, which is, for a long time, a long history following a family's life. The Queen's result was a masterpiece, but here, in Mama Flora, there was an inspiration. First of all, maybe the book itself, and definitely, in this television production. Years are gone too quickly, such as the superfluous, superficial saga that opens up, is not as authentic as "Queen". The full picture of the staging of the first parts of the film, which was carefully prepared, seems to be confused with Dallas-forsythian, as the film progresses, it mixes three or more hours in its final third. I expected more; But, clearly, Haley did not inspire this story to be near his near-biographical "Queen", and Peter Werner III is not equal to John Erman. Only those who invite long stories of growing generations are advised.
