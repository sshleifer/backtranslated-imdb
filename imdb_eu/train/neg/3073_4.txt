In the back of the DVD box, Ellen Page plays this role. It still does not appear two-thirds of the movie until it's a small role. I do not support roles, but a bit of "bit". The plot is not an explanatory item. Some examples are: why does the main character deny his eldest son? Why does his youngest son drive on the train? He said that "sale" is a bet and does not explain anything. Of course, the scriptwriter does not know the definition of the wager bet. This movie does not seem to me the price of the rental. Save your money and watch it for free on TV, if you need to see it.
