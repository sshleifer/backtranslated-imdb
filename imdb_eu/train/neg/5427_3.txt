The typical Goth Chick (Rainbow Harvest, Winona Ryder, crosses Beetlejuice and Boy George), although he feels that he has found the home base of his house and his mother (horror), Karen Black, with the help of a new home with his newly discovered mirror, the only thing remotely hated) to buy. The effect is quite laughably bad (especially in the interactive mirror referred to in the Rainbow) and it is not afraid or suspense. This film, that is to say, three investigations are much slower than the last. People looking for a similar theme, but the film's efforts were much larger, it would be advisable to look for the "Friday, September 13" section where a girl finds an old, damn complex mirror. That's more than 40 minutes that it has immense silence than the entire franchise in 4 movies. <br /> <br /> My quality: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Charlie Spradling offers an essential T & A.
