Wow I was thinking, but it was even worse than I thought! Sometimes I like to see a good movie "crash": they're so bad and you can not see the bad thing you can see what you want to see outside. This is really the only reason that can leave television - an evil fascination. It was not so much a performance, a cascade or a bit worse as expected than this cast, but the premise and plot that never saw the light of day. The script is also astonished. Concerning cinematography, someone noticed that using the "curtain-drawing" device was in use in an old 50's television series ... but without irony? I thought I was supposed to be joking early, but the movie is seriously taken for the use of tongue cheeks. Do not ask for punctuation ... The high point is Morcheeba's latest song. I think they wanted to leave $ 8 with people ... I saw it happy on TV !!!!! Wonderful! I wonder why it has been a problem Timothy Hutton has recently discovered a lot of work? If you do not expect much, and if you want to see a thriller boring, an afternoon would be better than cutting your shoes, which is why it's worth 2.
