As a girl, she moved away from her small village in Tokyo to Tokyo, leaving behind the two best friends, Fumiya and Sayori. Returning like a young woman, she was surprised to see that Sayori's teenager was dead. They came together with Fumiya and they are doing so tremendously, reviving Sayori Shikoku's island. Oh boy I like to rent this I'm afraid of horror and I think Chiaki Kuriyama is a good actress. Unfortunately, if I had to describe Shikoo in a single word, it would be "fruit." This movie is nonsense, boring, poorly shot, non-imaginative and, above all, not bad. The Kuriyama screen has a minimal amount of time as a resurrected Sayori, and his character is given little to work.
