I usually do not have trouble moving away from a bad movie, but it was the only case. This movie was so bad, because I was really sitting down for almost every prayer, it would be about a minute of movies to justify just about half an hour. Needless to say, I was disappointed. A group of university friends, located in a beach house where they celebrate the holidays, is having a lot of problems because it does not deserve to be seen. First of all, there are empty holes. Secondly, the C-list is very small (I do not dare to call the B) actors can be damned, so any scene that potentially fails. Thirdly, the movie rate is very noisy and incorrect, most of the time to see the suspense building is very difficult. There are few surprises for audiences. Fourth, and more importantly, the end is completely anti-climatic as it is partially ending (knowing who is the murderer) and partly because of the horrible conversation. Regarding the film's credit, I can say that I'm ever saying that the movie is a bit worse, I've seen a single movie and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> So, it would be like a bad joke, it would be happier without ever hearing, if you ask someone you do not know the next time you want to know a secret, you will not cry, you are not really in the opposite direction.
