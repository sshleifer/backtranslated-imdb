I watched the night movie and I expected the best of all the cool vehicles. The cover of the DVD was also good. As I can see, I started thinking about others like "Oh my God what this this". The moments were awful, but then the stupid music music was prevented. Then rock and opera seemed suspenseful scenes. That's what ruined me and if I lost my mind, I thought I lost my money again. A lease and deck of art were deceived. It is not in the music itself, there were erroneous parts of the movie. Whoever has not edited the film does not have any idea what they are doing. He showed lightning rods, saying they were caught. sea ​​storm That would be more interesting, but it did not happen. The play has never been seen, they are unknown, and this is his first feature film. There was no point in the plot where I was desperate. At first two men saw all the teenagers in the boat, and in the end, supposedly the only girl had existed and others were imaginary friends or were not ghosts because I was not very sure, because it was very badly depicted. WhyteFox writes a comment here, it says it's a real story. He believes in ghosts and spirits and says he has a ship that shot the movie. There is no mention of being a real story. . I have never experienced such a thing personally, but I do not say it's impossible. I think anyone who wants to rent this movie, do it at your own risk. If you like amateurs in horror movie amateur, you would like this.
