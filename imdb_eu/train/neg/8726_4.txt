First of all, I mean that this movie is worth more than four stars. I have given four stars, for me 86-minute movie seems to be 2 hours and a half, and it's not enough to sit down. However, "The Big Alligator River" (better than my DVD title) is better than a movie longer than your average nature. <br /> <br /> It opens and employs a tourist resort located in South East Asia. trying to manipulate wildlife. Mother nature is seeking revenge, the Crown, the Alligator giant. But the creator is not the only thing to worry about is the tourists and the main characters (photographers and establishments workers), their natives are also getting worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite well done with adventure / horror story with music score and good directions. But the aligator himself, the main attraction of the film, is a false appearance. Some tips for her cheeks are good, but we have to see all this. Some underwater remote shots make it clear that it is something we're really dealing with, probably in the zoo-reminder store. But the locals are incredible, but they are not real. <br /> <br /> Probably, it does not stop the movie, if it's appropriate, but to be well-carved and well-crafted. And like many creatures, this has ended with a large number of bodies. It also has good jungle landscapes. It's a bit smaller than the rhythm, but who hoped it would be better, right? <br /> <br /> Much better is "Primeival" than the last one in the US, but it should be compared to "Jaws". But keep in mind that you might not be able to access a few points.
