Cafe Lumiere is a beautifully photographed personality. Without knowing the director's work, I am well acquainted with the filmmaker who honors Ozu Yasuji. Not too close to our greatness, Houk has told Ozu about the concentration of emotion and depth within the meaning of a closed space. One of the things that Ozu has to pay attention to is that he does not "himself" his "main character" (perfect white page). There is no medium or narrow plane in its town. One of the DVD add-ons offers interviews with actors, and it does not give us Houk: faces with good looks. <br /> <br /> Bardem created Nunca Pasa Nada, an excellent Spanish film. Something like "Nothing Ever Happens." That would be a much better title for this sense of exercise. Throughout the movie we give a glimpse of a dark Taiwanese composer, some of the tracks we hear on the soundtrack. But the traces, like everything else, do not add anything. If you're not a train provider, this movie does not recommend it.
