First of all, I'm not really "fancied in the new ways I eat" a fan of all things about the genre of cinema, but I'm a bad hobby of cinema, the neighbor's neighbors said he had the worst movie. This So we see it. First of all, it is engraved on a camera with no tripod! Secondly, the white doctor's white voice has doubled a large black man! Thirdly, no dialogue is meaningless. Fourthly, although zombie scenes, bad makeup and sticky tomatoes are convinced and astonishing, I think the director (and neighbors next to me) need psychological help. It's a fun 5 minutes, but it's fast growing. He is so amateur, it's like watching over a high school video game ... with a zombie. A note to anyone involved in this movie: I wanted to see this 20 minute of my life, before I went to sleep, I wanted to go back.
