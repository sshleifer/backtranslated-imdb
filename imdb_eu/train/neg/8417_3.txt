I released the movie as soon as any fan of Broadway. I read and read comments in the months that I had commented on. I mean Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles and Danny Glover's star power ... The movie could not be less than 4 stars, right? WRONG! I definitely finished the product disappointed. The film was not publicized and Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. Facing alone. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy's film James Brownesque denounces the movie, and the performance of Jennifer Hudson forces him to focus on the screen every time. It was time for the performance of "And I Am Telling You". You hung up for a good man not asking him to stop him in the group and his life. Many reviewers have stolen the film among the best actors, and it deserves the effort it receives for performances. Anika Noni Rose was very talented with voice and comedy. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles, on the other hand, went through their shows. The actor's capabilities of this film seemed to be "Ray" before its superb performance and Beyonce Knowles came in a long-time shooter or video recording, starring and amazed at the movie. His performance was not strong enough to take care of the character of his film. <br /> <br /> The movie was too much, 30 minutes and 1 song (Beyonce Jamie Foxx's "heart solo solo"). too long <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
