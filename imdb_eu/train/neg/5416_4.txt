Von Stroheim was the third endeavor of the director: he is quite crude and the atmosphere of camera and editing does not show the atmosphere a few years later with his masterpieces GREED and THE WEDDING March. We basically have a trio of griffers, masquerading as a Russian number and two princesses who rent a Russian villa in Monte Carlo. Their goal is to falsify money and make money in fake games. Part of this plan is to count on Count (von Stroheim), the American ambassador and his wife to "stand up for his stupidity", gaining its frosts and money lacks by its weaknesses. Similarly, the girl ordered the saving of the prescribed life is also wrong. When he saw them together he entered the fire (von Stroheim and his prey are on the balcony of the room). Here, von Stroheim establishes his character as "man who loves hatred". It is very bad and the mistakes of its character lead to an end up endowed well deserved. In cinematographic and editing films it is gross raw, and it is not worth seeing the director fascinated. If they are jealous, as with the wife of the ambassador, he is reading a book - he says with Erich von Stroheim. It was originally planned as a 210-minute movie, cut into the studio for 140 minutes and 70 minutes later. Kino Video Recovery retrieves images of older versions (somehow affected by most scenes) from a previous version version of 107-minute print.
