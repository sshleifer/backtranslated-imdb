I do not know ... maybe because I'm a Brazilian, but all things were too much. Too much love for music, too many faces, too much contrast between the pleasant life of the main characters (continue, not so sad) and the director of the city. Everything looks good to me: families, relationships, music, "congratulations." Only sells Latin American culture's false culture. I have to be honest: I have been fascinated by a bit, but who would not seduce the false life of music, sex and pleasure? I'm not a fool: what kind of world is there, where people do not suffer from diarrhea, deep sadness and STD? I liked Charidad's call for phone calls and talk with all musicians and Spanish people.
