This movie was absolutely terrifying, although I feel comfortable calling a movie. "Mumblecore" is a typical, zero-plot movie and a bunch of rumors about 20-something things "to figure things out" about. I tried to give Mumblecore a chance, but it's incredibly honest. <br /> <br /> I'm not synchronized to the movie, I'm grateful for Dogme95 movies, Idioterne is one of my films of all time. So, I do not care if a movie is cheap (substance). <br /> <br /> In this movie, everything is awesome, acting, writing (or not everything was improvised?), direction, but above all, the camera's work was plain and absurd. The camera was never anymore logical, there was no coherence. I had to admit that it was a boy I heard that there was nudity in the movie, so I thought myself well, even though there was a nasty buzz around everyone (I know, I'm a jerk). Well, thanks to a wonderful camera, you never see anything, and the things you see, I use NI - NOT to watch. I wanted to throw this movie on several levels. <br /> <br /> I wanted to vomit the interview, I wanted to vomit the camera's work, but most of all, some critics of the film praised me. Now, now, I want to throw anything over.
