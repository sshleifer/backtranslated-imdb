I thought the movie was quite lame. If you are looking for cheese, you might like it. I, myself, I do not like a huge amount of cheese, but this one was ridiculous. The progress of the movie got bored and the story was very weak. <br /> <br /> They were the day-to-day zones that were entertaining about that movie, but this is not enough reason to watch this movie.
