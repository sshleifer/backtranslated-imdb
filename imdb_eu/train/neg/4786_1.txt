I scorn movie horror, this is not a secret. Non-terrestrial, play-offs and blood gallons are not the basis of film mistakes, and this "movie" is no exception. I can not sign that some cable stations run this garbage. (I released this particular junk in a live video, as I recall). Referring to any other movie would be a great insult to another movie, that's all Phantasm films, all Jason movies, Freddy movies. , Chucky movies, and most of Michael Myers can be summed up in one single word: TERRIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> Rating (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
