The most important aspects of Superstar's films were the frequency of a movie and the next. Being a well-established star of Southern Indian cinema, Baba's opinions were excellent. <br /> <br /> Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films that played at 11 films was only 11 years old in 11 years. All of them were very successful. There was an image that many people could not think of. <br /> <br /> But after Padayappa (1999) he entered into a state of Hibernation. Its fans around the world, especially South India, were ready to watch it with any super-movie. So Tamil film industry decided to come along with Baba. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers believe that fans will take everything that they show with Superstar. But, clearly, this film has not been made. As usual, the rumors of media and fans' expectations exceeded the limit. <br /> <br /> The image of Rajinikanthen was completely corrupted. The fans made walnut. The collection of films was not expected to be predicted. The popularity of a great people fell. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this film was A.Rehman's songs. Rehman has composed good music for compositions such as Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu, etc. Well, I never thought that this movie would match that league. > <br /> You feel very depressed, because it's a bad movie because the superstar image goes down. He had two years to complete the recovery of two Chandramukhi and Sivaji films, and they returned to the fans who really looked for a superstar movie.
