I do not want to call this movie - it's a movie that does not have to win prizes. The performance was horrible, for example. In fact, so many people are a movie that is directed to an NRI audience, but it is disgusting abroad trying throughout the movie "trying". <br /> <br /> I find it amazing that many English-speaking actors are so hard to persuade them to face the camera. Surely readers know what I'm talking about: all those movie phrases that put cool movies in Hindi and in the movie movie. There are several Indian films, which seem to be completely authentic in English - Cyrus Being was a new one. Although not a great movie, it was a good movie and language was not "put". <br /> <br /> I feel embarrassed when I was assigned to P3 NFA in 2005. The only half-pleasant part of this garbage was Konchana and a short background point. Also, do not waste your time with this film.
