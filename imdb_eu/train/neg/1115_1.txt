We saw this at the local video store shelf, we saw "Coppola" in credit and excitement. That was the only time that the movie was interested. I could never work out whether it was an essay of a movie soul that did not crash or failed, it was the attempt of a serious movie that failed. In general, the whole production was very wonderful. The sound was particularly horrible, especially in scenes shot in a small bar; The conversation was so unbelievable that it was incredible. Very depressing
