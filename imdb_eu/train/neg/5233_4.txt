Pretty terrifying but enjoyable and entertaining. It's an old story (if you lived in the 80's). Vietnam veterinarians fight together against injustice in the United States. A-Team Death Wish, my favorite! <br /> <br /> The time goes by, the soldiers go home and, later on, a friend has problems. No, wait. In fact, his friend is dead and his dad has problems. Joey, our first hero, is a terrible fierce animal that kills his little father's shop because he is making efforts to defend himself from the "protection" of the country as a war wheel chair. Desperate help, father speaks with Sarge, leader of the old Vietnam Joey unit, to show Sarge funeral. <br /> <br /> Well, the penetrating wheel gets greasy, and the old team is watching. for the city. You can imagine much the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing I am totally upset about is Sarge's thinking about the planning of his man, and what they do is really good. when they plan ahead Joey would not have put a wheelchair in Vietnam with a gun, first of all, even if the unit was not bent! Then, when things are doing well, they fight again. Without any reason, they totally exclude their plan and try to keep the nails of the gang without all of them. Phh !!!! My hands will get disgusted. Madness! <br /> <br /> There is also a suspect that all the members of the unit consider themselves gangster to prove their heroine to be true. Each one of them. Hmm ... <br /> <br /> What will you do? I still watch, I think. The movie is not terrific, but it's not boring. There are no climatic moments when nothing happens. The most dramatic events happen at the start of the film: the Vietnam explosives, Joey's death battle, and the gang throws an enormous teddy attack (Teddy!). <br /> <br /> I / invented my main cow with this movie. Although "mystery assistants" and their cross motive types were confusing, it was not enough to save. But one day maybe he'll be fine and they'll make a sequel. Ha ha ha ha !!!
