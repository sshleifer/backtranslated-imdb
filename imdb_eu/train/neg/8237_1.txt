True, how did all the saints get the distribution of this film ever? Someone has filmed on his mobile phone and seems to be a huge victim of girls to new scenarios. Directly scream for the entire 90-minute movie. And all they do. There are no plots, there is no tension, no characters, and it does not interpret many. Scream and scream more. <br /> <br /> I gave up fifteen minutes later, and as a result I was soon to see something that happened. It does not - except for screaming, of course. Clearly, the action to go forward emphasizes another problem: there is no camera. Each shot looks like any other movie - the middle distance, an angle, dull, dull, dull. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad it's good. It's bad
