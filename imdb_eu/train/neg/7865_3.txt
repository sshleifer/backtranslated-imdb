Last year, The Hills Have Eyes remake has been one of the best updates among the 1970s horror movie flute. Alexandre Ajak admitted a marvelous level of character development, and at the beginning of violence he was wild and all was developed in a landscape of photography and production design. I was just a few people who thought it was better than the original and I was waiting for a second visit to the world wild and cruel wild wilderness in the desert. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Hills Eyes 2, after its original release, plans to enter the franchise with an injurious attempt that seems to be released and . Jonathan Craven's script could be written on a weekend, probably because of the speed at this movie theater. It falls on every topic of the genre of the book, which offers absolutely nothing about desert mythology. I always left with despair when a sequel replaced civilians with civil characters. Soldiers are always idylling and always writing, and they never get bored by the raw caricature of the whirlwinds. In my opinion, 'Aliens' was the only movie that was successful in making this transition, as a result of James Cameron's talents, not only for correcting the sequence of good performances, but also for keeping watch over the dying audience. Several talented actors also helped. With the movie 'The Hills have Eyes 2', it's clear that Martin Weisz's video director is not James Cameron, and TV bitmakers do not have the talent or even the desire to become a living and breathing cartoon character. humans <br /> <br /> Needless to say, every character is a generic and topical topic. They act in stupid and non-logical ways, leading them to preconceived immoral and illogical deaths that make mute and non-logical decisions. The second half of the film is a dark and boring dark corridor. 'The Descent' (on which Sam McCurdy, by chance, worked as a cinematographer) showed that most of the derivative sequences are still original and suspense, but we do not see any innovation here. <br /> <br /> The film "The Hills Have Eyes 2" is very lazy, no suspense, no tension or anguish, no single person in charge of any quality is far from involved. The excuse for a sequencing is low and tired, and it is worthwhile selling the rest of the pieces of his life.
