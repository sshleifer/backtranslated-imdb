'The Fox and the Child' Luc Galaxy is the new French director, awarded the "March of the Oscars of the Penguins" documentary. Bertille Noël-Bruneau focuses on a young girl who plays and fights her friendship with fox. <br /> <br /> There is really an amazing moment at this time; About badgers mucking around, lynx fox behind a littered snow forest; A scene, especially when a fox dies when a wolf feels painful, is very intense and sometimes horrible. However, just not enough of them. <br /> <br /> Beautiful shot; Cinematography is brilliant. It's a wonderful movie look. Without a doubt, production is very bold. <br /> <br /> Kate Winslet is an English version, but the already-existing little conversation was very bad. The score is also very fluffy, or at least it's my liking; And the scripts, though subtle, go from one stage to another, eventually leave me almost baffled. <br /> <br /> The heart of the film is a beautiful morale, and Noël-Bruneau's performance is rather quiet. It's pretty pretty, it's a real star fox. The fascinating moments that focus only on our little buddies are incredible. However, once again, they simply are not nearly enough of them. <br /> <br /> - To keep up-to-date on the latest developments in cinema, reviews, news, discussions, and more, be sure to visit www.mybluray. com.au
