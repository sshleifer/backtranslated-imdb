There is only one problem with this website, you can not give a negative score. Also, a friend rated it as a D movie. I said it was very nice. A piece of wood could have a greater emotion for the actors in this movie and the money used to create this film to start a fire. This is absolutely horrible, anyone who survives this bloody bloody bath for 2 hours will never return. After seeing it 5 minutes, the soldiers and the boys asked us if they were heavy boarding boats to entertain them any more. A drawing and 151 bottles a bit later, I found some of the G levels, remotely fun. The insult to this planet is that the director thought that anyone who finds it is more beneficial, should have bought a rope. And the actors in this movie have been glad to be able to be in this joke because they questioned it because they will never work again. In short, in this movie we have 100 wonderful people and 12 demerits points with your permission.
