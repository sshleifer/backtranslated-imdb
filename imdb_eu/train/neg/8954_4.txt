I expected this movie, I liked the book so much. However, I do not think that if I did not read the book I would have understood the premise of that film. The film is an enormous attempt to show the despair of the people who try to overthrow the government of the nobility, but the book portrays the suffering much deeper. The corrupt officials of the government have a comfortable and almost luxurious life, but people struggle to survive. Perhaps most people feel that their leaders and their leaders are either oppressed or repressed or not. Orwell's dystopia seems to be in many places in our modern world. Several years have elapsed since I read the book, but Brother Big Brother, the Thinking Police and Newspeak often hear in the media and in frequent conversation. Many of these terms may be used by many people who do not know where they are. I strongly suggest reading the book.
