The photos in the DVD are very dark, I thought the screen was dead. I think they've seen half of the movie. However, it was poorly planted and it was not interesting. I have not found a story related to "The Black Widow". I expected a mystery or a thriller, but I did not care enough to take care of the first frames. I rented the movie especially for Willem Dafoe and I felt sad that I lost his talent. I do not think Giada Colagrande's film was enough to develop a feature. It is attractive and can become an actor, but it has taken too much of this film. Although they are married in real life, they do not have chemistry on the screen. Their relationships did not seem credible. I do not understand why the other characters entered the plot.
