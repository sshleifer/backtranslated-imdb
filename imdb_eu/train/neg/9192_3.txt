This movie was found in the 'horror' section of my video shop. It seems to be sensible that most zombie films have space. Romero's "Dead" trilogy "28 days later." However, if you see it, you can see what the movie really is. <br /> <br /> In fact, the music video is progressing faster and more and more. There are no horror people here. Simply, some of the scenes that are performed in the middle of the episode soon grows exhausting ... and the last ... and the last ... and soon you will get the feeling that the DVD player accidentally skipped you back for 3 minutes, but not, that way they made the movie . It's a shame. I think that nobody can use it better than 7,000 million dollars in making this knot in the film industry. Although some of the 360 ​​effects were good, they were once again used and boring again and again, with another character. <br /> <br /> Also, what is ROYALLY annoying is the video game footage. I play the game. It's dirty. So why did they put it here? Okay, this is not a movie, but music video, and it's poor. 3/10 <br /> <br /> R rated: violence / gore lot, and ugly
