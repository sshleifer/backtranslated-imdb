I wanted to be sincerely ... I was READY to see it. That's why <br /> <br /> I've given it a star to a 10/10 story / shoot / performance / because of its unimaginative story. This movie was RIOT to watch. <br /> <br /> If you like to see bad movies, <br /> <br /> you will really shoot Severed. <br /> <br /> The story really does not matter, it involves a guy with a bald one <br /> <br /> and has a sword and cuts random people. <br /> <br /> But there is a supernatural tour ... nobody ever watches. <br /> <br /> Even in a memorable scene, he enters a night club and goes to the little girl's boyfriends, <br /> <br /> nobody sees. <br /> <br /> Stop it, it's not just look at the video, it shot it in someone's house. The filmmakers have the knowledge of lighting <br /> <br /> (very thinly) and the composition <br /> <br /> is really in some scenes. But, above all, you can not hear the actors <br /> <br /> ... you can not understand what they are doing, and you laugh at them <br /> <br /> when the next vicinity is pumped out. from his body. <br /> <br /> Go and rent this movie. They are supportive of such films and <br /> <br /> a hollar!
