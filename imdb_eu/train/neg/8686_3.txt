I'm marking this as a "spoiler" due to some comments on the content of the show and not the content itself. <br /> <br /> When reading comments, Republicans seem to tolerate the show somehow. , but despised, while the Democrat seems to call his authenticity. Even a reader (it seems) truly states that they think they might have happened or could have happened in Bush's school. <br /> <br /> But, as I see, what content is trying to be neutral. The team that made this series is really Bush's enemy. The last time I saw the episode, s02e03, showed that the program had to be put together, McCain was competing for the nomination; In fact, the other front runners have appeared. <br /> <br /> I have taken another look at the use of other cabinets. I thought that the series was not intended to be made in the United States in Europe, I do not know the US homesteads, who have not built cabinets, and probably artists' houses. <br /> </ p> <p> When I'm seeing the show, I'm trapped, well, I am surprised to learn that the writer's desire is terribly embarrassing to our President. It is sure that most Americans agree, but this is not a reason to be so hateful in public screens that are visible around the world. Perhaps this trend has now been established through this show and network, so that if they were included in Obama or Hillary, would they continue to create their "humor"? <br /> <br /> One more comment on comments on a comment. If in 2000 a change was made in the elections, according to this writer, he was so sure that he would be a completely different president. Wow, in turn, a compelling thought. With regard to the 911 event, I think that it was re-launched by President Clinton and I do not know how Gore's chairman would have been anything much different.
