What can you tell about this movie? It was not horrible, but it was not good! Two days before I saw Lillies and I was one of the best gay movies ever seen. So this was not the best time to see a mediocre gay movie. <br /> <br /> The story was stupid and the acting was fine. It was not enough to turn off the wrong, but it had a bad moment and a stereotypical horror. Not very well thrown. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend this movie? You do not waste your time and money. I do not understand why they're done and who finances the movies. You have to spend time watching Noah's Arc Logo. I think that he wanted to go on this movie, but that he was never there.
