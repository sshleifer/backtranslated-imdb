I think that the best Oscars of last years were in 2003: for two reasons: <br /> 1) The host Steve Martin was most honest: "I saw the team with the support of Michael Moore," and I'm not better When I said the gay mafia woke up at the head of my dog ​​"<br /> <br /> 2 Surprises winners: Nobody falls into the best actress Adrien Brody (Authentic). applause) or the best director for Roman Polanski (real jokes and boos), but they won the awards ceremony last year was not bad, but it was not unpredictable and I was happy to return. THE KING clears prizes except for the best trilogy (FELLOWSHIP was much better), but BBC's coverage meant that Jonathan Ross got some sophisticated friends and something that seemed to them to be hilarious. but So when I was listening to the British television for Sky television, I had to make links to Barry Norman and Mark Kermode, but we did it with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! If the British cinema was disappointed with sworn criticism (of course), I am sure that Bob The Moo and Theo Roberts will be happy to give LA their honest views of their winners and losers <br /> <br /> Chris Rock was not very It's a bad thing, but Steve Martin was not there, because he looks like a sports seats. In my opinion, it is not a very noisy arena. The main problem I had during the ceremony was the small Oscars given to the winners of the children's seats. There are no small Oscars, and this award is best for the Best Animated Short Sleeve or Best Costume Design, Best Picture or Best Director. All the winners can go to the podium. The Academy is proud of the snobs of arrogance and I agree that this format is shameful and, if it were not for surprise, it could be the worst event in history. Prizes like himself <br /> <br /> Best Actress - Cate Blanchett. It's not a big surprise for the competitive category <br /> <br /> Best Actor - Morgan Freeman. There is no real complaint that Freeman is one of the greatest actors in American life <br /> <br /> Best Actor - Jamie Foxx. Best night's prize. Yawn <br /> <br /> The best actress - Hilary Swank. Mostly surprisingly, they all believed that Annette Benning should win only academy policy, but Swank was worth it and gave the best night-time performance <br /> <br /> the best director - Clint Eastwood. Mostly surprisingly, they thought Scorsese should get the reward because he never won. Actually, I'm glad I did not deserve TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS for this, it did not deserve the best AVIATOR movie. <br /> Best movie - MILIO DOLLAR BABY. Once again, a big surprise is that everyone thinks the academy will distribute the best awards for the best director and the best picture, I thought the nice plot of THE AVIATOR in Hollywood was the best death, the best picture of MDB's controversial issue. polling solutions <br /> <br /> These awards are illustrated by the fact that this year's election has ruled out Oscar's policy and decided to give those who deserve what they deserved to do in the past. USE THE BEAUTIFUL EARRING AWARENESS FOR GAWD! And for a long time the academy will vote with their heads instead of their hearts
