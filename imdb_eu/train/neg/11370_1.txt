This video has a more stringent way of mixing and manipulating Americans around Islam. It's hard to believe that people believe that Americans believe this way, perhaps, as a citizen of America, each person must protest against this kind of shit. If you want to know the truth about Islam, do not let anyone tell you ... QURAN PUBLISH! you can read and decide whether it's true or false ... <br /> <br /> The video uses a lot of audio-visual strategies, even with the intention of linking and linking things. He prepares to hate what he sees in public music in some places, even if he understands what is happening there. They use images that are lost from the original content. <br /> <br /> To finish the comment, I'd like to think ... Did not you think that you could make an exact movie in every religion world?
