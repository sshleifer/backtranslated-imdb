I have to say that many people have argued that some have to get up with new times that the new "Dukes" movie is a modernized version. OH Please. If this is modernized, Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN website have also said (and I mention) "The old fog is over and you need to do so." Well, you've got something to say, I'm 24 years old, so I'm too far from being old and FOGIE, and I'm not over, it's HAZZARD COUNTY. The only thing in the title of "HAZZARD" was the title. It was all that was needed, smoking, and drinking. It was a huge kick. Jessica has been in the show for several months to discuss the movie, and I think that all went to mind. Daisy Duke is undoubtedly but definitely not a Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not Bo. The original theater would come as a cameo at least, but Hollywood did not know the screenplay. People, today's actors and actors, say a negative opinion, why do you suggest some positive suggestions?
