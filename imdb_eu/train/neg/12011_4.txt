John Pressman (Michael "Ditech" Lerner) works at a doctor's office. Her mother (Zelda 'Poltergeist' Rubenstein) hypnotizes people who think she's misunderstood. However, this movie is part of a movie, but soon the lines blur that John goes to kill movies. Ask about a guy watching the movie. Lerner is right at the top, but Zelda repeats the conversation lines again and again. That hurts so quickly. But as annoying as two girls who are watching the movie inside a movie. As a horror movie, it fails, it's too busy to be clear, trying to get a message and it seems to forget a movie slasher. tension, or at least one or two jump. No, the worst slasher we have here is the art house. <br /> <br /> My grade: D +
