This "fake erotic thriller" reminded me of this flick I stopped late and I saw Cinemax when I was 13 years old. This color would be softer. However, there is a lot of nudity: the opening scene is in a club, we see Kane Hodder's keester (or at least an unforgettable adventure), and then a 10-minute lesbian dance with an unexplained explanation of the female wolf mask that looks like a disguised, naked movie in Munster. 13 year old boys are glad. <br /> <br /> Others have the worst CGI I have ever seen. Plans look like FMV in the Resident Evil video game quality. The wolf is very bad and despite the bad quality of the suit, it is obvious, too. <br /> <br /> Land and actors do not make sense. There is a strange story about their men and hybrid pangs. Darkwolf is the second, but hybrids say that the wolves that make the same thing look like humans, change the wolves to kill people. Darkwolf is trying to find a friend, but she can not find a friend in a strange way, but she can get anything that touches her. Once again, this skill is not very useful because Darkwolf will kill as many people as he can ever touch, discover or even discover. His friend does not know that he is a male man, he is fighting for a transformation or something. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to mix a simple monster, but they did well. . You want low-quality men and women to rent. Dog soldiers want a ton of T & A this is your movie.
