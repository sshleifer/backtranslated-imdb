1973 TV The restoration of the Billy Wilder class is not lower than the original. Surprise <br /> <br /> First things good. Lee J. Cobb Barton Keyes is wonderful. It's not as good as Edward G. Robinson, of course, but there's only one reason to see it. The only improvement in the original version is Lola Dietrichson, a reduction in the role of Phyllis Dietrichson, a female fatale daughter. <br /> <br /> And that's for good things. <br /> <br /> The bad things are a lot. The director records everything differently: seeing the sound of a sound movie, you do not think anything interesting. Due to the poor modernity, the film must be replaced in black and white. In the 1970s, due to the bad taste, all the sets make it ugly. The expensive apartments in Walter Neff, in particular, are awesome. <br /> <br /> Modern setting minimizes pain. Train trips were unusual in the 70s, over seventy years, so Mr. Dietrichson seems to be in a position to make a train. Men were wearing hats, which prevents Walter from covering his brown hair, as a white gentleman Dietrichson. The women dressed in dismay were left by Samantha Eggar who offered a wonderful spell. (Oddly enough, Lola still has a line with her grandma's grandmother trying to get a black cap and a veil before she needs them). <br /> <br /> Stephen Bochco keeps Billy Wilder-Raymond Chandler's writings a lot. the same. But there is a lot of small and inexplicable changes in the conversation, which leaves the script somewhat weak. In the meantime, the famous police motorcycles have disappeared, but look closely and you will see what this line should have been a post-production cut. Bochco may not be guilty. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna is just as good as Walter Neff. This version is likely to be a very good Phyllis Dietrichson. Samantha Eggar, however, emerges as the standard malice of "Barnaby Jones". But who can take Eggar? With the director who is interested in what is happening to the camera, how can Barbara Stanwyck create himself?
