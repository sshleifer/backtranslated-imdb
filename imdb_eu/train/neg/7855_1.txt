I can not believe my eyes after seeing this movie. Then blood and violence are not at all. Unlike other frightening guitars, the gore and meaning of this film blossomed in blood, and die one after another. This movie is not about any interest, no plot or storyline, or intelligence. Blood is very fake and this movie is generally no sense. Do not waste your time too. It's one or two hours of violence. It has a lot of bloody scenes, but it's not terrifying, but it's boring. This is the worst horror movie I've ever seen from all horror movies I have ever seen.
