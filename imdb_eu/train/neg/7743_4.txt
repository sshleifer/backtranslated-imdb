This movie was the worst thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Police drama and comedy combined, two Hollywood detectives, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, are currently investigating a hip hop club. <br /> <br /> The plot is created, and there are a lot of problems. Ford is committed to real estate (Martin Landau is one of his clients), Hartnett carries on a yoga school that will shake his spare time. Two of them are under investigation, former Ford girlfriend (Lena). Olin) is a psychologist with a researcher and a radio show. The man who dies in the club is a former police officer who shot the duke Hartnett's father a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Dropping yourself out of compulsory car and a few hopes to avoid humor, about the wrinkle of this turkey.
