<br /> <br /> When I called "Trance" or "Eternal", or anyone who calls this film producer, I asked myself: "I could not see at least one entertaining movie from any of my worst films I've seen?" Movie Acting, directing, writing, or whatever it works for, it can be at least fun, and therefore worth it. But this film is bad in the artistic value, it is very boring. For such a thin plot, it moves slowly, with no dramatic tension. At least, to strive for entertainment in a little finger, the death of the characters could be terribly and bad, but the creators of this dreck also failed in that section. <br /> <br /> What is the movie? Unless enough, if you're watching entertainment Christopher Walken, being able to be superb, he has made little effort to fall into self-parody mode (why did he decide to do this movie anyway?). <br /> I will give this movie 3/10; God helped us, the earlier films were really worse.
