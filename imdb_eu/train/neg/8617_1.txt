After seeing 10 minutes of this movie, I was disturbed, I saw 30 minutes in my head curled up - I just believed: the movie is really awesome. In fact, it's so scary, I had to see all this to be convinced (!). During this period, I noticed the bundles of the 60's and 70's comedy Daniar reminded me. The model is: Take a very popular comedian, write this comic in most grotesque situations, add a joke (especially the flashlight) and give it to a beautiful young girl - shot that and you've had success! I did not know if this movie was a success, but I think it's not like the dancing that killed Danimark peace (with some good comedians) that there is a market in this US film.
