There are laughter in this movie, that's for sure. Michael Keaton is a talented and fun one (before deciding that he was a serious actor). However, it's so bad about this film, it's almost impossible for all the characters. Not only are the two main leads, everyone is a shake. I mean, as rude as you can get losers of small villages. You just look and think, man, those losers must be unemployed. Additionally, the American factory worker is depicted as a lazy slob and ingress. It was asked by the Japanese nationalist films. Or, surely, at last they all come together, but I did not get to enjoy the trip.
