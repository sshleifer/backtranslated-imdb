I rented this movie as part of "Romanticism" and "Western" genres with some of the Grand Canyon landscapes. But if you expect a typical Western romantic romance, forget about it. Movie trash is empty! Love that is just like puberty and a half-man! Children also love other leering men. <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda is described as vertuous, who tries to face what attracts Brooke Shields, and who seeks a relationship above all. He tries to avoid at first, but eventually he gives up and the pair is happy and loving. It's boring. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this movie could have attracted anyone except pedophiles.
