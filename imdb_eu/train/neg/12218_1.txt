Very bad. Very, very bad. As a classmate who wants to make a catering, a board or at least a sniff at a movie theater, it's hard to criticize independent critics of any type of movie. However, this movie ... Oh dear. <br /> <br /> The exploitation with Frightworld does not want to try something more than gross exploitation (a good thing in itself) and try to match the more general rules. faults For a reason, it's more entertaining, for example, Red Zone Cuba ... but not much. So I will not try to criticize you, let me ask you for some observations. <br /> <br /> 1) If you have a movie point, did not you see it? <Br /> <br /> 2) If you have hired three men, make sure you know at least how the equipment works. . I'm really sorry but really ... 4) There are talented video recorders in the Buffalo / Rochester area, most of which you can rent cheap. Get someone who draws a scene. <br /> <br /> 5) It means that someone who does not use After Effects and other beautiful programs means that he should do it in two seconds. /> <br /> 6) Women will bring their girls to their tops, but next time we will meet the girls. We want to get it. <br /> <br /> 7) Editing the story should tell or help set the mood. At least in this film edition we should sell gore gags. The chainsaw that appears on a stomach in a sudden character is not terrifying, unhappy. <br /> <br /> Some good things. The performance is not bad. Jack was pretty good and I really liked Acid when he started fighting. There were some clear images, but unfortunately it was thrown on the screen, not without rhyme or reason. "Acid Poptart" is a name that deserves a better movie. I also like Mumia in Frightworld. Next, now, under the cinema, I have a kind of film, I hope all of this is something better than Colman Francis. Update at least Ed Wood.
