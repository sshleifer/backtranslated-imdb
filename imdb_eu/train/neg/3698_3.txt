Here's a summary: <br /> <br /> * Animation nested work is so wonderful: the colors are superb - it would be made of silk neck <br /> <br /> * Story and execution is a complete repetition. It was very difficult to stay awake regularly <br /> <br /> If you are a Fine Arts student, it is a medieval calligraphy, early religion, and so on. THIS CINEMA IS FOR YOU. <br /> <br /> If you want to be attractive and entertaining CINEMA - look elsewhere - this is a failure that is not an artistic expression. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
