I did not see a very good score on the IMDb but I went to see it, because the Bible is a fan of material related. The first thing that worried me was that it was more than a short film by Indiana Jones, but Casper Van Dien did not see Jones as such (but he did). I think he has tried his best, but a mere script. The music was also Jones style. An excellent job, but it seemed like too much work for that movie, as the video parts did not deserve all this great music. Robert Wagner gave him his best skills, he did a good job, but somehow the script got everything. The old jokes are about 20 years old; They brought me only to my face cynical smile. If there are some bad camera angels, SFX looks like home-made and realistic. Kevin VanHook is a good idea about the story (I think, but I like stories), but things were not over. Maybe he had to put it in a paper that was still fresh in the head. (In the first minutes) when I saw that this movie was one of the low-budget films, I expected at least a good story, but sometimes movies are blank.
