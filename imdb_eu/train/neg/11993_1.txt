When I saw only half of the movie in November at school, I saw Flix being in the channel and I decided to see everything else and write a new review. <br /> <br /> The film-based book, Hatchet, is fine. This is a great deal of adaptation. <br /> <br /> The terrifying impact (and I mean it's horrible), the bad conversation and the average cinematography make up Hatchet's awesome adaptation. <br /> <br /> Filmak Brian-ek 80. hamarkadako amaierako nerabe baten topikoa den irudia dauka (marmol bat kiribiltzen duena, 80ko hamarkadako musika merkea jotzen duena) eta amak auto batean gidatzen du hegazkinera atera bere aita kanpoan ikusteagatik gidatzeko. His parents are divorced ... now the mark of the dramatic scene.) Now he has said goodbye to Brian and his mother and father and is to see his father. The rider is a crude, ugly and sour man (there was no such book), within 2 minutes he attacks the heart and dies in the air. The book goes much further with the pilot being more pains and the pilot seemed to be much older than the headaches. <br /> <br /> Hegazkina (beste bi minutu barru ) erregaia hutsik egon da (gurekin, ikusleek utziz, ordu batzuetan han egon dela uste du, nahiz eta eguzkiak ez du posizioa aldatu eta paisaia bera ere badirudi.) Orain lurrera erori da. <br /> </ p> This is because the movie point is different from what is different from the book. He said that his jacket was chicken, but the movie is very good, but without tears and sassiness (it seems he just bought it), he never said he got up on the mountain, saw the wolf and slept there. In the bush, he never said that a bear was attacked (what was said to be a tall, but not a bear), he never said he was eating a variety of mistakes that he did, he never learned to get the second tornado or poor. Cover them and eat them or they can eat (that is, destroyed by one of the tornadoes) and does not hurt their ribs in one of the tornadoes. <br /> <br /> I do not even say that something that was depicted in a movie could be called a tornado. It was just a windstorm that made a lot of things. <br /> <br /> The favorite of this outdoor party was Brian's great lightning (which is never mentioned in the book), especially Brian Waking's topical scene. up, up to the window and sees his father (his ships are perfectly suited to the back of his truck), and shouting "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD !!!!" (of course, though, his father did not hear him, even though he was out of the way) and he touched the fist in the window (wtf?) <br /> <br /> It's the only thing that ends up with. It happened in the book (I closed it). In my book, I think that when the pilot rescues one of the key issues that came out of Brian, he was "the baby you are looking for! They stayed for months." .. "oraindik lerro hori utzi zuten filmean. <br /> <br /> Brianrekin (nolabait aholkularirik gabe edo terapeutikoki gabe) duen epilogo patetikoa normala da familiarekin. Nire ustez, Thanksgiving elkarrekin lortzen zutela suposatu behar genuen (indioilarra taberna gainean zeuzkaten delako ). Then, a temporary house shows (three days, the movie seemed, but the book was several months), and his ax, still left him in a tree (also, there was a book there), where a message was developed so well done: "HOME" (where we thought he believed that he had crumbled it.) That's perfect for just that ax? <br /> <br /> <br /> There's no budget when this movie says better, Ghost World-en Enid-ek esan zuenean "hori hain txarra da ona eta atzera bueltatu da". Pelikula honen deskribapen perfektua. <br /> <br /> Ez nuke gomendatuko norbaiti (liburua irakurri ez duenarena) eta ez dut filme bat ikusi, nor someone who has read the book b roar they will be disappointed and their death will be bored. For those who have read the book leave your imagination as a movie. That is horrible and will make you think about the book. br /> <br /> 1/10
