Roy Rogers with Jesse James and his unique appearance is similar to Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Mr. Hayes Rogers is Sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a prominent group to watch stories about the unforgettable anti-illegalist heroine as a reporter. <br /> <br /> Of course, the development of imbalances / imaginations is a plot because Rogers makes a "dual role". Rogers is charming, as usual; But nothing - nothing that raises anything really raising its usual performance - Jekyll / Hyde is a tough performance to give a memorable performance. The pairs to be seen are Mrs. Storm and Mrs. Paye as the Reporter for the St. Louis Journal - the films are remarkable. The songs are very good, but they are badly synchronized. <br /> <br /> *** Jesse James at Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm
