Do not let the premises fool you, it was a fun movie. Problem - comedy was not supposed. The story is good for you to never end. Even worse, the configuration never explains. You will leave the theater asking "Is that it?" I say 2, because it has made little promise, but I'm leaving it to a very flat finish. Nicholas Cage hopes he's got a good job, but he's been very busy. There are strange disagreements, and they have no connection anywhere with interesting conversations related to that movie. Let the video be lost before you lose money.
