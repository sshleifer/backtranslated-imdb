... Montana does not live and, above all, the nineteenth century. Not to live at the end of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> "The river passes" definitely a good movie from a movie movie. Excellent scenery, Redford plays well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is bad (everything is in the story). <br /> <br /> I was sorry for the narrator / author, who is dry and close, his father, as a preacher. Without leaving his life without his brother's sight, he is kept in a small-town environment that has lost his life. The author never approaches his brother's motivations, but at least he realizes that they do not have the slightest fanfare. However, it is a fishing that flies, where the old man is following his father's style. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's not surprising, since it seems very early. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
