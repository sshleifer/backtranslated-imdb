Disney has done it again. The company, "Mr. Magoo" and "George of the Jungle", has made another movie that resembles a cartoonist who does not retain the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" was one of my favorite cartoons when I was a young man, and a movie of it might have existed. That movie exists, I was tireless, although I was annoyed. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have characters. <br /> <br /> Gadget itself has tools that have led to a fun character. The original drawing (with special effects that are well-made), and even though it has some curiosity to the original device, it now has the right to own and the crime itself should be solved while Penny and Brain only see. <br /> <br /> He does not have to do Penny; cartoons played a leading role in knowing and abolishing the crime and sometimes they were arrested by the MAD agents, it is now included and then forgotten, even at least back on Claw's base. <br /> Claw Claw is a version of Dr. He was a male man, generous and noisy man, he wore metallic gloves and sat on his chair, his face was hidden, he stroked the cat and investigated several crimes. Now it's just a man with a hand-held, mystery behind the character. <br /> <br /> Brain and Mad Cat exist but they do not matter. <br /> <br /> There are also no small portions of cartoons in these rescues. "Wowsers!" The famous expression. Mysteriously it changed to "Wowser", Gadget Gadgetmobile now looks different and talks. <br /> <br /> Product permissions are also everywhere. Why is "Yahoo!" Announced on a sign? Why Gadgetmobile has buttons for M & M's or Skittles? <br /> <br /> The cartoons will hate enthusiasts, others may find the movie down, and when all is said and done, it is another attempt. to bring it soon to other old shows.
