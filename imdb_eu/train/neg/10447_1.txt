I had the opportunity to watch this movie because it has a good score on the IMDb. But many people have a bad taste or someone is setting the score. <br /> <br /> It was really a disappointment. The title is a huge and stupid movie. There's no reason to give a plot summary - but here it goes: someone thought he was thinking: "Would not it be happy to make films on an airplane? And then some snakes were crazy and started bites and stuff ...?" And that from! It is thin and unusual. The snakes are CGI bad (but it is reasonable to cut their minds that the film has had no problems with anyone). The performance is inadequate and all people are incredible stereo types. <br /> <br /> In short: it's one of the worst films I've ever seen.
