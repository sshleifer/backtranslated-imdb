I looked forward to seeing this movie and watching the big actors. However, unfortunately, I was disappointed with the whole plot of the script and story. David Duchovny (Dr. Eugene Sands), "Connie & Carla", '04, a doctor who was a medical practitioner who used the medicine and losses license to practice. Dr. Sands visited a night club and used her medical experience to help her injured clients and Angelina Jolie (Claire), "Life", 04, was attracted to Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton, (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsey", '04, Big Shot Gangster and has all kinds of money and connections. Timothy Hutton seems to be in most of the scenes and is excluded from trying to kill his gang members. Gary Dourdan (Yates), "CSI-Vegas TV Series," is very helpful and portrays the real COOL DUDE of Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her red lips, because all men are paying close attention. This movie is not the greatest, but it is entertaining.
