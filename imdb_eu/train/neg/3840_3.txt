I've heard a movie a long time ago, and recently got it on the DVD. There was a great deal of anticipation and excitement, and it was a terrifying movie, as we heard it was really terrifying. How was I disappointed? VERY BEAUTIFUL !!!! Apart from that scene (we all know what bit) NOTHING! Seeing the woman in black women a few times and thus making the scenes more fascinating, appear in the window or walk through the room or something. <br /> <br /> Almost all opinions are here. What is horrific, tough, is this atmospheric movie. I'm afraid Perhaps there is a difference that people find it scary in the United States in Britain. <br /> <br /> After all the revised reviews, a great drop :(
