SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86-minute director Jim Sotos Director Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell <br /> <br /> A bad girl of fifteen years Melissa is the new desert town One is not long and begins to kill people around him. The detective learned about his Dana Kimmell on Friday, with the help of the good girl Nancy Drew, to collect traces. Local American Americans are the principal suspects because they have been blocked by citizens with disaster. All these events reflect Melissa's sixteenth birthday party. <br /> <br /> Below this slasher is not memorable. It has a television sensitivity that, apart from scoring, plays a couple of times with the themed song of the same title character. The lines like "killers" will make us look like a raft. Set the eighty-minute screen scripts to standard. Marci Melissa calls her an evil name and immediately develops a friendship. Apparently, Marci sees how difficult it is to get involved, because Melissa makes her make-up. This film would be a tough day to date at the age of fifteen, and the director has provided many new versions of it. The social comment on the Indians was not seriously developed. I was very surprised by the high score that this film achieves. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday were able to take advantage of the celebration tradition of that year to create a massive sequence of extermination. However, publishing the dark movies of this DVD gives hope to the success of others.
