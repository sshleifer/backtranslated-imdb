If you want to see an intelligent philosophical debate about human and potential, see "Waking Life", which is excellent. "# $ *! Do Know Know" is in the whole place misguided, misread, misinterpreted, non-directorial and completely annoying. He was not influenced or entertained. In this movie, Ramtha has introduced such an incredible adventure to avoid enough reason. Is not it amazing how filmmakers look like a 2,000-year-old Atlantis god or worship? It's a small pic, which is my waste of time and money. This was the whole movie. The film makers will not be allowed to make another movie again.
