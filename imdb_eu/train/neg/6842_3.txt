"Paula, I can be a whore, but I will never be a donkey!" <br /> <br /> A ridiculous line with a beautiful honey on Stacey Walker, but that's all. This girlfriend calls her fairies, colleagues and Paula their logical roommate in her bedroom, but then calls for "rape" and calls it to the police. <br /> <br /> Certified c ** t's schizophrenic identity may be of interest to a little while, but the story is, in the end, a unique repetitive note. He deserves to wait at least to finish, for those who also look after this one.
