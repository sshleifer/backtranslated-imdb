It's frustrating to watch a movie like 'Murder By Numers' because of a Hollywood movie that's trying to get somewhere out of that formula. However, when the credits are rolled out, they were not saved. The whole thing is that the "sides" of the story is slowly lit, where the detective characters in honor of Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin mix with a sexual disorder that is becoming increasingly vain. Even though Bullock's role is strong, it's not enough to keep the unexplored script and calming. Ben Chaplin's talent has been forgotten (he has done much better in an outsourced "Birthday Girl" than many years ago), and with Chris Penn, who feels the role he feels generously. However, the plot is not a factor in the movie. Two young killers, Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt, are the only reasons to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry are quite good and they play very well with each other. It is very bad that they did not have a completely better movie. Barbet Schroeder is considering the security cycle of this land. Bottom Line: If you are a fan of genre, it's worth a rental, but others will be full of life, without ever seeing it, with the best commercial breaks with the network television.
