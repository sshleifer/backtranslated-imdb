You know this will be a cheesy one: <br /> <br /> 1. It was made in the 50's. It's black and white. 3. It has no name for the actor! 4. Screaming responds to the lack of special effects! <br /> <br /> Benoit is not going to get out. This movie has included all the four elements mentioned above to make it a real blur. <br /> Okay - shhhhh, but here are some of the special effects we are going to discuss - or none of them - <br /> <br /> Did you capture underwater scenes? It seems to have been shot in the wrong way by an aquarium - note that the kennel that flows through the neck of the wind. <br /> <br /> And repeat the repetition of stock footage (home plans, scenic bridges - a great improvement in the KRAF-Tiness of this movie - not "9 PLAN"! I've seen creative use of these materials. <br /> <br /> And as it lacks special effects - do not worry - it cries - this is a special effect room in this movie - yes, this movie was used very clearly for the old hack trick. Take the popcorn - set your brain to bed (several fermented beverages definitely help), sit down and ask: why did they put him back in the movie? <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br /> <br / > <br />
