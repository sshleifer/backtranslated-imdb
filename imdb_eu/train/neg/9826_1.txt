I think this would be a true believer organized by Christian Dogma, but for those who openly believe in free will, there is a great joke about the church and the statue and science fiction. <br /> <br /> Some well-known actors have had to work poorly or have their personal beliefs shared with other countries that were with us. <br /> <br /> I was entertained. As it was entertaining with "Reefer Madness". This film is an attempt to teach drug education, thus trying to teach the principles of "Christianity" with the threat of hell, with the threat of hell and other good people who do not share the interpretations of our world. <br /> </> I was crying, laughing and at the same time I was afraid people think of the nineteenth century. The society that should return to the great ages!
