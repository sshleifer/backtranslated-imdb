This movie is a terrifying source of "devil" masterpeice and is the only thing that deserves the movie. The play is awful, the action scenes are accelerated, the script is almost painful and the budget does not exist. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good, you do not see a real horror movie, skip this and get a copy of the movie demons.
