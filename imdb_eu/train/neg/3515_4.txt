Basically the typical propaganda movie for the ultimate war. But they caused me to be a couple of things. The first one was to use epithet mouths. In both cases, a Scott character gives his mouth, once he has thrown bombs by means of bombing ("dammit") and once a bombarder is trying to force himself to be a rider ("s *% t"). I would be wrong with the second instance, but I have repeated several times and that is what I think. Third, the character of Anne Shirley, O'Brien, is good-natured and good luck ("Give 'em hell") on the rooftops of the engines. He had to think that he was not very pleased, because he says "clear". Also interesting is the interesting character of the bombing problems, especially the bombing of civilians. Official aviary officials assure that the military targets will only be used for the accuracy of the bombing. According to LeMay's strategy for the sale of Japanese cities in oblivion, this scene does not play with a bit of irony. I remember McNamara called LeMay's "The Fog of War", if the US did not win the conflict, it would try to be a war criminal. Finished mode is exceeded, in accordance with the movie. He reminded us at the end of White Heat (I do not compare movies, end only). It may just be deleted. Blowed up real !!!
