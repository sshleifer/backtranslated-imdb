First of all, I would like to emphasize that although it is not an expert, the management mode of judgment will offend your intellect. First of all, the accusation has never proved that "facilitated learning" really works. No responsibility whatsoever for the prosecutor (who can get an appeal) and for not doing so. Other comments say that simplified learning has not been proven. Secondly, Terry used his personal interest as a translator and, furthermore, as testimony to his testimony. If the court could have proved this way, someone would bring a neutral appeal for the appeal. Thirdly, this child was not a specific question on the secret advocate (birth, incident details, etc.), and he could not answer when asked for certain defensive questions. If there is no doubt, I do not know what it is and get the lawyer released. <br /> <br /> The bottom line begins with autism in the pressure of being a parent's parent, but this trial film is incredibly incredible.
