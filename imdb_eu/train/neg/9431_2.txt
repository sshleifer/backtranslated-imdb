The basic slasher movie premise, 3 young girls sink their car and eventually stay home with a terrible family. YAWN. <br /> <br /> Visit the OJ car's 36 minutes of sight with a white sedan instead of a bronco. YAWN. <br /> <br /> The old lady to control her daughter's cold and cold dementia ... YAWN <br /> <br /> The actors are watching for 23 minutes - YAWN They're trying to eat ... They're drinking right It could be a game here ... not - YAWN <br /> <br /> Performing free scenes ... OK, a couple of seconds have been my interest. <br /> <br /> Absolutely random and non-inspired killings ... YAWN <br /> <br /> At the end ... dude! Psychological psycho is inappropriate - why the rest of the movies can not be done for the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately that is ... My advice - faster than the last five minutes and see that and then put something good to the player - I'm going to sleep.
