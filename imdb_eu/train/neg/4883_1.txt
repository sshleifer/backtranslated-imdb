Cheaply shot at the start of Crazy Fat Ethel II's video, I asked if it had been the same movie on the cover. Unfortunately it was. The story itself is not easy. Ethel, a homicidal maniac, with a mess disorder, has been released halfway through the hospital's people. Shortly afterwards, it is the headquarters of most people, while one man dies when another enters the soup. Ethel is affected by unemployment with a chocolate bar, causing him to reduce the costs of feeding dogs. After Ethel strained on the stairs with a wire rope ... he thinks well ... well, you get the idea. If everything is fun, it's not. This film was badly done with poor performance and performance. Characters are wooden when handing out lines for standing in front of a cigarette store. Wrong stuff, half of the movie Criminally Insane, which is the first flashback of Ethel, which is a little better. Bad effort
