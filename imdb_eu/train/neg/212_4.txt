Closer to reality and being deeper than "Breakdance," Stan Lathan's "Beat Street" is still very sad. Once again this pic is only included in the "reflection" motivation, but at least we get a bit of entertainment from the plot, with three youngsters and younger brothers, all in Queens, New York. Each has its own unique talents. One is a toy, a dj, another creator of "burners", is an artist who is dancing "hot" by Lee. <br /> <br /> Lathan can not create a real interest in the audience. The story, however, and his young cast are also fighting with their characters. That's why it's almost impossible to keep funky music and dance "fresh" day. <br /> <br /> Choreography is again sharp for clubs and street scenes, but this is not enough to raise. Beat Street ", unfortunately, the movie is falling late, after showing the brightness of hope that might be of interest. Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video
