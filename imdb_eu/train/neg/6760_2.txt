The renowned author Mark Redfield (Edgar Allen Poe) tries to conquer the old addictions and began a new life for him, as editor of Baltimore, Maryland magazine. However, the shadows threaten delirium and condemnation to frustrate their efforts. Likewise, old love would revive old-fashioned love, because it has erroneous views as things work. Redfield directed this dramatization of the mysterious days of Edgar Allen Poe. Redfield uses black and white photography, misleading color photography to create humor. Kevin G. Shinnick (as Dr. John Moran) works well, quite speaking. It's not enough.
