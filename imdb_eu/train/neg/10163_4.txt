Having thought about the revelation of the "main character" of the "Bubble", when I'm done with the end of the movie, I remember the recent "Machinist" Christian Bale. The only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters. <br /> <br /> A small and realistic portrait of a small town. It is a reason to observe the title. Perhaps the viewers are "Bubble", because we did not win in a 90-minute movie. Audiences' reactions were often sensitive and they were criteria, as they clearly stated that human beings perceived human beings as themselves in selfish characters. These are the people who have been given a second term to those who want to go back to George W. <br /> <br /> He thinks of the reality of television as it spoofs the reality of reality. As soon as her feet exit credit rolls. This film has merit, and it must be taken into account that it does not mean.
