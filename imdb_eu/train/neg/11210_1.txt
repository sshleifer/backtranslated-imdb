I read the story of John Everingham a few years ago in Reader's Digest, and I remember what a great movie would do. And surely Michael Landon was not in his hands. As I am worried, Landon was one of the greatest actors of the earth, and his artistic license came from the top, the massacre of the "Little House" book series is similar. The play, because there is no better word, is hateful, the script is wonderful, and there are more than the first shots of Landon's. <br /> <br /> This movie reflects Everingham's story, "Little" reflects on "House-Based-On-The-Prairie" books. Landon's hair is just another vehicle to show off.
