The main performance of Mira Sorvino is the poor breathing: on stage and plummy, as part of Helena Bonham-Carter's Ivory Ivory's work. Only Fiona Shaw notes - and perhaps her plays pedigree is the best way to handle the material - but it's hard to see a single movie show, even though this performance is clear, true, and like Shaw. Ben Kingsley turns the middle and dismembered, and Diana Riggen's daughter, Rachel Stirling plays as his assistant. Unfortunately, Bertolucci's magic is not offered to his wife if the film is to be proof.
