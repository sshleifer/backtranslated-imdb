Alexandre Ajaren's The Hills Have Eyes's remake has been one of the brightest places in 2006. It's been just a restoration of classic horror films, but they have been quite good. So, almost a year later, we are continuing to make this version. Although original writer Wes Craven has returned to production and scriptwriting, this film reaches its original and version's version. A series of military training stops in the wilderness to attack some scientists and attack mutant families of first-class mutiny (at least those left or new). Here is a lot of gore. What threatens me about this movie is the lack of characterization. The viewer does not suffer any problems because of any of these people, because they do not enter. Mutants had the latest characterization, and this time nothing. Gore Gore's favor does not hesitate. That must be a reason to be interesting. Anything that's going on here is interesting. What has lately been in rape movies? We will get there for no other reason. Fortunately, it is a group of hills that do not visit them anymore.
