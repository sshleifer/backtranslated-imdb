This is a superficial and / or remarkable commentary about the generosity of a jealous young woman in the distribution of her father's and daughter's daughter. Is it an insight or just a vision through the eyes of a daughter of a complex Alectra? Who is it for? All characters, except Anne (Deborah Kerr), are insignificant. Seberg is inadequate (I agree with the "boy's chest" reviews in earlier reviews). The territory is drawn. This anticipated material was enough to keep up to an hour and a half film for about 30 minutes! If you want to see costumes and jewelry on the Riviera, I suggest you "Catch a thief". In it you will be added fun stories and funny characters bonuses. <br /> <br /> I want to entertain movies. Personally, I do not like where a movie is located. Regardless of the time or place, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I want to see nice characters. It does not hurt to relate them. Deborah Kerr's lack of good performances, and David Niven also plays in a shameless role. dark and black faces. Unfortunately, the big cinematographic world can not restore the story badly with wonderful characters. The ears are still ears. As a result, seeing this confusion was a serious waste of my time.
