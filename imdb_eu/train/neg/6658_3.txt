There are several quality variations for this show. One is the melody of the theme song. The show has a nice premise. Also, I'm at least, but I like Wanda. I like it, and Timmy's mom is more. However, despite everything, I do not like this show, it's not excrement, but it seems to me very annoying. <br /> <br /> I would not say that Planet Earth is the best animated show. When I use the word for animated television, I think Peter Pan and Pirates, I think of Darkwing Duck, I think Scooby Doo and Talespin think. And I hope that I'm not just like Wild Wild Thornberry and I feel like it's all I liked. Also, I do not think Justly Odd Parent is the worst animated show in Earth Planet. I admit that it is annoying and somehow overwhelmed, but it's not the worst show in Nickolodean. This is the Chalk Zone, the god that is exhibited. The worst show I have ever seen is Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get a clue, a serious, uncomfortable and shaky animation. <br /> <br /> Animation is a thing that is not about this show. The characters, because they forgive me, have very strange faces, and their origin is dull and there is a lack of color that Spongebob Squarepants and Wild Thornberrys see so pleasing. The character Wanda seems very annoying to me. I do not believe Timmy's voices with talented actors like Timmy Strong (Charendoff). Timmy is not like a leading character, is annoying and sometimes privileged, and the deciding party is also wrong. And his voice is above the nerves. I really like it but not in this show. Another annoying character is Cosmo, a supposedly funny character. Instead, his jokes may be uncomfortable. Yes a) are invented, or b) are known. Timmy's parents are awesome characters who do not draw on their son, and their personality is very thin. <br /> <br /> Story lines are usually very common, and I still think. I saw that before. The episodes of the baby arrived were not there. Even worse is the script, very unpleasant, childhood, nonsense and lack of energy. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's never the worst show, but it's pretty poor for being a fan of animation and sitting quite uncomfortable. 3/10 - There are soothing qualities, and I fully understand what they like.
