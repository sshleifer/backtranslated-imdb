Alex Gardner, a university student (Nicholas Celozzi) is packed with the nightmare of a future ghost of the Alcatraz winery. He has a dream of cutting himself up, his throat rolls up, a ghost breasts his breast and burns more than the burning fire. After seeing his friend "6 feet" on his bed, a helpful, hidden-obsessed teacher (Donna Denton) suggests that they will face Alcatraz in fear. In the middle of the night, of course, when nobody helps to let him in. <br /> <br /> The group landed, brother Richard (Tom Reilly) acquires his brother and starts to die all the people. . Toni Basil's "Mickey" fame is the ghost of Sammy Mitchell's "Bodybag" singer. Alex teaches how to raise his body and repeat the dance music dance with the time frame of the nightmare. All of the victims reveal a terrific ghost on a character Griffin Dunne in AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. The script tries to avoid cartoons, intense dialogue and comedy. Good works by FX and initial credits (Ernest D. Farino) are the only things that are worthwhile. They make some songs in the soundtrack by Basil and Devo ("Whip It"). <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10
