This was not well-done west. This walnut walks through the hot sun, on it with a sun-buggy, which kills people for its reasons. The same person is sitting in a snow-cave during a blizzard, cutting the frozen frost pieces. Then some women go home, in the middle of the wolves there. What's the point of that movie? Can not find Bruce Dern? Film was lost.
