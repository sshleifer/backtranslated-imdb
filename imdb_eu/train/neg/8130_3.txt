When examining some caves with his wife, a doctor causes a bunch of bumps to cause some disturbing side effects ... The horror movie B is a subtle story that makes man a creature. The Bat People, Night It Night, lives, his nonsense story suffers awkward and drawn. The plot seems much more than ever and the movie never gives an explanation or even a good result. The plays are pretty fashionable. <br /> <br /> I'm still going to give the movie some themes due to their theme song and beautiful shooting locations. Stan Winston's latest works are pretty good, but it's not a great show here. I'm sure the missed option. <br /> <br /> No doubt one of the smallest human beings moves. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 away
