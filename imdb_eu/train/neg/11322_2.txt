There is a word in that film, and the word is "drivel". When VHS was rent it was a whirlwind and today's satellite route. <br /> <br /> It could be nonsense, because it has 2 well-known names called Kistofferson and Henriksen, a soundtrack that is reasonable. and a landscaped Monument Monument Monument. <br /> <br /> There is also a curly hair that fights a lot. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie, maybe you'll keep this happy. <br /> <br /> It's still drivel.
