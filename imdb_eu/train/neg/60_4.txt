Goldie I like this and I wanted another movie; So I bought the $ 5.50 from Walmart I watched. Although filmmaking is fun, the movie never reaches anything. In a bar in the bar, some scenes are still too long and they do not have any intention. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, at the end of the film there is a predicate scene, which generally gives it. shot in the face of the wrong taste. I do not think this scene adds to the movie. I do not like some lessons in a stupid comedy that tries to write some sunblocks in the 60s ... <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm glad I've got another movie here. I'm sure he deserved the money he paid!
