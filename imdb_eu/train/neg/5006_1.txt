A movie about a group of friends is not hated at all, but they do not make anything sad as well as giving the audience a * or a character. There are so good films (Ed Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter), and it's just that bad (just like Uwe Bollen's "99% of work"). This movie is almost non-sustainable, even though you're a talented MSTie (eg Mystery Science Theater 3000). Fortunately, I'm very talented in that sense (my mind works like All Time), you just want to get yourself out of this movie * that you do not want to get into the MSTie riff, which are naturally talented. Gently aware that "Taboo" returns about an hour and a half, you will never return. My MST talents were not nearly as stern as dragging and boring. The most curious aspects of this movie are * someone * is a clear and / or financially green ... I rented "Taboo" Amber Benson was usually rented only for the great talent. I know less other movies to rent in my queue, the reviews I should first read. Ironically, the best part of the film was a spectacular labyrinth house, due to its interior location.
