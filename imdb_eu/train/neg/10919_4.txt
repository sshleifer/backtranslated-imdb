Bollywood fans are very much aware of Amitabh Bachan's Mard, but I think it's overcome. Manmohan Desai collaborated earlier in films such as Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie, and I all liked it, so I saw a lot of hope I saw Mard and I was very disappointed. My main concern about Mard seems to be the second part of Amar Akbar Anthony, perhaps Desai was unaware of it, when he used that formula for years. 1. All the members of the competition repeat the AAA for the first time, such as the police inspector of Amar, Akbar, Nirupa Roy and others. 2. AAA, Nirupa Roy loses sight, Mard's voice loses 3. The famous song AAA (Shirdi wale sai baba) is well in Mard, we sing Amitabh Maa Sherawali. After seeing AAA over 1000 years, I soon realized. <br /> <br /> Among others, in some situations, it seems ridiculous to me, Manmohan Desai's real brain left the door for some doors but I thought Mard was too far away. My latest reflection is that, compared to songs from earlier films by Manmohan Desai, I have found quite disappointing songs. I know many movies swear but I did not like it. I like to write this review because I am really a fan and I love movies since I was a child.
