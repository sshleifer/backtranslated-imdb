I remembered the title well. For me, with Olivier and Vivien Leigh, Flora Robson was a film with assistant roles. Vincent Massey's voice was behind the bass. Well Flora Robson was great. The next signature, for me, would be "Peking in 55 days." The same task but with the most beautiful outfits. And the same voice. As for the Navy, it was a subtle text. I like black and white movies. Did everything Elizeber did at night? Sometimes it was time and hard to know. I could not know the interest of love. Was she Spanish or Vivien Leigh? And I do not believe Elizabeth would be an excellent strategist to recommend those who sent firearms to the Navy. Apparently, he worked for the Empire, but not for the script. This could have been more historical, but Bette Davis had more manual scripts. And I lost it for a day!
