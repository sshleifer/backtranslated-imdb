I feel like an idea; I'm the only one I've ever seen through this fake movie. I saw it three times, once with the commentator, and I found myself angry at the foreground, the black and outer screens, the worst, the movie had never been fixed. Yes, the priest dies, but he did not really relax because he had given so much pain to the people, or with him. That was an idiot. If it was not a comment from Peter Cowie, not only because of the movie, but also because I did not describe the book, I would not be embarrassed at all. I enjoy French films, but it was completely absurd. <br /> <br /> The newspaper of a country priest is filmed in a beautiful black and white picture, but this can not only be saved by deadly motifs. The characters do not say anything, until the camera goes away and the scenes of extreme scenes that take place until the end of the game. NO the story is interesting or important. It's time to see how this classic has become: it reminds me of the new emperor's clothes. <br /> <br /> Yes, the performance of Claude Layu is an enthusiastic and thoughtful heart, if you are sadistic, but this film stays. I felt empty, in general, because it was a weak impression of the Catholic priest, a wicked and unknown institution of corruption. The scene of the young priest, who passed the pride of the priest, is weak, but 90% of the film will drag his introspection and his window into the melancholic thoughts of the young priest. This priest is not so humble as to be simply wretched. <br /> <br /> I do not know and I do not know SUBTITLE in English for trying to understand French. movie Well, the subtitles in English are sometimes impossible to read and the text is so fast that I could not read (and I'm not a very slow reader) that I could not read in 3 days after I finished Dostoevsky. <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie. Criterion Collection is testing everything "chosen", and I can not see why this is a critical nod. However, I sat down at this two-hour movie to feel the empathy of the main character and never get it done. It seemed more than a fighter than a victim. And for that, I say this rumor.
