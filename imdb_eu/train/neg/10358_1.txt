I read the entire book "A wrinkle-up" and then I watched the movie. All the items in the film are collected, but the book was 190 pages and the movie was 2 hours ago, with a lot of effects and a bad performance. <br /> <br /> It's a wrinkle of time. Meg's girlfriend, Charles Wallace, and Calvin have to be together as a group to find Meg and find out from the island of Camazotz. <br /> <br /> The start of the movie is really smell. The performance is horrible, the direction is not surprising, and until now the situations are not necessary. I really missed this book, wrote Madeleine Engle, who watched this person and created the movie, a great book and a horrible movie. The play is worse than any live video play. Yes, I must admit that they were good effects. But all the serious ones made them incredibly impossible. If you read the book, it will take you on the movie. I want 0 to give it but unfortunately I can not give it 1. It could be half useful.
