Killer Tomatoes is a special kind of humor that you love or hate. Personally I like it, but the feeling in this fourth movie has disappeared. Tomatoes are not the same, jokes are lame, although the actors are not so funny. That's the only thing that this kind of film is fun. <br /> <br /> So now, after the reason for laughing, it's annoying. They did not have to take the fourth part of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.
