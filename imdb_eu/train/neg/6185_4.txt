The first review of 2010 is "Into The Blue 2: The Reef". The story is about two divas played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort, who like to explore hidden treasures underneath a reef. After a crawl day, a couple of times David Anders and Marsha Thomason approached. They tell young divers who want to explore clothes and discover the strange treasure hidden in the fishing of Columbus. <br /> <br /> <br /> The next day four diving reefs below and a day of diving after a day, nothing is found. A few days before and two contracted Boston found part of the deadly plot, otherwise they could not run away, otherwise they would die. They were hired to find two large ships. One has a nuclear reactor and the other contains a nucleus. <br /> <br /> The film also has a story about another person (main character's brother), who tries to fix things with his girlfriend. It was a loss of the time of the story, this is also a very sexually-challenged scene for me, that is, it's a waste for me and it's not to be shown. <br /> <br /> However, in addition, this is it. The movie has good underwater photography and the colors fit well, which is why it has 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 is the only sequel to the name. No original actor or character has returned to anyone, he has a silent plot, a stupid character and a peak.
