I wanted to see this movie for a long time, when I saw "Return to Paradise", and I found it wonderful. I was so disappointed. I think that the most real thing was "Return to Paradise" ("Back to Paradise"). <br /> <br /> I expected too much. <br /> <br /> In a positive way Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. I did not like the nature of Danes and, first of all, I found it very annoying. <br /> <br /> I can not see the realistic about the film. It is possible to do so much, for example, in terms of prison conditions and horror care. The movie was very rewarding for being realistic. More action and tension could also be <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is "tragic." I did not anticipate that. But I did not care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3/10
