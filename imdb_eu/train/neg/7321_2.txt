Maybe it's not my genre, but it was a great plot with Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino acting. C. Thomas was also uncomfortable about the role that could be fascinated here (marijuana carefully? Why should this be included? This weak plot is obviously). Similarly, Farentino charac. It would be better if a relationship had more respect. Could it be in the movies? not many
