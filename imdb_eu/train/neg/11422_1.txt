When I first saw him in the theater, I saw him again yesterday with the cable. This I knew myself was a boring film. The bunch of characters are self-absorbed. It is the worst thing that reinforces each negative stereotype about 20 dates, in order to celebrate people "to find themselves". The pretty boys end up in the end, the rockers say, they are very good. The girls are all the boys' toys. Only one character (Wendy) is seen to be useful for society remotely, and neglects a long-term virginity in a single-piece demolished garment. romantic This is actually the concept of Hollywood youth in America: permission, liberated, confusing, thoughtful.
