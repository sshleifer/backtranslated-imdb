I can not believe what a horrible movie is. I often feel like a "movie". The performance was flat, the edition was awful and the plot did not answer many important questions. The premise was fine, if it was not an original: a small foreigner is living in the U.S. and is trying to gradually take humanity. But that goes down fast. How would you convince a foreign "human" who needs a foreigner hybrid and a man who requires him to be his wife? They show an alien larva but never show what he does. They have a plastic surgeon to create skins that look great on the industrial scale. Extraterrestrial tears throw away the mandatory alien monster. The final sight was very painful. I think that, above all, I was disappointed that Bruce Boxreichere should do something about it. How could he say to the big strange monster teeth, "he fled before a son," with his direct face? The long fall of Babylon is 5 days. Avoid at all costs.
