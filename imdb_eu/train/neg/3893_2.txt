I thought the main character, an astronaut with a bad case of stairs (in his case, his skin, hair, muscles, etc.), after reducing the work he had ever achieved in more movies. All you have to do is get Blob's work. The premise of this Flick is pretty lame. An astronaut is affecting solar radiation (I think) and therefore begins playing cool ice cream as a cone. This is not just a puzzler but, apparently, it is necessary to kill human beings and to consume their flesh so that they can maintain a cellular integrity. Eh? Have you ever noticed that whenever a radiation accident or experiment occurs, it becomes instantly a machine that dies? Why is that <br /> <br /> Astronaut's night enters the "secret facility" (no security whatsoever), while it spills its parts. Apparently, he kept enough memory to get in on his mind, because he wanted to go back to space. <br /> <br /> This is how the part of the movie, which is quite filling, starts with a doctor who walks through Geiger's counterattack to find the murmur that he finds melted. Bill Gates fights stupid fishermen, Frankenstein's monster movie scares a little girl and ends the oldest couple (he charmfully punishes them to steal the lemons). Then the scene is short, where he is a general who is his general and a young man who dies while he is sitting, and his girlfriend. After cutting the arm and escaping, you would think that the scene would change. But no ... we have treated about ten minutes, a horrified woman in the horrified corner of the horror, even though the monster has disappeared. Directory girlfriend, anyone could think of it? <br /> <br /> The end of the film is clearer than the rest. The man who goes out makes him a gooey bat, and ... nothing. That's it. That's the end of the movie. Well, that means that there was no place for at least one sequel.
