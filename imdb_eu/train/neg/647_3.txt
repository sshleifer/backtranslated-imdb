The play was awesome, as well as the script. He was badly picked up and almost laughed at you, they made some horrible scenes of murders. Finishing was even worse. Everyone continued to die, but to some extent it was perfectly good at the end. They did not give a good story about teachers' obsessions, etc. The movie has taken more time to develop a better script. The only reason I give it 3/10 I feel bad for young actors. They needed better training. They could really do a good movie, but the script and the performance failed.
