*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If you only look at the premise of the film, it might be thought that you were seeing an average horror movie on animals. The plot is: A group of filmmakers go on an island to shoot a documentary with shark or blood surfing surfing. (I live in South Africa, which has been released as "Blood Surf"). In fact, it seems that the idea is more interesting, that is to say, if it were further analyzed, the film could improve somewhat. However, this is not the case because the part of the film's blood is minimal, because the documentary is interrupted by a great salmon crocodile. <br /> <br /> The script is totally horrible. A good example of this is that whenever a crocodile that produces this film is eating, it seems that no one has been damned. Everyone who made the film was the only victim to make a toast, it was polluting in a scene, but it was wonderful for the film to be a very questionable conversation. Another thing that is really annoying about this movie is that the movie itself presents characters that are not useless. They present a series of pirates, which only adds another 10 minutes to a short and compassionate movie. <br /> <br /> The play can be said to be half-crazy. It may well be much more spectacular if they do not have a great script for work. After all, it is not the only person that has made a huge impact on me. Everyone seemed to be a bit of a caricature, so that none of these agents had any impact on me. <br /> <br /> The crocodile itself is said to be more than exactly 31 feet and this sense of size is well represented by the false false crocodiles that we have given in the film. At the end of the film the crocodile's death is so incredibly false and it stops abdominal. With a terrifying horror, the hero of the film tells us that he has a plan that falls down a hill and announces that the crocodile is lying happily over his head. > <br /> In the end, I would say that what you think of this movie should be what you think might be bad. At that time they seemed to be a good idea, they probably had a great script and a huge sense of a low budget, and all this really created a horrible movie.
