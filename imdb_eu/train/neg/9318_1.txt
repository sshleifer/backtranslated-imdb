This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I once again made a mistake to buy the movie, because the synaptic in the background had cooled down, and the front looked pretty nice (I also bought this and bought the movie "Malevolence" here) I learned my lesson.) I love horror movies in the forest or in the desert or in a farmhouse. This allegedly happened in the wood of Texas, but probably shot at the director's front. The production I have ever seen is likely. The actors were absolutely PICTURES. The story had nothing to do with the back cover. I tried to sell to the F.Y.E., buy "used" DVDs and "mom and pop" to other stores, and they would not be taken. That's how horrible the misery is to make a movie miserable. I have seen first shorts (for example, Troll 2), but it definitely takes the cake. I did not think the movie "Troll 2" was worse. Boy I was wrong! Do not buy this movie if you do not give it to anyone, but if you do not throw it attached to it, you have to do what I want to do. !!!
