This show boils. For parents, they usually want to see something they want their children. Education is fun and bright. <br /> <br /> Is it education? No Doodlebops sing and that's it. They are singing themselves, they do not try to teach anything. <br /> <br /> Is it fun? No Doodlebops say something like a joke and they laugh. <br /> <br /> Is it bright? It's shiny, it's painful. As for color, everything is very bright, so it's good. But nothing is ever wrong in the Doodlebop world. So they are always happy. A child with problems will turn depression into a drama that never had. <br /> <br /> The show is very cursed. Each syllable is the highest level of abuse and is very crunchy. Overkill it. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining for children, but at 2 you do not want to see your children. They never grow up to know.
