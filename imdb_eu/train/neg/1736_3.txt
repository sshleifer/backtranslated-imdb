Let me Betty Grable, especially saying that I liked the "Down Argentina Way", but he also got the time he got around this disaster "round" and, in fact, the whole movie was embarrassing. Douglas Fairbanks has made it cost for JNr (who has to be quite disappointed), the story was bad, good colors and longer movies. There, there were some rumors such as Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner, without encouraging interest or success. Partial music was shameless, and I had to say that a melody was not in any way memorable ... As I was a fan of Miss Grable, I've never always seen!
