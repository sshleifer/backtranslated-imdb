<br /> <br /> Inexpensive and ugly, this film did not allow the audience to be entertained, except for a fun joke. Christopher Lloyd surpasses his or her first level, and it's really hard at work in that role, but it does not help the joke of writers. Elizabeth Hurley is shy amateurish in a supposedly comic role. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah dumped humiliation. There's really no reason to make this movie, especially because we're going to compare it with Robin Williams's brilliant, magnificent improvisation of Mork & Mindy. <br /> <br /> <br />
