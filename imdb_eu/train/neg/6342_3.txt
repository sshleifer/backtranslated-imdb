I received it at the video store for Tarantino's recommendation ("(if you do not want to go, and yourself!)" In the box ... it seemed like the call ... I expected something like "Death Proof" ... it's not This violent crime, or plot, character or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Look at the poster. Everything is there. Stunts and rock. It goes back and forth. In a one week band, a wonderful magic show, a strip-off casino one of the smaller ones and a new Aussie stuntman in a country where you can find ... They work, they meet the girls, they party, the end of the story. <br /> <br /> The group, of course, needed everything he needed, They were strictly second class, and they played the style that was dated in 1978. The curiosities of the film are true, they are real spinetingling - Aussie fellow is really something, and the film largely resembles love and "art". I cried to see how crazy it was. I want to find a better vehicle.
