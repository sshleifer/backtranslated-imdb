Do not disturb yourself with this movie, when it is judged by its merits when it's wrong, but compared to the original 1972 (that is, classical), it's horrible. And BTW, someone commented that the 1972 movie was bad compared to the book. This is absurd, movies will never be taken against their books. Both art forms are completely different (that is, but apparently, this must be done). These criteria would be sucked in "2001" on all films, so that it would be "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs".
