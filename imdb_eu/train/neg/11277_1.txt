Without a doubt, this film is a huge figure, but unfortunately it does not help with the most important part of the film. I never understood why correctors have asked for actors / actors to avoid using accents because they do not believe everyone can not believe it. Fiennes can not make Irish and Fitzgerald does not much better in Russian. Whatever the voice is, whatever the good interpretation is, the character will never convince. Due to the main problem ... on the plot ... was it one? I think I had a line involved, but there was a lot of holes, I just had to wait until I finished the movie ... it was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and watch the movie!
