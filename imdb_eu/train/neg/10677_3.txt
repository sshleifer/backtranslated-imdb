I rented the final game, I never heard it, but I like political thriller, so I gave it a shot. After a few studies on the film, I discovered it was directed to the theater version, but the DVD was tight. After seeing, I'm thinking, "it's not surprising." The movie is moving in its specialty. Plots and characters are empty. I calculated it in the middle of the road, but it was an end curve. I have to say, I did not want to hope, but it is not for that. It would be better for anyone who would be less likely to finish it more predictable. Perhaps the filmmakers saw the planned movie, so they decided to throw a tour, although it would make the film worse. <br /> <br /> Leave it away. I want $ 5.98 and 107 minutes.
