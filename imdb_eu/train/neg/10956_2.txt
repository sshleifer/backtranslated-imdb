I bought this movie from the short film used in Gamestop and I laughed at the surface without control, so I bought 99cents. The same film has been delayed and used as eleven monkeys in a film that does not appear anymore. It is worth mentioning the double stunt, which is just a little costume, which makes an effort to represent a monkey. <br /> <br /> More than one director has killed suicide after making the movie with chimpanzees Warner Bros. according to a preview of other low wages, and sharpened the money from the studio. He also did not help her because of the terrifying work he did, because he did not know how to produce an indenture film. <br /> <br /> Why was this movie created?
