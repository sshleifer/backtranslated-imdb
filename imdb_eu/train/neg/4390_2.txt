The television guide described the plot of SEVERED TIES, as follows: "An arm of a bone is a bad experiment," so I immediately thought that it was about an arm that would have its head on its head. Get five hands or a hand or someone get a arm transplant as BODY PARTS. Both sites have tried and tested, or I was more aware of how tired and trying to test out how producers will approach the story. I thought I thought I'd make a movie like a movie theater at the beginning of the B & W photo, but the makers spent 20 minutes tired of this vision and decided to make a comedy similar to THE EVIL DEAD splatter. I have said very little about why THE EVIL DEAD did not like me and I liked HIS BETS, and it seems unfair to watch movies like this when they use shades of rubber when the third world screams.
