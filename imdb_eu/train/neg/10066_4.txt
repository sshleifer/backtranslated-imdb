Recently I saw it again and there is another version of 1999. I think it's the same film but I would like to know the difference. <br /> <br /> It's Japanese and I can not start short pikachu. On the other hand, why vote the same movie twice? <br /> <br /> Prof Ivy was boring. As he was almost asleep, he did not do any expression with a few lines. <br /> <br /> That was pretty nice, but it was not much. <br /> <br /> A collector who does not intend to destroy the future of Lugia, who does not intend to destroy the world and who tries to avoid Lujara, because it causes many destructions to capture Lugia. <br /> <br /> The next pokemon movies are a bit better, deoxys (poke 7) is not great. 8 almost here.
