Hello, I'm not one of the major theater or movie being a sophisticated vision ... I think this movie is "Boring" and "Dumb". <br /> <br /> I rented this movie because of Charles Bronson's title ... but how much time was lost for the boys ... 2 sitting in a bargain and talking ... looking ... <br /> <br /> The movies in this DVD "DARK" ... I was ... it's hard to watch the movie ... it's a 1968 movie ... I realize ... but they're on the DVD, they should be remastered again. <br /> <br /> I was also absolutely impressed to see the high ratings in this movie for this movie ... I have just said before, all the other people who have commented on this movie earlier have not so sophisticated.
