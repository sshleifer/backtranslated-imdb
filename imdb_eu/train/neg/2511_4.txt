The director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) directs a rather well-liked comedy on Albert Einstein's (Matthau) to enjoy the relaxed and enjoyable 1950's life with Tim Robbins of his scientific nephew (Ryan). Ryan likes to play Robbins, Einstein tries to look like a brilliant scientist Robbins. The idea is very nice, but the flat movie falls with stirring situations and stupid conversations. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, are trying hard to keep this bad comedy, but they can not save the movie. Unfortunately, so much talent was needed to bring the movie to such production. I would not recommend anyone except Meg Ryan's great fans.
