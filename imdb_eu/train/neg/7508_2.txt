I chose another title for Spike Lee. "Summer Of Sam" means that David Berkowitz is an evil killer. It is not. Berkowitz was a terrifying city in the 77's, a straight-forward portrait of NYC street life. Some of the characters from a fictional italo-american city follow some movies and their reactions to the threat of Sam of men. There is no Vinny and his wife Dionna; There are Richie and Ruby, and many other characters. <br /> <br /> The problem is that these characters are not liked. They are commonly annoying and sometimes overwhelming. Then his energy is high, chaotic, full of anger, lust and general anxiety, his energy is higher. At least two long-running scenes include Vinny and his wives, redundant disco dance scenes, numerous gabfests ... I asked him repeatedly: where is the movie editor? <br /> <br /> In the meantime, with that board. The film allows fear or fear to be transmitted to fear of the threat of Sam Son, which is too much in the background. Lee is more successful in showing a different neighborhood, which comes from neighborhood care guards. <br /> <br /> The effect is evenly good. Combined with the music of the 1970s, our costume and production designs brought us a great deal of attention, and you really feel that you are in a New York-based Italian-American neighborhood in 1977. <br /> <br /> The authenticity of the film's atmosphere, however, is not enough to offset a shrill book about life that is shameful and irritable.
