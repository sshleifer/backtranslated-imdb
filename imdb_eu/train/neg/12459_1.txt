Taking into account the amount of the budget for this movie, you would expect the whole story more generally. I probably saw the movie that I could see, probably. There was nothing advanced. The development of the characters is minimal. Soil progress, maybe. Enjoy it, no. I do not know at what point he even tried. If you want to see the movie that wants to be a good-natured terrorist, the American CIA bombs us with our opinions, all the capitalists are corrupt and you want to see something similar to a drawing of death. Understand that we do not accept any good point for each one of us, we will match other films. In short, this is an enormous essay on a plot of hide-and-seek 'Ocean's style', because you do not know what's going on, no one has ever made the movie. Home Alone was a better piece of 3 movies.
