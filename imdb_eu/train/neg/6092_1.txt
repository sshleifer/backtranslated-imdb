When someone needed to think about this film. <br /> <br /> The first film that was made in 1993 was absolutely impossible. Fashion and music say that it's a series based on the 80's. I think this has been sitting on the shelf for a long time, before getting rid of some wrong distributors and releasing them to a world that is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> There is a plot. Like it. A strange solo encounters a random man, who sings his favorite song, becomes anyone who chooses. At this time, the solitude song's favorite London Bridge is Falling Down. Why is this your favorite song? It's an idiot We're just a minute in the movie and the film has already reached a high level of stupidity. It gets even more stupid. <br /> <br /> The solitaire is a nose harvester. I can not only assume the two scenes of the movie as it nines its nose. This cleans the title. She decides to change a girl to approach other girls. And kill. This is more or less. <br /> <br /> The agent is universally horrible. Each movie's performance is sucked. Actually, this reality would be a standard pornographic movie. It's really awesome. The nose pickers appear as nose-pickers. The movie characters are seen as a girl from London Bridge is Falling Down. Man, I feel like an idiot writing it. However, it is strange to see a middle class jewelry in school. And not in a good way. The scene where the nose chooser is in schools with girls and a song that also plays a high-level scene. Probably the worst song ever recorded. I will not describe it. When you hear And you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> There are some violence scenes, surely. And a Benny Hill-style chase sequence includes a transsexual. There is also an immortal conversation that would take Shakespeare's or John Milton's (or nose-mattress testimony to a prostitute), "if I have money". Fine, I'm sure you agree. <br /> <br /> Nonsense.
