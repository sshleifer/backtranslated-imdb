** REQUESTED BY REQUESTS <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Untitled heroine holds her handsome and beautiful father (a strange teacher whose helmet's hat is broken in a single shot and next ) will rescue, dime-store mummy and nasty Nazi ... what else? - Build a fourth Reich. Misty's costume, like others, slows down as the movie progresses. The last part of the film is a long act of lesbian action; This footage is really boring, true, when it says more behind the camera behind the horrifying creatures. MISTY pulls out its nominal plot quickly and quickly, then focuses on nudity and soft sex. This film by MUMMY RAIDER in the 1960s casts on films such as Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Imagine: if it had been overwhelmed four decades ago, in 42 years, WHAM BAM THANK YOU SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICK would be played. However, MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went directly to home videos. Take it quickly before printing.
