First of all, this movie is GLACIALLY slow and I see the audience patiently lose the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> The subject of the movie would be the basis I thought. excellent movie; The missing thing was a plot of land underlying the most underlying issues. <br /> <br /> Unfortunate in the hands of a writer (for example) like Lanford Wilson, I think symbolism as a mountain lion. School campuses can have a good deal of tragic handicapped hands. <br /> <br /> I think a good screenplay with the movie, the same filmmaker, the same tastes and even the same actors. who has not been able to impress the boys, maybe a boy has suffered pain and a significant and emotional depression in the fight, when he admires an older boy. . <br /> <br /> However, I feel that without saying that, and that the book is armed, dull and very uninteresting, without any plot, and in no way. I think that the structure of the guy (for example, after seeing it, can not point to the climate scenario, instead, "well, maybe that scene, or that was the point ..."). The result is 95 minutes of tedio. <br /> <br /> Without land, we never create a great interest. in every character; Their trials and difficulties are boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Without a good ground, the dramatic devices and surrealist directors make confusing and confusing freedoms for the story. I never believed, for example, that I was creating "Leah" and I believe that most audiences would be captivating their phone calls as usual. As the film highlights, I am afraid I can not recommend it. I never understood why a movie like THIS is not re-created by an activist filmmaker ... In the first book, all the remakes of the movie were very good. It's a good script written by the handwriting, and I think that this movie has become an unforgettable class about a man's age that rarely treats the theater. All the elements that seemed so boring and exciting in the movie (messages written on the boy's stomach, "Leah" scenes, television screen fantasies) would become rich with a good STORYLINE. <br /> </ p> <p> I see some comments that people are talking about as a "gay topic" about this film, and I think that's wrong. Of course, a depicted "twisted" teenage boy is a new boy, but Logan's young character is not in sexual choice, and we can see it in fantasy fantasies. All kinds of sexual and non-sexual stimuli, like a very young boy like himself, would hopefully be. I think that "crushes", like those in Logan, are common among men who preferly sexually assiduous female sex workers.
