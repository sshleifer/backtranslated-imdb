This is probably the worst act I have ever seen in a movie ... never. and what is the question? The main protagonist of this film is a kind of nasal disfigurement and it is almost impossible to look all the time without setting it on the nose. On Sunday afternoon, you can go to your local grocery store and you will find 50 qualified women to look at it as much as possible. I made an unfortunate mistake for renting this movie because it was a "cool" DVD case. This movie is just a class project for a multimedia student's technical center. I would prefer to spend this time or watch this movie on public access ... at least the special effects are better and they are more attractive to people than they can see in this movie.
