I do not know what they liked about this movie. The setup was long and bad, and when the end was over, the main character stayed flat and prosperous in the first scene. Eventually, when Cusack entered the hotel room, I had to ask, well, what would happen next, so it would be better. Answer: It's not much, John Cusack is just far from my head, taking away my head. <br /> <br /> Maybe Cusack's character would be deeper. . maybe his daily life might be doing deeper tasks. . . Maybe the movie has developed losses or issues about faith in the semi-baked or if it does not. . . Perhaps if the film had the possibility of being afraid of psychological or emotional fear and embraced one of these styles completely. . . I do not know. I know that they have seen this movie with two other horror films and that nobody liked it. <br /> <br /> Except for a disturbing passage in the corner of the hotel, the huge ladybird and hanging on the air pipeline were stupid, and they respond to more than five minutes on three screens. This movie was bored. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, this story robs Shining ideas and uses it to make it much more powerful. Stephen King has now reduced his ideas to steal?
