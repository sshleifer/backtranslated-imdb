Sometimes I do not understand what the directors do when they make the movie ... I had a trauma that they would think it's time to see Welcome (2007). But after a lot of exciting promotions, Tashan finally ended as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> This amazing song in the promotion - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ... and what movie? The Zero story, the predicted plot, Akshay Kumar stunts plenty and nothing interesting besides Kareena after losing weight loss ... !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another great catastrophe in the music album ..., small and pathetic conversations between these 4 jokes They've given up and Akshay Kumar stunts! This song is very enjoyable, it's very similar to Tashan Mein, and this is not a music album! :-( If you want to watch this movie, I'd like to say, listen to a song that sings something like this ... 'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ...' <br /> <br /> In general, Bhaiyyaj is very disappointed to try to speak English badly As your way! <br /> <br /> Leave the man, I must throw it!
