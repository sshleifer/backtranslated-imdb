The plot was quite interesting with the backdrop of the Russian revolution. Also, I enjoyed watching Budapest partially filming the movie. Unfortunately, there was no chemistry among the two main characters, so it was difficult to believe the love story between them. Love scenes were forced and mechanical. Jordan Kirckland was very hard, almost frozen. Rob Stewart was quite nice and young, so he was like his oldest sister, rather than a girlfriend. In the end, at the end of the day, when we got back to the one we got there, it was pretty weak and there was no sense. I think this movie would be much better if the relationship between the two actors was more credible.
