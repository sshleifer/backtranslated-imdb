MASTI was a success and Inder Kumar again returned with a comedy PYAARE MOHAN based on the Hollywood movie. SEE NO EVIL, HEIL NO EVIL <br /> <br /> The film reminds you that HUM HAI KAMAAL KE (1994). where Kader and Anupam play blind and deaf <br /> <br /> The movie is boring exercise. <br /> <br /> We have jokes about folly nonsense, like Snehal Dabi like you do not like. All kinds of comedies that are not stuck in the back of the horse and we're not laughing at each other, but <br /> <br /> the movie starts to cool down and some scenes are unhappy, because those moments do not last the whole story is never getting bored. It is handled and in the second half, the actress and the deer becomes an action movie to save heroes and we have scenes of pursuit of OTT and battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Inder Kumar's management is bad. Music is OK, I highlight a song. WE HAVE OUR ANGELA <br /> <br /> Vivek is a great comic scene, its time is very bad and it has serious scenes. One of the reasons is the comedy, and his career has broken Fardeen Khan, but the rest of the wood. Esha and Amrita are the heroes of Boman Iran. Snehal Dabbi is well
