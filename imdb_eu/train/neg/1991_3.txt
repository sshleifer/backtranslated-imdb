So, what a great adventure is doing is to work INDIANA JONES, an actress with a fictional dude actor who does not want adventure adventures in an adventurous adventure. Whoever writes JAKE SPEED's script, probably shot it, but, for whatever reason, this movie is missing a lot of excitement! This does not mean that there is no action, but look at the dark side of the image. This is not because of the emotions of INDIANA JONES or other adventure ventures that do not resemble closely similarities and exhaustions, and I was encouraged to use JAKE SPEED with a fast propaganda that is so much to myself and others that we are interested in! Besides, I have never heard the boy, so who needs his attention?
