Is the lowest possible score a star? it's shameful Actually, I will go to the IMDb portal for the "zero stars" option. To give this movie, a single star gives way to the WAY. Is the only microphone detected at the station? and acting, or should I say that's missing? Apparently talent was not a factor when the casting director arrived in the city. My younger sister's educational talent show a deeper and deeper emotion. And these Irish false accents were like nails on a chalk board. The only thing that could be worse than this movie ... oh, wait, no, no, it's already bad.
