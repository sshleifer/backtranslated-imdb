This could be the worst film ever produced ever. <br /> <br /> 1. The most exciting is the beginning, where you can walk on the ... walking ... and foot (spoiler). The walk is about 15 minutes away. How <br /> <br /> 2. There's not a lot of problems related to lighting, and almost a day-to-day scenes shot. <br /> <br /> 3. The play was TERRIBLE. They seem to have found a community theater (in Mexico) ... and then they took the people they took. <br /> <br /> Please, do everything for sainth, do not rent this film. If you know someone who owns you, apologize apologize. The director should be subjected to punishment for the war crimes to be taken by the lawyer through the lawyer.
