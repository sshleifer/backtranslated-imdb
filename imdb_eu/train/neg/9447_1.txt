I can easily sit in most movies, although I do not like the movie. I'm a kind of person who knows great movies, even if you do not like the genre. I could not see the first movie. The movie I've ever seen in Cat Hat is the worst and I've seen a lot of movies. The play is fine (Myers cat is good, it's just really annoying). The stupid songs that cats are boring and monotonous, as well as for the children of the audience. The plot goes ahead and the viewers have to undergo a bad conversation. Parents' comments are "funny", not funny (a garden hoe, or a great commentary about a person who calls him a "ho". Although a very short movie, it seems to have lasted a long time. Do not waste time. I know little children I hate. I can not even know if they can not stand upright, I do not know how to get any adult. I'd like to know more about this movie, but I'm not going to miss out on this review. Give yourself a 90 minute viewing of your life! Watch a good movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 star - the smallest movie I have ever watched.
