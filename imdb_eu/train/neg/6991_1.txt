Do not worry I thought I wanted to see a movie with great actions and actions. <br /> <br /> But it is boring and very predictable after the start is interesting. In the middle of the movie you have a small social drama and the tension loses its speed by slowing down. It approaches the end but it's not really great. The director is a very serious movie. With this kind of movie, even if you want at least some fun activity on the plot. I was almost half in the middle and in the middle. Rating 3/10. <br /> <br /> derboiler.
