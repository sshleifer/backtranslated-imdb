The main fault of this movie is that it is impossible that any of these people should ever be thrown into the professional Macbeth production. Listen to David Lansbury's soft mouth, "Fight tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow", he never fought for anyone to believe in this role. For this reason, I still believed that he did not act the wrong actress; It's not a big name. So when we see pieces of the essays in essays, it is difficult for the director to mislead the parody of things incorrectly, misread, articulate or understand theater. interpretations Sometimes, the directors are so demanding to make their own films (and they think that writers have the ability to direct their work), they need to fix it less. This seems to be an example.
