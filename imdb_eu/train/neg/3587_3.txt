How can Joe Don Baker (the first Bufford Pusser's) with Bo Svenson (with the second-second Bufford Pusser). Why did they do it? Booz Bo Bo Svenon seems to have a look like Bufford Pusser. The first time was Joe Don Baker's first time as the Bufford Pusser and I wanted to see it in the second season. <br /> <br /> I'd give this movie at 7 out of 10, and I'd give it a story about this if it was not related to the life of Bufford Pusser, but why I gave it to this movie at 10.10. <br /> <br /> I recommend that I see this cheese as anyone I propose does not see and see the next first battle.
