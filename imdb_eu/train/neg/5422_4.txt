It is a curious idea of ​​a movie about the creative credibility of "Death Wish". The point is clear; above all, the scene that strives to read our hero Hagel, "I'm too foolish to understand that." Reading a paragraph and reading again, we read it and we did not even get it. Then a car's alarm goes out. During the ongoing interference of the movie's alarm and noise. However, he understands very little to understand our heroine, which allows all of them to spoil their marriage and pay attention to unnecessary plots by deepening their nature. <br /> <br /> The film itself does not inadvertently detect its sound problems, incorrect editing and visible micro-visuals. No, "Noise" is not bad. William Hurt is at least the color. At least, the end is not falling. In general, it drives a logistic point at home, you probably did not think about it. At least I did not. All in all, ninety minutes, he could not finish before. The story dragged on and, apparently, he was immediately lost. <br /> <br /> It is one of those films that you can watch at a movie festival, but it probably will not be distributed. Check if you join a DVD participant in the project. Otherwise, jump.
