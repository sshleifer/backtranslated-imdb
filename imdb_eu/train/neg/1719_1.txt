Crater Lake Monster is one of the most horrifying movies I have ever seen, with Manos, with the bad performance of Fate of the Hands, in the wrong direction and nursery production values. In this movie, the awesome claymation / stop-motion animation dinosaur wakes up when a meteorite falls into a lake of Bumblebum (CA) and begins to eat in its wildlife basins. In a beautiful atmosphere, a creature, described by a local as "a giant puppet", drags the heaviest weight on earth to take his lunch, a bulldozer knocks twice and dies before boredom. . Every character in this Moovie is absolutely a fool. A nonsense subset shows you to enter an ice cream shop, $ 4.75 to buy a Ripple pint; Just buying a bottle, he throws an idiot box and other audiences shoot a cop and look at the lake to eat monsters. The misfortune of the unhappy monster reveals that it is only a thin mirror. It seems that a false magician struggling with a false British accent (to convert it into it), two abusive shipbuilders, a precious "prehistoric cave" made from ceramic excitement and in the backdrop of the annoying grill. In a painful scene, the false magician and wife / bride / fake complicity manage to take four minutes more of the movies even though they can see stars in the night sky, it's clear daylight. In constant breakthroughs, the boy is also hurting and bad. MooCow says they call the fumigators, "because this beef cake is really shameless!" : = 8p
