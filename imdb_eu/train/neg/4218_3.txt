This is not one of these, or dated, revisions of special effects or bad technologies, only topics that could be linked to dorkiest people, but a story-telling review, which many of us are really interested in. <br /> </ b> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> Manipulation is not so bad as the film standards, and we know that realism in the plot will not be high. Films like this are credible and enjoyable characters, and some reasons are apparent in the actions. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks both. For a feature film, there are only 6 characters, three of which are hardly ever seen. McClure's hero is beyond the "routine" and does not make any sense at any time. Women seemed to be looking for a response to a dinosaur-related enigma, but the enigma is not much more enigma, and we could take care of it less. <br /> <br /> Failure could be much better in a movie, even in its time.
