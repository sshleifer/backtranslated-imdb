I'm the one who loves movies B Give me a boy boy and I'm in heaven. These films allow you to think about everything that happens in your world. A stupid movie from NY also makes me laugh, and I'm still good at it. Afterwards, Hammerhead was there, so I was obliged to register with the horrible movie to warn others. First of all, a man who created the shadow of science, hardly touched the movie. To save audiences interested, they made sure they were blood in a few minutes. In a scene of an attack, the attack on the camera was abandoned, but apparently a blood vessel appeared on the stage, it could have known that the attack was bloody and probably that the person was dead (what special effects were wonderful). Returning to science, I thought it was very interesting that women's testing issues were naked and that testing equipment should be monitored through breast tissue. In any case, this movie was a bad plot, the story was awful, and I feel like saying bad action. Neither William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo, nor Jeffrey Combs could save it.
