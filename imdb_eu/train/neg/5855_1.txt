The movie that started in 2000, MELA has been so terrifying with the two disasters to start a millennium, with such a nonsense <br /> <br /> It seems that the movie is in the 70's, but it's a comedy that was a must-see in 2000. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In any case, the classic gems of the movie: Paresh Rawal I do not understand her role or weep laughing Reason: She finds herself in the middle of the town. The worst part is when she learns a secret from Anil, she keeps her secret in her stomach. It reminds me that it becomes great and that I am pregnant. In my childhood, the teacher told me that Urrf told me the joke! I laughed as a child at that time but here? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is not a joke. Anil has two ways (older and younger) and Rishah the eldest wife and Raveena young Harish are also dismissed by Shakti, Aruna, Iran's son, who is the worst movie to fight against <br /> <br /> Abandoned Directority Bad Music < <br /> <br /> Anil tries hard. It looks like the older one is younger and the older ones too older, but the good work is Rechaha, and Raveena is well. Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is horrible as Aruna Iran is Rajnikant as usual.
