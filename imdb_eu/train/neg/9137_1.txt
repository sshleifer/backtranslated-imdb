What can I say, an excellent movie that should win an Oscar? A copy must be kept safe for the following. You must see it for all the high school students all over the world. Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps a writer, director, producer / chef / childhood / walmart striker, and his art to thank the world of cinema. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Where will I start? Ben and Arthur in milliseconds were once completely astonishing! And Mraovich Arthur, I'm surprised by the fact that it's very attractive to wow. The universe was not gone. I could not tell myself naked. This movie borrowed my brother and he called me on the phone, he told me he had turned the gay scene of Arthure bare. Of course, I am very supportive of this film and the beautiful lessons of tolerance. Why did I smoke a church yesterday and I wrote "Sam and Arthur" in his light ash. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was the best thing about cinema. The Fed-Ex plane, when the palm trees of Vermont moved to the sky, wept! Why did not I ever know about Vermont's palm trees or how people could travel on Fed-Ex aircraft before this movie. The eyes opened up to a new field of new possibilities. This film enrolled me in the screen entry, Action, Direction, Composition, Foundry, Production, Production Design and Real Estate Enrollment for Sam Mraovich. I mean: "Thank you, Mr. Mraovich. Thank you for bringing this creative to the world. We can never pay again."
