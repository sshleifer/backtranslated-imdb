I can not believe that people thought that this dirty rude was fun. Changing attempts at cruelty, cruelty and madness, "Mary About Somer's" causes little reason to reach the finish line. Surely, Cameron Diaz is very nice, but that's not enough to store a movie. Ben Stiller tries hard to work on the plot, and, of course, it is very talented, but it's a losing movie. <br /> <br /> Once in a while, a scene was not even compelling. The maps were not very little time and they were drawn. Farreley brothers should be off the beaten track. I check IMDB to see what they are working on, so I know what I've avoided. <br /> <br /> 2/10; It's time to smile at a bonus. It's not like humor or my opinion. He also hated my wife. The next day we saw 'Top Time' and laughed the fool. This movie is pure noise.
