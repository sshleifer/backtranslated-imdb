Ok, we would say the movie really "unique". Carrie Fisher was undoubtedly the most talented movie, though she said it was a coke problem during the movie. But he said he could not remember much. It's fine for her, but what else is it for? I can not imagine that everyone has a coke problem. However, it was not bad, I think the plot was right, and the moment was quite fun. The guy who got into the head has got a bit too much to get my taste. Oh well, I was convinced that Carrie Fisher is so awful and this movie did nothing to her.
