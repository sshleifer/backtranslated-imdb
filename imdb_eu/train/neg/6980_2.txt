Historically accurate? Hmm ... Maybe ... If you play, and the light falls on the subject. But the basic accuracy is not a rough, short and incoherent plot, cardboard dialogue and inappropriate consequences. The main characters are mere descriptions; Disturbed stereotypes from enigmatic and noble American Americans, who are British and sadistic. A wicked and improbable interpretation of a wonderful period of American history. I want to make my money back.
