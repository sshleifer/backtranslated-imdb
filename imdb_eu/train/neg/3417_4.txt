Wow, the first review of this movie was so negative, but it was not exempt. I will shake this one one. Let's face it! Nobody wants the main character who does not want to watch the movie Chuck Norris. In the end, the fight scene was good, but the rest of the movies stroked. I must ask that the old Chuck can only hang on the best. Has so much slowed down the return of such garbage and hopes to bring his reputation to the whole movie? Chuck is a huge martial artist and, as we have seen in Walker, Texas Ranger, it's a pretty good actress, but it's a combination of these two tricks in movies, which is not. Norris lovers are very friendly. Chuck, follow the main character in your movies, that's not working for you ... Gary
