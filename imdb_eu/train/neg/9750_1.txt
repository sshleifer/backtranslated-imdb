The film, a universal version of Protelco-MLC production, breaks down the theory that breaks the molecular structure of an object, capturing "pure energy" in a cell and then completing it again. "Target space." No explanation Why is it necessary, but Paul Steiner is a teacher Bryant Haliday's pock-mocked actress, "Devil Doll") thinks she wants to offer something, and her collaborators, Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen) live. <br /> <br /> An experiment in front of the Dutch scientist "Lembach" fails because of his sabotage machine. Secretary Sheila (Tracey Crisp) has "projected" herself for revenge. Of course, it sucks and goes out like "roast pig" to allow people to elect. <br /> <br /> With this new power, Cockney gets rid of some idiots, a type of security called Latham (Derrick de Marney) and a head of Laboratory at Blanchard (Norman Woodland). He goes into a pharmaceutical store and steals rubber gloves and a black coat. <br /> <br /> In the end, though he tries to help Hill and Mitchell, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. In general, a wireless wireless message. <br /> <br /> Also, one of the hardest-ever-colored movies you can ever see.
