I have never understood the appeal of this show. The performance is inadequate (with Debra Jo Rupp exceptionally obvious), the plot of most parts is boring and boring. The conversation is weak, the jokes are not painful and trying to get through a half section. Additionally, this show and the relationship between the seventies is very strange, and the style of dressing and the landscape used by the show seems to be only modern scenes with modern scenes in the same comics with modern scenes. Twenty years ago, they imagined a show to win some nostalgic audiences or something like that. Two "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" techniques are used more efficiently, and it's really nice to make a show a tremendous and pathetic excuse for a show.
