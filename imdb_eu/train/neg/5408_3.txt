THIS INNOVATION IS ALL SPOILERS. PLANES OF SUBMISSION OF THIS FILM, IT WOULD NOT WORK ON THIS INNOVATION. <br /> <br /> Today's kids are a TV problem. It's all smart and intelligent. "Wow, it was fun, right?" It was not there. Unfortunately, it seems to be included in children's films too. Here's the 'Reno Flight'. Certainly, in a few years, I have not seen a "Flight of Snow" to be frustrated at some points, but I remember that I had the time to reflect on it. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the story continues with a teacher who will give a Christmas book. Nowadays, the scientist is a famous scientist on the wings habits of some animals. I think it was bullfrogs. In any case, through this book, the teacher / family man learns how to fly like snow flies by snowmen. Apparently, this book was written by a scientist who disappeared in the North Pole hundreds of years. Now, if I were, I would throw the book in the nearest window. Rumors of birds are naturally occurring, but snowflakes are a wonderful and realistic concept. However, the teacher is not for me, which is why he explains why he decides to fly to the south, leaving his wife and child at home, where he disappeared without any idea. Of course, things get worse and before they get acquainted, a reindeer has collapsed in his private plane and was stranded in the North Pole. <br /> <br /> Are you still following this? Good <br /> <br /> His family, of course, is destroyed. I would also, I mean, what a Christmas suck-tacular one. On the other hand, the teacher finds himself in a hidden country in the North Pole, hidden in a hidden country that lives in a tyrannical image only wrath and small and white. Instead of trying to escape immediately, as I would like to do, everyone will welcome your arms open. This civilization, hidden by the evil monsters, opens his arms. Oooo-kayyyy. They feed the story of Santa Claus that is called elves and they make toys all year long without the idea of ​​children. And all this professor accepts. He also admits that Santa Claus disappeared two hundred years ago or disappeared any longer. There is only one problem: they do not want to leave. The world can not know its secret existence. After all, before they found out, McDonalds and Starbucks would be one of the corners of every street. <br /> <br /> Are you still with me? <br /> <br /> Now, Mr. nice guy's family discovery book and assumed that he went to the North Pole. The boy, would not they be ashamed to know that he was walking on foot? The audience do not know, they are jetting ahead to spend the most wonderful winter of Christmas on the planet. In the meantime, the teacher condemns the wrong toss and decides to leave. I can not remember exactly, but I remember Santa Claus holding the gun. Fire fighting takes off when turtles attack him and escapes through Santa's sleigh. Santa, in his eyes with hot and bloody heels, Mr. Whatever, with a wonderful collaboration, flies across his family's airplane. It jumps to the plane and the plane goes back and everyone is always happy. <br /> <br /> In fact, the years have been amazing movies with the name of Christmas, but they appear. They leave this festive charm. And this "charming flight" is totally empty. Anything that insults the mind (well, obviously, is not a movie about children, so that it can flush with them) or is particularly offensive, but the problem is nothing like that. It just feels Christmassy. And in regards to a Christmas movie, this is a great mistake. But, do not I think the flight of mosquitoes in this area is a lie? Why did they need it? Therefore, they are not so duplicated in sedatives, they probably say "Christmas". <br /> <br /> I spend three times. If I had a television movie, I added two other stars to her. We all know what can be bad.
