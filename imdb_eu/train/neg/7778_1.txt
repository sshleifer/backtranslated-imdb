It must be a horrible, horrible and horrible monster movie of all time. This joke is full, it also appeared in the theater. This is the sight of Laku Ness's monsters in rural America. This movie is in common and it is completely forgotten. John Carradine, you are ashamed. The people involved in the confusing stack of the trash can lobothe. Wait! Maybe I give too many credits. I'm sure they were lobotomized before shooting. Otherwise, how does this giant fool figure out this trash can. Do not miss a minute of your life. Do not waste your time sending a review too.
