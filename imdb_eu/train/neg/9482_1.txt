Do not waste your time, let alone pay this dreck piece of rent! I think how it was done. (I do not know why they are at least 10 lines ... I have already shortened this short short, but yes ...) The effect was tremendous, all the lessons needed. The plot was weak, the end ... Feh! I think the only thing that was not sucked into cinematography ... well, maybe the sound would be minimal. It's a good thing if you could have made this movie, even if you make some money, maybe the scriptwriter might be a hope for a REAL idea. So you all goodbye! I think that if the actors are the same and those people are really paid, then you can do it too!
