As others have said, this movie is a drivel charge for masochists. <br /> <br /> We all know what the railway and acid house is to see Scotland is one of the lowest places in the world. But unlike trains and acid houses, humor or realism without realism, such films do not work. And more importantly, the movie without a good script will not work and there is nothing new, inspiring or thinking about the script for this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie won some BAFTA shows. Bad in the British film industry at this time. I thought the Aussie movie industry was very bad, but unfortunately the British industry is even worse. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to be so bad I would not rent rent from the rental section. <Br /> <br /> Make your favor and give it a great movie.
