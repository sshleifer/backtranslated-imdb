It's probably not a sign of salvation. I'll take my time back. wide-skull pleasing face really smiles when the camera shines when the illness has led to the destruction of a well-written script. I was happy (at the end) when I saw all the characters killed or seriously ill at the end, especially the supposed sunset on the side of the party that drinks unclean juice. Eli Roth has spent ten years for a moment, while the tiles are burning in the forest, while others are on top of their beer consumption. In general, I have found the most absurd, even though there is no violence and no nonsense, I am glad to see the disappearance of the cast, in any case, this trip never happened (probably I should be late at TBS). at night).
