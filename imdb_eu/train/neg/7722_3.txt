The action movie was very bad, with Dolph Lundg and Brandon Lee playing in a role that never seems to ever be. The best action is the average, it's a bit of a nuisance and it's a dual Tia Carrera body! <br /> <br /> The company is a compulsory former police lie in a large case in a new case, the author tries to make at least one formula with Lundg's eastern police officers and Lee gives it. The development of modern cities but of zero characters is not nearly comical, but the contribution of Lundgren's warriors is to be seen as a big showdown. The sequences of actions are numbers and Lee (The Crow would do great) would never give way to show a shine of martial arts shine. But thanks to his famous background, he had to have a lot of pressure and served much better when he did not have to live with his father, when he was very different from Crow's role and showed only what he could be. If not his tragic and premature death. <br /> <br /> If your hardcore Lundg fan or 80's poor style do not avoid taking action movies (thought Cobra, etc.). <br /> <br /> Poor 3/10
