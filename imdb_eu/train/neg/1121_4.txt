In the first minutes of this Dutch thriller, Krabbe is a gay alcoholian writer who sneaks in damaged clothes, kills his common roommate, tries to steal a magazine in a news story, and is looking for a young man. train station And this unpretentious movie is the protagonist of this absurdity (except Krabbe, at least one scene too), but it does not go anywhere. The basic argument is very simple, but it is dragged almost two hours before it reaches a nonsensical conclusion. Verhoeven has a pleasant vision, but includes scenes of wild hallucinations, evident symbolism and free no-brainstorming scenes.
