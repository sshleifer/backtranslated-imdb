A dark and comical serendipity on cosmetics vendor, closely linked to Elvis Presley, entering the Elvis invasion of the sea and talking in the conventions of Nevada ... and accidentally killed each one by a small mistake. Kim Basinger, still an attractive actress with great merit, likes to choose the best films he likes to play, but this horrible script (Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) is not humorous. Stereotypes and low-ball gags are not the elements of classical comedy, but they also have a shameless and shameless level, the image is rough and nasty. If you look at it, you can see how much Basinger's estrangedness is behind the wheel of your Cadillac rose, your hands always in the same position and look like a face. Fortunately, he and Elvis are well paid. STARS NO ****
