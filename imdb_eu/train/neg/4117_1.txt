After two days of seeing this thing, I'm still agonized when I saw HAVING. It's so bad, you should ask someone how to write this gut, and let loose so much for the crowd. Theatrical performance, the most important man sleeping and Alison Eastwood is shy. The actions are representative of the production of low-budget films. This means that it is bad. On the plot? At 6 years old, you should write this movie. Easier, more idealistic and just.
