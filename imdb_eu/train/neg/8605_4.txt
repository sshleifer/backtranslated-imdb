At the beginning of the 80s, it is interesting for the gore festival, which has some nasty slugs with human blood taste. If you can overcome everything ridiculous, you can enjoy it. The play is horrible and it's just a plot to get the movie together from slug turpentine attacks, but the movie is not a waste of time. The special effects are pretty good and they make good results. He reminded me about Blob's rematch, which surely all came. After all, without a doubt, your time would be an hour and a half worse, but I would not like to see this movie unless you have a strong stomach and if you like these things.
