I hate that this film has no creative entry. I know they're looking for realism, but to be honest I do not want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see everyday life, I will live. Tell us an interesting story and we will talk about it. I can face low production costs, I get low production costs of hell, but at least I work on some good ideas. Managing a camera camera is just about walking a bit, but, of course, I have to digest it because it makes a lot more realistic. Hitchcock essentially tells the drama of a bit of life cut. I can not think that this is not a drama, or a long film. We see Rosetta walking somewhere, working at a Rosetta bakery, eating Rosetta waffles, wearing Rosetta bags away, when Rosetta came back home, Rosetta walked somewhere ... she's just entertaining. There is not a deep meaning either. I was bored in this movie, I started looking for some thoughts on life, but it was just realism, the highest quality of business. I suppose I suppose that I love it, but there is nothing.
