Everything in this movie is bad, story, performance, effects but fun, fun, fun !! Scott Valentine, an uniform army, is ten in size too large, so hard on his face he is trying to crack the head of a special ops team! 'Terrorists' are terrifying and realistic as '' predators ''; That is, so fake and bad, try everything you need to laugh. The giant T-REX was aboard, and then fell somewhat lower, and you see the perfect metal end of the stick. If it's a bad movie, it's a golden pot, it's pretty bad!
