Koen Wouters is a Flemish singer and presenter. In the early nineties he also tried movies. But this unbelievable piece of rubbish ended his academic career definitively. He also finished the acting career of Nada van Nie, a television presenter and programmer. I really saw the theater (almost empty) in the theater because it was a fan of Koen Wouters (Clouseau). So I regret spending money. It seems cheap, the story is awful and in a bad way. Many people think it's bad that it's fun. I'm not one of them. I have not lost any time and money.
