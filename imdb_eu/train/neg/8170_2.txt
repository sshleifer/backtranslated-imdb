A friend and I chose some crappest horror films for a video game for a long time entertainment. For some reason, I ended up buying (probably v. Cheap). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the synthesizer is cheap and classical in its genres. There are also some very entertaining scenes. Among them, a man is attacking a scene that is attacking and with a lot of objects, he laughed at that time (retrospect does not seem so funny, but you will not go). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> However, it's probably worth the clock if you like movies like "Chopping Mall". Yes, I've seen that too.
