I'm wondering what this movie should do with the movie "Bachelor Party" in 1984, along with Tom Hanks. Is the movie an official sequel? It's missing every movie series and, of course, it's not getting better. <br /> <br /> For a comedy, this movie is not good or fun. The character is mainly based on its stereotypical assessments; Then the movie shows good moments, original and fun. <br /> <br /> Obviously, it's a little storyline and a nude movie banner. In the end, things will continue to wait. The main line of art is somewhere, but this is not so original and it is so bad in the film, even if it feels like it does not exist. I also think of a moral message and story somewhere, but this is just as dramatic as it is in the movie that it does not do well. <br /> <br /> It's basically a teenage comedy. sex jokes and nudity, without the protagonists of adolescents, which makes the story even more dull and more enjoyable. The film makes jokes wrong, which are not lost for any type of film. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to see all this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
