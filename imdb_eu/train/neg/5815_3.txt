I really expected the movie based on a preview and a preview I expected, but when I saw it I was very disappointed. Slum is an unknown film that Todd Solondz has with Todd's humorous, alarming family-life. The story is dragged down and each scene is faster. I may not miss this point, but I'm glad I'm a man as an example of this growing experience of each girl's movie.
