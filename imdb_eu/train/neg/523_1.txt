It's amazing for me for today's entertainment. Maybe I'm a 50-year-old dinosaur and I'm confused with today's movie genres, and it's apparently happening in this movie, because it loves a lot of people. It seemed bad and ordinary. I do not say that about the many movies in my life, but this bill adapts. The humor is sophomoric and raw. I am not a politically correct person, as well as gay jokes, not just funny but totally offensive (I'm not gay). The protagonist of the movie is not a nice, pathetic person. When the movie was over, I heard a lot of people as they watched how they looked after money.
