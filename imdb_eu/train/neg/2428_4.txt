Audiences will remember the most painful mental illness that the film has given, the brilliant camera, the bad, the cameraman and the fast and confusing mix. I am not doing any of these stylistic devices, but there were not too many ways in which movies like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh do. I think that the crash and cave breaks that helped me in all the flights and flights in Mexico, the story is quite slow and you think it was very predictable. The biggest disappointment is knowing how to end up knowingly how it ends. It is impossible for a film to be violent, inadequate, and morally damaged, that the story has been told so much with depth and character development. This is another aspect of the film. If I want to see more than one action movie, I do not need any justification, but this movie has justified justifying the murder of the character of Denzel Washington and has done it wrong with unbelievable performances. In the first half hour or so, nothing happens, archiving silent and clicking portraits and when the machine of action is rounded, it cuts so quickly without knowing what happens. So, the movie is not at an incredible drama / thriller level, nor action action as a movie level. Of course, the movie is not as bad as some of the super-produced supercomputers in recent years, but I can not understand why they're so cool and so cool. It is too long for a video clip and contains little substance in the movie.
