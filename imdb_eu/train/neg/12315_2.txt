OK, I'm not an American, but in my low-minded Scottish, Steve Martin has never been, and it's never a fun man when our elders point to the south. The silent Phil Silvers was a fun man from Bil, definitely the best writers and directors, and all the other talented characters in the series, who have helped the community and fun of the American comedies comfortably. In my opinion, anyone who tries to repeat the character of Phil Silvers is not for me either. In order to compose things, the exercise of being Peter Seller, Clouseau Inspector Martin, was repeated, he said, an abortive essay that, in my opinion, would lead to untruthful careers. Some of your helpers say 'Steve Martin puts his stamp on the character', I would say 'Balderdash', his portraits will be forgotten among the generations that are going to be Silvers and Sellars
