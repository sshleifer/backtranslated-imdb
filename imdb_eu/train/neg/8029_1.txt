It was bought by my friend (very cheap) and I decided to give her a birthday gift. I thought I never saw it, because I knew that it was a joke and I think the DVD cover was pathetic, but then my friends and I got bored and saw it. from beginning to end! I know a great achievement, but it's really a masterpiece. It's difficult to describe. You would see, when people are capable of being creative and intelligent, it is a real lesson, and they are not really. "Operation" is an underworld (sometimes you can see laughing at "main lady", it's definitely the worst). The "story" is stupid, it is summed up and it really sucks everything in this movie. Please pay special attention to the "sheriff". They are adults, and therefore they have no excuse. it's too bad. they could be ridiculous at any time. look, haha
