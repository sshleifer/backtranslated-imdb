This is the worst part I have ever seen in my life. It was hardly sensible. It was not terrifying (you're not afraid as scared and screaming?) When all the other film makers agreed with me, when they shouted "SHITE" when they cast their credits. <br /> <br /> Make a list of the worst film ever made: <br /> <br /> 1. Return 2. Wardrobe. 3. Silently Cabin fever was equally absent, but the return list was over. It's worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever
