The soul of an ancient mummy is taken to one of his followers to punish all those who participate in the demarcation of his tomb. The transfer of the soul makes the young man a tremendous rhythm, as far as mummy. One by one, the blood is poured into those who pierce. <br /> <br /> In order to be as short as possible, the curse of Pharaoh is quite empty. While the film presents original and good ideas (those that absorb mummy blood, soul transfers, make-up, interesting effects, etc. Scene ...) and some atmospheric moments, direction and rhythm are the definition of plodding. To make things even worse, the first 66 minutes of the film are relatively short run-ups that are not more than 15 fills. I usually shoot slim mummy movies, but I can also try the curse of Pharaoh for my patients. The function helps very little. With just one exception (Ziva Rodann is the only one who can want more mysterious characters); Cast is as dull as the script. In the end, I do not know what the idea was to put on a seemingly civilian pajama apparitionist, but a ridiculous and ridiculous look of a creature that needed to teach fear. <br /> <br> </ p> <p> Despite the negative comments on the curse of Pharaoh, I will score 4/10. It's not a good score, but I'm generous with all the problems with the movie.
