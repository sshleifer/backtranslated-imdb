Greenthumb Grace is not allowed after her husband's death, she grows ganja and has to pay bills. It's wonderful and Brenda Blethyn is not trusted, but the material is sitcom-thin. Actually, it's a scene, Grace can ask his young gardener "Give me one" and he thinks he is asking for sex and that all goes wrong. Yes, it is a sense of humor, so a wet man would get bored. It does not seem to save grace: what's stunning cinematic and elegant rhythms bring Ryan's daughter's remembrance to remind us of the unbelievable plays in any episode of Old Roadshow. It accelerates from the first hour, but then it comes out with great care. Klimaxa has never seen such unforeseen Deux ex Machina's unforeseen hits.
