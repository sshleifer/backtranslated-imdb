At first I believed that they had made a television movie, it was not bad at first. But after a few minutes he was silent, I noticed that there was at least one comic value in top-top stunts and c-movie activations. This movie would get 1 when my wife and I had not laughed so hard, seeing that it was amazing to us, the actress could save her face. Big Hit's spy was just like a fun version (I laughed at the Big Hit DVD when I actually bought it) it was even worse with the performance. We felt ill, that Nick was going to marry and marry Jim, hugs and five highs. Some rum and coke will definitely be easier.
