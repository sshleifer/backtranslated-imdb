I thought this was a very intense and irrelevant version of the famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good at their roles, giving their personality identity; but all things were forced and mechanically felt. <br /> <br /> In the beginning it could be much more; maybe starting with a shoot-out, and then go back to see how gestures get or how it happened. And I felt every scene in a common way, and I felt it signaled, like a very bad telenab. <br /> <br /> I was really waiting for this movie, and I expected much better. The only thing that one can say about it is that Mick Jagger is playing, but not much.
