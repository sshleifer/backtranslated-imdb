This show is incredible in that. . . what he indicates and focuses on. . . Words can not describe ET insane. They will report anything. When a celebrity is closely related to the story, ET will report this. If he has a puppy on Tom Cruise's yard, they will report it. If a celebrity dies . . They will talk about them in a few weeks, envy that celebrates people. If the celebrity puts it in trial. . . ET will inform MONTHS at the end. This show does not end, and it's not a time period to determine how long a story is going to be. Even if the reports are legitimized? Reports are very annoying, they end up in harsh voice stalking and unnecessary steps to convey a meaningful significance. I can not see this conception without questioning the existence of humanity. ET is a great reason to avoid last night's entertainment in general. I'm sorry that the IMDb only allows a star rating and not just zero or even negative. This show is worth 10 stars.
