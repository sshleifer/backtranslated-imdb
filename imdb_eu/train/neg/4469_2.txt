When I first stopped playing this game, I like to stop playing and then enjoy it. Congratulations FIRST and LAST Tomb Raider I'll make you play it again. <br /> <br /> Argument: I'm writing that word, it made me laugh. There is not one. There is no character development too. In the end we'll take care of the little heroine who can take care of herself, but she does not signify it, but unfortunately she wears it like a slut and her breast is very large. You have been attracted by sexist boys. However, everything in the grave will go to the tomb after the tomb to carry out things. Why does this not know? I have subtitles and t.v. I can not understand the bad stuff as well as I can. His development (or not) for him, his two friends and * criminals * were laughable. Additionally, the levels you need to go through are not about the next thing you would like to give advice and it will literally be boring in the tombs of hell, trying to guess what HOURS is. he was supposed to do it. There is a course (one of them), especially with the bike (think it is not fun) LEARN ABOUT that point without saving. This means that if you hit other motorcyclists and vans or hit a tree, you hit it. A long walk when you start OVER. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: You know that the levels that allow you are very long, basically save no dots, they do not have the story, they did not develop the character, you did not give a variety of games, the greater part of the music is longer in the blood of the ear, and do not give advice to the player. Instead of entering the line that does not exist in a place. <br /> <br /> Extreme F * ck: as a bang idea. Sounds F * ck two: I agree. Who needs the development of characters, plots or game play. <br /> <br /> Todd: Sorry, sir, but these ideas seem to be a very unbalanced player. <br /> <br> /> Boss Stupid F * ck: Close Todd. You disappear <br /> <br /> Game play: shoot everything that fights. Clearly, SHOOTING, SHOTING or SHOOTING can be shot again. Throwing, jumping and kicking does not eliminate, after all, that everything goes away. BORING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: introduction music is very beautiful. I love listening. The music of the game is overwhelming to break your ears. <br /> <br /> Acknowledgments: As I thought this game was done in 2006, I wanted to get the images out. I was really upset, but definitely not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This game is plots without any confusion of the character development, with some young women, who are slightly unmarious (THANKFULLY), who go through boring tombs with some young women. This is a boring reason (I can not say so) with images without shooting behavior. CLICK HERE FOR THEM! !!!!!!!! That is to say, it is getting two stars to be a woman with no distress girls (in any case it may be scarce) and beautiful in music.
