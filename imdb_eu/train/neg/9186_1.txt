Do you know the feeling of truthfulness that you know, when you watch a film that causes serious cinema thoughts and does not fail? When can not you help make me laugh out of the huge splay that your screen wraps into? The "House of the Dead" is also struggling to achieve this low level of cinema. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end that the "Homes of the Dead" has been discovered, the cat has set a pretty business in front of you while you sleep. At first, it is clear that female actors were thrown out of their hidden size (which is exploited by insolence), because the male "hard-ass" attitude was hard. Honestly, I did not care about the characters at any moment of the film and I really found it in their desire to pay for a good hour of torture. Uwe Boll thought he would give two game hours as a movie. At least then, will we better play it? However, it is not a fault for actors, because it is a challenge to create a convincing film before the screenplay of this movie. Without a doubt, it is the worst part of the movie and it really has the following lines: "These are zombies, simple and simple" and "No, we must not go! It's evil!". <br /> <br /> We all know that zombie movies will never be a special thought or even a lot of meaning. At best, there are two harmful actions, blood and wardrobe. The trash, yes, but a fun trash. There is no type of landfill coming out of your bag of baggage, when you are transporting it through the room, and removing your shoes from milk cloths and bananas on bad skirts. According to the IMDb, the "House of the Dead" received bad opinions that Danish films did not buy. Only if they had the same privilege, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Last score: 1/10.
