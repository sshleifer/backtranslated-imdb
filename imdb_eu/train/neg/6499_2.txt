Sir Anthony draws from natural genres of the genres Born Born Killers, U Turn and the like, in editing, or perhaps Nixon's vision was an inspiration source. Say what you want about David Lynch, but at least it's a madman method. <br /> <br /> He says the quote for making this movie as a joke. It's not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
