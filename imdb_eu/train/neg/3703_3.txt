I did not expect much from this movie, but boy-o-boy, I did not expect the movie to be a bad thing. Chris Rock does not show a good show here, you can not feel its real nature, I think the movie would be a better drama or romantic scene that would have a smaller part of the movie and it was more / better. Film filmmakers were like having a bad hangover. "Making" is not a single smile. This movie is very bad! I gave him ten out of three, who had little smiles, but I never laughed!
