I have seen some of the worst directions. The approach can be very powerful, but when each scene happens, it loses all the impact. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott has beautiful scenery in Mexico, the corners, the beautiful countryside that lives in Anthony Quinn and the ways to take revenge with Costner. Unfortunately, we take quick look at these places to capture a huge and giant camera head. The transitional scenes that Costner took to travel throughout Mexico were rapidly cut. <br /> <br /> The score is too dramatic and intrusive, by any emotion that we feel. The story itself was much better handled. Among other things, too many people will appear everywhere to help with Costner. It's just a bad writing. <br /> <br /> Thriller is a story, but many have taken on the same premise and have done great things with it. Costner's No Way Out was a similar story, but the movie was much better. <br /> <br /> The end was completely antagonistic and underwent a melodramatic score for the film. This movie will never be wonderful, but if we see more of Mexico and lesser heads, maybe this movie can be invisible.
