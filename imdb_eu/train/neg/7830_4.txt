Nightmares and Dreamscapes have so far been flawless and depressing. The first segment targeted by Brian Henson might bring innovative stories or real fears, but at least well-aimed, suspicious and visually interesting, with strong William Hurt's authors and special effects that were very impressive. minimum series one. <br /> <br /> However, the second story in the series was horrible and not in a good way. The script is a bad thing, acting out of the dark and unlikely acting of the protagonists to move the plot and keep the characters constantly striving for unnecessary explanations. The play is excessive and convincing, and in the second, I felt the first story of a cold killer. The director has used a million tricks to make this narrative awesome, but with amateur dramaturgy and writing, the final result seems to be a school project for classmates, based on the camera itself and on the plot. or tension. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series continues, I will not release it. I hope William H. Macy's fragmentary, and I expect director and scriptwriter in his segment. For now, quality is too much to announce in a way.
