Oh Geez ... I want to see so many movies there ... I've been linked to my nephew this weekend, and he wanted to ... Yes ... <br /> <br /> I used to see this show at university ... I was not there Think about it, it was fun and a bit entertaining. The show had good hearts and the characters were boys; No one ever killed or got badly taken ... the cartoon was alive. Cut to 2005 ... What happened? This is not working. As others have said, there is simply no cohesion story and curious performances ... almost annoying, untruthful, loyal to original characters ... The whole thing is like a TV series Mad TV and it lasts for 100 minutes. ! It was one of those times I was watching a movie. What did they think? I can say better, to market the product for toys ... And I can say all that it will kill death fast. The original Hazzard Dukes resembles the Masterpiece Theater ... <br /> <br /> Gilligan's Island ... Good Luck!
