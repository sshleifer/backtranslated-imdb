Funny concept, but poorly executed. Except for good makeup effects, it's not really much. There are obvious problems; For example, taking weeks and weeks to look like normal fats, the main character seems to go through normal size and sluggish deaths ... and once he's dead, he's still going to be quite dead. It seems like a long time. In any case, the film has much worse problems: cinematography is a low budget, a television show quality and, above all, it is beautifully beautiful around it. Robert John Burke always seems to be looking for something similar to Charlton Heston's fraud and is literally painful ... Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are just two things that are scary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the gypsy's gangs are completely boring to get upset. It is also a good end to endings. If you are not avoiding being a Royal Phile, or with Simply Fat Tony, you will be psyched with the idea of ​​the voice of the gypsy camp.
