This movie was one of the biggest films ever made, and he had everything he could do to make a great movie. An incredible operation, wonderful special effects ... I have to wait for a good movie to wait. Well, this was not one of them. <br /> <br /> What I want to know is what would be the head of the bones because it seemed 10 of this movie. When I cast my vote there were 206 out there, he knows what's wrong with them. As with any other vote, 8 or 9 was too high, but 10? Come on, what has this movie done to give a good 10 sooooo? I know that Jean Claude Van Damme is the 206 most important actress.
