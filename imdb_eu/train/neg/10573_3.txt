I went through this movie to become a contact point at my school. As it seems, there was nothing fascinating and nothing new. Although she tries to be an original, her father was looking at her teenager, because her mother did not show the problems she should follow. He had an interesting side, but he did not live according to his origin, because this film was another original. His main character is like all the likes of this one, and he feels he feels he feels he feels he feels more than he expects and feels too much when he is at home. then we have a father who has always disappeared. After all, we all have parents who want everybody and expects all that they do. As I say about the story, it was interesting, but it was not well-known for the whole cast and in the absence of good writing or stories. He begins to learn everything about the little girl who starts studying, they meet, they have sex and then there is a small child. Perhaps if they had a better handwriting and they improved the performance, I got more serious emotions than Leatherface and her chimp than any of the actors in this movie, which is pretty bad as Leatherface. The movies are empty and they play a terrible role. I saw only one interesting pregnancy for teens I have seen until now. Until now, the comic aspect of this serious situation has been entertaining, still giving the same message. As I said, the majority of these films centered on teenage mothers, but this did not choose to focus on the father's dramas, but once again the originality is not saved. I really hope someone decides to make this movie better or make a better writer, or to make a similar movie, that is, the potential was lost.
