The sadest thing about "Homage" is that almost all the singers (including Nick Cave, including very talented singers) who are almost familiar, whose intensity has lost all the dangling points, has delivered almost all his poems, Cohen conveys all of his poetry, irony, humanity, laughter and tears. <br /> <br /> To see some of these singers, they make unbalanced sufferings, to start screaming at the pathetic screams, "I'm a singer!", it's a real pain. You will feel very much listening to some awesome versions of some simple songs like Lennon's "Imaginei". Nothing, at all, is nothing closer to the simplicity and correctness of the original. If there is a kind of art that does not require decorations, it's the art of Cohen. The embellishments released on the street appear like sex sales flavors. <br /> <br /> In this tribute to Cohen, I suffered and suffered great tributes and awesome reinterpretations. the irony of the master and, in fact, some of these singers said that they were included in some talented asylum shows. Cohen pays homage to her songs, really, not vice versa: maybe they could be friends or daughters, they could be very tender and kind to get presents. Very bad, he was not with the family. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The U2, they all have a statement that appears to be bored by the bored children when they visit their poor grandfather. <br /> <br /> The sad, really and sad drama, if you really love it like Cohen.
