I was excited about this movie, when I previewed the previews. Usually I see a preview that's good and I bought the movie completely. He told me something ... you know you first see. I'm happy. Keira Knightley gave me all the future movies with this role. 2. I saw it when I ran out of the movie Pirates. I only saw Domino Harvey and I hated him most. I think that this must be done to cut hair and Dominion. <br /> <br /> Dune? Who is Domino Harvey? I still do not know or care. I do not know who was in real life or who was in this movie. I do not like his character, and even if Keira did not want to get a naked movie. No doubt the direction was missing. The writing was intricate and superficial. The edition was horrible. I do not like the style so too much. There's a place. MTV style jewelry, colorful edition (if the official name is not sure) Fight Club; from the top of the head. Even though the style of editing similar to the hostile state was similar. It was used as a taste and no crunch was used. I mean the same guy who runs Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott please give me my time back. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are many people who love this movie. I think it's a fair assessment of the idea that you totally love or totally hate this movie. True, I hate it.
