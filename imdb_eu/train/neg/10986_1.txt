When I saw that Mary Louise Parker was associated with this epic novel, I saw that the movie was turned on. I thought it was a fan of the book, Tony, Roz or Charis, but I was even more fascinated to see how this novelty, almost psychological (but not psychological), would turn out to be such a novel. There was a movie available to those who read the novel, which was at least as pleasing to those. The book is a complex reflection of society, women and life, and I was interested in the different narratives that make up the story they used. He was really a crime of what he did. <br /> <br /> An error and a confusing problem is: why Oxygen, a network that proclaims women, has a stunning book about a complex, fascinating and horrible woman. Are they and can be, and 3 women's protagonists change to an ancient dumb mute without the real reason involved in the story? It seems that anyone who has arranged it has easily taken this guy by asking about Roz, Tony and Charis asking why Zenia was doing it, and they did it through a large part of the book. By doing this, they confused the story and cut off all the great characters that were there, the viewers had no credibility. The women in the film are not characters, they are characters. <br /> <br /> Zenia's book makes her fake deaths, but the book mentions that point, because the film has a waste of 30-45. There are a few minutes for police to use at no different moment. This complex book tried to become part of Law and Order or CSI. <br /> <br /> Mary Louise Parker played Zenia, which is wrong. Zenia Catherine Zeta-Jones, Angelina Jolie, or maybe Scarlett Johnasson is a type. Men can not worship a woman, and women are interested and threatened by a woman, but "keep your enemies closer" in a way. And after approaching, it seems totally authentic and worth the trust, despite your better opinion. She loses what she also won: it's still beautiful, still rich, and there are always people who do not know their game yet. <br /> <br /> The Zenia film was not taken by Charis (first of all, Charis Dodger was using Charis) ... but he took it to August and became his tutor (and apparently returned to stop his lesbian lover in the cafe it's a kiss). And Zenia chicken did kill before August, but it did not make any sense what was being built. Anyone who wrote the script was able to meet what we read, but I think that I did not read the book, I would be confused with the whole movie, if I continued. all. <br /> <br /> And Roz's husband died before Zenia's photograph (it was rare for Zeniak Rozen's business and his life in the house, which is why Roz hated him so much) and he and Zenia conspired to kill Roz's husband for years and years And according to Tony and West they were permanently ... even in the Zenia and West (in the book) they painted the black place at that party and that Tony was very similar (and evil, hateful). Because all people respected their minds and were popular. Tony's character was so bad in this movie ... it seemed like a psycho psyche, and like a mind behind the conception he fell into the book as an evil and kind teacher. Films, basically, smart women are evil, beautiful women are evil, strong women are evil, and yoga teachers are rock. <br /> <br /> Basically, Zenia was not necessarily as terrifying as the book, and eventually three women persuaded her to be the police (that is, in the research, she is in love with Zenia and she is in love with her). Barbados or something ridiculous, of course, by Zenia.) To hide the body of the genius (they stayed where they stayed at the hotel, but the movie means that one of these three women pushed the balcony or conspirated from each other, what to do ...) and then Zenia also took all the money from Roze in the process. At the end of the film, I only focused half of the ads that banned the b / c so far that it could and should have been in space. <br /> <br /> If you do not confuse the movie breakdown, then maybe you'd like to read the book and watch it, and I'm only confused by the movie. It was horrible. I have a pretty role in making a movie from that book, but if you want to take this task, you should determine what is not necessary in the book, as well as creating some amazing daughters to make our Alicia marvelous. . <br /> <br /> Is not there any fluffier book that makes oxygen a decent television movie and half-less?
