I have a slow and enjoyable drama. Christmas in August, Chungking Express, Virgil Stripped Bare Graduates, The Way Home, A Small Town, Hana Two, Drink Man Man, Dolls, In the Mood Love and Spring Summer Fall Winter Spring are nice movies. ?? to name a few. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is a subset of genres of movies while trying to stroll along with the best movies because they do not have any interest. I call movies IAN. "Unknown artistic nonsense". Tsai Ming-liang is the king of this subgenus and Vive L'Amour is his "masterpiece". In fact, this is the "art" shape under the rubbish-infected skin creams. People walk through their apartment, drink water and go on, but waiting for their smartphone to hang up, hang up ads, mix their papers together, go to the bathroom, eat, push, watch mosquitoes, etc. I'm not saying jokingly, to say that it is an exact summary of the whole movie, that is, the main nursery home without art housekeeping. There are no plots, no stories, interesting or relevant events, emotions, meaningful conversations and most important. no drama <br /> <br /> The most memorable scene two people "knock" on a bed, under a mattress someone masturbates? ironic, also, completely taste and free. There is hardly any relationship between the characters on the bed. Tsai apparently did not want anything to be related to other people who are not real people who like "bang" about the audience. He's as dimensional and interesting as a person under the bed. Drinking water, drinking with melody and stinging his head. This is the idea of ​​Tsai "character development". It's an "animator" that is really straightforward. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < First, the main actress runs through the end of the park in 285 seconds in a row, to show a terrific cry? without any reason? another 356 seconds later. Then the movie ends. No point No entertainment. Only, visible, torture. <br /> <br /> The effort to tackle the dead horse. The theme under solitude is so badly managed that the true feeling of this movie is boredom. In fact, Kiyoshi Kurosawak offers a much better exhibition on Kairus's horror film. And what guess? He's really interested! This movie was as slow as it was in January, but the way in which the concept of bacteria is better known is how to deal with waste known as Vive L'Amour. Cairo is an excellent example. <br /> <br /> Film enthusiast Tsai Ming-liang can thank the director for this film because it has proved an excellent proof of art home cinema as a B-like. television horror movies Art-house snobs have lost the foundation of self-righteousness officially. The quality of your precious genres is now Army of Darkness and ??? gasp! ?? Showgirls How do you like apple?
