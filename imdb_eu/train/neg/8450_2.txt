What is ITV Drama? First of all, it's just the worst television drama I've ever seen in "Gemma Loss", and now "Perfect Parents" are completely shameful from the beginning to the end. Those who are responsible for running this Drivel should receive P45 with special delivery. <br /> <br /> In most drama / thriller, it is necessary to develop a plot line for a particular level of belief, but they moved to a new level of "Perfect Parents", at the end of this nonsense I interrupted so much the "magical mushrooms" trucks When I felt that I had the power to load, as the scriptwriter decided to try and create. Drama, religion, education, greed, fear, murder, some issues that were serious, was the only problem as Eric Morecambe said in his piano, "I'm good. , just ordered by compulsory ". In the case of the Next Script, we recommend reading some script-reading books for "Dummies For Script writing". <br /> <br /> The act of acting is ridiculous and ridiculous because of lack of voltage and direction. But I suggest that all agents involved in this dramatic dramatics give instructions to their agents that the Postman will have to deliver a book of the ITV drama series the next time.
