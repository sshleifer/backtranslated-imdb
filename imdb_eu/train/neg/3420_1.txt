I watched this movie for the first time twelve hours after Saturday afternoon. It's really good for this time. I've never ever seen a movie that was planned and embodied with stereotypes. If you want to see an exciting action movie, do not miss the half-heart you want to live in. However, if you want a good laugh, check it out! I also bought a 3DVD collection from Chuck Norris on Saturday night. This remarkable scene was copied from the Discovery documentary or the former US Army television. Also, I was surprised to find no real effort in the real look of the production. As I recall, Afghanistan does not approach any sea, and yet with just one click Deke terrorizes the sand-castle with his jet pack and removes it from a submarine (probably Discovery). Later in the film, Deke terrorizes the terrorist Islam against the wall. You can see slow motion in the scene in the air by running stuntman twisted long hair against the wall. Gotta love I recommend you to watch with some friends and with good beer, then you will understand why I had enough money to spend the â‚¬ 6.99 euro.
