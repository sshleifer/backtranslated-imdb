The words fail me. <br /> <br /> And that's not unusual. <br /> <br /> It is possible that B-movie might be a fascinating and fun science-fiction movie, but unfortunately it was not. In the field of theater, they have fought so glittering with so many manuals the starvation of a script. I only accept comments from the previous review - clear the bathroom. In fact, do nothing except seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> Positive: Lucy Beeman's nose. Negative reasons: everything else. <br /> <br /> Top line: "This is not going anywhere" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If all plastic surgeons meet that fate.
