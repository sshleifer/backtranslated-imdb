First of all, I saw this movie at 7 years when I went to Christian Scholl. There was no need to say no. It was terrifying, but because of the content ... I was 7 years old. However, cinematography was pretty bad and acting was cheesy. It's very bad because it was just 7 years old and I remember that. The only thing he still hates is that incredible song we'd like "all of us ready", "chorus" ... when it's over when you're done. I would not propose this. I am probably from nostalgic reasons. Also, I am sure that this remake is much better. The best part of this movie, however, should be everyone's "disappearance"; empty empty cars, cut grasses ... quite fun.
