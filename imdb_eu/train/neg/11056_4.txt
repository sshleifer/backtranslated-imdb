I was so disappointed in this movie. I do not know what is about the real story, so I was playing at the movie movie and educating me about a small part of history. With a real story and a great actor, it seemed a safe combination with that powerful story. Well, the scripts failed somewhere. It was so scattered - is it a movie about her childhood? his love? his own disability? the ability to speak? Does his passion for the disabled? I'm sure there is a way to get all these things into a good story, but this is not a movie. Because of my disabilities, but because of their nature, I saw the characters that were not cold. Other small climbing: 1. heavy soundtrack. It's the seventies - we're already there! 2. If there is a huge public speaker, why did not we here consider more than one treatment here?
