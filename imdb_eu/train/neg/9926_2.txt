I saw the 30th anniversary edition of Blazing Saddles, one of my favorites! Black Bart television stun pilots. It was not in the plot and the performance was not good. It was an attempt to succeed Blazing Saddles and made some TV shows that had the chance to take on big movies. For so many years, TV shows that noises were taken on television on television, it is unthinkable to think about throwing a show on TV "N". On the other hand, I've seen a lot of familiar faces !!! There were actors in the years that I considered other shows. I wrote all the names and had to do some searches. That was fun. I argued with my mother that Steve Landesberg was Barney Miller or Mash. I won! :)
