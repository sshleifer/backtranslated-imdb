Yikes made the movie. The characters were weak; This could not be bad, Christoper Walken, oops. He had to do this because he was bored and had money. The characters should be Irish, but no one was an Irish accent. I'm looking forward to something nice about this, I can not do a good job with Walken's wooden character. Find something to read or watch the discovery, never watch this movie.
