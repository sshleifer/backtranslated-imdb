Never throw models and Playboy bunnies in your movies! Dorothy Stratten's "Star 80" Bob Fosse's "Star 80", obsessed with SISTERIO's obsession with murdering her life, is much more interesting than Dorothy himself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is not an actor ... I expected to see some loss of masterpiece by Orson Welles, but Audrey Hepburn got jeans and goddesses of "poodlesque" ... Very disappointing ... "Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Show "I saw them again and again. I could barely sit down once. This movie was not released because Mrs. Stratten is a brouhaha about serious death; I think the real reason was so bad!
