At the age of five, Michael sees his mother dying as "Highwayman" kills his mother. "Growing 20 years later," Mike (Gordon Currie, PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) invites seven of his friends to his lone grandparents at a Halloween costume party to "dread their fears." Morty, a wooden sized doll that keeps the wooden buckthorn in the attic, owns the dead spirit and kills phobias. The characters are thrown from a window and become stuck in toilet clothes, etc. Morty goes into a father and a tree, they walk around and are stupid. After finding a girl cut into a cardboard box, the characters stay home, cheer up, joke and have sex. <br /> <br /> Morty is a good design and Betsy Palmer (Mrs. Voorhees Original Friday 13TH) is surprisingly pleasing to her grandmother, but this is even more nonsensical and more confusing than the original and horror fears, bad performances, dead brain characters Repeats repetitions and distorted camera work. In addition, the two first minor minorities (Indians and Middle Blacks) die. Blah!
