I know some movies (I mean: European films), they are very bad films, some great "movie critics" considered because they are not American. I noticed the 8.1 IMDB score for this movie and I noticed that it was being selected at several festivals. Do not let this fool you! Those of you who like movies like those of you, except one of those people who like you, and what they call fine art, skip! The film picks up on a fun scene after the other (an Italian similarity has come to my mind, the PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE is terrific (I prefer the sea's sound)). The problem of these films is not only boring, but also as some films that have surprisingly surprised others that they act as a camp. I mean, apparently, the performance is horrible (I mean: soap opera level), the story is not surprising (that is, it has been several times over, linking a lot of stories: SHORT CUTS, MAGNOLIA, HEART JOLKURA, only much better), it is not a realistic character (on the way, true freak-watching, who feels like a daisy-like zombie), and so on. <br /> <br /> If it were not enough, the movie was 135 min. (tell it!) It's long, and in the end the director opens his sentimental cans. He made the movie of theatrical and scenes of dialogue and dramas and the public before the preview laughed so much incompetence, well ... This is an insolence film and it receives high scores in the "other" language. , in this case, Spanish. The strange world we live ... 3/10
