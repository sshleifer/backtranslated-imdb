Words can not be described as the fact that this movie is terribly terrifying. "It is so bad that I want to be good," but I do not want to. It's very dull, boring, and boring. It was so bad that I could not even laugh. <br /> <br /> In front of other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the most important movie. The only person who is less charismatic is the director of Brett Kelly, that is, as a true expression, casts him as the head of a man. Both are inbreeds, sisters and sisters. <br /> <br /> Sherry Thurig is a galaxy instructor. Anne-Marie - appealing. This girl is tall and inevitable and can play. Although you look back, <br /> <br /> All actors seem to go back, especially male helpers, Mark. I saw less wood in a rain forest, but it's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly continue to act on his actors? Is the director really? Everyone else does the story perfectly. There is not one. Kidnapped by the children and Kelly resolved to curb his pawn. I know how the feeling approached, I felt after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I tried to make money from my rental store. It's a home movie (and if you're looking for them, you'll see friends with a positive movie).
