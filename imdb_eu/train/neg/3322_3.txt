Unfortunately for me, I first saw the first Busby Berkeley movie "42nd Street". Then I hoped that all of his things would be good. I did not know this case, here, too, the favorite actor of the classic age of James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Oh, finally, the music numbers are as spectacular as ever, but the story is like many others and it is quite laborious. Apparently, they always show the creative audiences and misfortunes. In this movie, Cagney starts crying so often, he pain a bit, he's a light person ... fast! <br /> <br /> Although the songs that are here are closer to the "street 42" class, I would have to say the songs you can cry in years and years, in decades. The songs in this movie are not memorable. No, this is one of the first Cagney films - and Berkeley movies - I really do not like it and I was very disappointed.
