The film deals with Sir Christopher Strong (member of the parliament), Colin Clive, about his relationship with Amelia Earhart, who plays Katherine Hepburn. Until he was there, he was very honored, but when he knew Hepburn's curious but fascinating "he could not help himself" and they loved each other. You can say, because they look a lot in space, and therefore they speak of a painless fee. Actually, this film is very impressive and almost impossible. Part of the problem is that movies that captivate adultery in Pre-Code days were very common. Also, even if you accept this morally suspicious, the whole rhythm of the conversation in the nineteenth century. It looks like a romantic novel of the century ... and very bad. Favorite and favorite characters (after all, Clive's wife is a nice lady and has not hurt anyone), it's a waste of time. As far as single interest in this film is concerned, Hepburn is a costume dressed in an ancient costume worn by costume. You have to believe this and look like Bugalo (a dark but appropriate reference).
