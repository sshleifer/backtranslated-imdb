I've never written two or three clear reviews to complete this movie, or it was in vain or when it started to rotate with the bank, and if that happened, I would like to return my seven dollars! The cast, the words used again, is horrible, but almost nobody ever does anything but a relief. Everything about the landscape and shout we had about $ 7 a month to work. Filmed in several movies behind? Everything about this project is a small budget. The list of the best actors is D. Do not waste your time, of course, if you want to take it back and try to get rid of the rent. This evil punk 70's punk shows that his grandmother married Dummee Moore. List my large local video vendors with a sad movie with a sad comment. It's also a 99-centimeter rental, dust collector. Someone has really been in favor. This stinker is super and I give 10 turds.
