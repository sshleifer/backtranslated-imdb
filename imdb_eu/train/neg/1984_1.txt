Fully vaporized cow coated stack. It is unthinkable that this film was also made for me. Hip-Hop and the ancient westerns seem like they do not mix. What a public was when the recipients of this thought planned this workout. <br /> <br /> Not only does the concept and a joke work, it's also theater, and some decent actors were also in this nightmare. The film ridicules their whole career. He does not need forgiveness, and he is taken away from the dignity of his dignity. After reading the first ten pages of the interviews, he should ask who one of his friends was playing the joke sick. After some research, I found a list of other actors who sent this movie: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah and eventually Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> When I'm done, I'd rather watch TV empty than watching the movie again.
