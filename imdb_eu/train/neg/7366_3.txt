What was this F * @ # that I saw? Steven STOP !! Please! This movie is bad and shameful. In a strange distance from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal will now struggle (of course) with super-human beings who want vampires. ADOS? Oh, and your eyes are flashing back? Wow! Still in this movie, however, the latest drunkenness in Seagals and nobody can have a $$ ego, it's a bit stronger than HE. However, all the average men will be stepped around. Forward, I can understand the bully's or pharmacist's neighbors, but this is super human power. And to achieve this, Seagal makes short personality problems, but apparently Wolverine and his movie cohorts believe it. Oh My GO ... And worse than all this! Yes, it's worse than that. While his voice is watching, he has a voice that changes his voice. Obviously, they do not have any similarity and I think it's one of the actors in the movie. Mourning was pure. Although I wanted to turn it off, I always see a movie. This is also the shortest time in Steven's live video footage. Scary! Scary! Scary! Two fingers down! Recovery Features? Well, I think, I will be fair in that regard. At least some of the special effects were good, and I like the choice of wardrobe for actors and actors. All women had an IMO appealing. However, and I still said, it's not a blatant X-Men, Underworld, (rip your favorite zombies, vampires movie here)! Director, writer, producer, ALL movies and exile in the movie business. I think that most people in this movie feel like Blood Rayne (and all other Uwe Boll pictures). That's my whole movie $ 1.00. See if you dare.
