Difficult times with Angel Town, gangs regulate with an iron fist and, above all, they are unknown (especially as a result of embarrassing writing), gangs want a street boy to join Martine gangs. However, due to the presence of the Olympic boxer of the Olympic Games (Olivier "The greatest actor in the world of Gruner"), Jacques is hopeful. Angel Town is one of the most popular films ever made (and I've seen my action), it seems that all the groups that need neighbors have the idea that they need it. The worst is so many difficult times really ridiculous. However, it is the exchange between Gruner and Aragon, which essentially summarizes this ridiculous thing. Knowing: "Do you like fighting?" (Olivier captures his best friend in Asia) Can I really die? I'm afraid I'm afraid of death because I'm afraid of the reason I'm afraid, and I know I'll kill him and his son and his wife, That's why he did not die! "<br /> <br /> Of course, someone is wrong to die, much less your best friend must be left in the equation. Odd <br /> <br /> However, do not let this movie hate me far away from this sound, so terrible it is priceless. Grunner will finally arrive at the biggest events that he sees as Grunner, the greatest logic of the movie, as a result of the use of pistols. Vietnam for the Disabled Vets also helps his gun machine shoot at the tracks and releases it to the other. All of this is a "Mexican" sound of surrealism and energetic accent, to be a memorable one for fans of cinematographic garbage like this. <br /> <br /> This is another reason why this movie is for some reason. Although Olivier Gruner has never gone to school, the main reason lies here in the states and not in France with his girlfriend (he is dead at the beginning of the film). Angel Town is definitely unthinkable at all levels, but you're laughing at movies of martial arts, with a level of action that does not make sense at all, this is the perfect movie for you. On the other hand, make sure the tequila down, like the rich song of openness, "There is no mercy in Angel Town", <br /> <br /> * from 4 (bad)
