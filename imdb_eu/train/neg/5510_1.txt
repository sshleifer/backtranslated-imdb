Rodney Dangerfield is not the star of this film. It has hardly any. Most of the screen time are jokes. A running gag indicates a character named Jerk Off. There are also many erection muntaments, where punching on the line is someone who is an erection. This movie is funny as Kirstie Ally's British accent convinces. <br /> <br /> This movie started as an action-packed movie: background story five minutes later! Unfunny jokes. But, apart from the awful writing, the movie is also misguided and the play is awful. In addition, this film makes a bad comedy with a well-known popular B-movie actress. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid and Phil La Mar. These are some people who spend more time on the screen, than Rodney, even though he has been named the main character. Do not be surprised to find this movie in a drug that sells five dollars. That too is too much.
