This is the third Errol Morris movie I've seen, and I do not like his style any more. It seems very interesting and diverse characters, who find great documentaries to create characters and then have fun on all those who are edited in cheeks. It's not really their direct caricature, and Morris says that he says most time: "But no, no, people are really fascinating!", But there are always subtle changes and not so subtle. Morris reveals that they are mocking in the background. <br /> <br /> Four films that break the boundaries of the organic separation of philosophy. amazing ancient theater, lion maurer, an animal-shaped shrub garden and robot designer. The general issue of the film asks what names the characteristics of animals, humans and life. So the title Fast, Cheap, & Out-Control is not about anything about the movie, right? Of course, except for Morris, the passion of individuals seems to be very disturbed ("obsessions"), making synthetic designs of life. I do not fear sharing it and, in fact, I'm not worth the value of some of the links made by Morris. <br /> <br /> But I emphasize its nuances. Without leaving a voice narration and speaking out in conversations, Morris never faces a collective head of the audience. Instead, it mixes zirconia footage and ant plays often when it comes out of the circus and ants context, which shows the collective nonsense behind all those people who speak. I will not find senseless ones, I find very interesting and interesting people. <br /> <br /> If we do not want to have that idea, it's just a bad craft, instead of a silence. destructive Considering one of the films I have seen so far, I have been especially surprised by the fact that I do not want to know what to do. <br /> <br /> --ParisDiB
