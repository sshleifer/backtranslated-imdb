It's not one of the best pokemon movies. <br /> <br /> The story of two legendary pokemon comes in. You will see how Celebi is powerful, she first becomes the evil one. <br /> <br /> Likewise, Suicune looks like it does not look so powerful. <br /> <br /> Marauder did not have a lot of Pok√©mon, except for Taranit? Pokemon can improve some battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Professor Ash and Pikachu Oak know a lot younger, but they do not realize. I thought Misty, in the end, but he did not close. I saw these credits. <br /> <br /> Do not expect so much, so far the worst series.
