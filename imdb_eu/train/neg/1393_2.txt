I thought watching video clips was boring. This movie is nowhere fast. What could have been a half-hour creepy zombie episode apparently ended the movie with their car parking at the crowd, some photo of the dude pool (he really needed to answer his phone by the way) a dot matrix printer doing his job, and Heuy and Louey control room light Sitting in a yellow, they repeat "T minus 10 and count" as if something exciting happened. It's not like that. The best thing about this movie is James Best and Gerald McC, seeing something else than television celebrities, and finding something good. And do not start to turn me on, above all, a Tympan, large marine mammals and microphone feedback. As this film is still approaching, but I've got it for 2, I have been able to heal insomnia and I do not have to leave it in the middle. NOT ALL OUT OF LOTS.
