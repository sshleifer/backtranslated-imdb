After being surprised by Sandra Bullock's Miss Congeniality show, I decided to shoot Murder By Numbers. With stiff and self-efficacious roles, Mrs. Bullock wants a lot of "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, 2 speed, 28 days). His character is simultaneously sensible, confused and improperly adjusted (Sandra's past subculture does not work as a necessary filler, which makes it scarce to develop its superficial nature). Both teenage boys gave good performances, even though their expertise and seizure of the forensic law, as far as possible, even if they were infected by stupid mistakes, "We did that!" Chris Penn's loser is missing out on here, Ben Chaplin's pair and love interests. <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers Ahead *** Mediocre aside, it may be the biggest mistake. According to first television plots, you will never buy completely the cause of the murder, and as we have already said, stupid mistakes (in a slaughter scene It cooks rare foods, which is very comfortable and adaptable. school children, public love, love-to-seek, etc.) from a perspective-rich perspective tired and dismayed. At the end he was strictly "Numbers" and was probably the most vain part of the movie. At the beginning of the film, we have been using the tactics used to illustrate the climate scene, and as soon as we arrived at the public, the latest scenes were not surprising and there was a supposedly intelligent movie. to reach those consequences. A nonsensical concept, but poorly executed and almost always weak. * outside ****
