I was one of the liberals who appeared as a video of Steve. It was a pretty experience ... propaganda shooting and boredom. <br /> <br /> Michael Moore hoped that this could be a real documentary from my local school, UVSC. Conservative and other liberal efforts to conservative and religious slam of the local community. It seems that a filmmaker has self-serving as a documentary that reflects the preconceptions of these issues. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that her home can see all 10 votes here. Did they watch the video? Golly Gee Batman, that is, Rank all Men of the President! Their ratings are as evident as the bias of this film. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie that awaits the piling up of the IMDb is helpful. My vote may be balanced.
