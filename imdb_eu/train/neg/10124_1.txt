there is no suspense in this series! One episode when the performance is over, they are so dirty, the effects are so bad, and the script is so scary that you will keep the end of things like how Batman and Robin keep it. No, indeed, your thoughts are to see the last parts! This show is boring, I can not see how it was created, posted on DVD! Of course, the effects are not matched by Batman's current movies, but writing is also horrible. It's a mess mess or a similar mess about a bad teacher and a ray gun. I'm not sure because it's going to be followed. See the version of the 60s or the 90s, or even the Batman Begins version!
