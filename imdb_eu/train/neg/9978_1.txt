My girlfriend and I really felt this movie. After 15 minutes, we would call it cancel, if it were curious to see if the film could be recovered. That's not it. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the praise of this movie. It was a very awkward writing and I was given by some of the worst actors I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I was particularly annoyed about this film when people talked to each other. the interline pause was natural. I understood a pause to create an awkward feeling (like happiness). This was not a break. It was just a bad management. This movie can be much better with subtitles, and perhaps the foreign market is the best for this movie, since they were not an innane conversation and performance. <br /> <br /> I generally like these types of Little Weird Films (Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing), but this has failed at so many levels, I think it's one of the worst movie I've been in recent years.
