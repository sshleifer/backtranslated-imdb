That's it. Directed and produced by Fred Tepper and his family. (Fred should know him better after working with 'Titantic' and 'Dogma') <br /> <br /> So on the plot. There are some scientists, some forest guards, and hot breasts have giant breasts. They are totally bad in their jobs, as well as in the doll (I think it must be a photographer, but who cares for wearing a bikini). One of the forests says that "professional people" are good scientists because they are either skins or jellybeans or professional Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Some of the strange bones like monkeys are in the woods, and no one ever mentions that their bones can be Bigfoot. They walk around, and one of the guards is filled with emotion. We all hope that he will die soon (but it is really annoying for his sister to be naive). Then * gasp *, find a Sasqu ... I mean, Ape-like animal burial ground. Obviously, it's not mentioned, maybe Bigfoot bones are being mixed ... Myths scientists and forests do not think about these kinds of things. <br /> <br /> Then Sasquatch and his tribe. He is dying of all those who are very angry and like us, he escapes away to other losers and buries him again, and his aunt Muriel and cousin Josh (a trout in an unfortunate trout). <br /> <br /> Boring and boring conversation (I have sorted several times), plots, undesirable characters, bad CGI (a monkey suit would look better), and I did not see what I was doing was not good at making a movie . again <br /> <br /> You see anyway; It's good for some unwanted laughter.
