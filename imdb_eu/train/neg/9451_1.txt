I've seen bad things in my time. Half a mile of cow trying to get a muddy mud. head of two cars; Thousands of plates break into the kitchen floor; animals that are similar to animals. <br /> <br /> But I never saw anything like my cat bad in life. <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than 911, worse than Hitler. , Worse than Vllad the Empaler, worse than kittens put on microwaves. <br /> <br /> It's easy to make the most worrying film of all time. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a joke, some joke, and Mike Myers, perhaps, lost a lot of cocaine or something he missed by betting on high-pressure brominated cocaine bans. <br /> <br /> Shudder
