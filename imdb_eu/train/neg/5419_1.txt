Why do authors always work against the author? I mean, though, things should be condensed for the audience's interest, but look at Green by Anne Gables. The most important events that happened to be a wonderful event were just as enjoyable. I can not believe together three incredible mixing together with Anne of Avonlea together. Check all that forgotten. . . Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, widows, Poplars Windy. . . And Anne's university years, for the sake of heaven! Is not it nice to meet with Priscilla and all other Redmond teams? Kevin Sullivan had to shoot a movie, at the same time combining all together and combining characters and events together. This movie was good, leaving the novel! L.M. The beautiful work of Montgomery is something to deny. This movie was unknown to Anne Gables Green when he saw life in a successful way.
