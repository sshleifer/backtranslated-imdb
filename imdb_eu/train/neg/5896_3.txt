A missed call, another Asian-based Asian mobile phone. I recently rented a Korean horror movie based on a phone called "Pon". It was so boring as a missed call. Maybe the phones are just scary or something, but this movement was dull and pretty. No tension with me, and the last monsters were shameless and shameless. The movie crashed a bit in several parts and felt too long. You have not kept my attention. It seems phones are awful, such as trying to sell a machine. And it's ridiculous to compare "The Ring", it seems that all Asian horror films compare them and I have not seen any measure in the past until now. For horror directors - Remove the device as a hook as a horror device.
