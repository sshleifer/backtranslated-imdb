Well, let's just say that the movie star Jerry Springer did not expect the movie was to be. I asked him to be a cinematographer ... and that was not it. Someone seems like bad home movies. I had not acted badly, full of the nakedness of people who have never written and have never seen. <br /> <br /> The "plot" of the film is aimed at a low-class family. "Jerry Farrelly Show" discusses the diverse aspects of mother, daughter, daughter and daughter's daughter. Thereafter, the film creates a special experiment: white-faced pornography. Is not sex sex, sexual intercourse, sex? (Yuk!) This movie sparked me to escape from the theater and get a second circumference. At least it was wonderful. Disgusting and shameful African Americans and Workers' Classes must be in America. (Howard Stern should be pleased, but he did not miss the movie stardom attempt. He was smart, funny, and entertaining) <br /> <br /> MY DESSERT: F + (the daughter was hot)
