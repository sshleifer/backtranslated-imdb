I've seen this movie probably the worst. Bad operation, bad script, everything is bad. With two other films of the same genre and at about the same time it is interesting to compare. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and harder in both story and direction, and yet Albert Pyun has even directed those two! <br /> <br /> The story is not original. The world has become an awful place, probably due to environmental disaster or a nuclear war, and people live in medieval circumstances. A special race robot (cyborgs) lives with the human blood and it's not the story ... cyborgs need to get a lot of people to fulfill this "prophecy" and stop humans from stopping. A creator of cyborgs, created by a robot (Kris Kristofferson), has been nominated to save humanity. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director tries to compete with some famous Hong Kong scenic scenes with the participants. Flying from there and leaping away. The film fades dramatically in this essay. <br /> <br /> I recommend that this is the only reason that most people will receive a new movie "never happen". And I recommend "Cyborg" for the genre lovers, I think it's a very unfiltered movie as well as a fun factor. And if you can not stand Van Damme, look "Nemesis." <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 1/10.
