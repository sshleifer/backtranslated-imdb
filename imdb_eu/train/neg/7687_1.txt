I started to see this great movie. However, after spending an hour I left this movie, they gave me a lot of unanswered questions. This already started in the beginning sequence and deteriorated. <br /> <br /> Why would they bury themselves under a Hollander statue? Why is an Italian comedy presented? Why did the wife of farmers Hollander keep? Why did he save him, did he not escape from life to start the love of his wife's wife? Why did not the farmer's wife Hollander keep the farmer around? Why did they understand the Italian peasants who are illiterate? Why did the Italian comedians know about gold? Why hid the property of the evil potholes? These and many more questions appeared, and none of them responded well. So I think that the point of this movie is completely missing me, and I do not connect the story in any way ...
