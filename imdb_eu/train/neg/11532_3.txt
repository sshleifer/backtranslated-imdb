I rented the other night because I never saw my girlfriend or my girlfriend because a mutual friend has heard "how great it was." <br /> <br /> I am now quite conservative in my times, but this distribution would be quite correct. Before I started the movies, I thought Michael Douglas was playing a liberal mass popular mass, and as his opponent, he would be a noisy conservative opponent. But I thought that the political declaration would begin and it would end. <br /> <br /> Okay, the land was strong: the president falls one by one to a lobbyist. Okay, that is, it seemed to me quite entertaining, because it was a unique plot. But the movie became a liberal advertisement. The movie was about controlling gun and environmental concerns about the relationship between President and Sydney (Annette Bening). <br /> <br /> There were several ridiculous premisses in this film: 1) This Sydney character is playing this six-figure lobbyist "closer". Could it be more? He was constantly disorganized and everything was frightened. Hardly "closer". I'm a salesman and he could not "close" a man who was thirsty for sale. <br /> <br /> 2) Secondly, is Richard Dreyfuss one of the most horny of the right-wing fanatic? Hollywood is the most liberal man and he plays the right ideologist. Give me a break. I really liked how to conserve its conservative nature and to be as malicious as possible. <br /> <br /> 3) In the end, it was a playful speech. A member of the ACLU has been a joke about "I'm proud". First of all, the president does not accept something like that, being an active member of a ultra-belt team. Second, why bring something like that. You have only alienated more than half of the films with double or conservative. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a great plot and unique. I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice. But the movie went from a "movie" to a political left-wing, which is why the movie failed. <br /> <br /> It's a pity Hollywood to see a big Hollywood plot that forced its political opinions. audience
