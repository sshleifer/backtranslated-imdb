It seems that the painful wickedness that follows the eternal day. It's not terribly frightening as "Freddy Got Fingered" or "The Lost Reality," but in any way they accept any kind of way, sense or form. It's always the worst clown in the world. Most people do not get bored, but more wise or politically correct. In addition, EVER is a parody of the "AVER" titled "WORK Arnold", which is not the worst film, literally EVER is the worst. I do not know what the protagonists would be Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan or Slash, which I saw first of all. Dickman was somewhat fun. As a result, I do not recommend this film to the ENVIRONMENT, but people who carry out this mission to achieve this 250 are pathetic. Do it with people you notice. Also, if he hates the church of scientists, he can not all be bad. <br /> <br /> My grade: D
