I do not often rate revisions, but the computer does not allow negative numbers. <br /> <br /> Opening titles tell us that we are already in deep water. Although budget exploitation is low, there are 17 producers involved. No. No. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the story comes from a hated husband Kenneth who comes home to a gated community in his upscale home-grown home. The house is a pig. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger), children have been able to walk all day. <br /> <br /> Okay. We are in deep water. Mrs. Basinger's 55-year-old movie was released. Uh, are these daughters? Christmas is Christmas. It leads to the Della business, a long scene cut. The eeeeeeevil male attacks in the universe thought to take home the empty minded brain in the universe by filling in uniform football uniforms in the past Christmas. Sure To get the amount, he sees a vehicle with a deer that dies with a walker. <br /> <br /> We are really suspicious of guiding scenes. It's raining and the traffic is bad. First of all, try to try to drive and smoke at the same time. Later, later, Della tries to drive on her mobile phone and at the same time turn it over to verify the back seat of the phone's charger. <br /> <br /> An old college friend walks out of business, tries to buy things, but refuses to accept his credit card, perhaps because his husband is grumbling because he breaks down, but it's hard to keep the script going. <br /> <br /> A lot of roles in the car parks throughout the history of the quadrant are underway. A white boy (Lukas Hassas saw his toilet in his career), black, Asian and Hispanic. Imagine Up with people to bad you are evil and you have ideas for a company <br /> <br /> Despite being a weapon, it gives them attitude. A commercial center comes to investigate ruckus and shoot at the head and shoot more than once. The parking lot is crowded, everywhere everywhere, and nobody notices. Della escapes into her car and goes to the construction site to choose a safe or a well-lit area that is well-lit. Four bad guys at the same time kill only the right tools (literally). <br /> <br /> Preliminary spoiler ahead. <br /> <br /> He has returned home. It breaks the car through the rainy rain. The child goes down at the bottom and asks her husband generously when the gun shows the center and attacks him. In pure reason He will give the power to Della. Instead, we know that their children spend Christmas at home or spend their time in the group, as the state collects as it charges a murder. Four punks can be justified by self-defense homicidiable. Husband, another story. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw the cable. If I saw him in the theater (did he release him?) I would be angry. As of now, Basinger and Mr. I see such talents as Haas, which ruin such rubbish. <br /> <br /> Very good thing, however. Susan Montford wrote and directed. Ms. Montford does not have any credit for writing or directing. There is justice in the world
