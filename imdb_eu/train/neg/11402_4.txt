Expected from B-Movie. Slope, free fragments, boring part, cursed gore and special effects. Of course, it might have been better, better written, corrected, and so on. But I think it was not a B movie. The actors are pretty whitewashed, this seemed pretty much like a vampire killer or a buffy episode, or a lot of bloodspeed, forgiveness and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiffany Shepis must be named. It's a scream of the new millennium. It's not that the performance is important in these films, but it was better than any other actress. He also works for hot films for the whole movie. Wow! His back is totally amazing in that outfit, but I'll tell you to turn it over. And near the end of the film, the viewer is highly rewarded for watching. <br /> <br /> So, if your b-movie is terrifying if you have a horror hobby (like me), look at that. Otherwise, you should surely spend it.
