First of all ... With names like Fred Olen Ray, Brinke Stevens and Jan-Michael Vincent, in the video box "Rhino" and "Troma" in the video box, you know what you put up with. B movie mania! If you expect to see a "thriller" based on Edgar Allan Poe, forget it and go straight to the series of the 60-poem of Roger Corman. This is a sleaze that is not changed (it is just a pedestrian attempt "similar to tombs rather than get it"), R-rated, sexually prepared and bare for video. However, it's fun and fun to say, so to speak ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Victoria Monroe plays with her first fear, rich, traumatized and insomnia by the three housewives. Prior to being involved, fate is thought to have happened to his father (Hoke Howell). Terry's husband's (Jay Richardson) debt of his game (owed to a gangster who plays Robert Quarry) and Lisa (Delia Sheppard), with the help of a European blonde and gentle secretary (Delia Sheppard). Brinke his money. The actress Karen Black wears a blonde actress as a hypnotist (talent is too big to play a role like this). Robert Clarke's 50-year-old science fiction feature shows Robert Clarke's medical and family friend and Michael Berryman shows. For an autopsy on a fast-paced lifestyle for a decent nightmare. Jan-Michael Vincent sits outside the house in his car, sitting at the outside of the house that enters and leaves Brinke. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Anyone who faces the horrible face and decapitated head up for FX release has to sharpen his skills a bit. Brink makes decent work to make his character enjoyable, but the biggest surprise is how Penthouse Pet Delia Sheppard had an ex-role. He was stealing every scene here, and he easily gave him a clear reality here.
