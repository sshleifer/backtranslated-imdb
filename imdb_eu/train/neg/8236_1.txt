I can not believe that this is on DVD. Even less was available in my local video store. <br /> <br /> While considering some good films, it has just $ 4000 in a quote. I find it fun The budget would be very bad. <br /> <br /> Even more entertaining, I read another review: "If you love drama, if you love fear and love something like Duel (1971) with a little story and throw some beautiful little girls, this movie He loves you. "<br /> <br /> What ?! It's a pity when compared to these two films. <br /> <br /> I'm giving "1" because it can not "0". I can only see that this movie may be entertaining.
