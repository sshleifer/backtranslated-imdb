A very interesting camera and a high-powered story. But he never joined the film school more than one postgraduate thesis. <br /> <br /> There are two main reasons for this. First and foremost, there is not a single nice character, because he is not a criminal who admires it for his sake. Secondly, all the performances are awesome - as well as veteran Willem DaFoe. The ham is so rich here, you feel like you're on a picnic, but one of those perplexing picnic staff of the company, drinks a cheaper beer and eats you next to you when you drink it. Then you eat a bad hotdog and throw it. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'm doing a bit rude about a young director who is in some places, as I said, the camera's work is pretty good <br /> But I'm deceived - as a result of this movie suggests we can see "modern western" and the DVD package has similar images - but no one really links the movie. It seems that this type of film is supposed to do so. <br /> <br /> This betrayal is painful; But without this, we do not like these characters, we were ashamed of the actors, the story is mixed with despair, and in the end, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> I took it out of the DVD player in the middle of the road. But the rental shops would not give me any money back. <br /> <br /> Now that's really hurt.
