Recently I was looking for a site with public domain movies online. The long list of these films was this movie and I thought I had to hallucinate the title and premise of attack in this way. But no, it really was. And as the film lasted about 27 minutes, I decided to try. If I had some porn movies, I would stop watching. Instead, it's the strangest movie I've ever seen. The Danish producer of the production tried to make a Star Trek movie style about $ 49 dollars for a woman on homosexual men who traveled around the galaxy to eliminate all women. Earth! And in all cases, now they are happy and grateful to the planet. <br /> <br /> Subtle, this is not. With one of the most promising and younger names of the people I've ever heard, I do not think they can write on the IMDb without losing my opinion! However, despite everything wonderful, it was amazing and he deserved a look. But, as I mentioned earlier, because of raw names and strange issues (despite nudity), it's an adult movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, I made 1001 questions about this movie, WHO could do: WHY and WHAT IS WHO is the public ?! Maybe it's never been the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's probably the safest and most aggressive thing!
