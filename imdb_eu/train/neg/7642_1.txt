People just do not seem to be terribly ludicrous about the subject and how they were aware of how the movie was made. The silent boss is very well, the underdog has won - it's good, the cricket party is very good, but the movie is average. I think it can be much better than I think. <br /> <br /> The territory is very predictable for a film that is not based on real-life events. I'm sure the movie might be more interesting. There are only songs in it, and I had to remotely forward the same thing that would appear at different angles. <br /> <br /> Impact, however. Watchable
