"I'm a picture!" "You are an image!" What does that mean ?! This plot can not be worse when a boy frightens everything, he becomes very brave because at the end of the film he has joined a library. The sole purpose of this celluloid waste was to promote the reading of American children, as it could be more inexpensive and effective when they could have been advertisements! Christopher Lloyd Macaulay Culkin (like children), although a book librarian was a predictable talent, could possibly save this unknown movie. Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, (though) Leonard Nimoy or the Hollywood Voice of God, as Frank Welker's cartoons have never kept. Only 90s of the 90s can be described as the equivalent of the adaptation of the Children's Kids 1978, which makes mild animations worse by making mistakes worse on the plot.
