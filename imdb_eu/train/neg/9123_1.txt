I do not say much about this movie. Peter Sellers's tour-de-force might be, but it's one of the most tragic events in film history. Sellers' latest movie was more painful. <br /> <br /> An immense script, director and wooden shows have come together to make one of the most extraordinary films ever made. > <br /> I'd rather like to find a ridiculous or buried man buried inside that burial ground, but it's not horrible, a catastrophe. It hurts the truth. <br /> <br /> Peter, why did not you stop?
