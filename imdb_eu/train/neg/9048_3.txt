Originally ABC movie week of week. This implies a young innocent university that drives two young women innocent to a jail in the southern United States. They do not support phone calls and nobody knows there. Below we bring rape, torture, blows, humiliation and degradation to a very disturbing conclusion. <br /> <br /> The television version (at that time) was serious. There was no nudity and the blows were pretty, but in general a terrible feeling was down. The revised version is even worse: reproduction is abundant, violence is extreme and, in a boring sequence, we remove a prisoner who is crying while wearing a lesbian guard "hers". Yuck! There's nothing wrong with exploiting movies, but this is just about to happen. The filmmakers like to be tortured and degraded by these poor women. All of this will come into your face, as if you supposed to enjoy it. The endless downbeat end is not helping. <br /> <br /> I give 3 because the actress is good, but this really makes the movie harder to see. A sick and noisy movie. It is not recommended.
