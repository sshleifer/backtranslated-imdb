I think it's possible that I've seen worse movies, but this is a real stinker! The plot is not noticeable, but this is not the worst. The management is not in any way close. He has done a good job but failed to push this movie together. There was no chemistry on display, its behavior was flat and woody, and 5-inch rings were all over the film that were senseless. This exit for harmonization is located at the bottom of the "b" list and <br /> <br /> what did Cuba think? He thinks he has many great shows, but what we expect is much smaller. <br /> <br /> <br /> James Woods and Burt Reynolds are poor. poor poor poor poor
