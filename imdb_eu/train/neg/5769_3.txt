Elephant Dream was the main project of the open source community. And although the idea of ​​the concept is very interesting, it has failed in reality because it has failed. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautifully given, which is probably the shopping factor. There is a serious problem with them, but the excessive abundance that flowers produce. It's horrible, but I think it helps the quality of the movie's dream. <br /> <br /> A great voice voice is worth mentioning. Although Proog's semi-voiced actor, Emo's voice is HORRIBLE. Above all, with a zero-quote, you can not hire real actors. In my opinion, they have hired an animator to make his voice. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is not free in any way. It seems to me that what we want to do is what we want more, instead of a real movie. The earth nowhere and fails to show any really interesting point. He thinks the whole movie has been made in an excuse to make it look like an interesting one. <br /> <br /> In general, it may deserve a quick download from the official site, but do not expect anything except beautiful graphics.
