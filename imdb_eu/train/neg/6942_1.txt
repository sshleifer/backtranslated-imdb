This thing is really wonderful. There are no weighty characters, they look around BG. Motion Capture is a beautiful toy, but this movie proves that it really needs people who make animation to make an animated film. THE MACHINE IS NO OTHER USE MACHINE. If you see a curious movie, you will find tracking errors ... 3D MOVIE IN !!! It's fun to move the princess like a physically different dress. You need animators and 3D animators, data that do not know 3D programs. Note that links, like elbows, lose volume and how they are deformed. He who made the character design (very good) was confident that when he was moving, "the coss can not give life."
