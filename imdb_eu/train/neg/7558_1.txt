You never want to. movie Recovery unreviewed. Everyone from the theater had the same comments. The worst movie I've ever seen. Save your time and money! <br /> <br /> Nicgolas Cage was walking down the mountains, while the dark waters and swimming pools swam while the bees were attacked, but still, the clubs were still deeply pressed. the last scene <br /> <br /> Although working with Ellen Bernstein and Cage, the play was as incredible as the movie itself. It's amazing how bad movies can make good actors. Do not have a copy of the script in the first place. If you continue watching the movie interesting, you should wait on the DVD.
