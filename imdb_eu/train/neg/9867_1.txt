I saw the previous screen of the last year's reward, I do not know why they had been awarded after the election, but it was perhaps for the exhibition, at least, but the movie was a mess. Certainly, some parts were fun in a way of black humor, but none of the characters felt real to me at all. There was no person I could not connect to and I think it has failed for me. Of course, the plot is interesting and very subversive with Scientology, WOW! What a great idea ... let's see that it is no longer supposed to work. The whole time is fake, from lighting, depending on the quiz, I can say that the script of horrible visual effects (it is necessarily an intriguing one, as well as others, no one laughs at you). In any case, I expect to sell at the DVD, at least, I do not want any project that would make a lot of effort to go unnoticed. But the way is the way. Triumph of triumphs
