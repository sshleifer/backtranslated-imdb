The genre of movie hangings is really immersed. The problem is IMPLAUSABILITY. I realize that I am sorry to create something that may arise in the difficult situations that can lead to rumors, but this movie is foreseen and not credible. As long as I see this movie, the more I'm talking about the actor always saying things to keep away from danger. Constantly taking decisions to justify being completely stupid. If they had taken time to become realistic, it might be a bit enjoyable. That said, it's better to stay away.
