Another person who thinks about making another camera is like telling a story. In 15 minutes, the entire premise will be fixed in just a few lines, so there is no mystery that eliminates the whole aspect of the suspension. In a matter of 10 minutes the competent Middle Ages die in the movie, so we'll leave stupid characters to do stupid things. Low-budget films can not afford special effects, so the parts of CGI are not surprising, but at least they have been valid. The creature is a great bat, as it can be seen when it falls on the sidewalk, and the director continues to emphasize his eyes, not even the color that appears in the mirror shots. There is an evil and insightful conversation that reminds us of some Aliens or Terminator lines. The last action sequence takes place at police stations, it also extinguishes in Terminator and Darkwolf does not knock on the office glass office. In the end, the girl calls her a "good sponsor" hero, but she gets her partner, the original sponsor, and three more civilians, without mentioning a dozen police officers, all of whom have died without a decent shot. Despite being an arsenal of silver bullets and mitral weapons. Here's a real bad writing office: he could kill the beast after the initial credit stripper keeping his red eyes flashing. Instead of being arrested?!?
