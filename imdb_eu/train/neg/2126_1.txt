Jason Alexander is a wonderful actress, but it's ridiculous as a romantic piece of lead. He dancing so well, it so vibrates so effectively and throws it in the part that he throws so much as he feels so full. At his momentous moments (the train station with the girl, with the last number in Rosie) I could not take his eyes off, it was so repulsive. I like the drop-in action that pleases me and starts to get immersed. Vanessa Williams was the real protagonist, the only performance that was better than 1963 movies. By the way, if you see the production of the scenic music, the 1963 film and the 1995 film, you will see three more versions of the song, which I have never seen before (other songs, the same song given by different characters and in different situations).
