If you are a person capable of kicking off a bad movie, I recommend this. If you are not, follow it away. Cinema is incredibly cheap, and sometimes you ask if someone is shooting you. The most positive comment that can be made about this is that the managers were aware of a very budgetless nonsense, so here is a sense of fun at least. <br /> <br /> But this is fun. The idea of ​​these massive killer mushrooms is just that of those who cover the pages of colorful fellows. Of course, it should not be taken seriously (it means at least), but even with this revocation you will find yourself trembling a lot. Or often laughing, as I did.
