This film has no morals. I would like to say, how would you feel your daughter with your daughter on the day of your birth? I would be with all my heart! It is classified as a comedy, but I did not find it funny. Mostly I found laughter and brought them away. I love Julie Stiles movies, but it's an exception. Jason Lee plays in another shameful show, somehow proves that in today's society good classes and habits are not important. I missed my whole taste and despised movies like this. People will defend this movie and defend morals because it's "a mere movie", but I still know that my bad behavior is not allowed on the screen. I do not try to enjoy this movie, you are a bad person, everyone has the right to have their opinion, and the parts of this movie would be nice. The characters in the movie were shameless.
