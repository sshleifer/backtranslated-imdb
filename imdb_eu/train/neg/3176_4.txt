Beautiful Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate when he dies when an angel of ice dies with "Henry I" (Paul Rudd) before doing "I do". Two years after, Henry has not yet moved forward and his sister, Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) is very worried. Chloe wants to talk to Henry about Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley is in touch with the spirit, with the aim of continuing with his life. When Psychiatry begins to attract Henry, Kate's ghost loves love. There are some fun situations; But if you saw the trailer, you saw the movie's substance. Also in a cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. Personally, I thought Bell was stolen by Parker. And Biggs is like a pain in the ass. Still this movie was overwhelming.
