Movie is pure If you want to avoid cellulose waste, it is consistent. I am proud to be in the depths of the 70's, from Salon and Salon Kitty. I like to remember it, but I need a consistent story. However, if you get a horse, this movie is for you. The worst part was the crazy lizard man wearing a functional outfit. I mean that its seat is difficult, the play is awful and the soundtrack is badly duplicated. Please, I am aware that the cover is very interesting (the gorillas have a nude butt butt), but you do not waste time or money, you do not throw it back.
