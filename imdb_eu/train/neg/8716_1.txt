I do not know where to start; Spectacle, special effects and all you can think about writing. I can not believe when production workers say "Our work is done, release time." I'm glad that the first two of the series have never been in the UK. I really would recommend that you watch this movie so you can understand how most of the movies are. <br /> <br /> I do not know how other users of the IMDb can discover how terrifying everyone is to "scary" down the corridor with wristbands that run by waddle dinosaurs.
