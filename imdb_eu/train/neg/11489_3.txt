In the US, very few films were made about Rome, either during the time of Julio Caesar or, as a matter of fact, they were not. The main theme of the Hollywood sword and sandal is Christianity, which is why it is difficult to enter Roman history earlier (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and found some resistance in Hollywood not within Jesus). /> <br /> It is interesting to see at least one picture that occurs before Caesar and Christ, but when Rome was established only as one of the main Italian peninsulas, it rejected this Royal Hatred. Tarquin and the Republic formed. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a historical film; It's peplum, and when the values ​​of production are not at the bottom, the representation and characterization are cardboard. I can only imagine what the conversation is about in Italian, but the wooden duplication is very campy in English. At first I got good laughter. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many films in this genre, without losing most of Hercules' film in the 60s. For a moment it's fun, but while the movie progresses, it's boring. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: I would love to see if I had watched this movie for ten years. was it At that age, I did nothing with the Romans and the sword. So, at least, this film brought some memories of childhood.
