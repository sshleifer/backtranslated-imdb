I was sleeping on my couch at 19:35, last night I saw Larry Sanders (usually but not last night). I woke up at 3:00 p.m. (a bank investor on the west coast), and I was fascinated to see that on HBO2. I was surprised that the "movie" was poor. Serious amazed So I was shocked to write a comment on the iMDB. This is really bad. The writing is boring, but the direction and edition of the film school are under a new student. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a video shot. Note that this is VIDEO shot, not a digital video. It's like a guy. Skateboard video clips feel more like "movies". <br /> <br /> I wanted to describe the lack of leadership, but I did not remember anything. Plans and blocks are stupid. Yes, I chose the word "stupid". not uncommon, daring, daring, not boring, stupid. I know people review the review as "good example". I can not. They were 3:00 PM. But trust me, I know you'll see anyway, you will draw tremendous reviews. <br /> <br /> <br />
