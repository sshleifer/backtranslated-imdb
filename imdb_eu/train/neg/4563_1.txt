This movie is probably the cheapest ever sequel ever <br /> <br /> <br /> However, Disney is the funniest and most stupid movie, and from scratch, it scatters dramatic stories and fierce lows from the beginning. finish <br /> <br /> Short stories are like bad fancies. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERTA * Beast and Belle is all about the first pathetic argument. Then the three losing new characters will decide to make things beautiful for Belle's apology. Through this little episode, Belle has the eyes of my eyes, I make my brothers and I laugh so much. Then Beast and Beast fight against the letter ... and later learn the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they ??? Certainly, enough age, to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Then, Lumiere is one of the greatest lovers in the world, compared to love. She comes from the man who could wear it with her. And the effort to kill FiFi Beauty, and the endless scout off. What a message will be given to the children! <br /> <br /> Then, next, Mrs. Potts was about to be Miss. And next to what becomes a beast's excessive possession of a bird, until it seems to be a mere fool. <br /> <br /> Animation is so ugly, it dies. You can clearly see at least 100 errors ... and the color is huge. <br /> <br /> Belle is a goddess that is sweating, when it's wrong. In addition, the usual Belle is very small and very different. <br /> <br /> And the secondary characters are annoying ... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere are fighting for a long time. I know what they did in the movie, but that's too much.) <br /> <br /> But the worst character is Mrs. Potts. This is ruined. I can not describe it. Simply buy and see yourself. <br /> <br /> I give 1/10 a sweat, but I give it a 10/10 on comedy.
