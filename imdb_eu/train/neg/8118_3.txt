Well, EYEboy, I must say I'm not happy when someone singled out and when I try to laugh, it seems to be as intelligent as you. My favorite part of my message "But it's not a big-bang-bang big bad guy here, it was gummy. I suggest you connect the movie with a bang stick." <br /> <br /> Welcome! I like movies from the action, especially if they're doing well, but I also like films that have a lot of action, if they're always good. Sorry, but Secret and Lies are not in this category and it's a very bad movie. I do not really see a lot of American films, so I might have spoiled it and I do not know what the bad news was about foreign secrets and my lies. Maybe I judge foreign films through another standard, in some days I would see secrets and lies as one of the best IMDB films. Hmm ... True, that's a terrifying thing. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new email)
