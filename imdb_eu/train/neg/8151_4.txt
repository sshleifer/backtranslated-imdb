Leslie Sands has played "Deadlock" for the unlucky vehicle by Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, after gaining success in "All About Eve". After his wife's death, a female wife visits her husband's best friend, just like her husband, others start home. Irving Rapper is one of the best directors of Bett in his senior years, unfortunately it is not possible to raise this stunning theme, until Davis is very popular and is silent until the end (where he is strictly stopping). Production and cast support closely secondary; Bette Davis accessories only. * 1/2 ****
