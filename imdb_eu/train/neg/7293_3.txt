Aaron Spelling did it for television western television, that is, a seventy-minute movie that fits perfectly. It may well have been a pilot series that has failed. <br /> <br /> Handsome Clint Walker is a marshal Dave Armon from the United States, where he goes to Yuma (Arizona Territory) to kill a brother of a farm office. a route <br /> <br /> Walker has been jailed by another brother. Walker also meets a young homeless Mexican "fascinator". One night, Andrew is being disengaged. A villain and the other men dressed in the blue Navy are killed and killed on the brother's side, killed by Walker. He's not working well for the first twenty-four hours. Walker visits the local fortress of the Navy and classifies the commander chains. Bigwig hears the deaths of his brothers and returns the rides to the town for their chains too. The local population of the local population that changed its flock was also located in the chained area. When they get all these chains, Walker still has the hotel owner available. The men involved in the killings eventually die, the local livestock buyers are involved, the Indians doubt it, and it is very difficult for Walker to prove to the people. We suspect someone who has been very helpful. <br /> <br /> There is a half-infrastructure in the hands of the Walker family armies, and I think that this would be the strength of a series. Instead, the movie ends at the end, and next week I was waiting for some of the most exciting episodes. As a result of blurring of commercial disappearances, the stimulation is totally deactivated and its story jumps with precision. <br /> <br /> Walker is a beautiful, rugged and deeper voice than a puddle. The other cast cast is full of actors you've seen on other TV shows. A large part of the activity is quite lame and violence is hard. The first brother died and his jaw fell. I did not expect "Reservoir Dogs", but this is a wrong movie, so kids can tell you about the wrongdoing! When talking about children, the Mexican boy goes to anger quickly "aneurysm" and "aneurysm". <br /> <br /> If you do not like West Africans, you will not like "Yuma". If you like the West, you still like "Yuma". I can not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is not a classification, but there is violence and violence against violence. <br /> <br /> <br />
