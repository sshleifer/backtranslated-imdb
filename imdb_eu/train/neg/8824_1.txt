What can be said about this "other movie of the audience". The bad Christmas should come with a warning label like cigarettes, that is, my eyes and ears were harmful. I am rarely happy with the horror movie "B", but this movie can not be feared for five years. In a film, a point full of dark blood that is thirsty for blood seems to be a god-like thing, to keep it from being able to get it done, but this psychojob resident stays in the fireplace in this movie. The strange attempts to surprise his next victims and, of course, along with all the popular legends of the Santa Claus capital, reminds him that this man is not dangerous at risk. Fully filmed the whole waste
