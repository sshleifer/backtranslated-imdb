Despite the mistakes, I enjoyed "Burning Cigar", John Carpenter's One Season episode of Masters of Horror. Yes, the story seemed to be a cheap crossing between IN MOUTH OF MADNESS and 8MM, but it was still a good budget and time. With "Pro-Life", however, low budgets and time limits show more than anything else. Carpenter always has a solid leadership, but it is still a good quality for writing and production, which gives a feeling of total and total support. The script is not always a clear message, and the story is full of plots, if you look back. Maybe Carpenter wrote the script again, it might have been a part of it. Instead, Carpenter is a mess that will only enjoy hardcore fans. Without a doubt, Carpenter is the worst player. 2/10
