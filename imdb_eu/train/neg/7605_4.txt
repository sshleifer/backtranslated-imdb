I think that "Gunslinger" is not an amazing god of most of the films "Mystery Science Theater 3000", but Westerners are not the strongest of Roger Corman. Portrait of Rose Hood (Beverly Garland) became a sheriff of an old town after her husband died, and if the need to find bad guys, the movie is quite predictable. John Ireland Rose is a newly elected abbot, secretly working with Allison Hayes (a 50-foot woman). In summary, Dick Miller Miller's Corman Coproducer (currently part of Miller's Joe Dante's films) appears. <br /> <br /> I would like to see the version "MST3K". to enjoy this movie. They had a great time with him.
