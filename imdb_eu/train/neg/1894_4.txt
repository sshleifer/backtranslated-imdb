Although Flying Guillotines participates in the title, Flying Guillotines (1975) and Flying Guillotines II (1978). Both originals are masterpieces of the kung-fu movie and are still classical. The original copy is much smaller, and even as a regular kung-fu film, it is below the average. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film does not play much. It's a sudden battle scene, one after another, and the flying guillotine is not a big part of them. He is a story about some Shaolin monks who are investigating some wretched sacred books, and a wicked prince with a part of that book is part of the plot. The evil prince has plans to keep monks and use winged guillotines. <br /> <br /> Four films with Flying Guillotine. That is, in my opinion, the smallest quality. The design of this film is different from the other three films that differ from the other films produced by another three entities. <br /> <br /> The film is not necessarily a bad product of chemistry. <br /> <br /> Better skip and see two originals.
