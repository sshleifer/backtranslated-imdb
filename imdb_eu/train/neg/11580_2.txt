If you want to see a mystery, do not see it. Although it is part of the Elmore Leonard territory, it is closer to one of the "dynasty" episodes, because the filmmaker focuses on "character development" - a long and boring conversation between stupid and uncomfortable characters. Some may make a wonderful movie without actual action (see "Exotica"), but not this. Avoid, especially if you like actors involved.
