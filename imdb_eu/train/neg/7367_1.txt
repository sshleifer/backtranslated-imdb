I truly start to see Seagal's mission to see how bad his movies are. This particular movie was a time that was completely empty and awful. My first complaint was the cover of the DVD when they photographed their photograph. which made him look sharp and sharper in the film. Her large and double belly has her chin for her and her face is admirable and boring. <br /> <br /> The whole plot was ridiculous to start too long. The whole film, Seagal and his team, had to take a bunch of people to the last post that was supposed to be under the influence of the greatest military secret of chemical adrenaline. There is no need for a lot of dialogue and a ridiculous and constant duplication of Seagals's voice, even in the middle of a statement. The duplicate voice felt like a man in throat and was quite comical. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The scenes of movie movies were horrible. With Seagal Foug around time, however, he could not see what was happening. There is a tight tightness between the arms of the camera and then the person who flies on the wall or something. That's the reminder of Kung Fu television. too slow fight scenes. <br /> <br /> Now it's the worst film in Seagals and I think I have not bought this film or I was very angry that I'm a fan. Seagal the Aikidoist. The action star quickly disappears and seems to be worse at every performance.
