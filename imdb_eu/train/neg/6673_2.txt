This video was the first blog that told me that the Blair Witch Project meant people were the masterpiece of this piece of garbage. The play was far from the level of Oklahoma's 6th grade production, and it's a predictable, boring, and endangered plot. 85% of the script is a four-letter word and its variations. Mother F seems to be constantly using the "writer's" favorite. It took about 10 minutes to write this script during the last call. Thank you, I rented God and most of all I jumped forward quickly. Do not waste time or money with it.
