I have never forgotten the night I saw this movie. We went to the submarine in the North Atlantic patrol and it was a night-time movie. We left the second canoe. They did not even try to show up at midnight. Choosing to run again ... This is what I really need to say, but they have stupid rules that my comments have ten lines. I do not dare to comment with random words, so I'll try to get ten BS lines. I could not list George Goble's credits, but I remember the movie. The head was awful and the songs were even worse.
