This is Robert Duval's similar to William Buckley in the whole movie. His melodramatic performance deprives him of any dramatic interest. I do not know if this was a robbery or an unnoticed scene, but the only thing I can remember is the unforgettable movie. This photo should not be shown in all the amateurs class that appeared in an example to be done. Thanks to God, Duvall did things bigger and better and he stopped making an excitement. The character is good, but that's it. Klaus is much better. His unrecognizable and outstanding performance.
