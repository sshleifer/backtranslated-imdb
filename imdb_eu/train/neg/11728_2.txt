Previously I enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action movies, and I expected much more, even though 5.8 of the cast scores, the movie fails, and even though the story is small and unusual, acting unfortunately is thinner and imitates mimicking. "The worst situation" to play "tough" feelings ... Do not let your time entertaining the movie, if you want to cry, it would be enough, even if your tears were crying. Tragic action in Wesley Snipes tragic comedy ... <br /> <br /> I'll give it 2/10, it was awesome if you want to see a decent movie, watch the shooter or rent, all good things. no movie
