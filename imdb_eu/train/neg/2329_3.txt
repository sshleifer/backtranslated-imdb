When John Amos died, the show was killed. It was an essential part of the information structure. The best way to tell the story of a family in an inner city. They were poor, they were black, and life proofs were that Jesus and your family if nothing is too hard. Surely James would lose jobs and JJ would fail in school, but the family always managed to find a way out. <br /> <br /> James was a powerful male model that earned income and disciplined children. Florida was a strong lady, all of James, who had to shoulder a shoulder, cried out. The children were important families and important units. Willona's nephew was also an essential element, not only for being a family friend, but also for a loved one. The things were bright, curious, fun and honest, until the program's path changed. James died and JJ took the show. <br /> <br /> Flo's mother was still there, she went into a Mrs. Thelma and Mikel Strogoff was overwhelmed but JJ was a show. We thought we would be in the family apartment of the famous father or wolf. I think that the money paid by James did not make much to the family. They were only at risk of extinction, because they were moving and not because anyone at home was working. I know JJ, Flo, Thelma and even Mikel Strogoff have finally gotten a job but here they are true. James worked so much for him that he could feel but the others were not realistic and shameful. <br /> <br /> JJ was a comic relief, but I felt the show needed substance. Being fun is good, but they were able to show a true family and show what they needed to survive in the real world, and they laughed laughing. Michael's character was almost disappeared while JJ Evan was in the shadows of the show. I really wanted to say, there was a guy who had failed at school, but it's been released soon and he painted the money about two episodes. James was always there to promote his talent, but Flo and the rest of the family did not care. <br /> <br /> Why did she take so long to understand what she should do? ? Pain could work for people selling street cars or printing streets and cards for people. (He did, but something went wrong.) Why did not he do it and why others gave up in their dreams? Why do I tell you, because it was not because the dad did not care and encourage the father to stop protecting his dreams. Shows more and more taught us, build, learn and learn gimmicks and catch phrases. James should keep them. If a show needs dad, that was it.
