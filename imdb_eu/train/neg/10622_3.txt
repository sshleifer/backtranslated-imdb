Actually, it's like Christopher Lee, but that was not the case with other performances ... and he was one of the best actors. <br /> <br /> The film does not live its premise. It's not so scary, it's very melodramatic, and that's why it's. Whenever I thought "O, here is a good part", it never came to the surface. <br /> <br /> The wicked are not convincing. Most of the other characters were also deeply lacking. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, because I was in the right mind, maybe I had an MSTie fitification at the cost of that film, but ... Naaahhh ... It did not really seem worth the effort. It was not really good, it was not really bad, it was just fashionable.
