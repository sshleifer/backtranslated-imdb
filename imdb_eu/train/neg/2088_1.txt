What a great spectacle. Science fiction enthusiasts seem to have nothing to do with the quality they already see. It feels like something like Firefly lasts for a while, but the landfill is similar to Battlestar Galactica. This spin is great at every aspect of the show. The playwright is for young people and is not inspirational. All the characters in the wrong Sci-Fi series are card-topical. The story is bad. The dialogue box is worse than a first television series. The direction is crushed and the set is horrible. Caprica is a loss of cinema, loss of time and effort. There's never a spin off to do.
