When I heard the movie trailer and heard Spike Lee being corrected, I was excited about this event. I was not alive at the time, I did not live in New York, so I expected more than a story lesson. I've got an interesting play, a lot of sex and about 30 minutes of the movie about my son's son. I think the movie was not about Sam's son, but it was observed in the summer of 77. He was not disappointed. <br /> <br />
