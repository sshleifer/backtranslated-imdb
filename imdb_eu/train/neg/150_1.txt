Dude, really! Where have you been in the last 20 years, this is horrible in all these ways, afraid? This is a joke, being a small budget does not do anything wrong, but he laughed, if you want to study the classics, Tod Browningen Freaks, Dracula and Frankenstein victims, The Undying Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener's. Golem and The Ghost Train travelers can not compare, bad name, bad performance, bad script, etc. Money and free time on the waist, watch a lot of movies, it's horrible. My favorite time, without speaking, to say anything else, please do not try to see something so wrong, please understand.
