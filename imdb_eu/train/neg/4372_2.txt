I love Don Knotts, let me just say no! Talent is horrible and what makes it the best is that the loser who tosses an authority's position is nervous and in love. It's really wonderful in Roy Fleming, like the Freak Astronaut, but the movie is pretty dull, but I was glad to see my little brother and I and his other films. It's still worth seeing, but it's really a movie that kids enjoy. I would rate it as good as 100% of the family and something I could sit down and watch with your children with the family tonight. <br /> <br /> As with all Knotts's films, there's a cast of lovable characters. The actors and you can not help smiling when Knotts gives a shake of his mouth, how much is it. <br /> <br /> From an adult perspective, I think that one thing that is great about this movie is how NASA catches in the 1960s - all the modern new buildings, hope, optimism, the future! And I was surprised by Leslie Neils' enjoyment and pretense. The only complaint about the story is the interest of Roy's love, which can be difficult and laborious for a woman. The daytime can not give him a long movie. that ends at the end Be careful - you'll be watching for a few days, remember.
