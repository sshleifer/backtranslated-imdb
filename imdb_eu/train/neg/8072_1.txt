(Possible spoiler) <br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" is probably the worst movie theater in the world. Nothing makes any sense, there is a plot about a girl with a strange vision about the deceased. The whole movie is not really a random plane of things that do not really bind at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> When it does not exist, the camera's work is jerky and the script is so confusing, watching the movie becomes more difficult. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for something. To link the movie together but nothing has come. Undoubtedly, the worst film of the year. - **** 1/2 star.
