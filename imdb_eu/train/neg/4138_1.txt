Although this would be a good movie, I like zombies and horror films in general. But I did not think it would be a part of it. The only zombie movie is at the start and a car plays the divine. Films must be written by pornographic directors and pornographic actors. I would not call the actors! An outfit seems to be stolen from local school games. It almost does not seem like a road monster. There is no entertainment in this horror piece, but not as the director wants. I'd rather have been raped by a pedophile than ever before! ugh!
