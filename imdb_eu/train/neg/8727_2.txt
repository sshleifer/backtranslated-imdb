Let me say that I'm going to enjoy any of the horror movies of the 1970s or any good movie-making exploitation. Serious This was unhappy. <br /> <br /> Martino has too many elements that attempt to inject and does not work well (except croc-gone-wild). There are some Western ignorants, of course, who create somewhere in the desert. I do not remember where it happens ... it's sad ... Basically, people will see this hometown and see "its ceremonies" at the resort, but eventually they will call the 'Alligator God' in the river. It starts to make a wealth, it's a holiday and some people even die. It is good, yes? Well, do not wait. The smallest violence arrives to the end, as the special effects are so bad, just like nursery classes, and the love story is awful. <br /> <br /> There are few scenes where they appear. put a camera in the pool and put a toy, like darts, thrown into the water and attacking it. I'm not joking. Another special effect that makes another, Matchbox a van is an incredible plastic wreck. Suddenly the size of a van is five times larger. (In a few minutes, he was just as good as he wanted to eat a man, but now he shrinks the size of a van-shaped truck ...) It's really pathetic. The effects of the story were so bad that the other film that I could imagine was the masterpiece "Rats" by Bruno Mattei, all those who frighten him with plastic rats and could not be able to. /> <br /> Normally I would say that Sergio Martino was a must see, but this is an indispensable passage. It's time to waste time and it's definitely not worth $ 15 + to buy a sticker from No Shame. This is KALDUA. <br /> <br /> Children 2 2
