The "true" story of the three girls in the Connecticut wild wilderness captures a mane in the woods. Thirty years ago, a thirty-year-old American film group would play. It is not by any means a very low budget film with mixed results. The movie is a clock, but it is not scary (some of these scenes of blame). The kind of film you should forget about it. You will definitely never think of it as if you did not deliver it to someone and you would say "See here," what happened to me. If you have delivered a copy, the movie is not worth seeing if it's worth seeing, even if you watch it.
