I can tell the best about this movie, sometimes it was fun and it was a good time to be a killer. Unfortunately, this film is so angry that I want to slap around these characters. It's so kind of a kind of film that makes your teeth hurt. The intentions were good, I suppose, but things are very tiring when the interview is nauseating. The two pieces are not on the screen together, this is not really bad, but be afraid when couples often love talking to each other.
