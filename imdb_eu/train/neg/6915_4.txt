I remember this one of these films before leaving for a few years. I do not think it's horrible, but it's not really good. Alec Baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is very short. It's pretty good when you're done, but you're just as good as the script. Although he directed this Baldwin, I swore that he did not direct everything, I thought I read it somewhere or again the movies were not bad, but it has a definitive potential. Although "30 Rock" has little genius, it should be busy for a long time. I look forward to the La Seinfeld show honestly, but perhaps not so long. He was 9 years old. So if you do not want to watch a movie, but you do not really hate it, well this is for you. I can not remember that the movie took so much time and eventually only released on the DVD last time. He liked to see them together again with Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins because they saw their great people "The Edge". Now pick up an excellent movie for real entertainment.
