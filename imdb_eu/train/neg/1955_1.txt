The movie is so stupid, it goes across the corner and makes it ridiculous. I really wanted to see "Darkness falls" and I thought it was a movie. Boy, what a mistake! I resigned as quickly as possible, and I still can not get rid of boring moments. I'm just envious of paying people to play or work for this movie. They really gave money to them. Is not it amazing? I mean, in this movie, a man dies and slices on a wood machine, a few blooms, and a few minutes later, mum and children quietly talk at the table and nothing happens and drinks coffee. Please! Come on! Who gives money to crap movies for that? Oh, and it was a "tooth fairy" lama. It's no fear and it's clear that it is a boring stuntman with a very distressed make-up.
