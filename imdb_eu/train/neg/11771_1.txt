It was presented at the 59th edition of Edinburgh International, although the best reasons should be. It seems that many Thai actors and crew members are the first Thai film, but directed by a western one. It is not honest because this film is dull, dull and sad. Why does something suggestive, why it covers an idea of ​​mystery, why it is called a sensation of sensation, a home point with terrible voices, clear shots and top scenes> It's not time for the imagination to leave the director. Spurrier uncovers the topical issues. Suggestions, there is no invention, on the screen, without having to use our imagination. Do you ask me 'scary' a bit? You do not have a habit, 'the soundtrack will be more and more afraid, so it gets upset. Hell, I am completing the words to describe what's wrong. Do you wonder whether the devil is real or imaginary? Why tax yourself - it's really a snake, and it's really biting on her crotch, and blood is everywhere splattering. Curious and disturbing film for various reasons. It's a horror movie, but it's not terrifying. The push ups are signaled. It could be a penetrating attack on the part of Thailand. However, the director has a lubricant and lubricant style when it comes to showing no teens. Maybe he put his virginity asking himself to be west-western. Or maybe the whole thing was just pants. Inspired, innocent, repetitive, abuse - all candidates for the best description, but it seems sad to be the most appropriate and sincere. Everything has been seen, probably better, often more thoughtfully, rarely with less imagination or recovery. I'm sorry. Change at all points. Actually.
