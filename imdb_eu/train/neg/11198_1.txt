I would not even review this movie, because there's really no horror movie - and, therefore, it's not worth it. Cheesens attention At least, it is not horror in the common sense. Without a doubt, your time is a huge proposal that you are wasting. That's why I turned off for the first four hours. Imagine my astonishment, then, show the watches only 45 minutes. Yes that's it; In normal terms, the movie is b-o-r-i-n-g. <br /> <br /> The "Order" had many errors, not all unique. In particular, the main problem under "horror" in horror films is that Hollywood's desire does not seem to fit Christianity into its own terms. It's also possible to make movies that are truly orthodox. Ask William Peter Blatty. Indeed, without such orthodoxy, such films are just different things from filmmakers (usually dull and illogical). <br /> <br /> Think about it. Someone who looks like a movie on physics, but does not get the basic laws of physics wrong, but on the whole plot of the whole plot, you'll soon get uncultivated plots. The same is true of these types of films. <br /> <br /> In other words, "The Order" (and many similar films before) come from the Catholic church and the Christian faith and essay. to build a plot for these inventions. Not surprisingly, the plot remains inconsistent and stupid. This movie has an eye-catching charm with its toenail growth. <br /> <br /> Avoid this pile.
