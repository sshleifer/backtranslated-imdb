After reading the comments in this site, I feel forced to write for the first time. The movie seems to have split the audience like the Marmite. I have to say that movies do not make sense to be nice (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE), but they still have to commit to the character. While Lynchen opus was completely absorbed by the lesbian murderer, I can say that Mr Green or other gangsters of cardboard that lived in this world of the day. <br /> <br /> In addition, many people also seem to like that you do not like it and we do not like it, but I would not agree - I did not enjoy getting bored. I wanted to finish the movie and I did not help them listening again and again. If you want to call me, I think it's a repeat. <br /> <br /> However, the main reason for my writing is to ask a question to all other reviewers: I saw the form of the film. Black music Have I seen or did I see proof of the boldness of this GR? Or anyone who has taken part in the film got a rough cut and they have been deleted?
