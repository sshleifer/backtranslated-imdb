I found that this movie was very strange. Since I got there, I thought it was very hard for me to like this movie, and although I think about it now, I can emphasize why. Jean-Marc Barr, even though he was in love with him (I think that Zentropa is one of the best films ever made) here it is quite wrong, and although I can not think it's better for me, I'm pretty sure I can take his place and this movie work to do it Everything else will be fine, except for hanging weak comedy (A Meet The Parents Joke is not really necessary, filmmakers!) And I really like Richard E. Grant as a British master. It's just one thing to suffer ... Jean-Marc.
