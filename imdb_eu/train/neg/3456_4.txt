All of this movie tells how much Raffy Carruthers has, what a great director there will be one day, and so on. I think it's wonderful. He also directed Kimble Rendall with more talent than this film. "Next Jane Campion," they call him; and, in spite of the fact that both are too much appreciated, both are very similar. Both are live movies. Both are women. Both are Australians. (Well, give or take.) <br /> <br /> Yes: it is one of those characters that is a great character, and we must swallow it and accept it. But Carruther says: it's nice. -It's wonderful. No, really. Here are some thoughts on his talents: <br /> <br /> (1) It's a part of a talented director to face people. Why Carruthers is so bad to get his crew even more aware? I hope everyone makes it easier to walk and kill me. <br /> <br /> (2) Why is there a more depiction of a series of films I have ever seen? Eventually he had to shoot in a real movie. How can they get it wrong? If Rendall's set is much smaller than half of the bad guys, it's amazing that he has finished his movie. <br /> <br /> (3) Carruthers's director's fiction - set the task of creating a brand new one. Horror movie in the 1980s. Fat choice Certainly I can not do it these days. I suspect that Rendall had made the same truthful and talented director the same task, that it could not be realized, and instead of knowing parody (with sigh). Of course, working in parody is not enough. As soon as the cast and crew begin to walk in isolated farms, the film spoils the parts of the era in the 1980s as horror movies ... well, less. <br /> <br /> (4) And still, and yet ... the film begins with a parodyless, but honest dance of the 80's (this protagonist is true) Molly Ringwald. This pad is much better than this one. (Film is a bad sign when you're watching the movie inside the film, if you want more than just a movie). However, it was shot at the end of the 90s. In the 1980s, fear can continue. You only need to stop parody knowingly. <br /> <br /> <br /> (5) I never wondered if all the horror characters of adolescents in the 1980s had an Australian accent, but I know now. It's amazing, I know. I never met the needs.
