I hope who loses those accentuated losers. One of the best times is just a few assistant characters, 5 of my favorites have been killed at the end of the season (one of them was a cat to take that perspective). <br /> <br /> The whole story is about sex and nothing more. Sexual vampires, gay vampires with gay sex, live sex with gay vampires, vampire blood sex, vampire blood, vampires, sex vampires, sex vampires, sex after vampires, sex. sex, because vampires feel bad, because we've become a vampire, and so on. <br /> <br /> There would be nothing against the opposite of sex if it were nice to get into the story. . Perhaps, after having a story and stepping on some sex. But they did not do that ... and Anna Paquin is a whore of the rumor. He either sucks him or sucks his character, I can not know what. <br /> <br /> I do not even think of a deceitful story, so it's like a vampire Bill, a 150-year-old, to keep things together. Someone interested in Sookie. He is constantly making things that he can not control flying out of his hands. It leaves for two days and decides "not to be returned" and suddenly has feelings for dog-men? Give me a break. She must be a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old girl. The people around him are dying all the time and he has the brightest smile on his face because he only gave his V-card, who could not read himself? As the main character of the story, I expected the show to be a little bit more, to be understandable and invest your interest in someone who did not keep secretly or go into the comma. I can not find his favorite character and even read the minds of horror and more interesting. <br /> <br /> I do not waste my season 2. June will come.
