Caution: Avoid this awesome movie duper ... If you've seen it, you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> <br /> Father's grandmother now and what do they do? Being trying to be innocent and fatigued, I do not do any work. Pam and Denise play a bad role. <br /> <br /> Plus The script is totally outrageous, I can not believe that someone can come up with these wonderful ideas. Along with the development of the film industry, film lovers do not find it easy to meet in the last century. I bet that fans of this century will hate it too. <br /> <br /> Leave it away. I think that in 2004, I see "White Chicks" that's much better ... I do not think that the movie is the worst mistake I've ever seen.
