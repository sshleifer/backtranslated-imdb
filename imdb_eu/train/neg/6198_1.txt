This cowardly and aggressive movie really liked me. Characters are well-known young men who often get bored in a maritime village. Robert is a foreigner, but he has the music he could have. Instead, Clay will turn Robert into a great deal, traveling through cannabis and ecstasy, and entering with the evil crowd. Clay seems to believe that he is "reefer madness" and ends up shooting Robert as a homicidal rapist. This young director asks how much life's experience he has. No one can save Robert weak. Clay is leaving us young British messages are out of control. There is a passionate connection with Iraq's rebellion; We face warlike images and explosions in graphic rape. The film shows the extreme movements of the male team. The young London bombers draw a parallel with the hateful representation of the modern man of Clay. Clay means that men can not encourage violence to act horribly. It is surprising that the British film industry makes it possible to invest money in films that advocate propaganda of different investments, when we are coming out of London's latest attacks. Clay's first movie. I'm glad its the last.
