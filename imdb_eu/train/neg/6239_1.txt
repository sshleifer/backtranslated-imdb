Where was the criticism of democratic and republican administrations? In the end, he served for over 17 years in a group of government reforms. Oh, I forgot it for 8 years that it was the second authority in the land's most powerful country. The film is pleased to see the plans of a young Gore Senator asking why a scientist at NASA had to change his scientific article, but Clinton / Gore's complicity is not asking for global warming. It may be that there may be an election year or Hillary's chances on 08. In any case, it is a political coward and a party at the end. He does not criticize consumerism, nor does he offer criticism of capitalism, it is the story of the development of industry that has taken us at that time. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film Mr. What Gore himself is about the real problems he faces in our environment. If you want to make a film for Mr. Gore, summarize and summon what it really is.
