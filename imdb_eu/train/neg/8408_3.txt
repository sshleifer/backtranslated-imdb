Wow, this is very rare in one aspect: usually the first feature is the best series following the long movies. People are surprised when the battle is really better. With Tarzan, I thought that the movie was the worst of this series, or at least my first six-month Tarzan DVD collection. I have enjoyed watching the sequel several times, but I have been using this turkey thanks to some characters. <br /> <br /> Well, let's get started with the good news: <br /> <br /> Good - A lot of action with plenty of wildlife, even if it's stock footage. You will see the attacks of lions, crocodiles, hippos, panthers, names, and you will see different kinds of tribes, such as pigmen ("dwarf"). I can not knock realism because they had not been in the movies for some time. They work well so they can put actors who speak to false origin. However, Weissmuller did a great deal of action and was very well. O'Sullivan and the couple make up a well-built couple if they had been in the golden age of the movie. The film has a historical value (with so much monitoring) that Tarzan shows. She bought her beginnings to learn Jane and English. <br /> <br /> BAD - "Jane Parker", in every scene that she takes every moment, is Maureen O'Sullivan's hysterics, shrieking and screaming scene. after the scene. It's enough to give headaches and ruin the movie. Fortunately, it was reassuring in the tracks, but not in this movie. The movie "The Great White Hunter" does not make any favors with C. Aubrey Smith, the father of Jane, and Neil Hamilton, the guide to Harry Holt, the safari guide, whether they shoot all the animals he watched . or not These people are killer, especially Smith. In another note, it's very bad to say that there is no way Tarzan seems to be in the jungle. There's no history of this growing footage here. Jane and her team are at a certain point in Africa.
