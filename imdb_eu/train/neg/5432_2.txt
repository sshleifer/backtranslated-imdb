A wreck is sinking ... The surviving inhabitants, hanging on a nearby ship, sit there while they do nothing, after long reflections, to get a long flashback. The only thing that you will notice over your credit, its cinematic is Lean. And in technical terms, it is very good. We make David Lean movies. Coward's research interview is the second seat for many moments and Lean's visual senses are the protagonists. Try the soldiers coming out of the sea near the end and all that scene; He has continued to sing the song, where the scene inside a house is bombarded. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. It is totally wood, which does not show emotions, nature or humanity. Look in his eyes that another speaker listens to what he is saying, hopes to end up pushing his line. <br /> <br /> 7/10. </ B> <br /> Its episode, a bit repetitive, and flashbacks overcome the story: the main story that goes forward is not just the general view of the characters. However, the movie is worth the clock, and Lean debuts. It is not a very deep or penetrating film, and it's definitely a propaganda film, but also a showcase of Lean's editing capabilities. It's about knowing how to assemble parts.
