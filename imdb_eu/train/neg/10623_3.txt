"Three Daring Daughters" is a look at divorce, remarriage and a single parent illness that is ill with sickness. Of course, social issues and economic difficulties do not take place in the image of a single mother who feels exhausted, takes a cruise and then leads the director and marries. When "Suspicious" is included in the phrase, "Daughters" suffers from many unnoticed songs, their real children are not real children and the director of the group Hose Iturbi. Is not it strange to star in a movie that would be married to real people in a movie that would be married to genuine heads? <br /> <br /> No doubt, the movie was released in the eighties. Only in love with the Hollywood style of love and comedy, "Daughters" movie could be tolerable.
