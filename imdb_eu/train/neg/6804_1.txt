It has to be one of the worst movies ever made. The plot seemed like 57 passengers. However, the film worked better with the latter. He has done it in the worst way possible. Some bad moments in the movie: A flight attendant stands up to an open 747 flight door and tries to close the door without absorbing 250 kilometers of winds?! Then, aircraft are only a few miles from the aircraft, starting at 8000 meters, but it is not possible for 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. In a track (directly directly and directly), it is necessary to order flaps, HUH! Come on flaps is there to secure the low speed lift, you use the thrust track on the other side of the engine and provide maximum power! I can go on and on in the minor and most of the movie mistakes, but then my answer would become the English vocabulary size. This is the movie you want to miss, take the word word!
