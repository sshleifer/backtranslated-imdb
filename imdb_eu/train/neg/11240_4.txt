In Kerry Conran's science fiction, with a dreadful ambition, that is, clearly, this love job. Unfortunately, it's not so good. Everything starts well - a slow but epic score, the mix of Lucas and Hitchcock style and the glossy filmography of Spielberg. The film also mentions several times as science fiction novels, movies and The Day The Earth Stood Still, Superman, Metropolis, Planet Of The Apes, The Iron Giant, Star Wars and The Spy. However, the movie has not been as good as it was for a reason: the work of love, which is all about the screen and the generation of brave new worlds, Conra really forgets the movie. There is no tension, no atmosphere or magic offered here airborne battles, dinosaurs and anti-races. Black items also blur. It's a great way to look at things, especially. These items mostly fail, because there is nothing real and, of course, it is false. The green screen only looks like a video game in half time and the agents are stuck. . Actors do not do much - Jude Law is wood, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and foolish, Angelina Jolie is wasting - and all of this is a huge screenplay - it's nearly all about explaining. Experience is decent and some may feel nostalgia, but ultimately it's a step towards yesterday's world. It's over.
