1950s play (London) Soho and future people. Based on the reflection novel. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is a video director. No more, no less. Give you $ 15 million and a $ 15 million pop video. Do you forget that it can not work with two activities for two minutes two hours? What he thought Who is the public? He cared for a book he cared for. London's usual story, chancer's choice. <br /> <br /> What can I do to get this movie farther? Well I know, third songs that are generally dressed. The title of the film David Bowie worsens several times and is the most prominent. Soundtrack clay is a pigeon material. <br /> <br /> There's a good thing anyway. Period Soho good entertainment. Pity does not mean anything to be put before.
