... and very bad! How long did this train sank? 14 episodes or something? Now why do I see it. <br /> <br /> I bought the "Serenity" episode from Amazon Unboxed. My first purchase was so free. It's the only thing about the experience (incident?) <br /> <br /> I have not commented on the performance, that is, I think people who were not quite new to work. still down At least I have never seen them in any major show, theater or television. I have, I easily forgot them. <br /> <br /> But the special effects were awful. True, this is not exactly a million dollar project, but it's been better than Star Trek, and it's been thirty years old. Especially when I washed the bad ones (coins or something else) on board, as Firefly was looking for a ridiculous sound, it was smoke when I got some sort of kupel. Eventually I waited for the top Wiley Coyote to follow, following Roadrunner. MODERN jet / rocket engines are not too bad. <br /> <br /> And that was not the worst thing. I asked Western-style shooter when I was actually watching a science-fiction movie or a Gene Autry. <br /> <br /> He does not have to waste his time ... He made 80 minutes of the disaster called "Firefly".
