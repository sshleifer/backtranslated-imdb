Just flashing Sound - the back music was loud and covered the voices. He should not ban it again and repeat it, to catch what he said. Nobody is checking these things and let them do it again. Please reduce the background music volume in the future. Adaptation of relative sound levels is the work of the editor Julia Wong? The lands were loose. The baseline was a potential. I think I need more movies. Was he running? Maybe they were left without money. Like many movies, it started great, but it came to the finish line. I do not really understand that, before you start the storyboard, you know why it is not possible to take care of all the scriptures in the script. <br /> <br /> Excuse me so critical. .
