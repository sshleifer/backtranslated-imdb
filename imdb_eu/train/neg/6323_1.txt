This movie is a bad memory for my childhood. This is one of those films that you can not make an effort to show off on sunlight. You prefer to see something else. At least this was in a basic school. I remember HATING this movie. I give it, I have not seen it for 15 years or so, and probably do not use it in rainy days anymore, but I would like to warn everyone: it's better to use these as entertaining than sleeping your children. Believe me, select something else. Although the matter is controversial, the earth is so slow and slow, I do not remember anything about it, if I did not like it here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn everyone. .
