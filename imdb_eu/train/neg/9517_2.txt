The films Vincente Minelli deserve your time; Meet Me St. Louis, Bad and Beautiful. I'm looking forward to this movie with great interest. But what a despair. <br /> <br /> The scene of some fatalism has been the scene of some runners. Sinatra is sad, she has returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships. On the other hand, a floozy hung upstairs. He resigned desperately, ending the desperate writing project. The film has a great dramatic finish, captured by the disappointed Sinatra and MacClane, and something that is disappointing. Sequence is full of voltage, but Minelli is not Hitchcock; The beautiful colors pay so much attention, it does not have a scene scene that weyezing a cliche and the characters that are so fine-drawn and poorly filmed they have not taken care of especially. (especially MacClane) But this is the only true film project. Alternatively, we will examine the constipated characters that place the two nerves that surround the bars and the living rooms twice. Hell is apparently another person. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens in this movie. Soldiers return to shipment and WW2 subsequently manages the issue of indifference to 'Life in good years'. And between two Inge products, 'Splendor in the Lawn' and 'Picnic' cover the desperation of being trapped in a dead town, much more severely.
