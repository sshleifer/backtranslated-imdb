It's Peter Falken's movie. Deadline <br /> <br /> I was 10 years old when this movie was released; At that time I was a movie maven. Of course we did not see our parents and this movie, but I fell in love with the love of their ads. OK, 34 years later, I've finally seen the movie - I have never seen films directed by Cassavetes. The general hack is. Time of pace, edition. Gena's performance reminded me a lot of Dustin Hoffman's "Rain Man": technically but intact. When Tom Cruise's "Rain Man" robbed Falk, he took the cake for this movie. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed by the performance of Gena, really, all over - "Awakeings" (blecch!) was better suited. It's not his fault: it's a wallet to take it from one scene to another. We never know why But Falken's character seems authentic, Falk is interpreted WONDERFULLY as a serious man. <br /> <br /> At least an hour's dump (an editor is required!), and this would not be a compelling portrait of a woman. but under the influence of a simple Cro-Magnon, a man who is associated with a man who does not work with a man, but still can not handle long hours to work with her three children and her husband. <br /> <br /> I 'merely remember Cassavetes "The Dirzy Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby". It would be a better director if you deprive excessive excess tendencies, as shown by this film. <br /> <br /> Bob
