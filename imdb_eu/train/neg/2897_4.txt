No great excitement about "Dan in Real Life". First of all, all the configuration is very well-conceived. Did you really believe in the conversation in the first long-term interview at the restaurant that Marie did not say where she would go? And since Dan talked about conversation, why would he attract him? In that sense, I never even thought why Dan Dan attracted the whole movie. He is very narcissistic and has not convinced us that he is really a good guy (for example, Marie lying in a bookstore, his girlfriend of her hilarious brother, and tries to make Marie jealous with a "blind date"), which is captured by Marie and her family as a whole There's a lot more reflection like the ridiculous scene of the bowling alley, it's going to be the case, Dan in Real is a slow, sappy and manipulative life, with chick flicks, such as Jane Austen Book Club, getting higher scores than "tearjerker" has it.
