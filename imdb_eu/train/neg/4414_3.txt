Christopher Durang had to teach him a terrific memoir, because he could not ignore the concept. "The one that tells you everything about Sister Maria Ignatius" was presented at least in Hollywood, in the same style as Diane Keaton's speech scenes. Sister Maria was an exaggeration, a lamp, a serious satience with a serious and reliable teaching, and as Lynn Redgrav did, she was ridiculous. But the film emphasized that taking excesses seriously seriously - again, as we say, keeping the same tone "explains" in all scenes. They approach two approaches, and in the last twenty minutes the movie rattles the track, it is immersed in the canyon and it explodes. There is no survivor It is possible to work with the tone of the four former students and the sister of Mary, like the sister Mary scenes. Or if the Arreb's scene was more realistic. This mode does not work.
