Kirstie Alley, a bit slimmer, but just a bit, with a man who looks like MacGuyver, with whitish blue hair and everything. The film's premise is about an older woman (50!), Because her screenplay has no age discrimination, so her young nephew will be the writer. It's not the original idea and it's not a very funny movie, a bad performance, a fast conversation and a hilarious plot. There is another plot about Kirstie's character, which is why the mystery enters. The actress portraying Kirstie's brother is so woody and confusing, seeing their scenes was torture. What do you mean about this movie? Avoid.
