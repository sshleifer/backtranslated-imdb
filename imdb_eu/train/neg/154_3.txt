Watch this on DVD in English sub-native language. Subtitles were very bad or the actual dialog does not create a lot of stories and gives any character development. There are few HK stars, but the movie does not make its presence better or worse. It's bad The bright and colorful scenes in CG are appealing to bright and bright colors, but they can be endured for some time. In any case, I think of it with the baby's movie, its cg stop, the fight scenes and the crap argument. I'm sure I understood what happened to the movie but it was nothing more than the whole story's delivery.
