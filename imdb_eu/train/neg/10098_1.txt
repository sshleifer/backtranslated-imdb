It's not a video rental or the worth of some time or effort. <br /> <br /> * Make-up for kids. * It was shot ... poor leadership. * Editing was very demanding ... many things did not seem meaningless or free. * The sound was bad. * Music was inadequate. * Casting was very deactivated ... it must be cracked. * Talking about the zombies that speak ... in the unit, dancing, working ... I'm just burning. * And bad ... Cry! He was as good as he was ... he was the best zombie he was looking for all. He does not say much. <br /> <br /> The cover was good but very misleading ... Main Menu of DVD ... beautiful artwork and excellent music. <br /> <br /> <br /> DON "BOTHER!
