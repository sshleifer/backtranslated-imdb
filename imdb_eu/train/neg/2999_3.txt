Another FRIDAY 13th ripoff, even some of his music! A young adult team joins a small high school luncheon and begins to die Jason Voorhees. Maybe what was the pain in school? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The end of your slasher will look a little bit more than standard. <br /> <br /> MPAA: violence / gore, language, sexuality, nudity and drug content are valued.
