Actually, people are very surprising to see all these positive reviews. That's why I really decided the main reason for this movie. And after seeing it, I was disappointed, and it is the result of the genre that loves this genre. <br /> <br /> I am completely impressed with this movie: it's like a child's movie that is totally unmindful and all children curse and swear. I am not righteous, but this has really gone too far in my mind. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: He sent a story about two men to a big brother's program for their shameless behavior. There, they met a boy with the boobs, and the other was a medieval spire. <br /> <br /> <br /> Your personal name is just related to the story. They do not act as a role model and do nothing to help them spend their time serving. The story is very predictable (though expected) and humor is not at all. And did we not see the same characters (playing Mc Lovin's plays) in many other films (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh three times and I almost sleep. <br /> <br /> Well, they thought about the questionnaire, which produced the script. And the performance is just as expected when you watch this kind of movie. And the direction, what is expected? This is what Wet Hot American Summer has brought to us the same guy, and the movie is awesome. But somehow he got a star to attract his horrible film. <br /> <br /> However, I did not dump the pace completely, but lost time. The naked scene only seems to be the best part of the movie. I can not recommend any recommendations to anyone I recommend. <br /> <br /> Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Two topless scene. <br /> <br /> Cons: Not funny, scary story, nudity and children do not mix. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.5 / 10 (Rating: F)
