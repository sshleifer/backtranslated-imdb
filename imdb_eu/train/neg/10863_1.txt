LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is a great movie. I saw the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good, but this one really failed you ........................... ... ........ <br /> <br /> This movie wastes your time and money. With my friend I went to this movie, on the first day of the release, and we both swore the movie theater .......................... ... ...................... <br /> <br /> CIRCUIT's role was unnecessary. I think SANJAY-DUTT cut the role of ARSHAD VARSHI ........................ <br /> <br /> The nature of the movie too It does not fit well like the previous one. This movie shows the result of OVER-CONFIDENCE ......... ............. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> DISMISSAL great
