I did not really know that this movie was about to go to the theater when I saw it (satanism, etc. Etc.), as I saw, the last film I saw was that the pioneers seemed quite interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> Oh dear, Catholic mythology? It's not my horror idea, and honestly, I liked seeing a horrible movie, not some fake footage, some small bloody bloody blooms in a few minutes. /> I try to move away from disasters (!) But it seemed to me very curious that the Doorman, who had a rosary in a dead priest's rituals, could suddenly fulfill the wounded Christ (supposedly stigmatized not to be deeply religious?) I mean, hanging with losers, losing Does it play like a typical rebel and shows here the wounds of Jesus Christ? Come on! <br /> <br /> The scenes of the crucified, throwing back and shouting his head, blood everywhere, becomes unexpectedly after a dozen times. It was not scary, not terrifying. However, seeing was very painful: those terrible scenes were very annoying ... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: If you are a Catholic, you can not see it defintly. If you are not, you have not seen it yet.
