This is the first of the BBC series, "William Shakespeare's Dramatic Work," I've seen, and all of them will not see it anymore. The almost complete text of the play "Romeo and Juliet" is missing in all other departments. Alvin Rakoff reveals himself as a horrifying director in both technical and artistic aspects. In the first one, he made a mistake, even though the first movie student avoided wisely. Take note, for example, when filmed for the first time by Abraham and Balthasar, or when Nureus introduced Lawrence Lawrence's room, asking why he was in front of Rome, he would also see it blind. And the second is directed by all the performers, although some of them are good actors. Rebecca Saire looks like Julie has always looked like, and does not seem to be a bad actress for a teenager, but her behavior lacks passion. As Patrick Romeo, Patrick Ryecart is even worse, as Julieta is as sad as he is, but he's too old and pretty good, he combines Malcolm McDowell and Chucky doll. Together, it is impossible to think that they feel nothing about each other, and even less being the main agents of the greatest love story ever written. Alan Rickman, in his debut album, acts as Darb Vader, a great mistake that removes the complexity of Shakespeare's provisions, the character is not hero or evil, but all wrong men. This Tybalt is so badly watched, we do not believe after the guilt for the characters. As in Paris, I continued to think about Spaceballs's "Valium Prince". Only Celia Johnson addresses the nature of the Nurse with some justice. <br /> <br /> In 168 minutes, this production can not get empathy for the characters, empathy with the characters, and never empathize. They are seen believing in their roles. The best screen version is Franco Zeffirelli. In order to be fair, the BBC does not play George Cukor's flamboyant geriatric version or anti-human crime such as malice, such as Baz Luhrmann's long MTV video. 4/10.
