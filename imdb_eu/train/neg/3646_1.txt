Oh ... my ... god ... arguably the absolute movie I've ever seen. The play is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker, and the whole movie does not make sense. To join the quirky scenes that are rare in the form of scenes to direct this couple (for example, the boy who falls over the cliff and mysteriously falls) and a deep conversation ("Look!" "Musta cleans her pants!"), And you get it full. failure. It is also worth mentioning that the only thing that Atlas could have failed was in the case of chocolate bars. But that's the charm of the movie. Sit down and see you laugh with your friends. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, BAD IS ENVIRONMENT!
