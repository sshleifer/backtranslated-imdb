I have to be back in the background because it was very painful to watch this movie. Does an impossible painter become a fully capable man? This movie happened with nonsense and I would give them a movie. Norm Peterson's issue George Wendt must really be on a route to make this movie. The performance was inadequate and the story was even worse. As a rational and rational person, I could not understand the writer where this movie came from. The main character was inability, there was a hilarious and hilarious chain of events, and then the movie was over. An absurd act of conversation after a conversation is not a movie, but the train speaks no more than a word.
