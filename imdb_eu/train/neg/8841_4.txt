It has an interesting local parasomy, but the story is wrong with no tension or logical view. The role did not convince, even Patrick Kilpatrick, to play an excellent role in films like Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest of the cast is unknown (and not very good) except for Jeffrey Combs. (From the brilliant Herbert West Re-Animator trilogy). However, it may fall asleep here (such as what he does here). The main problem is that the actions of the characters do not make any sense. The story is quite dull and predictable, with computer effects meriting merits, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> This could be a lot better, I did not get good comments about that. It's below the average.
