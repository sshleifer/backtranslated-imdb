Yes, this film feels an incredible fear, I realized that I paid for it and I spent more than one hour of my life. The guy who came to think of me was a psyche, the actress Junkie and the worst actor I have ever seen. Believe me if you appreciate your time to avoid this movie, I understand that creating a movie requires money and some films do not have any money but that's not a stupid plot and a bad performance. I always support independent media when it deserves help, but such a movie is a bad title for these types of films. I'm still traumatized. I am no longer a trusting covert coverage.
