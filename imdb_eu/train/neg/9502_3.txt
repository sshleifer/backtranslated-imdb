This movie was curious, to be completely unexplained and hysterical to see if you were drinking at home with your friends. I like the beautiful opening of Lisa in a beautiful city that loses Lisa. I want to be a beautiful stranger lost in an exotic European country, although it may not be in a low budget horror movie. Certainly, the extravagant sex scenes that are not sexually sexual (in my DVD copy anyway) will end. Do not try to understand, go and look curious jewelry ... this is all. Do not see this if you want to plot it or characterize it or make sense. Pretty beautiful, though, so watch over and see the horror movie that you decide, as Dead Alive says.
