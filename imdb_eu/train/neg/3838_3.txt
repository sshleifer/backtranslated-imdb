Terry West got a good idea about the movie. He just did not push thru. They are always there and, surely, there are endless external appearance to face the film's durability. In this school there are only 2 students. Misty Mundae is common, but this movie will always be Ruby LaRocca (that is, she is the only reason to see the movie in the beginning). The script should look at the film that belongs to its character. It's GORGEOUS! Good news for DVD buyers is Terry West's first feature film (Terry West), a feature that I would like to say is that someone who does not deliver this movie at the end of a long joke is someone who does not feel right. Also, see this Ruby LaRocca.
