I do not know why I like Dolph Lundg. Think of seeing it all without thinking of anyone who works hard on the screen. Good feeling is that all of us who are not talented. According to other reviews, the arrests are stupid, but many are forgotten to emphasize positive. <br /> <br /> At least one movie that kills a bad teenager can not be bad. Why should the young cast cast so many stereotypical teenagers enter? Is not it another type of teenager? Does each teenager have an angry black man? Anyone like a pagan nerd? Very friendly and (in this movie) a slutty pregnant girl? It's a disturbed boy of white-haired anti-civil society, everyone agrees (but what is talent?). And a young boy, a young man who joins the universe, and so many neurotic children trust him. Then add as many generic colors as possible for people to use. They do not say much, but they shoot for a moment. <br /> <br /> The best arrests would be if the bad guy had got rid of the boys to school. Better within the writers. The conversation is bad and the plot is worse. After kidnapping a van by refuges after a bad boy (and girl), they sit inside the van. They take Van to school because they want to paint their school paint shop again, but they never again paint a van. By the way, it would be easier for you to put all your medications in another car or two cars or other trucks or trucks and drive away with Police Van without painting again. In addition, they never move drugs, sell them, or do anything with great scoring. <br /> <br /> For some reasons, children and teachers (Dolph Lundgren) must be killed, when criminals take school, no one is aware of it after remote schools. Still, a few people in school still have nothing to do with painting vehicles; so why do you keep going? <br /> <br /> However, the best part of this film is that it has many sticks that are armed by all criminals, and are looking for teens (including in a wheelchair) and hundreds of bullets are still filming. In teens and usually lost. At the end of the film there is a blood flow. Everyone shooting at least three hundred bullets is missing. Stunts is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I read one of the reviews that this movie had about a $ 10 million budget, and I was shocked. When I saw the movie, Lundg was perhaps a kind of charity for some film schools I was a teacher. This movie might end by the end of the year. It was a test to watch, but I passed it.
