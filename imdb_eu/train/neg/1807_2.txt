I admit that, after age at the age of hippie-blue, it is a sale for these types of films. I will enjoy some slaves of hippie genius much more than "normal". However, this film is horrible in every way. <br /> <br /> The senseless perceptions of hippie silliness are presented as gospels, young police officers dying a long plane on a calm ground. This movie is so awesome, but it's not fun to see the look of hippie drone abuses. A left version is like Dragnet, unless he is a professional actor. The only reason that gave me two stars was because of the dark interests in the soundtrack; Also, I was not able to find a selection of negative stars. <br /> <br /> It's not an actress, there's hardly any plot, it does not sheeze, it's just a script ... you've got a "art" movie ... All this is done in the root canal drilling slowdown, dragging each scene meaning to time. <br /> <br /> batean bizitza imitatzen duen arte bitxia, filma honetako "ez-aktore" izarrak bizitza errealeko herri batean sartu eta Bostoneko banku bat lapurtu zien, bere lapurretako batek hil egin zuen eta kartzelara bidali zuten eta halako halterofilia susmagarrian hil they had it. "accident" ... and think of it, that he should leave due to legacy ... Oy vey.
