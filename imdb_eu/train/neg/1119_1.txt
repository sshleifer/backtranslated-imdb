Although this movie was a supposed joke that was criticized, the movie is still awesome. If things are committed to such things, at least it's a good joke ... first of all, I think that Gerard Depardieu's poor Jeroen Krabbé ... I naturally hate Gerard Depardieu even though he was very funny about the 'Iron Mask' three in a musketeer. Otherwise, it's a box-office poison for me and Jeroen Krabbe is worse than that. Poor box at the box office ... this really is not foreclosed by economically prohibited rights. If the fourth man's criticism of the village was somehow ... what do I say? It is not. Let's say, hypothetically, if you were to have it it was not sharp enough. Satire is a tricky thing ... if I do not have enough sharpness, the viewer is a joke ... I think it has happened again. The story is just like an awful character, no one cares for anyone, nor even in an interesting way. (For an interesting and deserving application, watch any Luis Bunuel film ... very demanding). satire) <br /> <br /> [spoiler alert potential] <br /> <br /> Really, the crash of the cemetery that plays Jeroen Krabbé's characters ... is you even worried? Is it fun? As Mr Voerhoven is a good movie maker, I'm going to give him some doubt, and it's supposed to be a joke of misanthropic jokes ... but I did not guess Jeroen Krabbe. It is the worst actress, and all the characters that play it have been pretentious butt butt ... that's not enough. So it's a curious caricature. Do you think Mr Voerhoven has done this? and is Jeroen Krabbé joking? I do not see ... So you understand the problem here, right? The worst film ever is because it's a good director. So there is no doubt. He knew that Adjective was not so great as Adjection. Do not deceive the ships 'The 4th Man' or the good name of Voerhoven.
