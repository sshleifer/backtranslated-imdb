Dennis Hopper is undoubtedly one of the best American actresses of our time, and it was interesting how his role would play children in the series killer. Most of Hopper's film has always acted with a psychotic threat that threatens to break things, but in this movie Hopper pulled out his efforts to keep his emotion and intensity shield. When I got into the movie line, I was hooked, but at the end they are just small things that killed the movie. <br /> <br /> The concept of the film is great - they are not just moving police. To catch the killer, we can see how the gangster works the killer. A footballer's soccer product is ridiculous, but it is necessary to get the involvement of the killers dead. <br /> <br /> That's all you can say about cinema. While hopper tried to be a tough street and smart police force, I could not believe that the performance was smaller than its own, and there was not enough to be really attached to the case. It was also a great director: it was not a feeling of a true movie, but a television production. This is evident when the gangster fights for the first time to kill a group of elites. When he shot another gangster shooting a gang's head, his performance was weak, predictable, and incredibly rabbit. That is precisely the first thing that the action would be atrocious. <br /> <br /> The camera scroll was an amateur, and the memorable images of the killer's little sister were not a real distinctive effect. . If it was supposed to be terrifying, it was not. Everyone's acting was awful and even though Hopper did not feel about his character, and it really did not matter too much about his relationship with his daughter. <br /> <br /> Finally, the last thing that worried me. It's the most swat team. Once I saw the team after the action group, I thought something good at the end. But I was wrong. First of all, the entire swat team consisted of 4 men. That is impossible. Secondly, apparently the team does not do any training, because they take them through the hands of the HKA4 mitral. If the killer had been hidden behind the stairs with a rifle, these four giants would be broken down, because they did not even target or pay close attention. Both hands should be looking at the gun, but it just seems that they do not take the job seriously and they are just flaunting around. 3rd, members of the SWAT team do not say "Set your eyes, be careful, it is best for us ..." In fact, they use manual signals or radios. But they are literally shouting one another: how do you suppose when you hear the killer? And to finish all this, these guys do not plan - apparently they just run in a wild turkey pursuit. They do not do anything at all. It was the last straw. I am not an expert on special forces, but, basically, what we have already said is sensible. As the audience knows that the movie is horrible, the action becomes much more than saving the life of the movie: you can not do great action to make it a great action, the movie will lose. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I give the concept 2 stars, but the rest can not be paid. If you want to see a crime thriller, do not worry about it. There is a lot of movies, but there's a lot of emotion.
