I read the book "7 years Tibet" by Heinrich Harrer and I was fascinated. Then I immediately started watching the DVD and the movie. I remember for the first time I saw it in the 98, I liked it. Well, now I saw the whole knowledge of the book based on it again. and soon I noticed how wrong they were told: <br /> <br /> When people go to Lhasa, people get out of their mouths and start Thewlis and Pitt's impression on how to greet Tibet. That's why they are greeted again ... In the book Harrer, sticking the tongue to the Dalai Lama in front of the enormous humility and loyalty of Tibet, they can do it, but not for the two Europeans! not only his mother, but also the Dalai Lama himself wearing glasses in the public. He mentions in Harrer's book that no one in Tibet had been dressed at that time (I feel like I forget the reason, but it also appears in the book). The young Dalai Lama did it, but he was alone and nobody could see him! and what does Mao Tse look like, destroy the mandala in front of the young "Living Buddha"? ?? children ... and custom made Harrer and Aufschnaiter Tibetan clothes, not European designer outfits! why have happened to so many stories that happened to fill the fictional love of the most irrelevant time (women's clothes ...). Harrers son, like a whole story about rolf. There is no mention whatsoever of the word, nor any member of the book-entry family. But that was fine for me, "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about a harrers person. about his Tibetan This "adaptation" of the famous book is very disappointed. and I bet heinrich Harrer too ... 3 stars for cinematography.
