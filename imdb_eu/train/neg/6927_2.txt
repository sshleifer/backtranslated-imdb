Despite the fact that this movie was worth 2, despite the effort to create a horror film, 10 have been unluckily fun on the scale. He knew what people were or knew about the movie, but it did not matter, because each scene would have something to laugh at. The interview is minimal throughout the movie, but I think they have started shooting without scripts. There is no groundbreaking movie, the movie is very adaptable. It does not matter if you can sit down and watch the movie from the beginning to the end or delay, you will be confused with pleasure. Especially I like the scene of the prisoners walking around, sticking with one stick. I think this doctor is the treatment. Genius!
