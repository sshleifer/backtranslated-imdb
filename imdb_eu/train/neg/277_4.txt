Lillian Hellman's work, adapted from Hellmax's Dashiell Hammett, is a curious project to get out with Warner Bros. Paul Lukas confirmed the role of Broadway and won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Waging a American wife and three children before finding a shelter across Europe (through the Mexican border). Washington's wife and a wealthy brother settles in Washington, but a man from the lodge immediately revitalizes them and will spend a lot of time playing at the German embassy. It seems that this drama is definitely needed to find its focus, and when we realize the heart of the material (reflecting on the sudden reflection of the Americans who teach the wise, honest, right-sided refugees), it seems to be a little too protective - the viewer relies on relatively relatives, giving it Lukas has several lectures in the third year of the Academy Award, but the smallest part of the image, however, does not go in but he has quit, enter and exit. As her spouse, Bette Davis tells anyone else, and her wide-eyed looks good, but the role does not leave much color. Their children (all with funny accents!) Are alternatives and annoyances, and Geraldine Fitzgerald does not act as a wife of any roles (and the shameful text she gives to the piece is totally wrong). Here the intention was to show it tastefully (Second World War II) that a man could be German, which has not become a Nazi refugee. In the first minutes we get that; The tasty movie and the rest of this touch to the exhibition, defense and, finally, compassion. The mixture should be malignant, but it would be sufficiently dry and inert to the eye. ** ****
