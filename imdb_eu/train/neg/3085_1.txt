Description: Corny, stupid and insignificant. So it's cheap and lame, it will ask you why these people are abnormally silent, even if they wasted 2 months or so I spent a budget (this I guess ...) probably more than $ 700 for this movie. Visiting with or without Mystery Science Theater was hysterical. I offer you the best advice in the world: <br /> <br /> Pay, leave your time, life and money, NO - I repeat again, or even discuss this movie. The movie is so crisp, it will hate your boredom with boredom in your face. If you have a single number coefficient, be my guest and watch a totally wonderful movie. You really admire it. (As I said before, if you have a single digit IQ) <br /> <br /> About myself, about 12 actors, some puppets you've bought for garage, and of course cameras and music today. You'll make a little more fun in the home video than the absolute crap of this piece.
