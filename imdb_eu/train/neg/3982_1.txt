Forget about God's love for the movie! It's time to lose, it's predictable on the plot, like romantic scenes. Trying to build a lot of things, using just a little bit, this movie and its evil predict the evil one. The characters are not developing, and most of the films are covered with Roman plans, which is much more interesting than movies. In front of all, the play is a shame. I know everyone tries to find niches, but it's really a disaster. I can not believe that someone has paid millions of pounds for screening this movie. Do not waste money or time in this movie, go to see your grandmother or something worthwhile.
