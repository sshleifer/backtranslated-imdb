People like Moody and their people are doing their work. I'm sitting in the night sitting. It seemed to me, it's just as good as Ringu, as I suppose from these comments, it might be that it's worth my time. <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyway, to find the next director (or writer), but I do not think it's Miike. I do not have a Master's Degree in Fine Arts at NYU, but I know a lot: a horror movie has to go through it. Also, the movie is more credible than this movie. <br /> <br /> The steps of this film shook my head. Some of the final scenes can be dragged so badly, I went to the fridge and Kou Shibasaki looked at the camera, apparently for a few minutes, his eyes wide open. Once a reputable director has made a claim, and I'm parasitizing, a movie will be turned on by a beautiful woman's camera, and that's why she can throw it. Kou is not enough actor to do that. It's more than just over the scenes as it reminds me of stopping by dead girls. And it's not the only one that resembles a deer of heads; Other cast members seem to imitate this non-performance. The script gives a little space for much more time. <br /> <br /> I like cinema in Asia. Hong Kong's films include movies like "Phone" and "Koma", Ang Lee's film, some of the Filipino movies, sex and free fight, as well as others. I did without Chakushin Ari
