I will say a lot: this director is about all the RAW images ... most of the things are not ready to fight. The images of people of sex, suicide, murder, and "freedom" are continually bombarding the viewer, and I ask why the director tries to communicate the concept of relief or release. I do not think I could ever watch this movie again, I would say that the director looks good. They were very nice and "photographic moments" in the film (fans, hairdressing in hairs), but I needed more story (we asked for a sharp follow-up) that we were just going to see. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Note: If you tend to easily or harden ... do not see this film.
