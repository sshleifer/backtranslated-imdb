I have seen other guinea pig films, such as Mermaid, a Manhole and Never Die. Although they are sick, they are at least humorous (though dark). The devil's experiment, however, is nothing more than shooting a series of punks that has shot a lot of torture and violence on a young girl, and there is no plot and it's not for that value. It's not a distant fear, maybe except the set of heads, but it's definitely a nuisance and I do not call entertainment. Now, I'm not a fan of the movie's good taste and I like my trash and sleaze, but that's been too much for me, really. I am totally disturbing. In fact, I'm looking for a superfluous possibility, but it has been a lot more. She throws a young woman, beaten, is sent to the headphones until it is poured into the headphones, then throws raw meat and walnuts and hangs it in the hammock in the woods. Do you think this looks so good, go, but definitely put on guinea pig for more things to see. From 10th, totally nauseous.
