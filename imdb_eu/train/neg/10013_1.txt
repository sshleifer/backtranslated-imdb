In a murder case, a man comes out on a plot of a man who rap out a woman. The same identical line of somewhere outside the outside will come out. In this case, we would think that the movie will rise above the horrible origins. But the scene after the drones after the scene is not a change in intensity, no arcs of characters, and inexplicable behavior. It seems to include only viewers. When will Hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically create a bigger image? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately a horrifying movie. When will Lauren Bacall choose a good one? I expected better, and Kristin Scott Thomas. This is definitely a lost one.
