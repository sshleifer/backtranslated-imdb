How many times do we have to freeze in the back and see a step through the reflection mirror? In the last twelve films, the last memory has been made and four dozen films in this nasty and evil movie. It seems they were just two moments ... when the ghost invaded the personal space of two characters. When talking about the characters, the 64-oz in the theater was as flat as the Diet Diet coke. I was drawing a cup. Second-person characters could come out of cartoon Scooby Doo. There was a friendly sheriff. There was kooky weirdo living with backwoods along with Alabama drawl. Lots'o'cars are not developing. It was the beginning of the child who killed the worst image. Instead of studying the child's murder, it could be interesting that they were able to find out that they were dead and that their parents were difficult to reconcile death with the community and together. When they arrived at the cabin, the scenes rarely flush together ... the flashing images of the dead daughter were here and there. Oh ... and the sounds were awesome. You know what I mean ... the only doors that open are screams, farm crickets, yada yada yada. Ooooohhhh. It was not seen before. Once again, you'll see the amazing movie auto opening door again. NOTE TO THE DIRECTOR: Scary horror scene is only 5 minutes in the same movie. Think of these things before calling them "It's a wrap!"
