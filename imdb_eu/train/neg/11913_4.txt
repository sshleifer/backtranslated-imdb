Good idea, poorly implemented. Although it shortens 99% of the SciFi channel, it really applies. I love movies that reveal a short story back in a flashy way, and I like movies, and I like all the main actors, so it might be perfect. However, despite good performances, the movie fails due to the bad writing and direction of Bill Platt. <br /> <br /> Another review came in handy to where you're going to find out where you need to find out. This movie is not. The word "Second draft" is contained in the Bill Clatt dictionary, which is not known differently. A scene is completely useless and can be removed without realizing it. This scene starts and it starts to drive with the car, cut off the scene of the car and not miss the amazing mid-stage. <br /> <br /> This film also had a strange habit. explaining some details, while explaining others, some to confront the "plot" as a whole. It also has a habit of canceling a fight, they probably can not afford it. There are some laughably bad scenes where the "plot" of a computer and the ultimate comfortable is implied by "toxic adhesives" (seriously, what is * that *). <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch because the movie is fine. His "Roswell" breaks down several times and makes it hard (but not always). Since John De Lancie plays ST, he plays the same character that plays with TNG, so there's nothing new. <br /> <br /> In short, I gave this movie a 4/10 score.
