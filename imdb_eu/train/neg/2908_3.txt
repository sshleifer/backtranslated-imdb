It is based on one of Gabriel Marquez's books, and it can be a fascinating literature, but film arrangements really suck on sleeping rather than about cinematic cinematography. The story, when his son died, is about an old couple living with a life span, and the main character, one day, is a chicken that awaits a little bit of money. I'm not going to throw any more words about this unnecessary piece of paper, so you can see Salma Hay here, but sitting 90 minutes before your screen? Thank you no .....
