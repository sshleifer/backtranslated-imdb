The shooting team did not have good access to the occupied territories, so filming for the Israelis was prevalent. My mother seemed to be almost completely unfavorable. The mother of Israel lost a child who had the opportunity to be happy. She lost a lost mother of Palestine and a life of desperation. With totally different views, no meeting was found. The word "peace" was not the same meaning for each one of them. Palestine peace was freedom. Israel's peace was security. With such a cliff, is this type of movie really worth much? I ended my feeling of endless propaganda. Both parties did not believe it.
