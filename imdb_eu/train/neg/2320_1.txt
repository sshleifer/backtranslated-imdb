This film is made for the Asian / Chinese market, Jay Chou, one of the greatest stars of Asian Asian music, especially for fans. <br /> <br /> Jay Chou is a singer and talented singer. In the midst as an actor, although he appeared in some high-budget productions ("initial D", "Curse of the Golden Flower"). Surprisingly, the Golden Horse (Taiwan) and Hong Kong film won the "D start" entry. <br /> <br /> The help works are very well-chosen, that is, mainly called by all Chinese. A number of feature films / TV actors, singers and sports commentary (including Huang Jianxiang, China). However, they did not have enough time to show their talent. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake Chu took on the role of directors and writers. From inconsistent coherence, it is one of the most profound and inexpressible films. With the lack of leadership and the story of poverty, the whole talent was lost, the elegant views and the tone of the production were wasted. <br /> <br /> However, the wonderful film has won more than 10,000 million dollars, perhaps even more Asian, which has been one of Asia's largest box office. <br /> <br /> It's the last line: you can watch this movie if you want to see if you're losing money and talent, or just, just like Jay Chou's friends.
