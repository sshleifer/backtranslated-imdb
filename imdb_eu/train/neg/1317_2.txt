When Kino Video's people picked up their wonderful "Slapstick Encyclopedia" collection, a selection of multi-cassette comedy silks, someone who decided that ONE TOY MANY (1916) was the first to star in Florida. Oliver Hardy is very young. As the group is so pleasing, this decision was unhappy; ONE TOO MANY is a very poor movie, which sees the viewer as remote. Everything is typical of farce, that is, greed, fear, when the plans go wrong, and complications lead to nonsense, but unlike Good, ONE TOO MANY is not consistent, shameless, and very annoying. It is difficult to know whether or not these plots are unreasonable due to the lack of footage or footage due to the fact that they are not produced, but regardless of the cause, the highest level of alertness in the middle of the road does not affect the nature of the relationship or what is happening. , and at the end it is no longer in custody. <br /> <br /> Here, a 24-year-old "Babe" Hardy, seems to be more heavily laden than a decade later. Stan Laurel, but who is, however, filled with young energy. When the first scene is awakening with the hangover, Babe backs off athlete from bed. Believe us, this movie is just as fun. Before reading Kino's "Slapstick Encyclopedia" before reading the first case, I suggest that you move faster and get things right.
