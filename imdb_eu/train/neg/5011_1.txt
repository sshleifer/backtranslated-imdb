... And I never thought it worth it to be a movie 1! But this is the worst movie ever I've ever seen. My wife picked up the bootstrap, but the story seems almost DVD to be foreseen. It's not a mystery or even a youth. It does not take sensuality, whatever you can suggest remotely from the titles. This is not a total. Do not waste your time or money, if you do not want to see young guys in a group of youngsters who are behind them. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing that you can not see. Max Makowski makes Nick Stahl the worst.
