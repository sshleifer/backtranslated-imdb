I'm among the millions who think Cary Grant fans, but I did not think the only reason to recommend this movie. I do not understand Betsy Drake's interrogation, and it seems that no one else should do it, later on, the number of smaller movies he played. <br /> <br /> Most fans will accept Katharine Hepburn behind Cary Grant and admit that they would be excellent at catching. Here they try to restore the director or writer. It's an idea, but fails miserably. "Drake" "Creepy" was how I read the comments, but I think this was a very mild description, through which Franchot Tone crossed it. The lost disaster is a thing. This movie is a disaster. <br /> <br /> This is not worth 10 comment lines and I do not know why this condition is. This badly was saved when so many movies are worth when rocks break. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to torture someone, give this width.
