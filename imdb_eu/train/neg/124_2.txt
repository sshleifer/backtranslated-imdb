This movie, surely, is Godard's Masculin, inspired by FÃ©minin and I invite you to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has two strong elements that are (1) realistic (2) impressive. welcome, picture In addition, the one that most likes me is the endless current of misfortune. Lena Nyman must be annoying actors in the world. He makes stupidity with all the nudity in this film, ... it's not attractive. Compared to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced by stupidity. Without going far beyond this, I would say that it comes from the differences between French and Swedish societies. <br /> <br /> The movie and place of his time. 2/10.
