Impatient, redundant and humiliating looks about "Elm Street on Nightmare on!" Part 6 is so difficult that Rachel Talalay's director wanted Wes Craven's premise to become a bad joke and tasty. This is not the worst entry in the "Elm Street" saga; It's one of the most horrifying horror films ever made and the genre fans fail! The story is silent, the drawings of the characters are hilarious, the structures are completely dark and ?? above all? The special and visual effects resemble the cartoonist Tom and Jerry. Freddy Krueger's sequences that kill his victims are endless and very uninteresting. Did we imagine an arrogance that a loud Freddy did turn into a Breckin Meyer video game character and be poked around the walls of the house? The story takes us to Springwood and, suddenly, Freddy seems like a daughter of age. What would be mentioned in one of the previous adventures, but not? There is only one survivor of Springwood, and Krueger uses her to contact a lost daughter. Another reason why this last installment is so huge is a completely logical structure. John Doe-boy is the main character, but he suddenly dies and the plot continues on two adults! Unfortunately, Freddy Krueger, when he was only killed by teens with five films, two adults turn on 3D glasses. Something similar destroys the whole essence, right? As I am worried, the series "Nightmare on Elm Street" has always been overwhelmed, but at least some of the most up-to-date elements were recovering. "Freddy's Dead", however, is not enough unbearable and nobody can miss their precious time.
