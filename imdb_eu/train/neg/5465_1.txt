This movie has a special place in the worst movie I've ever seen in my heart. It's very funny doing hard-working manuals with stomach hazards. It starts a bad movie (I would rate the first minute of the movie by 1/10) and it will be progressively worse for minutes. The only way to fully value it would be a negative cliff that grows at a temperature of ninety minutes. Unfunny is not a real word, but this video describes humor better. In some ways, the video also gets dressed in a cute and generous female, and sex looks grotesque and enjoyable. This movie is very bad. I would say it would be better to be locked once with TITANIC theme and to look for Buscemi's FROM LA character in your ears to see this movie. The consequences are not nearly as bad. If you need to rent a Troma movie, get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I'd rather 5 return Tony Little ads back than the NUKEM HIGH CLASS once again. Do not get it wrong, it was a great film that was needed to make this movie a great movie and if it's an amazing film ever worth it, that is.
