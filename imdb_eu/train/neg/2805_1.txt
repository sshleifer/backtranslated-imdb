This adaptation breaks a classic that is loved by its subtlety. Timothy Dalton does not understand the different shades of Rochester's character. I am sorry I never read the book, it was included in its tight trousers and was given a summary of "Grumpy Person, Broody, Murky Past." He plays Rochester as a character or a real person, but never strikes a smirk over a smile until he becomes a thought that turns it hanging. There is no chemical The only modification that I had for my enthusiasm was the sensation and sincere sympathy of Charlotte Bronte's definitive expression in his grave. GO AND REREAL BOOK. ROCHESTER IS PERSONALITY. AND ACCORDING TO THE WAY: I RECEIVED THE "PASSIONATE" REGION WITHOUT YOU.
