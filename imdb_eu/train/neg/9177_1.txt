I was the worst movie I've ever seen in the House of the Dead, I slept with the "pathetic matrix" 360 angle of the camera and the theater of the cheese. I do not think the director or the director should decide whether to rain or not, it would rain on one side of the ship and not the other. I'd rate this movie from 10 to 10 (being 10 best, 1 being the worst). The jumping movie scene was also very annoying, asking if you're asking yourself if they were doing a bit of time. Anyone who reads it, I ask that you do not see it. It's not worth the time.
