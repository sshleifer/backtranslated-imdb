Amazing. So you could say through this movie. Simply, incredibly, amazing. It's really so amazing that anyone could have made money to make this monstrosity that you do not believe in what you see. This, my friends, is a fear about this movie. Thinking that someone thought it was a good idea. <br /> <br /> Well, here is another amazing story: High School students (sometimes like college students) seem to be a mistress of a mother, she lives in the trailer park and she is a ridiculous "artist". because it's all its "different". Well, of course, this ugly little boy dies at the end, and here's the original part, he lives in a crazed soul (under which his mother's soldiers will die the last John). Next, it surrounds people with the standard murder of the people who were harmed. Awww. <br /> <br /> Here is the distribution: <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> - Fun and amusing film? Even though this is not clear, the filmmakers wanted it. <br /> <br /> - At $ 5.00 a couple of Wal-Marts is just a drive and an excessive price. <br /> <br /> It does not injure you, it's not Help: <br /> <br /> - Violence and gore are sub-standard. One person is stuck with a stem of corn. <br /> <br /> - Are the sounds sounds like music making an effort? But it does not really fit the movie and it's not all that. /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> - Terrible, horrible annoyance. - A slasher with a slasher under a sexy woman; none of them removes clothes. When did he leave that bashful slashers basic? <br /> <br /> - A ridiculous story. <br /> <br /> - Txorimaloak invites one-liner Freddy Krueger and would have it Arnold Swartzenegger blush. <br /> <br /> - The standard story underlying love is nowhere wrong and it's wrong. <br /> <br /> - Do people seem to be randomly selected? You never know who it is and then die. And you will assume that this is only necessary. <br /> <br /> Ugly: <br /> <br /> - Slasher mean, especially with a scarecrow, instead? well, that's all the other thing. <br /> <br /> - Not as interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky or Angela's "Sleepaway Camp" series? This cruelty. <br /> - The deepest conversation I've ever heard on MY LIFE. The script is never loading the level of delay I can not think of. Here I am serious, it's a great step. Do not get bad writing, but it's fun, but I've never heard a template again in "Slumber Party Massacre III." This movie looks like "Jason X" Shakespeare's. <br /> <br /> - Becomes a Scarecrow The dying man: Even worse, when a conversation comes in. <br /> <br /> A significant event: <br /> <br /> - Young people in primary education cast their bright conversation: "Let's go and find some animals to torture. Huh huh "Playing: 3/10 Story: 3/10 Spotlight: 2/10 Filmmaking: 1/10 Character development: 2/10 Special effects / Make-up: 5/10 Bravery / Sexuality: 1/10 (nudity, mother is a whore, girls are not breastfeeding) Violence / Gore: 5/10 (Low quality, average amount) Interview: 0/10 (Very hilarious, shameless, up and painful fun ?? It's so good. My first movie in any interview!) Music: 5/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 10/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10 <br /> <br /> People like me like others, who enjoy watching the crap, or Slasher-movies, this is not a good movie. Conversation and boring characters are really boring. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
