"Cut" is a movie about students who make a movie. "Scream" is a horror ironic and self-referential film, because at least it's falling for me, it's just a bad horror movie with all ironies, like the films mentioned. <br /> But he was not without his charm. Well, only one charm. Molly Ringwald was a fantastic actress as an affair with the American amateur film that he hugged every minute he cooperated with. It was so compelling to believe that he did not think that action, everyone who says "Cut" says he had a great job. :-) <br /> <br /> <br /> Seriously, it was a very good scene with his toe, cold laugh or snap. All others, however, turned away from being mistaken and terribly woody. <br /> <br /> In any case, it has some lace "Cut", gore cubes (some are surprisingly awful) and in the end ... it's just another horror movie.
