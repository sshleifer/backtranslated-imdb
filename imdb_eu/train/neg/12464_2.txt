This movie, presumably, had a thriller that had five sub-plot sites that were developed at the same time at the end, but it ended more as a yawn. <br /> <br /> Writing was a trifle, the pace was slow and imbalanced. and the characters were boring. George Clooney seems to have to go into the gym, Matt Damon insulted and others read their lines through a telepompter. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this film was that this craftsman was carefully made politically correct and, therefore, without saying anything about major businesses, oil and the Middle East. The documentaries have seen more enthusiasm. Just look at it.
