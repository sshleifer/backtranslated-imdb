Although I have reviewed the movie for about two years, I remember how my opinion was very low. Originally loved by the Little Mermaid, and babies could be obsessed as a child, I would take the time to sit and watch. Disney, I have a small message for you. If you do not have the original director and the actors ... you just need to knock your butt. <br /> <br /> In the afternoon, our story begins with Ariel and her daughter a little older. Melody. My main problem was singing Eric and the rest of the crew. Yes, I understand that Disney's songs and dance numbers are great, but really Eric was my favorite prince. He was calm, collected and honest. And he did it. NO. SING. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And then it is evil. Oh, how can we forget about the horrors that emerged from our spinalities when the Ursula is on the screen, Ariel and audiences all over the world? Unfortunately, this gene was not transmitted to Morgana's apparently useless sister. Nothing ever happened, he never said in the first film about Morgan; He goes out of nowhere, trying to steal the baby. Oh, what's nice. The younger sister is selected and instead of the trident, she decides to kidnap a month-old baby. Gag me <br /> <br /> In addition to being a flat character that is not flat and innovative, Morgana was very orthodox. His sister, as much as the same plan (whoever did not scare anyone. I was three years old when I saw this movie, and laughed it in an historique). ; I would like my mother to be a lie. I'm sure Tish Little Miss could do a better job. <br /> <br /> King Triton did not even make the respect for the first movie for me, and I did not even get it in Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder. Triton was a strict but loving father in the first film, and in the latter he nearly lost his will to the fear of his subjects. Scuttle, once he made a comical relief, everyone could laugh at his 'dingle-hopper' (yes, I'll admit it, from time to time I called my fork dingle-hopper). Scuttle has forgotten. He also gave a first character, at least a movie. The others were not rich in flavor, and in the afternoon, they all completely removed. Sebastian was still the same, but worst as before. Disney, do not do that. Do not even try to mix with our favorite crab. Or our favorite is a small fat fish, a dad who is a father and has many very annoying children. It's fat and smooth, and it looks like a flat line goes like the second one. <br /> <br /> There was no need for the walrus and the penguin, and after a while, you just annoyed everyone. Above all, Melody, who has no depth. <br /> <br /> And these days, Disney, I got out of my life. <br /> <br /> I do not love you or your originals so much.
