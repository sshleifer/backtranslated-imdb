This movie is not very good. In fact, I've seen the worst movie Elvis. There are very few terrains, especially the party, to drink and fight beer. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted. I do not know why they made this movie. We can say that Elvis was also useless, much better, called "Follow That Dream."
