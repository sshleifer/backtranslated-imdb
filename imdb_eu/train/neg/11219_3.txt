It was a film about defencelessness and revenge. A twin pair of "twins" feels that their sister feels something wrong. This movie has been forever staged in the plot. A plot that has been done several times. Efficiency was most often. When the plot comes together, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley are twins who are twins who live with their parents abuse. The father seems to go to Ashley, so Laura all blames her. There is no promise that promises to be never distinguished by girls, but as they grow, life goes into different directions. Ashley works at a dinner party because he is confronted with a man married to Barry. Of course, it's not good. Barry's jest was considered a bad excuse to get him to continue. I was looking forward to improving this movie and there is not any point in the resolution, but it never happened.
