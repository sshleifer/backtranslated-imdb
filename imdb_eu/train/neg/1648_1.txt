Personally, although I am able to rate good films, I also have a curious ability to enjoy the most beautiful dogs. You know, sit at that time and the time to see the horror movie cookie-cutter action. I recall that this movie is the only movie I remember that is turned off in the middle, and I do not want to go back completely. The plots were so ephemeral and predictable, I was easily telling the next scene (and I'm not very well for that). Actor was horrible, I saw performing in the middle theater as a better one. The cut scenes were also bad, the flow was totally wrong. <br /> <br /> It's like a parody that forgot the funny movie.
