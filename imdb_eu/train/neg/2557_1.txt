I really like asylum movies. I have been accustomed to seeing as much as possible. Their reals have also been like the EXORCISM and READER READER. This is just empty. I can not believe DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA'S CURSE did the same person who made the movie !!! JOLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION is a bad mistake (by the way, it's pretty bad). This is just BAD! I mean, I know and / or I am forgiven by playing bad performances or special effects in an Asylum movie, but this film takes it seriously. I really hope that READING SNAKES is better. Now I can not see the movie.
