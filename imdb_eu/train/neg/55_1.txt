There are less than two films at 10:00, that is, "The man who fell on the ground." I remember watching the protocol when I was in the theater at the beginning of the 80's. The script insults anyone (including a high school student). She was totally lost with someone who filmed "ass" with an "extreme" joke. Goldie is supposed to be charming here, but it is necessarily chorizo. Then the Arabs are offensive stereotypes and then all Goldie have won populist dribble spouting. The play was awful, including Goldie Hawn. I could not see another movie until the IMO recovered itself, Everyone says I love you. This is the type of movie you do not want to write your script. Worst
