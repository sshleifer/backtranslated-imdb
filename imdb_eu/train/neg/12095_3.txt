Elfriede Jelin, who has not yet been named, has won the Nobel Prize for Literature. His novel won awards for men and women who won the second prize in Cannes. I'm a dinosaur in cosmetic estimation or art is so badly doing anything? In the film world, a turkey is a monumental flop at the box office entrance or critical reception. 'Gobble, gobble' and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners. <br /> <br /> The embarrassing embarrassment of this highly praised film can not be overvalued. It starts really bad, as if it were boring against the viewer. Credits are missing a scene of more than 11 minutes. It is presented to the teacher Erika Kohut, apparently author of the author, a piano teacher. Mother lives and lives with her husband. Father is a hidden exhibit and is not seen during the passing of that act. <br /> <br /> Reviewing the piano teacher is difficult, beyond its unpleasant registrations. When I'm watching the movie (and I've read in the book, though, I know) it's a tale of an emotional pendulum that does not move from one story to another, it's exploitative and nonsensical. <br /> <br /> Erika, a name that is used to a minimum, is initially shown as a person with a strong musical sensitivity, but is completely repressed. It's not quite, because the two-step scene bags are deeply dislocated about his gravelly-voiced maman early in the process. If a reviewer (snooping) needs to take a leitmotif (why he does not use the simplest word), Elrica would change corporeal moods. <br /> <br /> Young Hunk, Walter, became a low-voltage engineer, that is to say, playing ice hockey during his time of recreation, is also a talented pianist. He met Elcura in an old apartment in a luxury apartment in Paris. In so much fashion of art, he immediately falls in love with the "cherchez la femme". <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Walter makes a great audition and Erika is admitted as a private fellow, teaching her remotely, hostility, inadequacy and humiliation. <br /> <br /> Soon he declares his love and Erika plays for Ladies for a long time with Ladies, with a slight and unpleasant oral sex. Erika maintains control over her love dog. It will require a training letter for more enjoyable treatment. <br /> <br /> In the meanwhile, the heavy jealousy of Walter's delight makes him literally dressed before another rehearsal for the next concert. Erika fills the student's pocket with pockets full of glass, creating serious drawbacks to these delicate hands. <br /> <br /> The next big scenes (the rest of the genital auto-cut, etc.) Walter shows Erika's apartment with her mother. Erika wants to be humiliated, bound, willing, and so forth. Walter is sensitive, for now, he spits back and returns tonight. <br /> <br /> At this time, it's still an hour. Audience can not be afraid. Erika Walter puts skating skateboard when ice-skating is done. They take them back to the room. Lusty Wally can not take his pants off his hands. His 'baby sauce' is soon thrown away with other stomach contents. Ho hum <br /> <br /> Having tried to avenge an offense on the ground, perhaps, Erika returned home. What happens now guessing? It is not very deep or difficult. Yes, he becomes an animal while Erika becomes a victim. For a moment the mother is locked in her room and Erika moves her face to the next, replacing her with love with her and sex. <br /> <br /> I am a summary in this summary? Check out the movie, but I would not recommend it. <br /> <br /> Anyone can see eternal remains in a good sense of humor. If I wanted to, I felt before a challenge to the representation of human relationships given by this movie. But "I prefer not," because it is a cheap and slick movie called the "core instincts". <br /> <br /> I think I suppose Erika's parents' suppression is looking for love, ineffective. pornography, inappropriately excludes, when it literally appears, pink and beard, under the nose, he fully realizes that I do not like injuries, blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> The world, for reasons, there is no explanation, he retreated. Apparently, it seems that someone who loves superficiality does a monster that appears, but we surely know that any human being is a potentially violent, because he does not try to speak of his own essential nature and the world. <br /> <br /> In the end, if there is patience there, there is a small little one. Before going to the last scene, as a student with a whitewashed suit with alternate hands, Erik enters the knife in her purse. For Walter? <br /> <br /> Yes, I am before. Life is at risk and leaves leaves. Roll credits <br /> <br /> If the second prize has been won in Cannes, how bad was the rest of the tickets?
