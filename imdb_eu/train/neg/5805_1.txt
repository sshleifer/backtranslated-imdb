Anyone who saw the original would have to go out and destroy the horrible restart. Steve McQuein's attempt to imitate Alex Baldwin's word just works in a remake. While Baldwin has done an admirable job, it's from the beginning to the end of the flop. McQueen was a charisma, never tried to compete with a star. As for Kim, he said Ali McGraw's role. McQueen seemed dangerous, threatening and compelling with Doc, the movie was excited and suspense, Baldwin and companies introduced them into a comedy, I laughed at the moment I saw the wonderful movie. And Michael Madsen's hairstyle is horrible, one of the most exciting and believable actresses! Makeup people play to Michael Strogoff, what they thought. If you want to see the way Sam Peckinpah's way, get the original!
