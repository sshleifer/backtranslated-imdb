How can the movie Ozzy Osbourne and still suck? I do not know. Trick or Treat is made. He liked it and liked it. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat is one of those films to be warned. He demands overwhelming horror atrocities to make yourself feel worse. Trick or Treat does not have amortizing functions. <br /> <br /> For a heavyweight movie, it seems I do not know what heavy metal is or what it means. This film transforms the appearance of heavy metal, which happened in 1986, probably one of the most powerful hours of heavy metal. This is quite successful, but negative. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat = you will be so bad to see yourself angry. This simple equation goes away from this film that is unmanageable and dirty.
