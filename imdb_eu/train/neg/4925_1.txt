Please do not waste your time. This film confirms Blade (high-tech toys) by Bram Stoker's Drakular (Van Helsing), Anne Rice's Vampire Lestat (bad rock and biblical references). I really like vampire movies and novels, and many are very good. But that's not it. There is no soundtrack, especially because the movie is scary of classical music, as it is known as "kick-ass metal". I only heard a few times on any metal; mostly tortured violins. Avoid garlic and garlic.
