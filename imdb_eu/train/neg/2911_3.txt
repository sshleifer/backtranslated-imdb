This movie is not surprising, predictable, pretentious and mere. The settings are loyal to that period, but they are more aware of the increase in exposure intensity. It's over the artifacts that stops action and almost as much as just a clue conversation. Tom Hanks, however, did Bruce Willis sleep like he did in Hart's War at night. Tom, you can not give a character to the depths of your face being empty! The content was not taking place in Paul Newman's performance. This is covered by an atomic bomb.
