It's hard to hate almost the hatred of this movie. But I try: <br /> <br /> Every other word was a symbol, sex scene was uncomfortable, drugs were uncomfortable and there were more stereotypes than the rule, if it were not against Italian Americans. <br /> </ br> I did not say the play was horrible, Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito et. Well, it's done well. But ... I deny all the characters in the movie. Not all Vanity of the Bonfire has liked all the screen characters.
