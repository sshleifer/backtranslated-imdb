Whoopi Goldberg is poor. Imagine a friend's dinner and add a comment on a deep political comment. People simply look at her, "Oh, you know, you were the star of Theodore Rex." How would someone wear his head a little after his head? Little children would be terrified at this. He reminded me of a particularly bad episode of "Sigmund and The Sea Monsters". Actually, think of "Sigmund" much better than that. <br /> <br /> And did it anyway? Did the producer spoil it out of unlawful substances before telling him about it? Look at this terrible condemnation at your own risk.
