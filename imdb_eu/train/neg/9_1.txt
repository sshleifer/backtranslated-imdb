This is what I have ever seen. Almost never rejects the thriller type and gets all the mess. <br /> <br /> There is not a good line or character in the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was a thought and, in terms of performance, there is no good meaning, so I will not say anything. I can not honestly understand how this nonsense is generated and how it is released, somebody thinks somewhere: "My god is really a murderer" and I call it one day. In this way, the trailer that unleashes people illegally, the trailer is completely different, at least when you download it, you do not waste your time and money. Do not waste your time, that's painful.
