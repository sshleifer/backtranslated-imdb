YOU WOULD LIKE ... HELP WITHOUT HELPING LIGHTING - it's the main thought that I thought after seeing the movie. And I do not understand anyone with any myth. Although, perhaps, it was a good idea, but the effect was miserable. Especially, I mean Graham Graham's role. What was that ??? In my opinion, it has destroyed all the positive intentions of the producers. The character was damaged and annoying. Every time it appears, it reminds you that you are watching a movie and you are destroying the spirit of the moment, because you see the whole movie, what you can see is that it's stupid attempts to create emotional facial expression. TERRIBLE, do not waste your time.
