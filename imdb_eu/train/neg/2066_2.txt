After two long and long openings, after seeing one of my brothers and having seen the other, we start fast. Obviously, the girls that follow with JACKASS or Tom Green are also terribly stupid to find out about the issues that arise, SEX OLYMPICS (I do not need to give any details), and a clown. It basically makes "little clown bad" a little bit. I think now that I've seen about ninety times that I'll eat my thighs beetles, well, it'll give you more power. <br /> <br /> I want to indicate that, although you've heard it, the movie is not a lot more fun than KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE, or not. The Skit movie has already been made, TO CONTRIBUTE USE TO USE IT, SEE YOURSELVES OF SEX OF CONTINUOUS STANDARDS, and so on. And better.
