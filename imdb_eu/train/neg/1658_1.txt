This is probably a boring film of history. I really expected this movie to see the movie given to Roman Polanski. I think I'd like to watch over three films more than ever. The DVD player came directly to the trash. What you like about this movie, however, likes Coca-Cola New. I do not like knowing why they like this movie, it's slow, dull and has no plot. You wait 105 minutes to start the movie. I understood that it was done in 1976, but it was a time of bad television. Thank God's disco and the Three's Company go along with stop signals glasses and Bay City Rollers. Well, just my thoughts.
