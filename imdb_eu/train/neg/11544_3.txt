I really expected to see that, I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is an elegant actress. At first it was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. Soon it will be drawn to the main plot, that is, a group of unknowns will attack and Dyer beats badly while beating Anderson. Then they decide to get revenge. It's good, right? Well, it's not. The story is boring and second class, and some things are really strange. I will not give details, but things happen, I want to see, above all. I really like the cinema, I really like it, and I really liked it. It just did not work. I give 10 to 10, especially to play.
