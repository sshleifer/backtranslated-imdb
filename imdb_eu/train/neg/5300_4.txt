I am one of the millions of Columbo dependence around the world and I've seen that, that is, everything started in British outdoors. It's wonderful to think just like that movie and just think of it. We would like to see the potential of "Columbo" and add small touches that make it a wonderful and classic series. That said, this specific movie is not as good as the rest (the last episode is shameful and the main British chapter). If Columbo was originally a "rider", it would definitely not last long or be seen and loved in the whole world. In this movie, Lt Columbo is elegant, dressed in a normal car, has a pair and does not talk about suspected relatives and is quite aggressive. There is also no chemical cats and mice between "Columbo" and "wicked". Watchable, but just for how to start Columbo for its novelty.
