It's like Cabin Fever's premise to offer something. Finals (in the fall?) A group of university students go to the resort cabin that is located in the forest, where it is crushed by a meat that is not seen individually. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's the first paragraph. feature-length remote movie stop. Cabin Fever has nothing more to stop the sexes, college boys, and they do not stop there, and see how many F-bombs they can take 1:40 minutes or so, this mess is long. <br /> <br /> Children react and make stupid around them. One of them, for example, realizes that the skin has contaminated the virus with its legs, so what does it do? If he does not pay attention to his wounds, he continues his legs. There's little scene In another scene, "Rider Strong" in "Boy Meets World" puts a guy who says "Pancakes", and likes a shot of karate sitting next to him. If you want to know why the baby "Pancakes" I would like to know. In any case, Rider makes a wild dog pet and then cleanses his hand at the pebble creek. Another boy wants to drop the F-bombs by reacting everything around him and shooting the squirrels. Why? Your invention is as good as mine! <br /> <br /> The director is the only recognition in this film. People try to calm down and scream and F *** Y **! the bombs that people throw around. Children do not shout, talk about sex, or talk nonsense about the adults of other people (if possible) when they are stupid for the kids! The IQ police seats over 60 have been one of the most watched films ever seen in a movie. You talk about people who do not play with all the backs, nobody knows how to find the cards! LOL! He liked: "Have you closed it already?" The children act as genius! The only part I liked was the Rider horror story (though it's a huge ball) about the awesome bowling alley. In conversations, Rider said he had a great respect for the director of Eli Rothen. But the problem is that Mr. Roth seems less than a blow and gore. The bad things about this movie are so much for Mr. Roth. I could agree with Rider and I like something about this movie. Maybe the descent landscape at the beginning? Actually, Rider Strong saves JUST from 1 on! Fortunately, he had to pay for this waste!
