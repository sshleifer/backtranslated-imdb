Spike Lee's little effort is this movie. Much more than this movie. Get rid of the bus because it seems racist, the white man does it and degrades the black status quo. This is an argument about this film about a black group traveling by Louis Farrakhan's millions of men. The bus has all kinds of people that you can imagine: Gay, Muslim, Gangbanger and Uncle Tom (it is thrown by the bus). There was only one white person in the bus. He was accused of being racist at the time he was driving the bus. Even though he was Jewish and explained the situation, he was racist and left the bus. I hate to say that, but such films have to realize their hypocrisy and the repercussion of the steryotypes. This is not a victory, but a dull hatred. I think that I am writing a racist, but I mean. Better luck next to Spike.
