I've seen a lot of movies and I'd rarely rate the movie "1", but this movie was awesome. <br /> <br /> The effect was horrible, the argument was ridiculous, and the effects were not realistic. the characters were annoying. Usually when I see scary movies, I think DUMB is listening to the characters in the home / forest / school / etc. and then shouts "is hello anyone there?" - but they are at least credible when they do it. This movie can not get this. <br /> <br /> This is a B-horror movie that includes films like Venom and The Fog. Like masterpiece of masterpieces of academic appearance. <br /> <br /> I always watch the movies and I can say that I can totally lose the time of the movie and write this comment that someone will think about seeing this movie again. YOURSELF!
