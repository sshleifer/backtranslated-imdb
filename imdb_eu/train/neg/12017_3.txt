I am a fan of Ludlumen's work and Covert's book and I often thought they would become an incredible movie. Imagine my enthusiasm, then, that he was studying this film really! Being the "Hades Factor" of the series seemed like an early place. <br /> <br /> At the beginning the movie was disappointed. Simple elements of the movie, such as the first meeting with Griffin Smith, differs from the book, much less. Not many characters are well distributed. For beginners, Dorff Smith is so wonderful. It's not a bad actor, it's just a very bad chance because it's very gentle and it's just a sign of John Smith's impressive features. <br /> <br /> Re-designate, re-assign and even empty. Some characters make films worse. For example, Victor Tremont's removal and the entire backdrop of the virus, including the involvement of VAXHAM, breaks the cinema completely. Marty Zellerbach is a great part of the book, and the back seat is changing much (it's not a movie that is unrelated to the character of the book) is a great mistake. <br /> <br /> Rachel Russel believes that Randi Russel will be the author of this book. Sophie Amsdenen (Sophia Russell) is supposed to be called, but it also assumes that CIA can come, NOT "hidden." This leads me to the last point, and I think it is the most important thing. COVERT-ONE does not exist at this point! Second book of the series until the president has concealed the second book that has been designed as a preventive preventive measure. <br /> <br /> Actually, it could go all day. In short: if you like books and want to see good adaptation, I'm afraid you will be disappointed. Acting as a film is also an average, especially because of non-gloss and bad effects. The watercolor with a dreadful story line and a dreadful source is the ultimate coffin of this movie.
