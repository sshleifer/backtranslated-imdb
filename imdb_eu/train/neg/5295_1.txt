Everything seems suicidal by a teenager. His family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) are doing a lot of questions ... and blame himself. <br /> <br /> A good idea, poorly handled. It was made for beginners before 1988 - especially television shows and After School Specials. Excluding sworn conversations and some conversations (for this reason, the PG-13 rating) has not added anything new. The result is predictable and Reeve's attempts to act are really painful. It's good now, but not in 1988. His character was dressed like a slob and it always seemed so dirty that it was very difficult to build sympathy. <br /> <br /> Apart from this movie. I have seen all the scenes of the future and all "surprises" were telegraphed. Basically, I could not wait to wait this thing. <br /> <br /> I also hate to play in 1988 and I hate it, and that's why I hate it (it has been bombarded by DESTINY). Almost 20 years later it looks bad. He deserves to manage the subject matter, but he has done better (with a better performance) in other films. "People's habits" come to mind. You can jump on this.
