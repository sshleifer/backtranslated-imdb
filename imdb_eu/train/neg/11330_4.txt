"Giant" is never a tedious and long-haul of any Hollywood contraptions. Many scenes seem fake and energyless. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean are wasting this great Hollywood production. A central concept about this movie, that the farmer would face oil drilling, is absurd, and I know he's from Houston. Two scenes, especially serving Dean Taylor coffee, exclude this boring movie. To get a more detailed and detailed description of how Texas Modernization has changed, see "Hud" (one of the great performances of Paul Newman) or "The Last Picture Show."
