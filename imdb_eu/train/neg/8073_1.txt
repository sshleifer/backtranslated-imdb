If the writer / director is reading this (and now I would imagine that you would be out of work), I must say - I have seen short films in my time, but this is the worst of the premise to be distinguished. I've never heard <br /> <br /> SPOILERS - Nothing happens! <br /> <br /> Time lost completely. At last I laughed aloud. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE - (if the whole movie is in commas, then it's a scene that slept, when someone had raped it when it was over?) <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Waste.
