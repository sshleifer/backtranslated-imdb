Viewing tenants has been an interesting experience for me. The first movie I ever saw was the speed I went back through (not) through the action episodes - and I've usually come up with some great movies, indecisive and fascinable for Serbocroatians. <br /> <br /> Neighboring villagers frustratingly slow and over-orchestrated. One of the main problems in the script is that there is little realistic dialogue with characters, because the characters 'collisions' in a very structured environment (to make this work, the film has to be conceptually felt, which it did not do). This develops realistic nature; Everyone seems two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> That's why Bill Spear's character, Snoop Dogg, is worse. His characterization was very uncomfortable and very simple. At some point, though I stopped the movie, because I was a character of aggressive, violent and monotonous nature, because the other identity layers lacked a "good" reactionary (which is really foreseen). and, therefore, I desperately wanted to recover some quality. However, a reason for this could be a fuzzy time of the film (they are supposedly 70s, they feel and shape early noughties). If he had been securely established in the 70s, his character could be more intelligible. <br /> <br /> The movie lighting was also wrong. By the way, the soundtrack tries to give a certain atmosphere with a jazzy mix, this was not going out, especially since the set was very bright. <br /> <br /> The tenant for me, this is an unbelievable film. It does not show real people, nor suggest ways of thinking about race, personality or the life of a writer, to be white or black. <br /> <br /> I was curious though, I felt this project. necessary David Lynch; His mysterious, horrible and obsessive look would make both actors and screenplay something outstanding.
