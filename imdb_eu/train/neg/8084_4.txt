I received this title because I received a friend who was sitting in the depths of his DVD / Video / Laserdisc collection, so fortunately I did not have to pay. I swore I was going to be a bad movie, but I know what is really a bad movie, such as Children Should not Play With Dead Things and The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Become Good-looking Movies like Mixed-Up Zombies nothing disapproves me if it does not surprise me. <br /> <br /> The Solar Crisis is bad, but it does not get that gorgeous pain in some movies. <br /> <br /> However, the general plot is that the sun will light up a giant sun to land, basically to destroy it. In order to face this immediate threat, humanity has mounted space and a crew of antimatter bombs, which is a bombardment of the sun antimatter (that is, the "greatest explosive ever described"). It will cause logic to shoot the river into another angle, damaging the earth. <br /> <br /> I would like to remind you that it is a bad episode of the original Star Trek. With a solar group (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle and Jack Palance), Solar Crisis hardly manages this Spanish level, thanks to a plot that is simple, but becomes increasingly meaningless over time. <br /> <br /> The supreme achievement of this movie's debacle is to add a bad character that Boyle plays. Unless explained above, it sends a malignant cancer with a shameless illness, a misunderstood control of female scientists led by Annabel Schofield about genetically engineered scientists from the space crew. Why does he sabotage the mission? Because his view is dull, this flare will not happen, and if that is not the case, it will be wonderful because it will make you rich, because its evil claws have been punched on the stock market. In fact, you have an evil figure with the most absurd imagination. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is very slow and slowly develops because of the use of short periods of time or unnecessary characters. story I'm here to sit down and explain to myself the role of the scriptwriter to prove the impossibility of making a plot of attention or capturing, but here I am saying that I'm writing Microsoft Word's review and I know that I would take three pages and lose my interest. But again, you would probably get the same effect to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> However, the film has poor conversations. Imagine that everything happened in the Star Trek Enterprise that the characters cast their science fiction jargon one after another. Yes, I know, they already do this, but imagine that they have done all this and have used this jargon to set the most plain and absurd scenes for no excitement, tension or audience. > <br /> A character in the Zero-G environment explodes when the screw screws a screw on a metal box when it comes to shouting before suddenly fluttering. The script mentions the character's danger of explosion, but does not answer why he or she knows why he or she does not know why he can not run away. All in all, it's a weird cross you've got between strange and hilarious. <br /> <br /> Then there are several scenes that lead to dramatic construction. Jack Palance's screening in the wilderness wanders a character that drives the heroine (or ask) to wander before the wreck breaks down the bunch and dies. In the bed of death, finally, Palance tells us that our heroine is his surname (wearing a terrific makeup, someone who placed a balloon under his eyes). Colonel Travis J. Richards. The boy repeats himself quietly as long as he expires, and then the audience will be more important in the film. Charlton Heston can have immense admirers, and the plot will move forward when the name is repeated again. Something. Any <br /> <br /> No. I'm sorry. Any hope will be removed at this time when they try to make dumb dramas for a character of this character forever, it will definitely become stain on Palancia's career. The rest of the pieces are similar. <br /> <br /> Forming the film, Schofield is an endless violently directing bomb at the center of the sun, trying to collect his deeds under the mischief of evil. Other visual effects of the film have a well-formed set of well-made films, including a carefully crafted attention to them, but still make films look very sharp. The sadest part of this movie, of course, is a great budget that wastes in a tragic script and gets a play that goes back to Boyle, Heston and Palance with close-up coffins. <br /> <br /> Grade: D-
