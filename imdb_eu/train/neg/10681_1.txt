Unfortunately, my "a" list has so many, and the good list "b" allows players to make this movie, but they did it, which is why I saw they sucked me. I had never heard this movie, but Cuba Gooding Jr. Was it on the DVD cover, and how could James Woods be on the back? In a word very! This movie will start. Twists and turns, and puts an egg. At the end he was so weak, as if the writer had been eliminated and his 4-year-old son was sitting in front of the writer and ended. How ironic a movie called "Finish Match" is, so it's so poor. These are the types of movies that can be played in the "a" list of actors. I hope Cuba Gooding JR, and James Woods does not have that habit.
