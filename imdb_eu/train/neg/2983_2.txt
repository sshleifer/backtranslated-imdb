Zombi 3 begins as a group of armed men begins to steal the experimental chemistry developed to resurrect the dead, while shooting man shoots and destroys the chemical metal container. The man will receive a green chemical product when he is injured in his hand, which soon makes him eat a meat with cannibal zombies. Within a few hours, the environment is crawling untreated flesh, while looking for fresh twins, Kenny (Deran Sarafian) and his army friends are having problems with Patricia (Beatrice Ring) and Lia (Deborah). Bergammi), the zombie birds (!) Have seen. General Morton is in charge of this situation and has to stop the plague of zombies throughout the world! But he and his men will succeed? <br /> <br /> This Italian-produced film directed by Lucio Fulci, Italian zombies, but underwent the stroke of the story, so that the producer could not finish the film. Franco Gaudenzie asked the director of the second unit Bruno Mattei and the writer Claudio Fragasso to complete and complete the film. Mattei and Fragasso seem to have just finished, because they did not really throw away Fulci and added a lot and Zombi 3 distributed almost 50/50 straight. Fragasso's script is completely confusing, it's not well thought out and stupid. The scene in the zone that attacks people is not technically only inept, but the whole idea is absurd. The zombies themselves do not have any coherence, look at the scene next to Patricia and they are slow zombies, because they confuse it, but then look at the area with a machete. Like steroid, after about 10 minutes reasonable explanation before the end of the movies, zombies suddenly develop the ability to speak, which also looks bad. There are so many things wrong with Zombi 3, after a dramatic scene of a scene with a dreadful and executed scene, a horrible and sad English conversation with a dreadful character does not make sense in half of the time. Then the scene of the refrigerator is shaky, suddenly, where the head zone inside the refrigerator suddenly creates the ability to fly through the air, but only in the end, it is the place where people kill white clothing Kenny and Roger. The automatic rifles decide to kill them manually, even if Kenny chooses a gun, he still does not use his rifles and when Kenny starts to shoot, they still do not want to use their rifles and they do not handle it anymore. The scene never shot and then at the end of the Kenny helicopter, but he can not stop on the ground for a few seconds to pick his friend, and then a few zombie loads rise suddenly. grass, what? When did the zombies hide under herbs? All this seems "fun", but it does not believe it, it's not really boring, repetitive, and just does not act as a level for entertainment, except for unwanted laughter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> In this sense, he has a life without nonsense, and for some reason, the makers have tried to bathe each scorched scene. The problem is that there is only one light machine and a fog in the corner of the screen is considerably thicker. It's getting straight out of the machine and scattering across the scene. Since it is set to a great deal of time, it does not add any shifts, and when it gets well, the fog evenly extends over the screen. One day they seem to have filmed a fog. The management is poor, without coherence, and the bottom of the bells looks like it. There are also a lot of blood and gore; In the beginning, the hand is penetrating at first, when the stomach of a pregnant woman wakes up when she wakes up, why she did not take her legs to the tip to be saved? It is a bit rough with zombies. Fulc is very disappointed for those who would like to be served regularly at the end of the 70's and Fulci's 80's, there is no decent nutrition scene, no intestines, no 'head' and very little Gore. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is a bad thing, the special effects are cheap, the film is sad, the music is awful, the locations are soft and have production values. That really was the maintenance of the cost of filming in the Philippines at least. The whole movie has doubled, of course, the performance still looks bad and it seems that someone who does not understand the language in the English version. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 is not a continuation of Fulci. Zombi 2 (1979), the classic zombie gore festival, has nothing to do with the money it earns. I'm sorry but Zombi 3 is a mix of amateur films, it's boring, it does not make sense, it's not fun enough to be entertaining and it lacks any gore. Avoid one.
