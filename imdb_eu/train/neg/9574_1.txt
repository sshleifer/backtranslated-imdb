This is one of the innocent films I've seen throughout my life. When I've seen the stupid scene in history, the scene is even more sour and weird. In my opinion, the travesti dogs made me talk to me or, rather, to speak their language ... or maybe the statue of a virgin mumbled on the windshield. Decisions, decisions ...
