XIX. The strange weird movie set in the century has failed. With great names such as Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and many others, there is no movie gap. However, there was no end to the movie, he felt the excuse of a plot line, and he continued. A story about a rich girl and a bad boy, lovingly associated and destroying beauty (or lack thereof), has a moving aspect of her mother's death and absent father. When Father Finney plays, he is a disturbing man, by comparing his life to his daughter and losing his death. She thinks she would dare to miss her daughter if she is married under her social situation. The actors tried hard to recover what was left of the story. Washington Square is a black hole in ruin and destruction, it's wasting time for those who see sadness. This movie is only for 0, I only provide for actresses' essays. Save yourself, stop from Washington Square.
