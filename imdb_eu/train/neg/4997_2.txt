... but definitely not without merit. Preston Sturges, the writer's director, experiences unusual cinema effects to tell his stories, drawing characters and situations, creating distinctive and clear and sometimes unexpected wise and compelling conversations. (It is not surprising that the next film by Coen Brothers will be a tribute to Sturges.) <br /> <br /> The main problem is not yet in the plot; It is not surprising that sudden changes in land plots and changes in money keep the audiences guessing. The slogan Coffee is a lousy thing to hang on the plot, and the end is foreseen. Frank Capra works much better. <br /> <br /> If you're new to Preston Sturges, check out "The Lady Eve" or "Sullivan's Travels" or "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" first. If you saw them, follow and see this.
