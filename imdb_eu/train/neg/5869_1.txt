It's been almost 30 years and I hate everyone involved in this movie. I'm the worst movie ever I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Before I see this, I do not care much about Rivers in one way or another. After watching this movie, I have an allergy reaction without seeing it on TV. <br /> <br /> I'm dragging in front of this: I think, in the face of a pair of pressure. However, when they left the theater, these friends swore once again that they were not rejecting the selection of my films. Almost thirty years later, we are still carrying mental headaches that are still happening on this film. <br /> <br /> In the midst of my death, I will waste the time I hope to improve my film. It has never been done. <br /> <br /> If you are given an opportunity, you prefer to put your eyes on this movie. <br /> <br /> I just hope in the comments I made on the IMDb I may be able to warn others to watch this movie. If I can save only one person from hearing this, the earth will justify such existence.
