Litter bins / bad films are usually not bad because it seems to be nice to you. This is so bad and I do not describe words, that is, "bad". The film is ordered at the beginning of the film that will tell you what to do at the beginning of the movie. Needless to say, the instruction and a dozen beers could not give me the whole movie. This tag compares this KILLBILL, undoubtedly unthinkable and insulting to our intelligentsia. Of course. This tagliner intended to buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you want to rent it, please delete it! If you want to buy, do not think! If you do not play this DVD unfortunately, throw it to the trash immediately.
