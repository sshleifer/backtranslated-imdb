Hey HULU.com Elvira late tonight is playing a horror show on her site and her name is called Monsteroid, to have fun watching Elvira comment on this movie ... Have Fun with bad movies. In any case, this movie has a very low value for 70s horror movies, bad effects, bad conversations, and bad films. Avoid laughing if you do not want to laugh. When you're on HULU, watch now the other movies are 10 episodes and some pretty decent movies with good plots and productions, many of which you can watch if you have a decent 480p speed connection.
