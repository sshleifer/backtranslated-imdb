Although the debut films by the supporting actors and Alan Plate's manual script, this film has a flawed mistake: the charm of the main character / actors is missing. One of the characters describes the character of Richard E Grant, "a little bugster" and, unfortunately, it fits perfectly. There is nothing in it that can be credible for him or her to work so that his girlfriend and senior publisher / friend would give so much time and emotion. It is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and totally annoying. Like the sun by McGregor. Ewan McGregor. The piece is called the actor who invites him to love him. <br /> <br /> All the classics and so on satire were wasted. Predicted yield and very hard. I wanted to shake everything I wanted to do and say it.
