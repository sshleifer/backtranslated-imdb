First thing first. In this genre movie, the first thing you need is good music, and that's when Mr. Shankar and his party fail. <br /> <br /> the music is completely pale and not correct. On the other hand, AJAY DEVGAN is the spelling of the "A" font, but he has done a good job, but he does not use such wrong movies. <br /> <br /> ASIN is like a doll. It is used to play public, although it looks good, but it's a dance in the movie, it's a dance group, and I do not have a rock band as a dancer. <br /> <br /> This movie is a dirty movie in a nutshell. See if you want to cheat.
