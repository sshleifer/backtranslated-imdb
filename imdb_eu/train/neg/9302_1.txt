This movie is horrible. It's boring, it's a little quality, it's just the worst actor I've ever seen and the horny scenario. <br /> <br /> He gets what he gets best. All the girls, but it is ugly, overweight and looks like it looks at the beginning of the 90s. <br /> <br /> All the people are out for the weekend to meet friends for the weekends, but nobody really is a friend! The married couple did not see the main character of more than 5 years and they were not really friends at that time. She only knows about the "date" of the main man and gathers a girl in a bar. Tell me now that you will lose your work in the cabin to spend a weekend with people who are not your real friends. This is what the film does at the beginning! <br /> <br /> Do not waste a minute in your time in this lemon. Home movies have shrunk less than this! <br /> <br />
