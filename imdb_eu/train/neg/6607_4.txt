Some have not been bad, though it's pathetic in its original form. In my opinion, Babacy Singh was a great Amitabh - try not to compare it with Gabbar in the original, which clearly does not have the same effect. However, except for poor shares, the rest of the movie fails. The development of the characters was bad and the development of the story was unexpected, there were many gaps and I would not know about the lack of information I had read in the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the film was the help of this new dude named Nisha Kothari and especially Prashant Raj. Nisha is the most annoying moment when opening her lips for the first time. In regards to Prashant Rajri, who is this seriously? Where does it come from and why did he present himself in the cinema studio for drinks? Her acting capability is zero and has the same tone, dialogues and strong voices in all scenes, as well as action, comedy or even a scene when someone has died. Ajay Devgan was the average, at least his expressions changed, that is to say, the mistake of a friend is more than saying. In general, RGV Aag deserves to see good results in Amitabh and, moreover, a very special look, Urmilla Matondkar, very sexy.
