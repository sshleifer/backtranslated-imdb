After seeing MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS, I am convinced that it is still the first movie of the witch's (witchcraft) wigs. I have not thought of THE CRAFT many and I'm not CHARMED. The only movie I enjoyed (about teenage witches) was LITTLE WITCHES (1996), which was not very good at all. But when you like all the movies mentioned above, you can also enjoy high-quality offers. But I was surprised that the whole movie was quite serious. Playing is decent and serious all the time. Teens or something else is playing. And the music score, at the beginning, was a pretty good idea. She added some sharp and even something "stylish". As the film progresses, I conclude that the score was more ambitious. They did not even need to watch these violin menace just when you just saw a car backed up and you just drove out on the normal speed <br /> <br /> Then Melissa Sue Anderson is the main reason for me to see her. this movie A few weeks ago, I saw HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME, a slasher-like movie, drawn (and sometimes even in some ways), that he did the same year as MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS. And I must say, it was very good as Vivian witch's cold melt. But the main problem in the movie: almost nothing happens! Vivian causes death and an accident, but that's it. Then Robin, a good witch, who knows his powers. And we expect both to use their powers more than once, but only once they use their powers as woodworking and other things to do. Was this a battle between two powerful witches? Even worse, at the end of the movie I expected to see a spectacular show among witches, at least special effects, eyes and whatever ... but nothing happens. In the end it is confronted, but it is a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> So, it was a good behavior for both witches. The music score has been decent (although it is very ambitious). Cinematography was sometimes dark and annoying. But this is not a good movie yet, right?
