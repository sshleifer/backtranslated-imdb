He first warns that this movie has been seen on television and has been dubbed in English - it is likely that the atmosphere will be totally ruined. However, I'm going to appreciate what I've seen and what I expect from that version. I found this movie so sad. The atmosphere of the film is completely lost by the slow dissolution of a Stalker movie with the dubbing. I'm sorry, but the worst of the book's signature is to be slow except for the movie about philosophy. In this movie, I do not see a profound philosophical meaning. Maybe I missed something, but I have to tell it as I see. I rated "1". What can I say about US tastes, perhaps?
