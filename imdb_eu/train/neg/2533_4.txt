Mostly, I agree with Tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com) in the previous comment. Zatoichi series is a great character, combined with swords and great enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> I saw 1-13,15,16 from Zatoichi; I think 14 have not been released in field 1 (USA). Zatoichi Outlaw was disappointed. The story line was complicated, and it seemed annoying to many of the previous Zatoichi tales. At some point, I asked him not to see a remake of the previous Zatoichi movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was disappointing because it was a part of the effects (a strong head, a serious body, a blood) and less the character of Zatoichi's nobleman. All of the previous films have achieved the story and action, and without any good results they won. <br /> <br /> I hope that the rest of Zatoichi's films will NOT follow the same trend. His first studio album, Zatoichi, is this film. I recommend all the previous Zatoichi movies and recommend them.
