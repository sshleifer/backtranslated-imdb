Yes, Marie Dresler drinks poison with a poison and runs it. <br /> <br /> Dresler is good. It's never my cup of tea, but it's probably a good performer on the screen. <br /> <br /> Polly Moran, I saw it elsewhere, I saw it. Here, Moran is just right: as a stunning enemy of Dressler. Very bad was almost completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> The plot is good. Bad guys are trying to steal citizens. Dressler succeeds and finishes well. <br /> <br /> It's worth mentioning the thinking mechanism: vouchers. This came out of the Depression, maybe everyone knew the vouchers and what they could do if they used it and if they used it incorrectly. But, however, I have not met with them at that time. Stocks are different, right? It seems that Man Little Man is about to build a story about a little money organization.
