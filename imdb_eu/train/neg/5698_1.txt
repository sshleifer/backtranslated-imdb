We were almost dying of watching this movie. In fact, I could not finish it. I want to make my money back. One of the weakest Hollywood attempts to create a new Hollywood idea. Well, the lemons keep a bowl in the fridge. Just in case. Nic Cage had to offer a hat and a bull fight. Swashbucklin '. Cage plays Raising Arizona or Leaving Las Vegas on "limeta". Fully commercialized people (and most of them) should love this movie. If this movie was cheering, I'd be more serious. I would rather see a stupid movie that he did not want to hide. In my opinion, the movie was very stupid and the attempt was made to make it more sad to try to hide it. <br /> <br /> Every forest seems to love it.
