Is Orca Jaws Casual After Two Hours? Orca is not just a "Jaws rip off" but it's clear that Jaws has succeeded. Orca thought it was a bad movie, not horrible, but it's definitely not good, the average. <br /> <br /> The plot is mostly a male killer (orca), after seeing his partner and his unborn baby. a fisherman seeks revenge to die. I could not see the movie again. The directing of this film is inadequate, and compared to Jaws, there seems to be almost unlucky directors, producers and writers. <br /> <br /> Regarding rhythm, it was a very mean and compelling, but true characters. They are not the most unusual. The effects were time-consuming and the images of the killer whale seemed pretty good. <br /> <br /> Violence is confusing, bloody and not sensitive to the people. Abundant and very loud music suffers from sound effects and sometimes irritates. I hated the way I thought about the whale slaughterer (whales murderers are not depicted with a friend Orca). <br /> <br /> In general, it was a bad / bad movie, which is why I mentioned the reasons above. Some people may appreciate this movie because of the concept of addiction between animals and humans, so I do not get bored with this movie and I understand why some people would like it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 10 (but for concept 5/10)
