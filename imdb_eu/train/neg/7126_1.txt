I mean, I heard this conversation in the movie, but it was so bad and unknown that I could not believe it. I was laughing about what was written about writing and acting in the history of humanity, that I could seriously incur a heart attack and I will die there in the theater. <br /> <br /> So, this is what I'm saying about the scene, the "hero" just saw his brother crash and his brothers burst the car there just there (heroine). The "Hero" was expected to "fit", seeing something so tragic and trying to get people back to the burning car. <br /> <br /> His emotional breakdown and anger control / emotional break says "I'm so sad" - said the right? I'm crazy?
