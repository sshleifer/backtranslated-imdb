Here is a new third version of SEMIINDUTAKO ENIEMIA after YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996). <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI worked and it was a better film <br /> <br /> DARAAR is directed by Abbas Mustang, unfortunately it failed to try it <br /> <br /> the story was good but Handling was not so good and the heroine appeared in a reinterpretation mode and the excesses were also depressing <br /> <br> /> Bad management Good music is Rishik YAARANA's role to play (it's amazing it was a SWTE's restart) and excessive It looks like the keeper, and Juhi is a decent player, and Arbaaz is trying too hard. His debut and scene often managed to stop the public but his voice was horrible. Johny is too loud
