Totally ridiculous If you know anything about poker, it will be absolutely horrible, but also fun, there is no doubt. The nerds who made this movie are very religious and know little about the poker game, but I doubt that I'm playing more than 3-6. (I think that he does not know anything about golf.) Where to start. I have seen better productions in the Intro to Film class when I started to study film at school. The actors in this movie are Queen Momma, Scotty Nguyen, and poker can never win. All others are wood, such as pornographic actors. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * The beginning of the movie is the only reason why the film begins with the beginning of the sequence. It does not play poker and never is a line of dialogue, but the actress is, of course, paid for the movie. I can not think of any unnecessary money for money unless it exits humans for this pure production. It was necessary to have such a role as useless. <br /> <br /> There is very little poker in this movie. Most of the time is spent on unnecessary characters, whose plots have not been solved least. Queen Momma has a show-robbery scene where she loses her boyfriend through a window and tries to shoot her brains. The unknown Arabs at the comfort store also give great performances when discussing or killing an old lady robbing stores. Their fine performances are simple among the highlights of the film. I wonder why it was caused by all the white people. <br /> <br /> In the end, full nonsense. 9. There is little consistency in the outer space of the Plan. If you play poker, even if you want to laugh. Even if you are a Christian, you can enjoy some of the great religious dialogues that make up the film's pepper-making films. I hate religious films. Above all, they do not know what they know about things. It's sad that Jennifer Harman and Scotty Nguyen have taken part in this travesty, I can not help but think less of them. They must be Johnny Chan's envy to join Rounders.
