Consider STAR IS BORN 1976 where it is: its last number is sung in Barbra Streisand in the foreground close to seven minutes and forty-two, and then frozen frost two minutes and a half frozen. Streisand - taking a similar position to Christ - close behind the credits. With over two thirty minutes of uninterrupted Barbra vision, I've been looking for a big screen ever since. That could only be a cinematographic record. <br /> <br /> Or think: the argument of that music is based on the love between two superstars, but while Streisand's songs are made entirely - Endless ending, Kris Kristofferson's costar does not have a single song to carry out He does not even copy a couple of copies, although they really sing the couple. <br /> <br /> Or take this into account: Streisand's name appears at least six times in credit. He also intended to include "concept music" and his wardrobe (including the credits from his closet), but he did not even get direct credits. One of these credits was an executive producer, with Jon Peters's friend and former hairdresser's creditor. That's why Streisand controlled the final cut of the film, why he was obsessed with the film's direction. He does not understand how he has come, allowing him to see the Great Diva well, his efforts only give Streisand a bad look. Although Streisand was one of the biggest boxers, his film is undoubtedly the worst and his performance is the worst. <br /> <br /> However, the melodrama is taken from Hollywood to sex drugs and the rock world. Esroll, Streisand plays with Esther Hoffman, pop-singer on the horrible star, Kristofferson's John Norman Howard, has a tough road race on the outskirts of Has-beenville. In the pre-incarnation of the story, "Norman Maine" will give his first career to the man to achieve "Vicky Lester" success. In the seventies of the Feminist, Streisand & Co has made clear that his heroines are nothing to the man, so the route is asymmetric; It will be successful with him or not, and at the bottom of a scene there is almost a lot; He must bear burden in the name of love. That's why there is a strong effort to make the lady who is dominant harder, but almost without mercy, as she becomes her lover. <br /> <br /> Kristofferson schleps material through the film; make a small effort to make a great profit, and in a strange way his character is stunning and good and good. Streisand, however, does not show the moment at the time when it was at the time the moment was at the time. It seems that if everything is not properly analyzed, at least it controls it. Although his apparent ad libs seem to be rehearsed and he thinks cold cold cold hysteria. Both do not have chemistry, which is absolutely incredible to love. Do you think that his character sees his youth and innocence as a symbol, even at the age of 34, Streisand does not seem particularly young or naive. The only understandable attraction it offers can be exploited as a means of exploitation. And, in fact, if the film had the courage to play such material, to play clearly a Streisand character exploiter criminals, movies might have a spark and maybe a reason. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But I think filmmakers see Esther's most sensitive victim; It seems they do not realize how bloody and absorbing cold it is. But sensitivity is not one of the strongest points in the film: keep in mind that Barbra's two African-American songs give minor jokes, which is why the film raises the trio of The Oreos. And the movie says that Esther maintains her ethnic identity with Hoffman, but filmmakers have changed the name of the character "Esther Blodgett", starring Streisand. Too much a Jew or a very unnamed name. Because of ethnic canine <br /> <br /> The back of the film is a legendary backdrop and backward movement that is legendary, so it is very noticeable to see the film so polished. Named Frank Pierson, he has been awarded the raw material for a good movie, with the support of the filmmaker Robert Surtees. And the movie was intended to produce the supposed soundtrack for pop tunes (won by Paul Williams and Streisand "Evergreen"). The overall movie Streisand said was not the only thing he wanted.
