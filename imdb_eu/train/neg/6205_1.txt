So he was told of violence and marked the sick. Well, fear is the best of violence, but sadly the characters are not developing enough to understand why they continue their (totally predictable) rampage. This movie has a great script. We have never met Robert and eventually his actions are pathetic. The play is not much better, as well as the television chef and school teacher. Management is clumsy enough for a rhythm of sleep. And what about the school project movie? Can a comment on the movie? Repeating news is to use a faint murder. These men, of course, think they are intellectuals, but they are far from deep. I got to know how to land the great Yorgos Arvanitis, I never know. And to make money first, it's a bigger mystery. Absolutely amazing beyond comprehension.
