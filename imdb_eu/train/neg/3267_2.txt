There's nothing amazing about 'amazing Williams' around Williams. A part of the movie's problem is Melvyn Douglas's main actor. The actress was evil and lazy with her. In a great part of his career, he gave good looks, in a silent way (and usually, but not in this film), some fine screenwriting to not perform acting. Douglas did not like me as an actor; I have learned enough about it, to contemn politics. I will give Melvyn Douglas a credit for his credits: his chromosomes have created Illeana Douglas as a talented and sexy actress. <br /> <br /> Melvyn Douglas made this film after the great Ninotchka. down! 'Amazing Amazing Williams' is supposedly a comedy, but I've never laughed. Douglas, the common man of the homicide family named Kenny Williams, plays a detective. I have never heard about Kenny detective detective, but Kenneth Williams calls him ... well, what will it take? The city is being scared because a series killer kills women. No reason is given for this; She likes to kill women. The mayor (commonly called Jonathan Hale) calls a carpet called Williams to prevent the killer from getting caught. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> RETURN. Joan Blondell is unknown and strange the mayor's secretary. (It does not have enough letters to read, much to write.) Blondell and Douglas play like a cat and a dog, so they will clearly appear together. <br /> <br /> At the lowest point in the movie, he decides to draw the Melvyn Douglas killer to dress as a woman. You do not want to see a trace of Melvyn Douglas! It has more than six feet and does not throw a mustache annoying. Likewise, similar to William Powell was similar to Melvyn Douglas (but much more talented). When Powell was dressed as a woman with 'Love Crazy', she had a wholeheartedness to alleviate her mustache: a real sacrifice, because Powell needed to grow her next role again. But Melvyn Douglas does not bring anything in her film, nor a razor. He uses the same smile that he used to measure his career in his row scenes. <br /> <br /> Positively, 'The Amazing Mr Williams' has many great Hollywood-inspired movies. 30 decades so enjoyable. Edward Brophy is wonderful here, as a punishment that makes an effort difficult to judge from his life. Donald MacBride Dispeptic is well-known as a policeman who is confronted with the murderer, and is almost linked by a mafia. Ruth Donnelly is brilliant: as usual, but here is the chance to move his talents in his or her usual orbit in the background of Warner Brothers. Jimmy Conlin, Luis Alberni and Dave Willock are very nice in small roles. Barbara Pepper (which I do not want) is also good here. Maude Eburne is an unpleasant pleasure; I am always in my opinion, and it gives the same performance in every movie ... but some viewers enjoy Eva's remark, for reasons that I can not. <br /> <br /> If you know the actors of the Hollywood characters in the 1930s, and the role of play, a look at the cast's cast list will tell you who the murderer is. That's it with "The Amazing Mr. Wiliams": it's all very obvious. This movie will be 10 points out of 10.
