Man, I love police movies, action, shooting, access, etc. Full. <br /> <br /> Boy, I let him down after seeing a short and awesome movie. We have seen everything before, the hostages, the banks, the surroundings ... However, 2 officers and the innocent people just shoot at the fire. br /> <br /> Multiple shots, not hundreds of shots. The return came to the bank, the warriors had no security or locked the doors when the boys were gone. The director was just stupid. <br /> <br /> Okay, the intervals between that fake document were good, but I thought after watching the movie: why did not police get a decent shooting course? And why where so much police and SWAT were in a real long break? Really bad
