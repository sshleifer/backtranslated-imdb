I love the sexy and science-fiction films of the sixties, due to the actors that appeared in these actors. These women found short films amongst their sexes and did not care to act (Remember "Candy"?). The reason I was disappointed with this movie was not enough nostalgic. Here's a story called "Dragonfly", a European-based science fiction film and directed by the director. So the producers decided to complete a new aspiring filmmaker (Jeremy Davies). She is a beautiful beautiful woman in the movie that plays Dragonfly, but she's almost there. Roman Coppola writes and directs the film, which uses it for the first time for some of his parents' uses and writes it to the script. The movie could have been a tribute to the beginning of these films. Actors who appeared at the event could have a lot of cameo. A well-known town of the sixties and his actor John Phillip Law (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell will also appear. It seems that I'm looking forward to a good homage in the sixties movies to be waiting for the director. If anyone reads, "Make it as sexy as you can!" I will wait!
