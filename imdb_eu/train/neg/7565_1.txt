This movie has been lost for quite a long time, this very movie. You know how many times you would go to movies, it's hard to imagine, but never, it's true! After watching this movie trailer, I saw it! If you're a fancied, mysterious and suspense fan, why should not you? The trailer is interesting and exciting; unfortunately, the movie is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Cinematography, script, theater, this movie is a complete flop. If you are reading this, I intend to go to the movie for waiting for anything other than emotion, mystery, action, fear or an hour and forty-five minutes, I'm disappointed again. <Br /> <br /> "Why it's so bad," maybe asking yourself. Tell me The movies were not mysterious and they were not suspensful. The movie did not give me a little bit "edge", terrifying or bizarre. The script was stupid There were several times when the whole movie was so ridiculous, I began to write as a comic relief, a few seconds later I did not know. The performance was totally horrible. I like Nicholas Cage but that's it. Exceptionally, the yields of this film were below the average. Cinematography was terrifying at the moment of suspicion or mysticism. In the end, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this film a mile away. <br /> <br /> Normally I'm not a very hard critic. Actually, I want to surprise myself when I want to see a comedy and I'll be surprised to see a mystery / suspense / horror when I go. This movie was boring, misunderstood, misunderstood and disappointed. Make yourself one side and see something else.
