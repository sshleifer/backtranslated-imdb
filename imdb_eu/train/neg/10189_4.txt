I watched the movie a few years ago, and I was surprised ... but I was just 12 years old again. I've seen it again recently and I want that time. This movie is pretty bad. With Lee Majors, what I like Chris Makepeace (see My Bodyguard (1980), you want to see the movie ... with Meatballs (also featuring Bill Murray) for some laughter) and Burgess Meredith. they do not do anything for their careers. <br /> <br /> In any case, Lee Majors, the driving force behind the car, Franklyn Hart, was driving a race car (he had in his repository). California. One problem: The government has banned all private transportation. I thought the concept was OK (I did not hear worse), but the execution was really wrong.
