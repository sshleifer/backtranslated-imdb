A few critics gave a positive comment on the movie. I do not want to argue for their opinion, but I do not agree. When I saw this movie for the first time, it was amazing. But compared to other films, especially with Bruce Lee, I quickly changed it. Indeed, if it's not for the title of the movie, I would never buy it. Death of Game 2 does not relate to the Death of Game (if Billy Lo shares a character) <br /> <br /> I was surprised to find that they were compared to 2 Similar Game of Death. Dragon Plots have a lot of similarity: Bruce Lee and Bobby Lo are just about to get close to their husbands. Both locations are similar, both are very isolated and Blackbelts are surrounded by thousands. In both films there is an element of prostitution (in both films, women are sent to two guest rooms). There's (Enter the Dragon) and Lewis's squire missing a hand. Enter the Dragon's underground drug operation, believe it or not, one is in Death of Game 2. There's a pet cat in Enter the Dragon, the director uses his imagination and Lewis has given him a monkey! The list goes on. <br /> <br /> As for the other aspects of the movie, such as script and theater, I thought it was very poor. It seems the director thought they were looking for a group of artists from a movie and they prayed. <br /> <br /> On a positive scale, I can not deny that choreography is spectacular. While combat sequences have strong acrobatic elements, they are skillfully performed. However, since it is not enough in the plot, I could not connect with the characters; So the fighting sequences were more exhibitions than the sense of cinema. <br /> <br /> To conclude, I would like to say that this film is a movie that is recommended for lovers of martial arts, but for those who enjoy a solid movie action, with a good story and strong characters, I would not seriously recommend this film. . The opinions on this film seem to be very opposite and supportive, but Bruce Lee set a new standard in martial arts, especially after his masterpiece: Enter the Dragon, this film does not rise to these standards. In any case, they imitated a truly brilliant warrior movie to achieve the same level of fame. <br /> <br /> Regarding my assessment, giving this film 10 to 10, the film is a barley that is spectacular and it is thanks for the sequels that have fought.
