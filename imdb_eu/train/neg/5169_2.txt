WARNING: Anyone who has not watched this movie has advised me not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> Even though I did not see them all, Hamilton surely gave them a bit of entertainment, which he did not do. I thought of the giant play, the stupid plot, and at the end of the film, it was very slow, I thought it sucked the movie, well! They are people who eat more people. Yes ... I noticed people because they are not human beings, or because they are not humans, or because they think they're waiting for you, OH, they do not give you! ! Okay, these people are cannibals, or imbreds, or what they are! I mean, maybe they just came from "THINGS" to see people who like to see or see what they eat, they're eating cannibals. For a long time people, or maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE! WHAT ARE? If this is a good Hamiltons, I wonder why, why WHY why it was so horrible, it was just my love for me. A big boooooo! The Hamilton! Go see The Graveancers, Tooth & Nail, or a part of the Borderland entertainment !!!!!
