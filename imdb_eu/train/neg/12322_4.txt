As the overall meaning of these comments seems to be, the movie has a stunning animation (I've watched Blu-Ray), but there's really no depth left. <br /> <br /> First, the characters are beautiful. dull Agito, Tool and Shunack's antagonist, I got something like Laputa. However, maybe I was in my head and this was a wonderful thought (Laputa was my favorite, the original Engilsh dub). The characters are not really lovable, and they are very much in love in a different post, leaving Minka's elderly and jealous sister (she loves Agito, who does not seem to). However, at the end of the end, the Tool forgives, without explanation of heart change, makes the "end" more fascinating. <br /> <br /> There is also a serious explanation. Who are really druids? Is it people? and who are rare women that hang wild with them? There is nothing to explain why they are and how ordinary superpowers can be given by humans. The plants coming from the Moon still do not comply with the gaps that surround it. It's almost a Christmas version. <br /> <br /> And who calls the Tool? why do you try to explain? <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie, but I found it in the plot just as deeply in the movies as Ghost in the Shell, or their true nature. Miyazaki. I do not like to see it, but I do not want to buy it. My advice? Ask for two hours if you pay, but borrow or buy cheap! Maybe you can enjoy much of your new animated movies and if you do not. It's definitely a pleasant sight.
