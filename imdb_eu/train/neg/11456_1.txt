This is one of the films that he thinks: Hogan did the same "American Real"? Actually, I did not think it would have been right. I am Italian, I can not boast my country for many reasons, but I would not have a row for another group (for example, French), because Juliette Binoche is in love. Moreover, the protagonist does not want to fall in love with a British girl at the end of a movie, but why the fish is against Yale. As regards the event, all players act very badly. And then you know, I hate the atmosphere of "the society of the dead" poet. In fact, I hate another movie.
