I saw this as "Last Days" and some Charlie Chaplin movies were full of cinema. Based on the quality of other features, I resolved to "Immortel". I've been out of this movie and I like science fiction! The story is located in a future city of New York, similar to Blade Runner's sky announcements and similar cloning / synthetic man. Unfortunately, the script is not enough condensed for one hour and fifty five minutes. In this world there are three groups: human beings, artificial human beings and Egyptian gods. Artificial man seems to dominate dominance and control of the city's policies. Humans are slaves who use eugenics and organ donations. The Egyptian gods have a mobile pyramid (modeled by the Great Pyramid of Khufu), leaving outer wastes, leaving the pyramid's "cap" soft. The pyramid is above the city and no one understands what it is or why it is there, I'm not bored. There are a lot of gore and a lot of crunchy scenes. The movie, as I said, seems to have affected Blade Runner and perhaps The Fifth Element and The Matrix, which was listed at the end of the Festival in the United Kingdom, France and Italian. The film is FRENCH, but it is used by British actors who do not speak French, so it is clear that their French conversation has doubled, which is a distraction and I also thought it could change the direction of human beings and real animations and bicycles. Being poor is not better than a video game. Skip this.
