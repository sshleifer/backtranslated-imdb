I hardly stayed through a single episode ("Crouch End"). The dialog was sharp and low right. The performance was a tragic one. Eion Bailey, despite his best efforts, is still dramatic, especially without expression. His new eyebrows suggest a botox treatment. Claire Forlan easily played the maid in a distressing movie. The characters were cartoons, each drawing their stereotyped plot on a mostly random plot. Cheesy special effects can be drawn to the TV miniseries quote. But the attempts to create a suspense and an exclamation create an unbelievable pendant through cinematography. I think that the end was supposed to be amazing and amazing, but it was not and it was not related to the rest of the story. If I should compare the overall quality with something else, I would like this episode "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" to be similar to the NBC's Hercules.
