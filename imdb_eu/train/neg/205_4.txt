I jumped to see this movie without interruption and without interruption, to remember the reflection and to remember raves. But, wherever he wanted to get to be terrifying, he went back somewhere else. The black spills, the black rain, the prophetic nightmares, the ruins of scarce wastes all over the house, they grew up before shouting. <br /> <br /> What a despair. The expression mask of Chamberlain's face mask was almost inexpressibly credible but confused, something I reflected on as the film progressed. Originally the mysterious song and the backbone tools that could be feared by terror was a cachephon designed. Modern ideas of modern-day gods, aboriginal peoples believe that white men in April were the first priests and many other options go on like a shopping list in the other dimensions (Dream Time). br /> <br /> [SPOILER] In the last scene, it did not tell me what the director said. Is there a great wave? And what? How big? A tsunami? Yes, well. This is destructive but not apocalyptic. Is the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? It should be quite a big wave. Why? Was the world a bad place? It was not so scary in this film. Actually, I did not think that this wave came out; Because the shadows were thrown by the waves, he left Burton's face. Was Burton's only apocalypse? Fish is happening to people who lose their daily lives. There was no interest whatsoever if he only had it. <br /> <br /> The most awesome scene, and the best example of Weir's potential, was placed in Charlie's apartment to face the elderly Burton. The man of fear of Burton's wife. Charlie asks "Who are you?" and it turns out to be a bit after a while. Unfortunately, the movie has never followed.
