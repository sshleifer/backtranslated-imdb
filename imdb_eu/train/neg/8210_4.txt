OK, here it is: "Nazi Mountaineer is with his friend Dalai Lama". We do, first of all, we will get a great star, no idea, some German accent, and let us stroll among French, German, American and British. Afterwards we distribute enormously large events, which are widely distributed, so that the plot will be almost imperceptibly spaced. But to make sure that the viewer is not sleepy, we are surprisingly absurd details, for example, our hero smokes cigar at an altitude of 22,000 meters. Of course, we must remember that our recipients do not want to read too much subtitling, so all of the wild-haired, character-ridden, Lhasa-banned debasers in 1943 speak English, also with doubtful accents. Of course, the most difficult part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story. So what we do is: Dalai Lama, we are now renewing Nazi relations, internationally, so good movie projectors with radio stations. Old cars and other devices represent the freedom of Western capitalism. Then, our hero learns a kind of clarified and defined Buddhism from his youthful protection, he never really creates or treats himself seriously. We also have many scenarios, the Tibetan society that shows all the respect and protocols that correspond to the rest of the Dalai Lama, even though the hero has deep and profound respect for these people and their spiritual leader. In other words, the viewers believe that this type is now Buddhist, somehow, in its own way, although it seems to us that we do not know what transformation does or how far we want to reach. And finally, we have statistically suspended the film as an amazing surprise at the end of the Chinese treatise (that is to say, in fact), so we opened a political film that opened its doors. It's not like that. So it's my idea. Do you have vat zinc? Can you make movies?
