I remember that I loved this movie. I was 12 years old, I had 64 Commodore and I liked playing Rambo. So, I was really happy when I bought this very cheap movie. I put on my VCR and I started: Man is a very bad movie! Sylvester Stallon says in 3 words the whole movie (at the end of his terrible emotional speech at the end), and has the same expression on his face. And in the middle, stupid love is an amazing thing. I finished finishing the whole thing quickly and I went to the movie to exchange something else.
