Hollywood is back on track. Lots of money, not creativity. I'm sure they were only one oxygen when they wrote the writers. I predicted that the movie would be fun. However, if you're not the latest pop music, you have the mood of this movie. Why waste time It's just like sitting down in a record and you will not be able to give this movie a lot more fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
