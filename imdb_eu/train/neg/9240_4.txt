It seemed to me that it was one of the most interesting German war films in Berlin to make a mini-series about airlift. It is a matter not yet considered. However, the leaders of this series linked it to topicals. It is already beginning with a DVD movie cover, that is, a direct copy of 'Pearl Harbor'. <br /> <br /> Luise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) is listening to her husband as a doctor. (Ulrich Noethen) is killed in Russia and is struggling to survive after the war. She finds herself working on an American base, she works for the best official officer in the country (Heino Ferch), she falls in love, she is pregnant, and suddenly her husband appears again. Come !!! We have often seen that. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play quite well; Bettina Zimmermann, however, does not seem to ever believe it. For some reason, it seems always too late to give the scene an adequate emotional reaction. Simply it has not worked for me. <br /> <br /> Plans and aerial lift action scenes, sometimes exciting, we often do not. The bad things always seem to have happened with the same pilot. <br /> <br /> If you are not a big fan of WWII movies, I suggest you make money in your company: chocolate ice cream is much more satisfying! <br /> <br /> 4 10!
