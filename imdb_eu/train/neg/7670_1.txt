Well, where did my story start? This evening I went to this movie, some friends were not aware of more than just the actors there, and they thought it was a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I told him in the first 20 minutes, what was wrong I decided to see this movie. The plot was rough and the script too. The line was awesome when the audience laughed at people. <br /> <br /> It was not possible to find more plastic cast. Even though some scenes seemed to be much faster ... just like they dragged on without any reason. Very bad edition. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was a waste of time and money. Boo
