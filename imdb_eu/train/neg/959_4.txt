I would give this movie from 10 onwards if there were no more. Claudine Barretto's screening. and I'll take this time to see Kris Aquino here. and ... end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I think that writers (some) have enough of their characters (and their progress) stories to focus on (redundant?). When they came up with the movie, they came up with a story teller. and my goodness, the exhaustion of creativity was ripping off other films. why ?? why this movie got a good review? I would not be worthwhile to give. The movie was terrifying, but the movie seemed more exciting about the folklore about Philippine ... that goes into my category. I wanted more time to improve story lines and set flash back sequences, if I took a clear breath, it would not matter if much content was struck ... SAYANG.
