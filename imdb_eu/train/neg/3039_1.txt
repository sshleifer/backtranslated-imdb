I can always say something to be successful. I see or hear and I get a good feeling. I did not see a good preview of the sensations. I was not mindful about this movie, and I'm not surprised that there are 100 of the worst movies here. I really proved it. <br /> <br /> The first thing that they had thrown before me was the title. I have a problem with Ebonics (incidentally I'm black), but they have used a better title for the movies and this time they use a title that does not have a bad grammar. I heard the conversation, I saw the play, and everything I could do was face up. <br /> <br /> I also think that the dance movie is too much a topic. At least this "You Got Served" was better for me. I did not even think of the soundtrack.
