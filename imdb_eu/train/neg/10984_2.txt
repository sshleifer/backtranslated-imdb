I watched this movie for two hours and I do not know what it is. Someone has died or maybe they did not do it and maybe they did it or maybe they did not. This old days good days (bad old days?) The memories that led to CBC all Canadian films were stinkers. In the end, stinkers have had an exception, but the podium is confused with feminine fashion, a backslash and a sling of dialogue. I have never read Margaret Atwood's books. This movie continues with an excellent Canadian tradition. It's not easy to see. Perhaps they will pretend they would like chi-torokon fashion in Toronto's cool cocktail party. The people in our boonies are a bit pretentious.
