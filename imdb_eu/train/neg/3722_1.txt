I remembered that I was forced (well - FORCED) to watch this movie with the Southern Baptist Preacher, and I loved her too much. He's "flammable" to scare off evil guys. The only thing that "saved me" could have said that it was over and I was leaving and I had a real life. <br /> <br /> Check out the section entitled "The Politics of the Politics Christian Right" in the Sarah Diamond's section, fascinating. And, definitely, more interesting than the movie!
