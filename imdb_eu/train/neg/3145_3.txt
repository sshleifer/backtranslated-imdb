I do not know which ones are related, but I am sure that Lost and Delirious is a re-creation of this film (or a story based on it). The drawing is very similar, and scenes and sets seem very, very similar. Lost & Delirious is much better, so watch it. <br /> <br /> This is moving very slowly, but in the late 60's a French movie is awaiting style. A retrospective little girl from the viewpoint of a girl who went to school. The editing of flashbacks with the current scenes is at first confusing, especially since the audio of each one is superimposed (ie, the present and conversing flashbacks that are seen). Similarly, "girls" are old enough to think they fit into a boarding school. In the end, you can not add a lot of character development.
