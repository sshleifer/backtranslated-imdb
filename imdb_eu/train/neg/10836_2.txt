"Magnolia" is a wonderful showcase that is very little added. As in "Eyes Wide Shut" mode, "Magnolia" is a series of different sections, without coherence. The camera jumps between corridors and corridors, watching the sad characters. Where is the reason to look after these people? Ordinary topics seem like those that are not cared for by others (except John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters) and are self-destructive, deadly, or fragmented. I thought they liked how much I liked the unknown monster of a father by Armin Mueller-Stahle, "shine." There are several attractive and non-attractive characters here, why would we like them with them? <br /> <br /> That said, nothing about "Magnolia" was done. Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are poured on his canvas by canceling it. There are two ideas, in particular, that bomb. Both are in the last minute of this 188-minute movie. The camera flares from one character to another, while singing one of Aimee Mann's coffee songs. Sweet, but not effective, we can not see what happens. The other idea I mention is to say that it is unknown and quite ridiculous. <br /> <br /> "Magnolia" has a great performance. Especially, Tom Cruise did not know he had a show that he did not know. And John C. Reilly plays a decent and really good cop in the last memory. But everything is nothing. When an unexpected secret happened, in a theater a little girl could no longer hold herself up and said: "This is a fool!" I think most of the filmmakers will agree.
