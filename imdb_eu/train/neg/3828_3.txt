In Western 1976, the genre was exhausted and the authors of this film were clearly acquainted. However, instead of lowering the project and not losing sight, they went ahead and did so. It seems that they needed an interesting thread to watch the movie and decided to make it as clean and unpleasant as possible. Hell, worked on The Wild Bunch, why would not it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch has been favored by an excellent script, but The Last Hard Men's script is old, but it's not so old. <br /> <br /> It's hard to know what Charlton Heston and James Coburn were attracted to. respective roles Heston plays a retired lawmaker after escaping the prisoners' violent robbery (Coburn). Heston's daughters (Barbara Hershey) become hunts more personal when they are kidnapped by convicts and suffer from sexual degradation. <br /> <br /> This is precisely when a blood film, when someone is killed, is displayed more than one. top details It's really disappointing because the star pair looks like a mouth watering. There is no rhythm or need in the film. Eternity needs to move forward, but eventually when it comes to doing it emphasizes the evil attention. In short, this is the worst movie by Heston. I am sure that it is one of the productions that he likes to enter the famous dark work.
