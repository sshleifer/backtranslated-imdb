I'm sorry I'm writing a review. Those who read it know that they are going through everything and that is also rare for them to recognize the unknown. Those who read the audience's comments had to be warned before they could watch the movie about the IMDb. At least I can. This is a bad movie! Believe it. The plot is wonderful. The play is a amateur. And the second rate is management, camera work, sets, costumes, etc. Let go
