The comments on this movie have been deleted twice, that is, it seems pretty painful because I'm trying to judge this movie for other people. Please have the opinion of others. Of course, writing in the spirit of Nietzsches's work is not understood, so my comment is totally unchanged. <br /> <br /> I think this is a very bad movie for a variety of reasons. <br /> <br /> Theme: One should be very careful, to make a movie about a philosopher who does not understand a current mass and creates fierce debates among classmates. What philosophers agree is that Nietzsche was an excellent thinker. So, making a movie about life, of course, which includes its "ideas", you should be very careful or, if possible, do not do it. You know wisdom do not know what it is. It might be thought that this is not the same movie review, but the movie is not an imaginary character, it is someone who really lived and has a strong impact on the world of yesterday, today and tomorrow. If he tells a story about a tomato, I can think of the story, but also the chosen theme, tomato. It is the responsibility of producers when they make a movie about real events. Such a particular case and this responsibility was not taken. <br /> <br /> Script: One of the first things I noticed is the accent is ridiculous. Why? What deviates from what it is doing; Nietzsche and found the truths. It does not help put things in a geographic or timely manner. Go ahead, make English right or better yet; German! Even though Mel Gibson succeeded in the right part ... The passion of chasing the characters to speak softly of his tongue. <br /> <br /> Second, it works well. <br /> <br /> 3d, Assante is not represented by the actress Nietzsche. Bad casting <br /> <br /> Fourth, the events are far away. <br /> <br /> And like this. It is a residue of its celluloid.
