When I was excited, I finally heard that this awful event became a movie. The whole era (Southern California in 1980) and issues (drug and porn industry) is brilliant for me. I thought that this fire was sure. I did not seem to be disturbed by Holmer with Kilmer, it does not look like physical or mannerism. Do I think I'm selling tickets? However, I was ready to forget this and I gave him a reason. I was a little surprised at the first day of the show with just four of them as the theater's. Now, the story of the movie and the crime is very difficult, I admit. There was no witness to this violent and brutal act. John Holmes was there, but he was also a pathological lie, and he talked to the policeman who was worried about the family (and himself). Actually, Holmes did not really prove what happened and the crime was not resolved. So it was still a great mystery, this film does not make it clear. The writer who wrote the script had a lot of discretion and most of the main characters were dead. However, there is no real story, fragmented. The script is lightweight and the actors try to push the fine paper lines if they are excessive. Films by Holmes or other people involved do not know. Kilmer's character disappears longer, the girlfriend is dull, the police are jokes. Even though Kudrow's hard-working functions may be sharp. It's a very shallow piece and I dare say it, boring. The director also wants to become a love story. It's wonderful, without knowing what is part of John Holmes's trash. Maybe here's some show on the "Boogie Nights" by Anderson. "Boogie Nights" was innovative and exciting in every aspect. On the other hand, this film was flat and without real charm or style. Although music is out of place, Duran Duran was playing in a supposed scene in 1980. Then is Gordon Lightfoot? Gordon Lightfoot? It was a great movie based on this awful event, but I have not seen it yet. I have not yet seen it yet (if you tell Boogie Nights's Rahad Jackson scene).
