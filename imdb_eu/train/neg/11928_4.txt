Saints of Lives begins with an atmospheric view of London as a lively urban street and sunshine. I expected to keep this atmosphere, but it did not fit into a story that came out anywhere. <br /> <br /> Mr. Othello works for Mr. Karva, his own crime-father's cathedral. At least I think that's what we really supposed to be, but it's kittens dropping in deep sacrifice, so trusting with me is a prick, "he commissions embarrassing little while his girlfriend penetrates father jobs. One of his colleagues is the Runner, a black guy running from A-B, who finds a homeless homeless man at home, wants him to stop racing. The runner spills the boy lost in the Othello apartment. In it, it immediately begins to give more desire. In order to fulfill his desires, Karva kidnapped him. But he does not know what he would be happy for. Is the innocence of being a baby or is it another job? In any case, I do not want to see the boy give it to the second. <br /> <br /> Simply, it's a bit of a bit to go on and there are repetitive scenes. In the end it tries to be moving, but there is no investment for almost any of these characters. In fact, it serves as a boring listener. <br /> <br /> Tony Grisoni, the author of Terry Gilliam's favorite. He wants to immerse himself in a religious allegory, and all this, hell, will be completely untidy, ironically. The characters that gave us the best available at least, or at least, were suddenly strangely curious, the movie would be more enjoyable. As we are right now, it is stimulated by the intelligence that develops the mind that develops the intellectually intelligent boy. Who is the origin never revealed. That's just nasty! <br /> <br /> In addition to an atmospheric momentum and a great score, this film does not recommend it.
