About twenty minutes into this movie, I was already bored. Simply these characters were pretty sad. Sometimes something would be nice, but then things would slow down again. Fortunately, my patience was finally rewarded, and the end of this movie was not bad. However, it was not good enough to be seated in the first ninety minutes. So I would say that the movie was mediocre overall, and, considering all the talents of cast, I would call disappointment.
