I was a fan of Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman, so Sci-Fi Channel had to watch this movie when I started it. I was disappointed. This is just Wonder Woman. the right outfit [he must have changed or refused] and the plot works like James Bond. There is no successful comic book hero, that is, too much power or absolute will. bad dream I do not even think Cathy is so attractive. I would not miss that time.
