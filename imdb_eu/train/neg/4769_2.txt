Unfortunately it was wrong. This movie worsens from the beginning to the end. It was difficult to see, I saw every day at Clarissa It All That in Nickelodeon. I LOVE YOU. Then the next thing I found out was Maxim and it was gorgeous! I really did not hear anything about this movie until I saw an accident. I could not believe it to see something like this. Everything was wrong, but it still looked like someone looked to save a damn ship that was really hard on the team. Bad ... I hope to act and I love to watch it in real movie with a real cast.
