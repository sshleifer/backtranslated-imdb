Alfred Hitchco is not my favorite director, but think about what he could do! The Earth has a strong suspension power. John Garfield is almost always superb and Raymond Massey is full. Nancy Coleman is not a great lady, but she is a very fertile medium and very capable. <br /> <br /> Yes, at the beginning it will start getting angry. Coincidence is too much. And an important issue is void, eventually, to be less than a love story. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch Garfield, Massey and character interpreters. But it's not very good.
