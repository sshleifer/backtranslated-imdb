After reading other reviews for this film, I think that the high markers have been the ones who have been in the study of the coverage, I saw the movie was completely real, with wood screening, screenplay and direction prediction. Be this amazing landscape, this film has some wonderful images, with a magnificent view and dramatic sky and vast expanses of sky. Unfortunately, one of the most memorable things in a movie is behind the cast, it must be a sign of quality note. It is best to avoid the movie, in addition to being completely Western genres, avoiding a reasonable price that can be obtained on the DVD.
