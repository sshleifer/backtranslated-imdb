Believe it or not, "Woodchipper Massacre" gave me a full invitation! For reasons, I have a rainbow with me, just because a group of children played a camera and got into the devil and got some sort of distribution. It goes without saying that anyone with moderate intelligence can afford to have a load of a movie load. The only thing I could do was take the whole thing (without attempting to commit suicide) at first, I was just the only reason I was bored, and the second one ... I think that I wanted to find more of this kind of hatred. I was living ... This movie is a "fear of video" "horror / comedy" about her three-year-old sister-in-law sister-in-law. The youngest child has suddenly shook the Rambo-replica hunting knife unexpectedly. Afterwards, the aunt disassembles several tools (apparently it did not have a single drop of blood in his body!) And his father's car washed into the carriage ... children also embarrassed ... I did not think they were causing nauseating the annoying actresses. Seriously, the voice of that blonde balloon shook me constantly. All the actors were absolutely outraged - literally offering false templates to be written by a chimpanzee who was not literally just minded. Now, I usually value independent efforts, but only those who see the relatives see this! I do not have to take the car's way and watch a 3-minute shot, and the assembly of a long tortured earring with ridiculous music. Also, why should we consider the box's bloody piano box ?! It was a piano on ONE scene and nobody was near death! I remember about this movie. If you do not know about the unblemable garbage, I would recommend that I give half a head to avoid the trash.
