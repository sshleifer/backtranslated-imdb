I wonder how the actors acted in this movie. Annette Bening was really half and a half, what did he look like? Although there was no difference taking place on the ceiling, it would not change the model of the film. Brian Cox played very well. I almost always thought that this behavior had been done, nonsensical, untrue, in a dirty area, that nobody really cared for hygiene. Regarding Gwyneth Paltrow, this question is what was happening in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite awesome. Who would pay such a rough thing?
