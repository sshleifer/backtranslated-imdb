I suggest a suggestion that they may be collected according to the comments in this thread. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate that people wanted to be "compulsory" or "compulsory". br /> <br /> I think that this film and its underlying issues give us some reason. <br /> <br /> Global warming has a lot of problems for people who want it. the desire to do them properly. Especially because it puts people "liberal" because the bedroom does not have to do with morality, which means that conservatives who want to go "good". <br /> <br /> And that's the problem with the movie. Al Gore is a politician. And very successful. Simply, it can not get people involved in wanting others. The political appeal is very large. <br /> <br /> And where we remain a major scientific issue, we remain restricted by the political tendency to force a political issue to those of the political parties. "do well". <br /> <br /> Another interesting question is how these people kidnapped environmental movements?
