The Inspector will complete with Palm Pilot, read "Read the bridal shop" on your computer. I did not know that this was possible using a database storage device. A woman appears without a ticket and never enters. We learn this woman in the middle of the film that works at the Attorney's Office.

However, many errors found in continuity were brought to more than 10 votes.
