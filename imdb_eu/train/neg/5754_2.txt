I saw the mask in the 80's and I now show it in the UK's Fox Kids (very late night). I remember thinking that it was nice in the day and I also had some toys, but I'm tired of looking at tears nowadays. I never realized that this cartoon show was really boring. It's very strange! No near the same league as Transformers, He-man or Thundercats, almost all of them forgot about it. I only see Fox Kids, because Ulysses 31 goes live (if you do not sleep on my mask first). I've forgotten Fox Kids again among 80's 80s cartoons!
