How do you write heavy Italian fats that could be wiped out by martial arts without the need for heart medication? This movie shows Steven Seagal's lowest level of achievement. Since its beginnings, it has been a hateful behavior in its career. In this movie, Alfredo Alfredo manufactured the Alfredo Alfaro Alfredo who feeds most of his workouts. <br /> <br /> An oily, slow and very old film, it's hardly a hero of martial arts action. It's like a clown like a horny one. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal decides to leave the time. This movie takes about 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Instructions: a great Italian fame. In the winds, a crime was taken that a group of criminals would fight with a military-designed dragon to create a response to the latest warrior. This argument, though pathetic and horny, offers some options at the top of the scenes of warfare, along the walls that explode like a comic book. <br /> <br /> I was completely sucked into this movie and Steven Seagal is full joke? yes I did it
