This movie is DVRd because I'm just one reason: I live in Cleveland and Shaq plays basketball for us now and 2. I've always heard it was horrible. The movie was not disappointed. The best parts were Shaq's outfits. The worst parts were all else. My 12-year-old son and I drew and could not look at the screen when Shaq rapping started and we wondered why Max Kazzam did not want to fix his front tooth! However, we could not stop watching it terribly terribly, the story was sucked, like a black hole or a fountain or a tar hole, it was hypnotic. It was a laughter it deserved and we really said we saw "Kazzam".
