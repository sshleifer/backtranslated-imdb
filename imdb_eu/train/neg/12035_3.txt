I expected that this was much better. I love the work of Tim Burton, so I'm very pleased to see these short movies online. Well, they did not expect everything. <br /> <br /> I do not really know what I do not like. I just think they are sad. The sound is hard for me, and most of the characters, although I loved Roy Toxic Boy and Stainboy. <br /> <br /> The Match Girl episode probably wrote to me badly, even though it was pretty fun. <br /> <br /> I do not like the way some characters die. Match Girl basically set up a petrol station, or how Girl Who Stares died. Roy's death was fun, surprisingly. Young people who love cars. Very original ;-) That made me so hard to laugh ... <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not suitable for children. Language and gore That's all about it! 3/10
