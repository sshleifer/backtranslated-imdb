That's really awesome: the most dreaded stylish playwrights creep in mournful conversations and do not aim at either the beginning, the middle, the ending, the cuts, the apparent narrative, or even the cognitive. The "story" is totally unimportant and almost impossible. What's wrong is that style can be called "style": it suddenly clears the remote heads down the spirals, and apparently without reason, there are suddenly noisy or wobbhandhand sections: it only increases "all styles" to almost unbelievable misunderstanding of the project and almost the banal attack of the material. Undoubtedly, the worst movie ever ever made.
