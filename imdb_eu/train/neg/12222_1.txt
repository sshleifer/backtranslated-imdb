(Honestly, Barbra, I know who you are playing in my "review" NOT "all the way. 22 times? How many people do I need to ask you to help? You do not want to make any better, Look at the mirror all day? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Steven Spielberg told Barbra that "this is the best" Citizen Kane movie. "That's pretty saying It's all - and it's a serious warning! <br /> <br /> What are the components of cinamatographic fire disaster, and those who will bargain with you, not forgetting both tears and pain? Components: Barbra Streisand's face, musical, feminist, Barbra Streisand's voice, Barbra Streisand's director and a horrific and idiotic premise, because almost everyone has to have a Hollywood origin, why they would like to play "Art"? Well, you're dead saying Have you interviewed them in carefully prepared interviews? And Streisand has the main ego of all of them! This great achievement da da. Cretin should be surrounded by narcissistic, and yet to overcome all of them? outstanding <br /> <br /> The movie, like all its "solitaire" efforts, is a departure from hell. Every scene in Streisand is automatically spoiled. Stillborn. But that was not enough, he sang a whole series of Streisandy songs? You know, Mariah Careys, Celine Dions and Whitney Hustons of this world poisoned our air of precious waves. That's just worth a hundred episodes for South Park's self-realization. <br /> <br /> Streisand, who wants to dress up as a man to dress up as a rabbi, ZAZ is a bad comedy. Streisand does not seem like a woman, as a clise, but is not he a man? Actually, I am not sure about the man too. Well, did he look like this movie? can not be described in word. E.T. Compared to the high school jock. It seems more strange than Michael Jackson in 2015. It looks HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> Songs. They made me tremble. In particular, "Can you hear Papa as a Mistress of Puppy in me?" and "Tomorrow will prepare for the night, YENTL 2: RETURN TO CROSS". <br /> <br /> Did you know that Streisand played the lead in his career, but he changed his mind. When he said he could change his voice? Do you believe it? He must do it! He would kill one of two flies, that would be it. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading biographies of Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals, contact me by email. <br /> <br /> REGISTERED BY BARBRA STREISAND?
