I've seen all kinds of "Hamlet". <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh was the most ambitious, Mel Gibson was quick and to this point, Laurence Olivier's best, his hands fell. But now we have come to take him to Maximilian Schell's Bard. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, William Shakespeare's chestnut is a double German television production for chestnut. However, somewhere later, later, there are worse and worse versions, it should be done at a school level. <br /> <br /> After watching MST3K, Mike and Robots play good boys with their old boy, drunk in black and white TV, Shakespeare and German intelligence. He plays and plays English that refuses English. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best pieces are MST riffs. The best lines? "I will turn on the Great Dandor," "I do not think," breathing, "" Meet the Beatles, "" Hey, dad, you will help me with my science project, "and my personal favorite at a party -" Garrison Keillor from Germany (YAAAY !! ) ". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But then Schell plays Shakespeare's main character as an establishment mannequin such as expressively. He is definitely an excellent actor, but here he comes up with Paul Newman on "The Silver Chalice". Have you ever seen that? GOTTA watches these two in a double bill! <br /> <br /> In the end, this is the truth, you just need to read the book that you do much better. At least Ricardo Montalban does not duplicate the book. A star is only for this "Hamlet"; Ten stars, of course, for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Good night, prince not so sweet.
