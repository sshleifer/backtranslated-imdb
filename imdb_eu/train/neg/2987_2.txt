This movie is a superb mix of dubbing / translation, and on the other hand, the zombie flick is totally dull. I have not laughed so hard in seeing my Zombi 3 (and I've seen real bad times in my life, I believe). Actually, the filmmakers released this movie again and released them as millions of comedies. It's really fun. <br /> <br /> But ... When laughing at Fulci's dueling, laughing at your movie in a zombie movie is not your tea cup and then DO NOT COST.
