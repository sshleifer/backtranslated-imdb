This is the type of frustration that I like most for me. A great thief, great director, a great potential story, then they destroy everything, with a script from nowhere ... and he will not say anything! Here is no depth. There are no deep characters, no deep plots, no deeper insight, nothing or sense. We know what is happening, he tells us that they want to solve the problem, they solve the problem, they are surprised at the end of a suspense, and then they end the movie. Option wasted. <br /> <br /> Positively, Glenn Ford directs a cast of great actors in the UK (and French). They provide a single-dimensional handwriting script. One of the most favorite favorites is Herbert Walton, "Old Charlie", and gives humor and warmth to dark and serious films. Also, I thought the movie looked great ... all the shadows and fog ... feel very black in film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br I still do not have enough time to watch the movie. Glenn Ford's films are much better: Great Heat, Gilda, Trinity Theme, etc.
