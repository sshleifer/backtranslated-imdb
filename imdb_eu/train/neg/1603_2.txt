If Barry Diamond and Art Evans were not considered stoners without a play, I would not have had any reason to recommend it. <br /> <br /> The Earth is located around a 10-year high school reunion. It happens in an alleged high school school (which looks like a very small budget horror movie in the 1950s), and a terrific student in the classroom pulled out a very traumatic class. This student wants to revenge the whole class. <br /> <br /> John Hughes falls in love with his characters, too, as the only student dies as a luncheon (Goonies' Anne Ramsey). We think it's hilarious that the refrigerator dies, but it's never seen. In the 80s and 90s, a huge film that followed the downward spiral of National Lampoon.
