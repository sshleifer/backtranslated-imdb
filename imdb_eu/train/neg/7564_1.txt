Wicker man. I'm angry because I can not write a suitable comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was ridiculous, close and totally close. Nicolas Cage ... shame! I thought that, as it was there, it would be at least decent. It was not. <br /> <br /> I felt a big part of the movie cut off on the floor of the room, and I felt it was full and composed, the movie was terribly and absurd. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You have finally left your mouth agape, you have a moody taste and a good taste. I've never heard many people hear the theater and that it was so much hate that day. People complained about it in small groups, at the entrance to the four floors. It's wrong. <br /> <br /> I had heard: Glitter, American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My boyfriend was so mad I did not talk about it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
