Seeing this movie was a waste of time and I rent 2 dollars in my life. If nothing happens to die, it will be the greatest regret for my life. Having thought about or financed this movie, he deserves a kick between his legs, when they thought about this movie. He talks about a man with an excess, without romanticism and writes it as a poetry. On a trip to the coast, he joins his beloved companion. Girls and so on. Only the thick man gets a girl. I do not harden the covers on my skin, I wear my face. But this movie tries to be more than one skin film. Some girls are looking for love for Fat Guy, but she finds herself with a silicone girl who enjoys her poetry. She finds her talent for a volleyball, she gets money from her family and gives her an impression on women, even though she only has her own lady. The interview is incredibly wonderful for a C movie. Black stereotype, a tone that develops without a character, is a pornographic film glorified, without pornography. Never watched this movie ever.
