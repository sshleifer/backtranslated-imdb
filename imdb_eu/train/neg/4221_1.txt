Maybe. Francis Veber, one of the world's best comedian director (at least holding his native France), is trying to make a movie slow down completely just because of the mortal man. Not only are the characters so familiar or that the movies are not the least spirits: it's really physically painful to watch, the endless parade of writing, acting and drama, that you can not believe. He is the work of experienced and talented filmmakers. Once in the cutting room and the near eternity of the shelf, he tells the whole story of the play-off before his gesture and lost-loss. What did they think?
