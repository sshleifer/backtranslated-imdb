The movie is bad There's no other way to say anything. The story is weak and obsolete, especially for this country. I do not think what most people are doing or "cared for". I felt I was watching a 70s movie. The theme was not believed in 2007, although it was set in DC. I think that those who have seen it have all those who have seen low and fast applause. Most are not stopped by Q & A. <br /> <br /> I do not think Schrader really thought about it before the movie. It seemed like a lot of scenes were missing, as if they were never finished, or did not know how to finish it. He jumped from one scene to another and invented or invented what happened. Woody (Carter) did not even get my private life or boyfriend. What were "artistic" bondage and torture pictures from Iraqi prisons? What did he think? I think it was a bad attempt to create this dark private infrastructure for Woody's character (Car). It does not work. It seems he did not really make sense. <br /> <br /> Woody Harrelson was a good thing about this movie. He played his character (Car) brilliantly. It was really sensible to look like a "walker" (now twenty years ago). It was great and it would surely never be recognized. <br /> <br /> Lauren, Lily and Kristin ... As boring. <br /> <br /> Do not see! It's painful! Unless Harrelson is a fan.
