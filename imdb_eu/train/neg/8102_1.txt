Oh, I heard so much about this movie. I saw with my best friend (female, I am a male). Now, leave us a different opinion of the mainstream. After the first twelve dozen "clothes are taken away", we both felt a strange combination of agitation and boredom. We laughed (with that, no), we slept (and we would stay in bed), we're sure we spent money in vain. And we had it. The plot was not consistent and the characters were careful and not cared for. Loss of money, celluloid residue. This movie is not worth one out of ten votes, but that's the smallest one available. I do not know why it's an excellent movie; I do not recommend anybody who likes or understands it.
