If this movie is to score a linear scale, I have a low score of 3/10. <br /> <br /> But it was fun and there are some good things about saying good things. <br /> <br /> James Bishop assigns a resident psychiatrist to San Andres Hospital for his residents, and he is eager to "change the world". <br /> <br /> If you know from the outset that the movie hides the hospital, it's a bad thing, James thinks he can make a difference and do not know it badly. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty well structured, knowing that you know about the truth about the patients about what is happening to the wicked inhabitants, and wonder how and how James will know how to do it. When it comes to the break, James attacks the evil one, and you'll feel some suspense until the "fight" ends. <br /> <br /> Add the worst possible time to a beautiful innocent girlfriend and other horror elements, and you get a picture. <br /> <br /> Collecting the character is pretty good, you get access to most of the people that kill you, some of them "know". <br /> <br /> The film creates an unpleasant scene, which also works well. There are mysteries that are displayed in an acceptable way. <br /> <br /> The main character, James is very compelling, the story of a student that is starting to work is good in this area. <br /> <br /> This movie is dying: * Special effects tight - Modern version of "9 spaces 9" is bad (evil monster resembles red scarf). Improper play (or surely shooting). - Sometimes the main characters play badly and sometimes they are good. * The sound is very cheap. <br /> <br /> I can do this film "such as my home video camera I can do for the movie".
