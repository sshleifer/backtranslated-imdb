This is a movie that wants to be good, but it's horrible. First of all, what are the hell with the school? I think children do not realize the seriousness of this situation. He told the guy she was responsible for why she wanted to go back, but then she gave her a gun on the wheelchair and would only go straight to the phone line. Where is the responsibility? I understand that the actors have to pay for their food, but why not make money like that or give money to charity. Yes, and nobody knows how he wants them. The stupid boy Punk shoots in the cafe like mad at any moment. Everyone wants to be a professional, but they all suck. I do not even think there's no way out of school, the kids try to get around the door, but they're all locked in. What happens if there is a fire and the security guard is killed? It's illegal to have an outlet at school. In any case, to say much more, it would be too long. I spent some time in my life.
