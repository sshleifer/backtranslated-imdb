My God Oh dear god, I can not pass this movie. He was a terror of terror. horrible, horrible! Do not miss out on purchasing money at 99 centimeters. If you do not want to avoid it, you can see it! <br /> <br /> The movie I ever saw was the worst. In my life In my life !! <br /> <br /> First of all, little girl? You're joking Get the real one that is similar to a new Barbie doll ... Super Woman? You're joking False fake faxes were so fake. The people of the town also did not seem to mind that there was only one blonde flying to get around the town ... save fire ... Ohh big! <br /> <br /> Jesus was just that the movie made me seem offensive? You have to be a superhero, do you think I have a couple of double D, blond hair, not glasses and a leather leather suit ?! .. god, I do not know It was a fear that one of the love would bring art to a show and be more in love in bed and air than in love. <br /> <br /> It was pathetic, everything went quickly. First of all, he was senseless, rather than dating G-girl ... than Hannah's little girl was breaking ... and ... she's still. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I am thinking of this movie ... What the hell did they get at theaters? !! <br /> <br /> Avoid the movie at all costs.
