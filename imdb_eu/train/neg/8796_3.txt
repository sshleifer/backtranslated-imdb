The average audience looking for a coherent sense of a movie should surely give this one. When an image looks at the curious individual images with individual relationships, it creates the same feeling, but they will never come in full. <br /> <br /> This insulating vision is to create a kind of cinematographic ensemble. They are considered to be some students or critics involved in filmmaking cinema, it is very annoying and enjoyable for those who have recently dropped out of lies. Avoiding accessibility is an essential characteristic of authors such as Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but Andy Warhol has warmed me. The only thing that I find is the production values, which will not be cut only by themselves. <br /> <br /> One of these productions is one of seeing and listening and producing anxieties. and a clear development of ideas or thoughts to keep all beautiful and beautiful scenes of individuality in vain. I'm sorry. Calligraphy credits start to unexpectedly grow. I leave with great pleasure and read it, I think they are very well known and well-known about this film that is not very understandable. Ideas and images without external context are not my idea of ​​fun. <br /> <br /> In the streets of Hong Kong I call the Philistine Chop Suey Bowl. <br /> <br /> <br />
