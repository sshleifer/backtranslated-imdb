- The movie is covered with a meteorite in a lake. The locals do not know, dinosaur eggs are also at the bottom of the lake. The weather heats the lake, it becomes a giant incubator. You guessed it, releasing a dinosaur that begins to frighten the community, the eggs tighten the eggs. What is litter I do not like the dinosaur in a clay stagnant, it's all that is disturbing to me. The performance is atrocious. The conversation is totally ridiculous. It's just comical comic relief. Logic does not exist. The similarities between scientists and similar scientists in this film are in full swing. I would continue to be an aspect of the bad part of this movie, but you get the idea. I think it's quite safe to call it a "MST3K worthy" call.
