Yes, children are going outdoors and age will begin as children respond to each other and learn to use ropes. Then, in 1986 they presented at Jinx, probably the robot that was not existent in 1986, since they have nothing to do with this artificial intelligence. Kid becomes a robot, and the boy rescues his courtesy in the outer space of this camp with a small oxygen supply that fights with other boys and does not have radio signals to reach spaces. This campaign is not too funny because children put real training and teachers get them from doing their missions or doing things well. Leave the rest, they are fun, they are not yet astronauts, just give space military experience as a non-military camp. However, Joaquin Phoenix gets quite a beginning role. So, the movie that wants to be realistic in some areas, but also in Jinx and other factors, would have to fight foreigners on all other things that happened on the film. at least a nice movie for me. Surely, others, who wants Kate Capshaw's face to extract a strange alien creature.
