The bad news is really awful. I've given 2, occasionally kitchy slapstick parody of some of them seems really fun. <br /> <br /> It is better than "Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker", and the progress is to be rewarded. Or maybe I drank a lot when I saw it and I felt generous. Regardless, it's "2". <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie may be pretty fast. Kill Bill takes into account the main elements and fight scenes of the main themes of I & II, cutting them down, stinging them down, snooping in the conversation, and taking up an entire mess about an hour at a great video. <br /> <br /> You want to burn something as powerful as possible. And return this DVD to a video store for a period of time! He'll hate you if you pay late.
