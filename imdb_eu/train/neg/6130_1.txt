In the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was a hero of the United States. Certainly, men in their position are just like that shooting. I do not know what Thomas paid for this movie, but I would have to pay a large amount of money in national cinema to agree to my fool to internationally. Obviously, films are films derived from "Enter the Dragon", as well as images of martial arts. Instead of just a real martial art, they create an absurd martial arts, a critic describes a cross between "Kung Fu and dance break". A gymnast (Thomas, of course) hires some women to get rid of fortifications, but in every room, Thomas is an assistant who needs to tighten up. Of course, he fights against the lead driver and, of course, fancy-dancy fights, never ending an astonishment that will see those who watched the movie. There are many touches of nostalgic likes, especially Thomas's hair cuttings and many male coalitions. But if you're only looking for Kurt Thomas to see this movie, you might have wanted it now.
