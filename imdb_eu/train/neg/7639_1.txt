I watched this movie at NY Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and I thought it was pretty bad. It was the first and most weird thing to have shot; That is, there was no point in moving slow and very close to the archives - a story wise or aesthetically - rather than showing the skills of the filmmaker (who I was the director). This movie seemed like a pretentious film student. The main actress (Sam Levine) was very nice, but in the middle she was an actor. and the other cast were so many and bad. The story itself was, above all, annoying predictable. I must point out that most of the audience enjoy the movie; I laughed and sighed continuously, but I liked it a lot.
