Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin in the third film of the Home Alone empire. The four-spy industry obtains the missile guidance system with a computer chip and is transmitted via an airport within a remote control toy car. As a result of the baggage mess, Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) is great for the car. Alex (Linz) gives his neighbors before the spies appear. Spysters rent a house to compact each home of the neighborhood to the location of the car. With only a wave of chicken, Alex calls 911 at the same time a robbery, but the police always flee from the police as he claims he can make calls. Spies finally focus on Alexia, they do not know how to capture their home in a compact device. Only 3 in the house was not horrible, but it was probably not necessary, you can not replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 had some fun parts, but I do not like some characters when they change in a series of movies, with their own risk.
