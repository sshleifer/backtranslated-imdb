This figure is a French movie, LOL, emphasizing the younger girls who are younger men ... why is French doing things like that? When age difference is very good, it's really clear! Valentina Cervi is beautiful (similarity is similar to Olivia Hussey, Zeffirelli's 68th Romeo and Juliet), but she looks at the age of 15 and the actress Tassi, the painting of her teacher, plays ... well, it's 50 NAME. <br /> <br /> Other posters have made the historical record of Artemisia's true artist (in this case accurately detailed). It is one of the oldest celebrities of the time. Century). His story speaks of modern times, especially because of the ancient accusation, because "all great artists were men" - this assertion is pretty curious, and its rape trial is so odd. He was not only clearly attacked and became a stunning sexual intercourse (these days were the only way to avoid social aggression that was not your attacker), but Tassi was a rape series and probably killed his wife and child. > <br /> The film makes a great deal of an invigorating and dramatic story reversed - it is very dramatic and has no "odor" - it is oddly curious because it is "warmer". a teenager drawing a male sexual organ and a man of great love, as a grandfather. That's "sexy" - the truth seems boring and feminist / politically correct. <br /> <br /> Besides, I am shocked that artemisia for artemis is a unique part of life. He painted the decades before (painted before the explosion of the famous paintings by Juditek Holfernes), he told them he was the first woman included in the prestigious Florentine academy. boring stuff After all, it's about a middle-aged woman and they're not as hot as young people. <br /> <br /> I understand that there is a real license for a movie (or a book) for licensing and a historical character. You need to create a dialog box, have subplots, create a dramatic structure. Certainly, some details can be sacrificed: it is not as important that the dates are moving a few years or when Artemisia acts as a blonde actress (we know from her portraits that she was a brunette ... and a great slurry, not a skinny one), or something like that . But condemning his story and transforming romanticism is really bad and disturbing. Even worse, the director is a female. He must be ashamed of himself! <br /> <br /> If you like this (and I know that you are a true female artist for the care of some people and the period is like clothing and hot sex), you probably like "Dangerous". Beauty "with Rufus Sewell and Catherine McCormack. Also, based on a re-written history, we have a lot of chopsticks and fine chopsticks: Bon Appetit!
