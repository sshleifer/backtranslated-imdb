Lethal director, otherwise, destroys a compelling story at that time, which honors Zhang Ziyi, as a woman who connects China to a first extreme in China in 1928, before joining the Manchurian Japanese invasion and her first lover working today. Japanese Ye Lou's drowsman-style drama and each movement of the movement dries. Characters are looking at each other for a few minutes, without saying anything, in the faces showing permanent reactions instead of holding hands, the same reaction repeats triple redundancy. The character is not known at all when the story begins and the story progresses as it gives a small amount of information, silence and type of words, not just static love, silent dance interaction but with no emotional emotional intimacy. A movie with a loose induction.
