In the end, I caught the night of "Starlight" on television and I can say everything. . . wow! It's hard to know where to start: special effects that have become very emotional (look out for Willie's eyes, laser beams!), Immense reactions, solid conversations, footage that do not match or look like the air. It drives full production. This is really a unique experience, and we must all appreciate it. I've been named Jon Woodson in Ed Wood's true heir!
