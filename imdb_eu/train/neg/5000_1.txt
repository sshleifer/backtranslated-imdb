This is probably the worst excuse for TV programming, I do not know, WHAT DO WE DO? Never happened in this ridiculous "series". Although Britney and Kevin have shot mostly, you do not get a good deal of detail in their personal lives. Above all, they make small, stupid and bad speeches, and they act like rude guys. Look, I like Britney's music just like the next day, but this show is just a filler of a nation that is addicted to Britney, they want to see their shoes (yes, this is a real section). Thank God, these two were broken, they were very sad. This exhibition is TOXICO!
