I watched this movie in the theater again in the original version. It was hard Peter Sellers was so misunderstood. The story was very flexible and difficult to follow, and the end was ridiculous. It was sad to see how Mighty appeared. I did not say that I am a fan of Peter Sellers, but I enjoyed the Pink Panther series and I felt that it was a good performance "There". But this movie should never be done. As I have read, this film continued to be produced against the advice of people around him. That's fine, but that's not really a film of this studio yet.
