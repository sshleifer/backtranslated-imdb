I can not stand the most reality shows and this is worse than Paris Hilton, and its company is sure to. But how long are you "or are you" hired? After seeing the show, I would not want to work with his own situation and I think everything is much better than seeing dry paint. <br /> <br /> A person should get up and hear. Say "I've left Donald and took your money and bought a decent hairstyle." I can see WWE fight wrestling as a fame. I hope he does not hurt himself, I no longer have to see his pathetic face. It must be sad to try to make the reputation so bad and not be talented and buy yourself. This show would give me a negative brand, if possible, but I get one and it's not worth it.
