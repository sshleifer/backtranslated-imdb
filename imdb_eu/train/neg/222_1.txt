As a single woman of over 40, I was very insulting at this movie and they were subjected to single women over 40, not any other woman, at any age. A man attempted to write and direct his "Chick Flick" was dull and pathetic, and he failed in defeat. Andy McDowell has not started acting much, but he has not had any chance when he's "on the plot" (I mean, I'm talking about a land plot). For a person to feel sympathy or empathy, and it is not an attempt to make this film realistic or compelling. And then, it's a sudden fantasy of male straight female, who suddenly decides to try lesbians. Please <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not get my money on the DVD rental. I want them 112 minutes of my life. What is bounced
