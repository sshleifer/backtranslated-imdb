I should have heard They warned me and, however, I paid the money after reading all the reviews, after knowing that the original was "so bad", and part 2 did not fit into that category, yet I was not able to resist it. Here's exactly what happened? The first part was deadly, it was so politically correct, and other Crazy, Fat Entertainment, and this, the worst part of the Earth's land, worse than Basket Case 2, hell or Troll 2. This is the worst set of history, which is really the basic carnation of the original taking into account the characteristics. The part of the nonsense of the crime 2 bad brand was completely different. Video shot, zero score, zero entertainment value, 1/3 original flashbacks, and all of that, crazy, fat Ethel has lost some of his body. I mean, honestly, is this a joke sick ?! Thank you Nick Milliard. 1/1
