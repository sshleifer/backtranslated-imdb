A plain and common thriller about a conventional woman who deceives the Bank account. Nicole Kidman Tracey is misleading, married to Andy's ex-husband (Bill Pullman). An old friend from an Andy school named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) appears as a surgeon, there are no problems behind. <br /> <br /> Script fails because it fails to develop the premature hope of failure. An effective and tempting thriller, and the character's motivation, background and lack of development leaves the show full of serious. It is never a question of creating cast-cats for interest in their superficial characters, especially Bill Pullman, who is unexpectedly surprised by Andy. and it is impossible to make them free. While the 'secret' of the plot is revealed, you do not mind. <br /> <br /> At least cinematography in Massachusetts looks good. George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer also appear. On Sunday, February 25, 1996, T.V.
