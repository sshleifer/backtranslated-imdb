Honestly, who gave this movie to God on behalf of God 8.1 rating? I think those who voted for people who actually made or starred in the movie. Otherwise, this movie sucks! This movie is not an amateur movie or maybe a student. I am a fan of a movie, and I've seen films horribly, but here there was nothing literally breaking up. I've never seen the story and performance worst. Props, toy airsoft including special effects of the gun, including where everything else is included. I'm a bad language in the movies, but I fall into F-Bomb in every third word and I think that any movie that could be used in the F-Bomb. The movies seem to have been cheated on video cameras and not shot in the same movies. I would await prizes to get an amateur film displayed only in public places throughout the country, but it does not fit into a DVD. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. I can say the movie is for a free rental coupon. It's a great time to get back to you. Unfortunately for me, this time has been lost, but it's not too late. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this my warning.
