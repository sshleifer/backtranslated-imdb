Michael Jackson would demand a better place for the GOLDEN CHILD, and he loves children. That does not work (and why should they do that?), That's why we will save Eddie Murphy world through "Kid Midas". All the scriptwriters of the future would recommend that I discuss the intense dialogue of the actress in this fantastic adventure - adventure - the closest comedy to ISHTAR. Murphy likes or likes what he does, but I'm not bad about his superb comedian talents; It's not included in this movie, and it's the same as the DR. Dolittle! Violence and images have been combined as the reasons for sealing as a classic worship camp, which would not make sense to keep Hollywood and fanatical cinema insensitive. When they talked about vision, the reputation of Ronald Reagan came out well during the presidential election. Murphy is much better in AMERICA AND ONE 48 OTHERS, but the outdated movie has not touched my golden honey with a crisp touch.
