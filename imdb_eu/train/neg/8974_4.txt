This movie I'm not going to call a "movie," was basically nothing and, above all, it worked for the popular actions of that era. Yes, we started the war (shootings), and this film gave us a treat and the spectators. <br /> <br /> But let's have something more. <br /> <br /> <br /> He loved a young Buddy Rich in the drum. music was good all over. <br /> <br /> But one older coffee happens faster. <br /> <br /> I did not know Zero Mostel! So if you're "the greatest generation", as you say, you'll definitely enjoy ... <br /> <br /> the movie.
