Racism and prison conditions In the 1970s, rural "social comments" allegedly had "stereotypical" "southern nightmare" with false accents. The sensitivity of most North American countries would not only be offensive. The part of this piece of work has only been released in a short "prison" film; especially as opposed to the original version. However, acting is above the average and later, Chuck Connors makes a good job of hating audiences, even though it does make some scenarios uncomfortable. Also, Robert Reed, the role of the patron saint, is the role of the momentary change and Tina Louise ("ginger before Gilligan's Island") was a compelling syllable guardian. My grade: D. <br /> <br />
