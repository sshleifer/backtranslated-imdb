I've seen bad movies (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this movie is horrible, so I saw BORING in the middle and I did not experience the rest. A pity Talented Talent, such as Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and John Grisham. What went wrong? Branagh is a lawyer with a great night with Davitz. His father (Duvall) is a psychopath that hangs his cat, and so on, etc. Branagh sends him to a nuthouse and immediately escapes. Somehow (I could not know how) Robert Downey jr, Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are mixed with the story. I really liked it, and, being a fan of Grisham, I read about this movie and it seems to me very interesting. This is actually the NEW CINEMA I have seen so far and can return my money. * outside *****.
