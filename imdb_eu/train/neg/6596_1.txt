This is a gap-jawed, horrified silence, and still continues to be hypnotized, it's a kind of film look, seeing a slow train watching train. However, the thoughts in the back of your mind are blurred: "Who has cleaned up this earth on the ground?" <br /> <br /> Some comments from previous users say a few things, "Laurel and Hardyri" "Good way to present children" - Everyone who insults children. Children should learn a slapstick comedy to learn to love comedy, to understand the nature of children around the world. Understanding, others have commented on the loyalty of the characters of Laurel and Hardy's two stars, and that's why I would answer: so, WHAT can you think of a BOMBS-based series based on Rocky and Bullwinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mod Squad, ad nauseam? In the end, Hollywood would have taught that some things can not be recreated. Laurel and Hardy's films are easily available on the video: why are you wrong? <br /> <br /> With fray F. Abraham, theater and screen actors. Well, I can say everything. It was a problem with the IRS. <br /> <br /> Run, not on the run, if the trash is away from the TV!
