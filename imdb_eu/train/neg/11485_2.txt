Forbidden Siren Siren 2 is based on the Playstation 2 (so much 2) game. Most video games like movies, for example, make up most of it. And this is also very difficult. <br /> <br /> The preface that explains the premise of the story is quite long and the mysterious writer (Leo Morimoto) and his daughter, daughter. Yuki (Yui Ichikawa) and Hideo son (Jun Nishiyama) have come. Citizens do not feel comfortable and soon they are advised on the island's mermaid when they close home and the mermaids get angry. <br /> <br /> Of course, things start. relief, and our brothers and sisters go to a mission around the bush exactly with what is happening with the weird islands that are taking place in this disgusting island. But the truth is that you do not get bored with what happens, folklore and fairy tales to be confused with a lot more. What was really happening in the field of a bad comedy was that they were very badly placed in the unexpectedly unexplained case until much later. It's about trying to introduce a moving and intelligent thing, but to convince something else and cover the gaps. <br /> <br /> In less than 90 minutes - I think it's a phenomenon of horror movies - an execution rhetoric - it's a two-hour feeling, slow to tell you how you want it. Things start in the last 20 minutes, but it's a classic case that's too late. <br /> <br /> What saves the movie is how it transforms and is the final revelation. Once again, a horror movie is a simple device to bring a seemingly simple, something extra for hope to offer the audience. He appeared to be delighted, but left untrue as he felt deceived. There are two ways you think: the movie rises a memorable level or offers a touching feeling. Unfortunately it was the second of the Forbidden Siren. <br /> <br /> The saving of support will be its cinematography using light, shadows and mirrors, but this will be explicit - it is still not worth the time, so it is better to avoid this.
