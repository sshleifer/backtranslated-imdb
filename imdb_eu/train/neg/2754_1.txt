The original review of this film was written in more than 2000 times. While criticism was very detailed, I thought that my opinion was a bit more description. <br /> <br /> I will start with the main actor; His facial expression does not change once in this film, it does not show fear, happiness or depression. Her body language skills are hardly hiding and concealing and do not know the jack. It's an emotional skin that guesses what he has too much botox. The absence of the face of the face of the film, however, does not go anywhere and it seems that the main actors from nowhere, in love with the beach and in love at both hours. The main agent, who demands more attention than his hair, was helpless and felt no danger at all. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is the most terrible thing to do is to correct it. plot storyline and pure accuracy. I have watched ads with more structure than this movie. There is no importance in the development of the character, I do not believe that they just say things that a real person might think. <br /> <br /> This film would not be bad if it wanted to be rough. I was trying to snake a plane but so hard I did not laugh. I believe that I am currently experiencing a brain tumor when I watch this movie and I thought all that I could think of that quote and group cg group was something to create something higher. If I purchased this DVD, I would break the DVD, burn it, then I would dissolve it in the hydrochloric acid. Do not miss this movie!
