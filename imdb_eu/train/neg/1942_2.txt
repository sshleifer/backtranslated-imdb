You do not mind if your emotions are playing, then you do not care about this movie. On the other hand, if you enjoy the mysteries of the British crime, you will be very disappointed if you can see the traces of the end and eventually fall into the logical way. <br /> <br /> Here are some logical incongruities. Disassociate to this: <br /> <br /> * While the police use camera cameras inspectors, it has not been caught before the disappearance of the huge truck that stopped blocking the traces of mystery, blocking the child's vision and blocking it. camera This is a critical part of the mystery. It is a car that does not capture the baby's camera and not a great truck with a very critical mystery. <br /> <br /> * The film has a long length to track the sophistication of the equipment. the loss of children's movements but the possibility of using the same sophisticated equipment is lost, which track the vehicles that have entered the crime scene next to the crime scene. Clues are developed. <br /> <br /> * In England, driving is on the left. The director allows the car to be removed from the right-hand side of the crime park, several meters behind the flower kiosk, immediately stop or side by side; like big trucks. <br /> <br /> * The police court is so strict that it is impossible to find a mobile phone in the excluded exit, but a thousand kilometers of crime, but no evidence of blood can be found. From the point of view of the crime in the field of crime, even after the disappearance, only a few hours were achieved, and there was no rain. <br /> <br /> * Search for dogs that were not used to find unplaced children; This is a country well known for the development of a dog for hunting and hunting. <br /> <br /> * It is senseless that this news item that was not widely used to stop the truck would appear to be an innocent truck driver. The flower kiosk itself - it just could not get out of the cell phone without a search. It was enough for her daughter to apply for her daughter's carpets under her claw, asking for her daughter's help as simple as she could ask, and also left in a mobile home in a busy home. <br /> * Little girl kidnapped the suspicious portrayal of slow intelligence / shortened - justified why this mom is drowning? But he had enough intelligence to carry out the rights that he did not keep himself in charge of coping with the police. <br /> <br /> There is such dissent as this creates the disappointment of real fans. The story of British crime "Five Days" is very weak.
