Good: I liked the movie, because it was the first horror movie I've seen for a long time. The play was not bad, and the murderer "Cupid" was compelling and disturbing. <br /> <br /> Bad: the story and plot of this movie is very weak. There was not much. The murderer killed a very terrifying and shameful way. I do not recommend Gore to anyone who does not allow this film. <br /> <br /> General: good fear, but a bad story. <br /> <br /> ** outside *****
