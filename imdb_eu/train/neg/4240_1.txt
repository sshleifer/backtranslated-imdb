We all know that Hollywood has a vibrant historical event, and it's a Dutch film for 44 minutes. For example, bank robbers did not return to the bank when they started filming at the LAPD, but we've seen twice in the movie! Another example is the number of official LAPDs filmed at the end of the movie, which is not true! But, of course, Hollywood should add good blood and blood. Some events were combined and the main actors played several people, but this is what Hollywood has always done. Why complain? I think it's a bit sad: I've seen some North American TLC shots, which is better!
