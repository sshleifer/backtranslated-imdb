This whirlwind movie combines MTV music clips as a true movie. If there's a real story and the movie goes ahead, ask yourself: "What will happen?"; But nothing happens. Eric Cloeck, a story about frustrated writer, is the only thing. The rest do not have anything in common: why bring them in a movie. You can watch the shortest movie with music. When I open the faucet and when I get water with Bach's music, most people would like to look, but this is not a movie. The director must learn to write a script for a 100-minute movie or more before starting a movie.
