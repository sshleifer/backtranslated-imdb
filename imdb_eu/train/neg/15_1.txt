This is. This is. It's the worst movie ever. Then Everything plays. I have never seen anything worse. Build the trophy and give it to the people. There is no empty comparison. <br /> <br /> After seeing that in three days (I do not know why I still do not know) I can not believe how frightening this movie is / was. It's so bad. Until now, anything that could possibly be a movie, a story or our existence. <br /> <br /> This made me doubt that humans actually put this earth on or did not do it good. In this universe I feel like a species that we have developed as a species. This type of movie is heartbroken as a society. We should be scared I can not really stress the global responsibility and art that we live here, that we must avoid the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our benefit. It's shame I do not know how the director of the actress, writer or film performs sleeping at night with a role of "Loaded". I do not know what kind of disgusting monsters like to watch these types of movies. <br /> <br /> That said, I love the movie "bad". I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are HILARIOUS. They say that all my friends are "bad". <br /> <br /> But this ... this "bad" line crosses a new dimension. This is wrong. This is the bad thing where you know everything that happens, each line, each action, each death, in all sequences; and not just as a second or two years before, I mean as before, after seeing the first 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Each cheek for editing the "effect" is used repeatedly to an illness point. I really never want to see a "heavy camera" "effect of drug buzz pressure" or cut cuts or cuts off or cut off MORE ON WEEK more than once. This is boring, repetitive and only torture the audience. <br /> <br /> But ... and let me know when I am more precise, this movie is a TASTEER that is produced thanks to production. This fair amount of money really went into this basket. I will personally take the shoulder of the director to see him and shake it, fall home and swallow two gallons of Drain-O or I'll be asking. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Believe me, I think that the suicide methods will be more strange after the seventy-seventh season. <br /> <br /> Stop these movies from all the aspects of our society. Please. Stop. ORAIN.
