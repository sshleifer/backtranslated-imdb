Guy Richie's third-handed movie (without telling the divine "Swept Away") is a thriller complex in the game, gangster, and chess, and as opposed to Richie's efforts, Revolver will hate it. Richie Stalwart Jason Statham plays Jake, a newly released ex-con, to revenge Dorothy Macha (a brilliant OTT Ray Liotta). Instead, it is hit by another (one of them is Andre 3000). The Outkast rap outfit (the viewer, himself and herself), is a very serious movie. All of them are very boring. The peak of this movie mix is ​​in the restaurant, where the conversation is activated. When Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata sound was brilliant, Revolver is a flawed one, not really scary, but far from Richie's best. This block would be Stock. School assignment of homework assignments would be graded "you should try the most difficult!"
