Talking to the audience, this movie is amazing. It has some wonderful black comedies. But, in general, the plot is very topical, since it is an apparent message. If you are a fan of the highest violence, such as hospitality or entertainment in live movies, it loves you. If you are looking for something on the top side, drive away. I saw it as part of Edinburgh 06 Festival, and I only chose something I was looking forward to. In the end, it's not disturbing. Just sit back and it's unpleasant to sit. If you really want to challenge, see Something Lost. If you want to get it, or if you want to make a really upbeat movie to your friends, that's it for you.
