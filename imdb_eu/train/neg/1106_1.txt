Do not miss this time. As portrayed, the characters are not worth the sale and interaction they see torture. It was at least "Gothic" entertainment, that's crap. If you like to see the infected and infected poets who want to crush each other, this will be right in your street. Lord Byron is fully represented, and why others would choose to spend more than five minutes really amazing. Mary Shelly has the only character that does not have any backbone, but even if she does not take her from a great deal of respect. Waste time See Gothic instead I also remember that I saw another movie based on the same subject, but I did not get any titles. I expected that, but it's not such a luck. It is not recommended.
