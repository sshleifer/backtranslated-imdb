I've heard stories about this movie, very good ... Well, last week I had the chance to see cheap ebay price. <br /> <br /> I saw it and I just got a few comments. about it: 1) Awesome story, 2) Awesome activity, 3) Bad fighting ... <br /> <br /> I have never seen a movie of my life any worse! When the story is bad, at least something more interesting. But the NEWS are terribly bad ... <br /> <br /> * The only positive opinion about this movie (I think) is Nikki Berwick. God, it looks nice in this movie. <br /> <br /> That's right ...
