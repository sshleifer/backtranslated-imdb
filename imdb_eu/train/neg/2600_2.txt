There is a movie that fails in every way that fades a movie. Awesome recording, bad performance, amateur directing, special effects calmly ... it's absolutely terrifying. In the end, when you realize everything does not make sense. If the whole world is asking about what's going on here, you will understand that the things that have been described above have been built on a foundation that has not been built with great care. "One of those terrifying criminals in a sequence that explains the whole movie," he has done something that our criminals can not easily do, and that makes no sense. Oh, and after that, there seems to be no monster-o-monster. Surely Drew Barrymore would love that movie ever. If you are tempted to sit down and see this movie for any reason, I recommend that you take this time for 104 minutes to wall up against the wall. That experience would be much more enjoyable than sitting on this garbage.
