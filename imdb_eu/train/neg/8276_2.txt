I know this movie would not be amazing, but I thought I would give it an opportunity. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson and I thought he had the potential. Unfortunately, a great part of the film's conversation was a very false rumor and cheer. I think that Aquafresh has made money for the production of films, which were giving a lot of hints. There is a shot that recognizes Aquafresh signal for you, so you can not realize it. Perhaps, in writing and acting, we should take more action than Aquafresh products that we can drop in the movie. The movie had its moments, but I'm glad I did not spend $ 9.50 in the theater.
