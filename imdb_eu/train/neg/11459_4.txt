Bale hunters choose a horrible whale. <br /> <br /> A group of Yahoo whale exploiters catch a woman and enter her tail-in. The wife of the whale sees the whole woman entering the unborn child and turning it into the same moment at the same time. "Captain Nolan" (Richard Harris) could tell that he was really mad at the man, as he could say, "before leaving the estuary to town". <br /> <br /> This revenge story has the presence of Harris and Boen's beauty, but not much more. Bo's first released movie was released, but his first plays were four years earlier in 1981, 'And Once Upon a Love' 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek). <br /> <br /> P.S. Currently, the date of this review (November 20) is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Boek has a 'whale' good time ... ...... whale ... ... hee-hee.
