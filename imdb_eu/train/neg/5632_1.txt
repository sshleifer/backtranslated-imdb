I saw the DVD (BLACK WIDOW, USA) and then I felt the movie was really awesome. But in the original movie I had to cut it a bit or I lost a lot. There were very few sex scenes and little nudity (although not a breast), but I have read many other reviews on IMDb.com, referring to something of a hamburger and a tampon. I did not see something like this, it was just a bad and boring movie with unfamiliar characters and a rough and sophomorous plot. Giada Colagrande is up or down in the mouth, and from Botoxed gums, and a touch touches her face. And his name makes me think of the super-sized drink of Taco Bell: "I have Cola Grande!" It was really fun to be so bad, as I did in Mystery Science Theater 3000, but Dafoe's face was too big. It's really like a mirror!
