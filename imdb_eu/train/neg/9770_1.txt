This is also the hated version of the author. They gave him a "happy ending" and they changed a lot of conversations and it was just a huge sack of pile. "Scene Manager" is pretty good, I think this role has been created, but the rest have made it into that style of the 40's that really is happening. The most beautiful feature: music. It's one of the best recorded scores ever, and it's worth looking into a recorder. In general, the 1989 Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller version is over 1989.
