Writing, directing and choosing my own film, I chose something about robot women with weapons. Anthony Hopkins, on the other hand, decided to have the most curious film ever seen. "Slipstream" is a rare movie, although David Lynche looks at the person next to him and says "What's up". <br /> <br /> This is a movie, in a single scene, a man crosses the road, which looks to the right and turns the pink car to the left, a pink car. The character of the two characters is an interview, scattering random people and insecting on the walls. It is a movie where a man begins to talk about the "Invasion of the Bodysnatchers", to reveal himself to himself (and then disappear in the air). <br /> <br /> This is a movie that determines the need for a conspicuous plot in the window and uses fifteen different modifications for that purpose, even changing black and white for no reason. In any case. <br /> <br /> However, I would recommend Mr. Hopkins to the selected actors in this movie (some of which are depicted by multiple characters). All those involved take up their duties, although they are unfamiliar with what they are doing. My favorite Christian Slater's hat was a horrible threat, stunned by nonsense and singing the American anthem. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins says that he made this movie as a joke and is probably the best way to summarize "Slipstream". It's a joke about the public. You will see from the beginning to the end, knowing what is going on and understanding what is going to happen, knowing what the answer really does not really do. The penalty for this joke, only Anthony Hopkins meets. <br /> <br /> I mentioned David Lynch earlier and I'm a fan of that particular director. Anthony Hopkins shares my love with "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Lost Highway". However, "Slipstream" was not as satisfying as Lynch could imitate any technological film (though "Slipstream" was not surprised to speak at all). It's much chaotic and random. Another reviewer mentioned here is the Alzheimer's disease. There is no doubt that there is a small number that is capable of watching and getting out of it. Unfortunately, all of us, "Slipstream", soon becomes an annoying and confusing experience as a result of Hopkins's participation.
