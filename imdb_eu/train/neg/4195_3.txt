Given the implication of the people, it is difficult to know why this film should be bent and dull. Writing by David Ward, two years later, the amazing film Capture The Sting, won the Jane Fonda Klute Academy Award and Donald Sutherland did a great job with "Klute," "Start Without Revolution, I" and "Kelly's Heroes." Plotwise, the movie is a Caper story, planning a bad misfits for a Bumbling small group heist. At the same time, he wants to be a satirical movie, which would take place two years later on Saturday night television NBC television. The bad result is that the plot destroys any suspense that comedy bits may cause misunderstanding and impatience and may contain suspicions of comedy disconnected. Literally, it is a movie that continues to hit itself, putting cars of cars from demolition scenes together. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda was really interesting to me. His "Iris Caine" Bree Daniels wants to be a light version of "dramatic" "Klute", his "prostitute". Not yet believed for a moment. We are always watching Jane Fonda pretending to be a prostitute. The performance is horrible, the performance of "Klute" was wonderful. This good lesson would be to direct the good teachers together with both films to show that the same actor in the same role is great or pathetic. It suggests that the actors are as good as their writers and directors.
