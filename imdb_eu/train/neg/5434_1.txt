Wow What is a great adaptation of a beautiful novel? Here are a few. - Deleted two main characters from the scriptwriter's book. - The land has been grotesque. - Voice directly from the passages directly written (that is, they may be readable, but they are not the same ones, with a Chabon handwriting). - Wooden wood is more like a wooden booth. (Esp. Bechstein) - Will this be set in 1983 ??? I feel more in 2003 ... <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see this movie, so it's possible to recover it yourself ... (sarkasmoa). I really hope that nobody pays to see this or at least anyone who reads the book is expecting something to be worthy of (a la Wonder Boys). I like Chabon writer, but this adaptation should be ASHAMED. <br /> <br /> No stars.
