Zombies riot is not recovering. I feel bad that people are not bad and in 1936 I think they should be more puzzled. I suspect this is not true: IQ has not increased significantly in the last 7 decades. The average audience in 1936 is probably bored by the current viewer. Why? Try watching the first scenes and counting the remaining steps between things that happen, with a huge selection that you want to trim quickly, and it seems that you have to edit slapdash for a further two seconds each time you shoot. Pay attention to the redundant interview: "I will make tea / away / read my book". "You are?" "I am both." This type of exchange occurs several times. I would normally like this, who liked the bad movie, but I saw the bad lines that drew their rough and boring lines, and the desire to make the movie disappear. This sort of unpleasant timeout is far worse than the worse and more suggestive than those of the nine-part of the Plan or the Martians who conquer Santa Claus. Those who say that it is "better" than the most interesting movies have a fun idea behind them. This movie is not bad in the sense that your jaws are open: it's bad for your eyes to get bored gradually. That's a bit worse.
