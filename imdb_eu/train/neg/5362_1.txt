A woman with a hairdo, who dyed her hair in the middle of the film (= wigs), does not think she can see the audience a thousand miles away: <br /> <br /> *** start spoiler alert * ** her daughter with her best friend They have a relationship with each other and both try to avoid them. *** spoiler alert at the end *** <br /> <br /> And what was the spoiler: the title already appears, right? Bad operation, bad script: loss of time Oh yeah: at last, since he happily lives ... <br /> <br /> If you liked this movie, he really loves "Agaveta's CÃ¡nibale women. Death of Jungle."
