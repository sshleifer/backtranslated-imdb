Ivan Reitman is a savior. The tired farms (Ghostbusters, Evolution) turn their hands on. Although occasionally shows his flop (Six Days, Seven Nights) signs that show humor and humor. That's why I was disappointed. Reitman could not take a pretty original plot (the man is superhero drilling, the superhero superpower gets a powerful revenge) and that's a nice thing. "Girlfriend" is a pointless exercise. It's longer than the first 20 minutes on your plot. The film can not decide whether a romantic comedy or a superhero drama. The result is two flip-flops of the movie, it's not really well done. Uma Thurman is commonplace, and Luke Wilson has also thrown out her role, although her most flirty outfits are tired. It's more madness in some scenes (for example, when Uma bumps a headband through the wall) when you start shouting when Reitman opens an amazing and fluffy opus. But a few seconds later, magic is lost, as soon as the superhero almost deviates almost in all films.
