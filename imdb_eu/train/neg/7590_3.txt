Beautiful bodies, beautiful colors and camera work, pretentious conversation, a mere plot. The name of the first woman in Camilla, and the often-appearing flowers, are enough in Dumas's La Dame aux Camelias, with Camille, Garbo and (I think) the similarities of Robert Taylor. but not least La Traviata opera Verdi. Beautiful young women, not very virtuous, motivated, or other social, emotional, loved, divided, to kill the last scene that kills tuberculosis at the time ... A pardon that prohibits a opera and puts realistic dialogues on an opera. Why spoil Hayak, Don Sutherland, a beautiful screening in the LA in the 30s, nothing ex-machina an earthquake to kill another woman appropriately, and all this beauty in this mediocre machine, though there's no beautiful song?
