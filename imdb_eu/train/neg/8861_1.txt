A horrible horror movie called "The Howling". This is the funeral of Karen White (he died at the end of the first film). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee unfortunately) has arrived and Karen's brother Ben (Reb Brown) tells him that Karen was a dog. He will go to Transylvania to kill his wife, Striba (Sybil Danning). Ben and Karens' colleague (Annie McEnroe) meet. <br /> <br /> An immense script, a bad direction, an inbuilt edition, and a great author of Brown and McEnroe. Men's wolf effects are mostly hidden in the dark - for good reasons! When you see it, it's horrible. Check out special effects - even though it's similar to lightning from Danning's fingers. In addition, the orgies of the whirling men are also very stupid and Danning has eliminated his championship at least EIGHT TIMES closing credits! <br /> <br /> There are some good things - I found the Transylvania village so funny - it seems like a horror movie from the 1930s! There are interesting camera scams in the transitional scene; Brown and McEnroe have good bodies and Lee and Danning are good, but they can not keep them. Really: Why did they do that? Where do they earn money ??? This is one of the lowest values ​​in the IMDb movies. That alone will tell you something. Probably, when Danning was horrified when he saw the movie - I understand why! Can not forget.
