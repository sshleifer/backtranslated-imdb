This movie starts off with great promise, with Frank Morgan's first scene with Anita Louise against Gary Cooper's marriage. Frank Morgan, a gold medalist, complained loudly about the plague of Cooper's family in his family, including daughter Anita Louise. I'm a fan of 3 actors. Frank Morgan is (in my opinion) a Hollywood treasure, a legend of Cooper, and Luisa is a very beautiful, versatile, and highly valued actor, rarely protagonist. Teresa Wright does not have anything, and although she does not offer her a great offer, she usually offers warm-hearted performances. <br /> <br /> From stories of hope, the story goes down. There was no point in finding humor about Cooper's laws at home. The non-smoking home warder would never barely work, Cooper would allow him to burn or otherwise he would definitely provide his cigar for his crap. Moreover, no one in any sense is left letting the cigarette be held up without asking for some ways of using it. And finally, in the mind of anybody, nobody cuts a cigar in a cloth and puts it in his pocket! All sequences seem like Cooper's fool and gauche. It's unparalleled poverty, conceived and shot in a way that does not cause naivety or laughter. <br /> <br /> Cooper's medical examination is similar. Nobody leaves the medical examination completely for its purpose or if he has not given his consent! Cooper has done so to get rid of reality, to be fun - it's absurd! Robbery babysitting is a serious offense, which is not a laugh. In the end, the life-threatening and weight-sensitive child of Cooper's very dangerous and neurotic can cause nervous nerve for a few babies with anxious babies. But it seems to me boring and slow. The wardrobes and the goddesses placed themselves in these scenes; paradoxically, the writer slept. <br /> <br /> The lines are not in the script for creating humor. They fail in all cylinders. Laughter comes a minute or so, but a minute's clearer for the year. The only time that the movie was with energy or humor is when Frank Morgan has a camera. <br /> <br /> Totally wasted scene occurs when Cooper's love interests and their parents meet at the same hotel. together room Perhaps the rich wealth of humor is somewhere in that mine, but none of them goes away. <br /> <br /> In the end, two girls are very fond of it. Predicted, the character of Anita Louise is considered to be jilted by her wedding tonight! Even if the camera is not there, that's the attitude of his fate, and it's not particularly fun, even though it's a loose end. In this film I did not do anything wrong (such as Gail Patrick, unlike My Favorite Wife). As a result, I expected (maybe "I hope" is a better word in the context of the film!) Even though Anita Louise has a happy ending. At the end of the film, this pleasing nature was basically eliminated, and Cooper and Wright's "happy ending" weakened. <br /> <br /> I expected something to happen, for the spirit of conversation. From film films of that era ... And he never gave up. Frank Morgan's good performance is losing a little bit of paper.
