I did not know much about this movie before, but I heard that I was interested in quantum physics. I did not know, that is, it is not the story in an active way, but rather a new age, those who love the sound of their voice, who know little about quantum basic mechanics. I say I'm getting into the category of documentary rather than comedy or drama. <br /> <br /> Marlee Matlin is a New Age movie about a story. The parts of the movie feel very lined up and they do not intend to display the thoughts of the speakers. Matlin is a real work as a photographer, unlike the New Age Hippie that generates on the couch. We hear people unnamed about what quantum physics is. The brightest part of this movie was an Indian speaker (I suppose), but I think he was showing a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that Barbara Eden really leaves him and continues and quantum science is related to something related to something related to New Age's New Age beliefs. It seems that the Quark DS9 had a low cash and a short look at the movie. We are surprised by the surprising CGI that many are; body cells jello molds are dancing, because filmmakers have seen Flubber magazine apparently. <br /> <br /> The people of the film say that the Arawans of San Salvador said that people were invisible to the Colon ship Pinta. The natives were not seen before, as if it were a way of knowing people today. Of course, all this information is excluded and they say "Colon ships are invisible to the Indians of the Americas". The movie is full of jumps. Thomas Young performed a duplication experiment around 1805, and the light may temporarily appear particle and a part of time. Of course, you should never know about this stupid cycle, whose only reference is "because atoms can be particles and waves." And that means people can cross the walls, water them and never grow old when they want a star! After all, I'm sure Marlee Matlin could have stopped his hat if it had been tough enough. I'm sarcastic, but this film is full of false expectations and beliefs that people who do not keep up with it. <br /> <br /> These are the New Age kooks, which have been introduced into quantum theory. He confirms everything he believes about meditation, zero-energy, crystalline healing, etc. These snake-sellers truly believed they had been rough enough to sell them, could not they have preferred their checks instead of appearing in this joke? We will hear another, unnamed man, with credentials that we do not know, to find out how to create life in front of a fireplace (or television screen). Every time someone was on the screen, I wanted to put someone in and put a cake on my face. These people take the WAY WAY seriously. As a tranquil man from another guy says, no one ever touches anything because of the magnetic force that prevents quantum levels. If someone goes on the screen and stays on the stomach, "I do not touch! I do not touch!" According to a moral relativism in the film, there is no "bad or bad" really. So, do you agree that Hitler has spent millions of Jews? Another person says "there is no love". It's just a chemist and people we really do not love, we're just facing chemical friendship. I suspect this guy is doing this film community as a heroic addiction for so many years. <br /> <br /> We are witnessing a truly pathetic sequence that takes two young ages at the wedding reception. RoboCop. Women evaluate if they have cows, dogs or foxes, and sexual attitudes appear on the table. Marlee Matline takes a picture of her wedding and, after the next day, she loves herself and decides to make a bath because it has a beautiful and unique snowflake. <br /> <br /> The film is often shown by people when I like pre-thought ideas. I can only see what I want to see in this review, but I wanted to see that people are facing their faces, and it never happened. <br /> <br /> If you have never heard any of the ideas presented before you are of interest, but here are some of the best sources for all ideas. If you want to see a good movie that speaks of the uncertainty of Heisenberg, see the man who was not the man. If you want to read a good book about Quantum Field Theory, read Hyperpace Michio Kaku. If you want to see the movie that talks about different philosophies with imaginary images, see Waking Life (although it is sometimes boring, self-relevant and pretentious). In short, you should read Robert Anton Wilson with Quantum Psychology or Prometheus Rising if you do not want to miss out on this movie. <br /> <br /> Normally it is very difficult for the film to score from 1 to 10. but this has been very easy for me: 1/10 stars. <br /> <br /> The movie title is true. People in this movie do not know # $ *! Hands down, the worst film ever I've ever seen.
