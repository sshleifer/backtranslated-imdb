With a raffle and amazing crew, this could be a classic. Instead, it is a recurring, repetitive para-frash all-time conspiracy theory of JFK assassination in 1979, which Kegan introduced in 1960 in a fictional plot of assassination of the president's fictions. Just given enough - such as Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, or when they leave their minds, they're asking John Huston. Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins all agree, in a very different way, anyway. <br /> <br /> The picture is beautiful, but it does not justify just one hour or half of your life or justify the price. purchase DVD
