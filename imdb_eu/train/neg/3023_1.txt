It's strange I'll find this movie incredibly annoying and hard. Without a doubt, it is one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Plots, confusing and absurd lines are not blurring on bright edits. Why did Domino become such a hard bitch? When his golden fish died when he was a baby and he was moved by a "traumatic" event, he hated all of us. When the conversation is not in a trace or empty, it is full of dreadful lines, such as: "There are three types of people in the world: rich ... poor ... and all others." Sometimes a reward huntsman has a combination of tattoos on his arm that is tied to the back of the bus. Because they are a mobile phone mix, instead of sleeve and number reading, they throw their arms with a shotgun blow. At another point, Bounty Hunters brings bombs organized by the mafia and threatens to bombard them unless they let the mafia go! Clearly not going to the meeting would be very easy. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley is not convincing and incredibly confusing. Mickey Rourke regains credibility from this mix. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance, but I thought he was supposed to be suffering this rumor. absolutely idiot
