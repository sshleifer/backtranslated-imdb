(Some potential deceit) <br /> <br /> I do not know for sure what Dreamworks thought when they decided to drop it by $ 80 million. Mostly, spectacular animations would be more than enough to see audiences (especially families) go to the curious. It seemed to work at the beginning of the weekend, amounting to approximately $ 26 million, and it was $ 38.1 million. Total (estimate this weekend). But when I came across the weekend I saw that the viewers were quite the same, and when I saw the word they opened it. This is a great movie movie, aside from other animations, most of which is a script for three years. <br /> <br /> The film is about 80 minutes. It's long but it's three-hour. For me, I've got some points, it's one of those irritating narratives and, of course, it's written. At some point, he escapes from fugitives and, although he is afraid of a horse, he explains the narrator (Matt Damon's voice of talent), the wrong ideas (this would be the simplest thought that would only happen). br /> <br /> Another is Bryan Adams's constant song. Now, I'm a fan of his music, I think it's good, but come true that Dreamworks really thinks they'll be managed by audiences 8 and 9. Throughout his short film, I definitely could not. In the end, here is a spoiler, a horse fights in a single area, unless, at least, he (horse) falls into a rock. Spirit (the focus of the film) tries to try to save him, but they have to overtake a waterfall of at least 50 feet, at the end of the film, we see that this horse is alive. I know it's a children's movie, but this little realism is also unacceptable. <br /> <br /> In short, this is really a lame mo. Come on, I do not say that children will not enjoy it, but everyone else will check their watches. Certainly, my Top 10 year list of this year. - ** from 4 stars. <br /> <br />
