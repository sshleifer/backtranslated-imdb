Bulldog Drummond, a weaker entry in the series, in the role of John Howard. The usual funny banter and antics, but not much of the plot. Barrymore does something like a supervisor, and he trades costumes to track Drummond, Algy and Tenny Goose (especially in regular circles, perhaps lower than normal) to save Phyllis poor. Drummond wants to take him to lie. For these scores, Drummond wants to think about Phyllis and Algy is worried about missing the baby's baptism. It's very funny wearing Algy and Tenny dressed as a fisherman, in The Angler's Rest, but slightly rising from the stupid one.
