Lord, what a movie! Let's talk about the first "special effects". I am not bad here, I am not one of those fanatic effects but I really thought that overlapping was a past practice of the past, especially the 60s. So, I thought for some time that this movie could have been recorded for a long time, and they had to be cut and released forever. But I know that as long as the mobile phones were not in the 60's ... <br /> <br /> When they're looking for movies, it's a good story with a very good message. The rhythm is secondary, the consequences are secondary, I do not give any contradiction. However, in films like bad play, credibility, etc. Add a terrifying movie even worse - what happened to me with the Celestine Prophecy. <br /> <br /> My wife said that the book was really good and, although I do not have access to this spiritual thing, although they can lead to a certain degree of compelling - the movie has failed. <br /> <br /> It could be the only reason to see it. this, though. If you love movies that you want to animate, it's good for you. IMDb stars instead of quality for quality. This movie should be rated ten stars. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are three stars that are worse for these films, like "Critical Mass." (check out comments about this - hilarious). The prophecy of Celestine, partly, is at least entertained.
