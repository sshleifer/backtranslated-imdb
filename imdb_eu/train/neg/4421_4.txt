The thing is compelling: a group of people love their gambling to take a step further in full of wicked medieval lords, kings, princes, and castles. Wargaming is an interesting phenomenon that seeks to deepen our collective need, something that is immersed in reality and, sometimes, in the universality of our being - something that can all be linked. The characters of the Lord of the Rings nerds and Star Trek fans can be mixed. It's enough to see most people. However, he quickly transforms the film into Insider's vision with wargaming, he hardly stereotypts the nose in the "nonsense" viewer. The filmmakers seem to put the wargaming issue, and especially this is seriously serious, having more than one humor and fun taking into account the adults being immersed in a medieval gear and introducing each other. Everyone who sits 7 or 10 hours in the computer is playing for anyone who is not playing or looking for a new destructive star to understand what they are doing and why we should take care of it. However, it seems that filmmakers prefer to focus only on the theme of the game, which builds a strong narrative with a clear story that everyone understands. Also, the characters are not credible and you get bored soon: 90 minutes when trying to keep people busy.
