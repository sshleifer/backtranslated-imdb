Seen on the 14th season of Graduates ("On the Wings of Love"), I knew it was an interesting time. I have seen some of the previous season's cycles; They see one or two sections, and the next three or so are missing. The degree is often attractive and interesting, although its quality and morale are often lacking. , Texas, to find true love, true love, like long-term reality-drama dating show. Jake finds 25 beautiful girls all over the country. It begins to know a little, but it's mostly superficial; In five-minute conversations will you know someone? Jake tries to get to know his true intentions at the outset, at least to the audience. She says she wants love or a good time, but she wants a boyfriend or a fianc√©. We can only conclude that in the competition women it has made this clear. In that case, it would appear that some women's activities in any case would appear. Women are super competitive. They still do not know Jake still, they still have the cost of winning there. <br /> <br /> Except women were competitive, they were confident and caring. "Beware!" -Rein threats, backups and reminders. All show that these women did not have fun. Jake stated that it was not only a sexual appeal, but rather a "connection". However, girls dropped all stops trying to impress Jake's sexual appeal. Were you coming home in a skimpy dress? small or short. <br /> <br /> While some girls maintained a sense of decline, others lost this note altogether. A girl named Channy told Jake that "good" was "a naughty girl." Then he said that "his track could be taken out at any time." He has gone to other girls because of the provocative expression that they face before them. <br /> <br /> So, a reality dating show could not be bad, right? Apart from the eye-catching eye-catching look, other appearances are also seemingly dangerous. Is it a good way to find a friend of the future? to pay attention to someone, because of the extreme proportions? Unfortunately, however, that's why America has reduced these days: pleasures and sex with no commitment and a bit of happiness. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the premature emotional attachment of girls to a lot. Jake themselves. In fact, some girls seemed to be fully attached. A girl said: "If I do not get the first impression, it will kill me!" As we have just said, they still do not know about it, and they talked about a specific rose, not only to get rid of one of the 15 roses. Delayed. Some Jake attachments. The other girls also noticed. After a certain appearance of Michelle, Viena said that Michelle "had headaches and we were here for an hour." Did Michelle get the last pink afternoon at the first show? lack of extinction? And it was very emotional about it. The other girls thought it was ridiculous. He also shouted another girl, but because she was removed, <br /> <br /> <br /> Did he survive and that's where he just started? reality tv It shows our entertainment interests as countries; If we did not see the shows and give good ratings, the network would not continue. The only logical consequence that can be drawn is American affection. One thing is clear: who loves reality television in America (in general) and its subsequent covers. <br /> <br /> This asks me: why is TV like reality? What is it that draws us around? Do we see similarities in our lives, or are we sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others? In this regard, we must take care of the media and entertainment that gives us the consent to fulfill ourselves. I do not say that all television reality is bad; However, I must say that each one needs to be evaluated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Critics used periods: Season Premier and Episode 2.
