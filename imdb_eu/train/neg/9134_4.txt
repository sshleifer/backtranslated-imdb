I tried to like this program; I really did I also bought a pilot movie in the first VHS and later on the DVD. However, I could not get into this story, because its two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) loved one of them for one thing. I accept that there was a clear dialogue in the shows, because it was a key part of the successful television show, and I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> Essentially, theatrical films of the thirties, thirties and decades of the 40s were similar to men and women. You get arguments, accusations, screams and shouts. Many people seem to love that seemingly bickering, but I hate it, so I never get into the flag of the Moon's flag. <br /> <br /> Only Allyce Beasley was the "Agnes" assistant. It is very bad that the air had so little time. The shepherd was pleasing to the eyes, and I think women would say Willis, but, in spite of the overwhelming debate between them, it eventually shut me off.
