I just do not think the other reviewers of this "film" are in the production house, because they are the worst film I have ever seen in the last five years. The first film of a Rabbi who laughs without a love for the fish is unclear to see the "B-Level" to kill the actors of this movie. My wife and I were very pleased before we started this movie, and we started looking for a fun, funny movie. You know that Citizen Kane did not rent, and we did not expect to see the most amazing movie ever. However, after spending 40 minutes to experience the strangest garbage I have ever seen, we are waiting for a minute of our life to lose. <br /> <br /> If laughter has a "comedy", a great performance, thrilling and annoying characters are your things, then this movie is for you. Honestly, the Troll 2 is better - I laughed at least the popcorn sex scene. <br /> <br /> I just can not write a longer review about this photo because I am trying to find out for about an hour trying to find a joke. .
