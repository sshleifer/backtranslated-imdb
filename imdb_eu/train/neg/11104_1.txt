I'm not in the movie when I try to decide what to do when I try to make the worst movie. If you have any questions, check my other comments. However, for the first time I have ever seen such a great movie, even before I could write what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. For me, Ed Wood was a genius, I thought Bloody Murder, Jeepers Creepers and horrible horror movies were great. However, there is no good thing to say about this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is not basically. Someone who reads my review will waste money, let's know what the plot is about, but I recommend you watch more of a nickel than watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Bad effects of special effects. <br /> <br /> The operation is bad. <br /> <br /> Both leads are attractive, but all this is. <br /> <br /> I'm not a guy. Anyone can spoil a movie, but I should not email anyone to foxbarking@yahoo.com before losing a dump to ask about this movie. I will tell you anything. <br /> <br /> I love filmmaking, and I love horror and new movies I loved. In addition, I also love pornographic horror such as refuge (the reviewers were somehow saying, but, of course, Roger Bart was the next and thought they were refuge 2). But this may be the first non-movie and EVER fool and stupid one ever. <br /> <br /> And before leaving the review, this is not just someone who came to the death of the House. But he really bought a copy.
