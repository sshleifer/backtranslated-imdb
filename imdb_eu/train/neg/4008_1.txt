As Sookie Stackhouse is a fan of books, the series seems to me to be a completely secular representation. Vampire Bill is not very well looked and looks much older than the one described in the book. It seems that wonderful and colorful characters have made it seem very exciting and vulgar. One of the things I loved about books is that, although it's rough, Sookie is always a lady, and yet she does not look like TV shows. The prejudices that appear in the TV series are not included in the books. I did not expect a specific replica of books, but I expected at least a feeling of their use in series.
