Thanksgiving to God! I did not waste my money, but I downloaded it! This is the worst film I have ever seen throughout my life, visual effects, unpleasant gores and nudity! Far away like other remote movies, such as Night of the Living Dead and others. There are many loops and errors in the movie. It's good if you get the following time to read this comment, look at the profile of the director (Ulli Lommel). After seeing an explanation similar to this film, each film directed by Ulli Lommel earns a score of between 1 and 2. Finish all this saying a solid sentence. Even if you have fun or spend time, or even be in extreme state of spite, DO NOT USE THIS FESTIVAL.
