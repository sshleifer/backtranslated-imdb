This movie is "before and before" "cat and mouse" movies. (This may look like a spoiler, but describes a great movie class.) The main character is fervent, sensible, its goofy but well meaningful, intense initial attempts at comedic comments. But he soon loved this beautiful lady who avoids the "inevitable" love story, the loved ones who were kidnapped and, of course, the opponents against the wicked wilder servants. Everyone has already seen tons of those films, and "National Treasure" is like one of them, it has changed a bit. Every turn of the story was easily announced (and I can assure you that I'm not the main saver tool). I'm tired of losing money from a movie theater in Hollywood, and if you've felt that way, listen to my note; Stay miles away from this movie.
