What is the Hollywood Left Burst Load? This film glorifies courage and noble revelation for peaceful principles. The fairytale is endlessly pacifist, led by Danzel Washington, who is truly promoted by his betrayal. What is Hollywood with? Is McCarthism still? <br /> <br /> If I hear cynic, it's because I eat movies that are related to the political agenda. The brass military in this film are portrayed, what? Gung-ho war workers. Do you know? Have you ever watched CIA or non-government agencies movie? Think about it Once again, the Crimson Tide point highlights. Hackman's U-boat boat at the Ramss is like a bad character, until the end, of course, he does his full 360, he loses his blood loss and Ron Hunter proposes a betrayal. and it is repeated by retiring from the service. Does a man hide, he takes command of your ship, the United States puts them first and foremost, nuclear, and does it encourage you ???? What a hogwash!
