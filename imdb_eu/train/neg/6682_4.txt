This comedy is not really fun. The love that stereotypes affect so much does not have any effect. It's so much called a movie - yes, even then - it does not hold on. <br /> <br /> Cast is appropriate. Saying more than that is difficult. However, it is good that players do not know. In MGM, that is Robert Montgomery. The wife of a businessman with little time of work could have been a lot of actors. <br /> <br /> We can admit that this famous movie is being eaten by unknown interpreters today. And the value of production is not horrible. However, it does not make any impression. <br /> <br /> It's a generic color. And who wants it?
