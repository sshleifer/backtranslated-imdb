** SPOILERS ** Redacules slasher movie with no sense of a murderer wearing a black outfit and what it seems like wearing a rubber mask by Peter Lorre. In the first film, almost as told, the young Beth Morgan was obsolete, due to heavy drug use, her husband and wife died in Tennyson Collage a year ago. <br /> <br /> FBI agent Sacker (Jeff Conaway), also obsessed with catching the killer, also appeared to have killed Tennyson at the same time. "When do you want to know a secret" when you have finished the movie, have you never said that in Connecticute two years later these murders were related to a murder of Florida? The other one, the murderer, at least on the death of Beth's boyfriend, wore the same costume of Halloween. <br /> <br /> In the spring break of Sunshine State, six students spend a holiday in a beach house, and before they know each other, they start each other. Brad Clyton, Chad Allen, starting with a computer geek, is also spreading to the town with people who have no relationship with someone else, such as Jack McGee, the head of the Gavin police, who is openly fragmented. <br /> <br /> The killing of the murderers has last saved a curious ceremony in Beth's empty church, which resembles Florida Everglades. Then, at last, who reveals himself and what are the intentions, so much sense makes the film, none. Every movie tries to frighten what he hears and stirs up with slasher scenes that are not too convincing. Oz Washington, the most influential Tom Jay Jones victim, has survived at least three attempts at his life and is also the protagonist of the film with Sacker. <br /> <br /> Oz also had a bad cut, almost half cut off and a tooth punctured on the bottom was kidnapped, but later recovered, he did not commit to murder. In fact, he twice exiled himself with the murderer, and he was not as small as a walk! There was no reason why Oz and Beth were going on their own to kill the murderer and the murderer instead of the murderer of the police, instead of Oz's mobile phone? <br /> <br /> Hank Ford, Joseph Lawrence, loses Beth's husband and wife, but it is not too convincing for both girls on the beach. Being a victim of murderers, and then somehow disappearing! For a moment you do not know if they really killed or a part of Oz or a local police was a sort of hallucination. On the church until the last scene that appeared on the off-the-wall wall. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Tina and Hank, which is both drunk and resembling, is also the previous relationship. With Hank, though Beth does not even notice Hank and Tina. It seems that Beth felt his relationship with him even more when he felt the movie!
