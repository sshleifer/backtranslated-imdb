This must be the worst film of horror ever seen. Remember that I remember a few years ago when I watched and watched the videos, I thought I liked it for some strange reasons. So, like a fool, I was exhausted when the DVD was released ... what a tragic mistake! I will not go into the plot anyway, so that it is so transparent that you can see it directly. I'm a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis, so I'm cheesy gore effects and performance, but these people take a very different level. The worst movie as if trying to make a human being as much as possible ... If that were their purpose, they passed it. If they want to make an unexpectedly repressive or believable movie, in any way, form or shape is true, then they failed, but ... SCISSORY! Avoid this movie ... read the plot summary and see!
