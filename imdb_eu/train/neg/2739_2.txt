I do not know what's been filmed, but you can say that they do not have a definite budget. Poor performance, horrible filmography and some lame plot and some of its special effects do not create a good movie. WWF-style filmmaking will cry ... where's the tripod ?! The filmmakers were tall, but their brands were lost.
