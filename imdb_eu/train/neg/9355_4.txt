I have recently been able to come across movies by Marilyn Miller because they do not appear in UK TCM. Over the years, I like the one I like because it's one of the super-20's. . Some stars of this age some of Jolson's magic still shine, but it's not Miller. Her dances seem to be mixed and unreleased, her song is somewhat limited and it seems Ruby Keeler as Hepburn. It even seems. This movie, tired of music by the public, has almost all the music numbers erased. So, with the comedy of that era, we had a real appeal. He paid $ 500,000 for it! So I have only two consequences. Film was badly served or had no talent. I think the truth is closer than before.
