Wow you guys are nice nice !!! Corny, Corny, Corny I feel like that about that movie. He started off with a good idea, wearing a guy (Edward Asner) wearing a Santa Jail, he found out that the little boy had escaped him and that his true saint believed that the Fake Santa children had begged the children to find a stolen money bag. The movie "Whistle down the wind" is like a Christmas version. The movie starts well, but gradually becomes Cheesier and Cheesier, which eventually becomes ridiculous and does not take this movie seriously. For example, you get a character from Scrooge, Sumner (Rene Auberjonois), Douchebag, who treats his young son like a pile, treats his son so badly, even though he does not buy anything, he wears a poor child. Jeans with hole in it! But Fake Santa visits 45 second scenes with Sumner and at the end of the film, all the angels are happy to make Christmas Carol singing and embracing his forgotten son ... that's how Corny is ... I'm all in Christmas especially to feel a good movie And I'm a seasonal hobby of the TV series, but this one is very good for me, it's a shame because it started well but in the second half I'm excluding a supernatural movie that does not match the rest of the movie. It's not quite bad, there are some strong actors, especially for children, but Christmas is a better film.
