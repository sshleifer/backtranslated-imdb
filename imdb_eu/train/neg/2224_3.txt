For the first time I saw at 7 years old. I remember that I thought it was a faint explanation of what happened. I remember everything that was fifteen years later, with great precision, that writers never gave a story outline. There is no plot for this movie or cartoon. There is no character development, no background story, no arc arches, nothing. These guys do good things, because bad things are only bad. A murderous person who thinks it's a bit annoyed, and that no one cares about it. They just shrug their shoulders and continue on. There is hardly any conversation. If you cut the wrestling scene and the running of the bulls, you lose 70% of the movie. <br /> <br /> See this for good animations and for some other reason. Or if you like to see the cartoon worn outdoors (or the bad vibes of cartoons).
