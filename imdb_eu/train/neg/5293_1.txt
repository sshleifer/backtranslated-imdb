I received this video after reading the text box, because it was a good story by Keanu Reeves! After 5 minutes, I noticed that the incredible star was walking in his role and talking stupid all the time, it is false and not convincing. It does not end there, almost all the characters play so badly, but Alan Boyce plays well (David); But the guy starts suicide at first and you do not see it again, why you do not know why he's done it! Everything about this movie cries down low quality, I can not believe how that sort of thing is! I was often tempted to stop seeing it; Indeed, I decided to stop watching it in the middle of it, and turning it off, I reached IMDB to see what he thought about others. No comments found (do not be surprised). So I decided to force myself to handle pain, and then come back to comment. Good things (for me) were the top subject of the Rock band, the occasional guitar playing and singing, but that's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Acting and correcting a very bad ... Terrible movie.
