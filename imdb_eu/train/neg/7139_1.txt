Redline is the fall of Fast & Furious, without any abuse. There is no need to have a rugged plot of land and a lot of surprises, but that's the need! This is equivalent to a pornographic film, where the story and the interview are about 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end. This is worse because you do not get your money worth it. Awesome awareness rage, impossible sequences and awesome car expensive waste, almost negatively affecting the appearance of this movie. Of course, it's hot, but who is that disappointed on a female screen? The director was sitting there, with a hat full of interviews and plots, and shook 8 boxes each time they changed the scene. He is not a serious person who plays in the race and does not know anything about this movie and enjoy the race scenes.
