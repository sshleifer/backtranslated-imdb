Not as bad as you did not hear. There are some fun parts, and Affleck and Applegate have a pretty good chemistry. Applegat, in particular, is as attractive and enjoyable as Affleck's love's interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are full of professionals. It's enough in every thing. In the end, "Survive" will never see the worst holiday. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is undoing and it forces a lot of comedy. They try to make dark smiles. Affleck tries hard to be spatially and overwhelmed, but gets upset. The character generates a great deal of cartoonism by Gandolfini and O'Hara, with loyal and unbelievable views. With relaxed holiday-based movies, you never really bought Affleck's "rent" family for X-mas. <br /> <br /> There is also a surprising surrealist scene. The scene of Xabarren is full of horrible moods (a child who is looking at nude and provocative mother images) is not fun or compelling, but disturbing. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the colors in this film are thick, almost black. The house with the biggest film looks strange and cheap. <br /> <br /> "Surviving" is especially interesting at the box office (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl and fourth) and this one for Affleck. The duration of the damage is to be seen.
