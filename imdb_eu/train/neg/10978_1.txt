Usually, when a movie is voted out, someone does not like it, and is angry because it does not have a lower score, so it can drag as much as possible to the low score. This is not here. <br /> <br /> Bonesetter 0/10 is an excellent example of a movie. It does not direct anything and has no choice, because it does not try to do anything. There are lines of a type called D & D, which does not take any inconvenience and does not lack any practice. It is clear that anyone involved in this project does not make any serious effort, because it would be a hard work amongst those who are not particularly prominent. A really horrible movie.
