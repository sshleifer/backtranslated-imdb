Comedy movie has its wonderful soundtrack on the back cover, but you do not know your first movie. I rented this movie to help my friends get rid of laughs, but in general, when we laughed at each other from our laughter to each other. We could not choose a worse movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps some changes have been made to the movies. First of all, the comedy was painful. Physical gag were poorly executed. The young children of the film wanted us to kill ourselves, trying to bless the scene and scene, but it was like a puppy that was in love with. Anything that came from the movie could be as sustainable. There were some fun jokes, I think that a boy was stealing one of the movie porn movies that he was a group of boys and gay filming. But to summarize the comedy, I'll tell the children's open gag. She wears a Puke shirt and talks about knowing something. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film's editor could save the movie by removing the child fat, which cut off for 20 minutes. Make an end to the school scene and more than thirty seconds. <br /> <br /> OH, BTW, there are two good elements in the movie. Kadeem Hardison plays a wonderful role and makes her jokes, because nobody appreciated or missed. Another milestone in the movie Ali Landry is beautiful. His most shaky movie character is ignored. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time leasing anything. I did not like it and I was a member of the recipients (18 men).
