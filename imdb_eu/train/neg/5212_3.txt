I met this movie for a while in the Mill Creek collection, and I decided to watch it one night; I do not expect much. When I was surprised by the credit of the area, this film was shocked when I was under the company Filmirage. Filmirag brought the world of amazing "Troll 2", "Ator the Invincible" and "Quest for the Mighty Sword", so I had to see it. <br /> <br /> It started from the beginning of the movie. The potential to be quite decent, even though it is common. Gore scenes could be improved if they were widespread and more frequent. But after a bit of a movie, the rhythm began to drag and "I'm thinking of someone better to die soon" or "Someone's better to mutate." When this risk started, considering these thoughts, if someone had died or mutated, nevertheless, gore and effects were not very good. As things were worse, the scene transitions were confusing. For example: the first houseman doctor would be at the Zoo, then he would have to kill him, eventually he would wake up in a cold sweat - the audience asked "he was dreaming about the zoo?". Like the movie's timing, these scenic transitions have deteriorated. <br /> <br /> Dr. Houseman could say that it was pretty good, but at the end of the film, that is, once ... I've seen what the doctor is about to do, luckily, you'll laugh - really, this is a movie at least once it's the only reason; This movie is like a joke unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> Houseman's doctor's costumes can also be seen in Joe D 'Amator's "Powerful Sword Quest". the same year. Films from Filmirage love you, always using the same things again!
