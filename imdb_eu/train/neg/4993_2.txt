To see this movie 'anything really many' was a flick of action, still very disappointed. Inauguration scene ordered a little action with a little comedy. The first half coz connects you with until then you expect to kick off that action. Well, nothing like that happens. It drags the movie and you can get angry at the end, which he thought the director. It does not make any sense. The movie was not in every aspect, it was not a real story, and it seemed to him quite insignificant, despite being "Rambo", I do not think any grade can help. There is no logic for the movies. Wasting time and money. At that time I've ever seen the biggest attack I've ever seen and I'm sure others will get the same look at others. Certainly, it does not have people with a little sense in the film in that sense.
