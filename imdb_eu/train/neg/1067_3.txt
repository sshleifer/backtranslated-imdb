Only a few segments are taking place here. It becomes a segment of a garage assistant in Nigeria. Together with Fanny Ardent and Bob Hoskins, it becomes twisted until the latest movie overcomes things. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that some of the musicians only call Paris. The others are so scattered throughout the subject, tone, desire and production as "The Years Best Commercials, 2006". It's really a whole place. It does not develop over time, and there is no director directing anything. The building can not join the pieces ... sets the tedium. One hour, I'm twenty minutes away and Elijah Wood is in a mute one. Commercial, produced vampire shtick. It must be as much as Parisian anthracite knitting clothes with Paris. The fantasy shows, first of all, I think of the Coen Brothers segment (Uh, thank you J & E because it ruined the other movie) and then it makes too many appearances. The point of being in Paris is not something you need to make a fool to make your days special. Why distribute district districts Madeleine with some paralyzed paralyzes with vampires? One by one shows more genres than the vampire movie. We get the same topical vampires every three years. <br /> <br /> The things that are worse are different from the segment to the segment. Transitions are lost. This is not a deliberate sense, it feels unhappy.
