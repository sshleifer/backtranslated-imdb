The film was "OK". It's not bad, not good, well. If there is something else in the theater, that would be far away. Unfortunately, Fast and Furious 2 also shifts, but I prefer to see it as FF2. :) If you have an fetish for harrison ford or other punk, it will be a movie for you. Personally, I would wait for HBO or Blockbuster.
