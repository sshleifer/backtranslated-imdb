The DVD version has 2 episodes, being the parricidae padlock of Caesar. In addition, Spanish was subtitled. Therefore, it is difficult for me to thoroughly review the movie because I do not understand what I have said. <br /> <br /> Being a historical icon of Cleopatra, the part is very difficult and I found this to come up with a new one. Leonor Varela plays well. He has a great will, but his twin soul is also very strong and tender. Thimothy Dalton is as good as Caesar and is the main thing in their first episode of love. So it's not a documentary, not a peplum, but a great love story. <br /> <br /> After the parricide, a new lover has arrived (Marc-Antoine) but the flavor is gone: we always remember that our first loved one. So I found the second episode dull and their tragic fate did not give much power. <br /> <br /> However, production is luxurious: groups are large, adorned decorations; Moroccan exotic lifestyle and excellent cabinets. Producers are sure to have a lot of money, but they do not have any expense for special effects. They are so bad (blue screens, boats, Sphinx) that are fun. <br /> <br /> In the end, I would listen very much to give you a final opinion on these two films in French or English.
