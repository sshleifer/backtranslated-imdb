I do not know how this movie would like Van Damne. <br /> <br /> The movie really starts to promise. I would say that the initial action of the film is excellent. The action scene that tries to keep the family pair is an excellent start and it is taken to the main story. However, the movie is down there. <br /> <br /> It would be wonderful to spot the director's original premise. That is, brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different abilities. There is a brother in the field of martian arts, but another brother's firearm is skillful. When a good time is created, he suddenly thinks he is a big brother who has not picked up a gun, and his brother who does not teach martial arts suddenly split up and shots. <br /> Land, actions, etc. It's strange. My favorite scenes? What's wrong with a soldier armed with Van Damne AK-47? The soldier is about 100 meters. Instead of filming and shooting with Van Damner, he is making war crying, just like a battlefield, and running. Van Damne begins to drop a gun against a fallen soldier and shot himself ... he still has a speed of 75 to 80 meters. <br /> <br /> This movie is like the ending. Bolo Yeung is a skillful martial artist. However, instead of the decent battle choreography. Bolo casts Van Damn's paintings like Donkey Kong. A very promising movie. If you have a Van Damne fan, save time and watch Hard Target or one of his first films.
