The movie is badly made except for the well-known ancient Hollywood names. Other screenings called strangers (that is, Jennifer Gabrielle) are not boring. I have seen some of the other films of this director, unfortunately, this is his worst thing. Maybe this is the reflection of the script? <br /> <br /> In a positive note, Kim Bassinger and Pat Morita's performance have forgotten the movie. I liked Karate Kid, however. There are many good films to watch and, in the end, this is not one of them. Save your money and celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
