Serum is a healing cure for all diseases, through the power of the mind. Instead, it creates a kind of monster that needs human flesh and fat to eat. A mad doctor creates some zombies from cadavesa and has some problems. Throughout the action, the protagonist is more than knowing the characters. The nurse of the doctor's madman goes into a car accident and crazy doctor tries to use his new serum to use the boy. The results are not good. This is a C class movie, well-executed, but it's about correcting problems and tracking some bugs. There is no zombie in this action and the effects, though they are appropriate, are not special. You can progress through slower sections and enjoy scenes of action. Beware of naughty and bad language.
