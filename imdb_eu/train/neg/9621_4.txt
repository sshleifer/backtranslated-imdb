I wanted to see this when I was killed, I saw a ridiculous image of MEATBALLS to be the best satire ever. What a great idea is for a satire - the genre is abundant. Unfortunately, the finished product (I think what everyone thinks is what they think) is a catalog of missed options, non-fair performances and (fortunately!) Some very hilarious, inspired bits. Janeane Garafolo, very striking, seems to be very bad here, because he's struggling to make his awkward task fun. David Hyde Pierce is sad to see it fun to be like a Castro nerd. Molly Shannon is so funny that, when he's alone, he laughed at you, but somehow his segment blocks the snowball in something hysterical. Paul Rudd had great origins and was very sexy, the other boys were also very entertaining (nerd). I think the problem is that the director does not take the right things. It starts very light and sets the monotonous one. But when things are really annoying (this is the second most amazing moment in the sequence of drugs that I have had during the whole year, the first one will be included in a movie: what is about Andrea & Martin GUY's film IN & OUT) is very funny. The movie wanted me to work so badly, but he did not do that. 1981 clothes and aesthetics are 99.9% PERFECT and some of the songs used are also perfect. This MAD TV is a bad session, with more than frustrating sketches.
