There are many good things about the BSG: there are several Cylon models of the 8th and 6th models, for example, who have played two great actors. Galactica is an old industrial design school ("My ship will not be on the net, from my body!"). Also, space battles, special effects (although science fiction instructors acknowledge cartoons). everything) Darkness of the characters, essentially a defective nature. <br /> <br /> This is even more painful because the end was so baby. <br /> <br /> Yes, the first part, the scenes of the space, Cylon's raids and very good. But the end of it? I always see movies and these days I show the timer hidden, so I do not know how long it will end. So, it was a special type of torture for me, and I had seen it happen again and again. Every time I thought, that is, the last scene, the latest shoot, I got another. Each fake character has its complete end! That was not really necessary. <br /> <br /> There was a great highlight in all the hobbies of the great school: the scene of the young Roslin. Why is it important for us to know that he lost his sisters and father in a horrible accident and {b} had a night stand with his former student / student? What brings the story? Where is the link? Now, I come closer to European styles, whatever the movies and performances, random acts, all of this, but this was ridiculous. This has not brought anything meaningful to the story. <br /> <br /> I also saw "The Last Cool Stuff", where Ron revealed his plot plot: he could not come up with a good ending story ... so he just did not! There have never been so many people in the final section. It was the idea of ​​the "thousands of years past" of that time, which was also used in the Hitchhers Guide to the mitochondrial Eve, and believe me, there are many BSG watchers who know this particular storyline H2G2. And talking about Hera, now is the story, it was not working well, IN ALL. Instead, Roslin makes a 20-year-old younger student. Do not go wrong, for older men older women. More power to them. But this ... does not make sense. <br /> <br /> In the end, (writing) the series is a mistake as the characters would be. That's even more in the last section. I hope Lost and 24k are doing better because of the final series.
