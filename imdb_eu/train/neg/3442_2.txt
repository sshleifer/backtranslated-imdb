I rented this movie I liked the cover. However, as soon as I started the movie, I regretted it. It seems that they have used their home video camcorder to shoot this movie and make a baby. In addition, fantasy faces and shapes were used to make people apprehend and try to make fun of, but I laughed, I put myself together and made a better job. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, I felt that this was a good idea but because of the crazy lines, in some cases, they were dimming. He was not under his direction. <br /> <br /> I did not want to sit down because I was forced to see physical pain, but I always finished what I started, so I let it breathe deeply and let it continue. . Without a doubt, I'm losing 98 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> I'd be ashamed to see 'Haunted Boat' and discover something entertaining. I am a fan of horror films, but I was very disappointed to think that "Terror Toons" could be worse, but that made me think about it again. Left to his genus. <br /> <br /> * outside ***** (the stars are the worst of their fears due to the ideas that will come)
