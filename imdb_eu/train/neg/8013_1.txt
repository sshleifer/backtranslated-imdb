You might think that a film about growing a homosexuality of a young man would be boring. Think again This production is bottled and the insomnia must be sold in a healing manner, as it is ten times as powerful as all the sleep aid in the market. As filmmakers did * for playing a movie *, it was lazy and decided to make random (and randomly BORING) images and some sort of non-scenes, throwing some real scenes on the scene. Good lighting is not so important in the film process, and it includes a "arthouse" movie. This is exactly a pure product, for many traditional filmmakers it is easy for the indie film to be poo-poo poo-poo, and maintaining the indie movie in the general public more easily. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in movies related to the theme, some of the great shorts that will be available on the logo website or Get Real will be better. Better read Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip this long butterfly piece.
