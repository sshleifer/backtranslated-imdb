Honestly, if anyone has a brain, there is no positive thing about this movie ever. <br /> <br /> I lost my $ 1 rental. I would like Will Smith to laugh, "If you get a dream you must protect it." <br /> <br /> All the actors had to get bored or at that time they had no reputation. While you're writing Matthew Mc Conahay *, all of the actors in this movie got better when they played a Texas psyche on the Texas Chainsaw. 4. If you watch this movie and say good things, you must be very little. Films with bad taste, it hurts. Thank you ... and TRUE, it's been talked about! <br /> <br /> Keep up from misfortune. <br /> <br /> Get Devil's Rejects, now it's classical.
