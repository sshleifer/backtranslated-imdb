The only thing that often meets the review I write is that I never get back for an hour and a half! I will not leave the air alone, I will compare it with the movie cubes trilogy (cube and hip-hop) with other films! The cube was not very good, but it was original and there were some technical defects that formed hiperkopia. a sequel lost the advantage of originality but was quite sharp and even better than the buck that I liked (the story was better)! but the cube in front of the previous zero is not really fx good, f * ck * d very script and just the bad thing is that the performance is not well combined. For example: in the film it would be a foolish idea all the time ... if it happened and it would happen, so it is not very original! my advice: do not miss out on an hour and a half !!!!!!!! Oh, and I hope this movie falls and it's burning !!!!!!!
