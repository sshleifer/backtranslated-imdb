Based on the sense and other reviews on this site, I was focused on a horror movie that was fascinated with junkies. I've got the entire shaft focused on landfills. Do I have a movie called "Sukalde", a review of these people? They are only 3 main characters, and nobody is well-written or well-behaved. Basically I took the whole movie out of my head and I was mad at the stupidity of drug addiction. <br /> <br /> Please, do it for your favor. Do not rent this movie. Rent a "Cabin Fever" or any other horror movie. Hell, rent "Mary Poppins"! Animation penguins are much more demanding and more robust than you will find in "kitchens".
