Since they had not seen in the theater book since 1970, MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has become a synonym for the film cycle of legendary proportions. Now, finally, it is unexpectedly the most beautiful in a DVD package, as it was not released today for the first time. <br /> <br /> Gore Vidal's 1968 seller was a satirical phrase. Most filmmakers felt that the story, structure and overall tone of the novel were not felt in the film, and that industry members were shocked by the 20th Century Fox's rights and at the same time hired Vidal to adapt his novel to the screen. The studio's directors quickly stopped their feet: Vidal's adaptations were repeatedly discarded and brought to the screen by Michael Sarne's most recent writers and directors. <br /> <br /> Executive students hoped to enter Sarne's youth market. They were seen as the target of the film, but Sarne revealed material with more material than the directives. Then rewrite after rewriting. Cast, perceived ruin, became increasingly challenging. In his DVD commentary, star Raquel Welch says he has not had any idea of ​​Myra's scenic scene or any single scene, and each person involved seemed to make another movie. Together with the documentary "Back Story", Rex Reed says that MYRA BRECKINRIDGE was a movie made by a group of people who were in their dressing room, while their lawyers were waiting for their calls to return. <br /> <br /> Accuracy is shown by the film itself. They are the basis of the story of Vidal, but it does not only break the story from all broader implications, but it does not seem to have any point. Everything goes in many directions, nothing is associated, and many scenes have been the scene of any previous logic. And as Director Sarne repeatedly tries to make the film an empty farce, the only laughter created is unexpected. <br /> <br /> The main accident is Mae West. It is true that West is well-preserved and has not lost in any way, but there is no movement in the seventies and still believes it. The safest tricks on leather shoes is very disturbing, at least. But worse, really, West is outside of his time. The effort to return his character to hip and rhythm is one of the most shaky self-crashing shots ever seen. <br /> <br /> The rest is wasted. Raquel Welch, a prominent actor who underestimates, plays Myra's role as a Barbie doll with steroids; Rex Reed, an inexperienced actor, is unexpectedly in the role of Myron, but the whole mission is essentially missing. John Huston and the lorry John Carradine, Jim Backus, William Hopper and Andy Devine only emerge. Yes, it's really a problem that should be feared by all those involved in the movie: when it should be slow when it should be slow, it should be slow, unbelievable, from the beginning to the end. It is true that Sarne's director has occasionally inspired the idea of ​​using the clipboard from Judy Garland from Shirley Temple to create a counterweight of action - but, in general, when he was selected by Sarne. It seems that something seems wrong. <br /> <br /> How and why is Sarne's commentary audio. Sarne did not like the novel or the topic in general. He did not want to write the script, but he needed money; He did not want to direct the movie, but he needed money. It is clear that Gore Vidal and Rex Reed did not like it (at one point, Reed "is not a nice person" and nowadays he believes he has worked in Vidal and Reed tandem, he refused to turn his "homosexual agenda" that is, when you arrive, it seems that Sarne really shot Vidal's novel, but he did not imagine it so curious. <br /> <br /> Although the short film said he likes gay people, Sarne She does not understand why she creates a lot of homogeneous film as a result of the hilarious representations of homosexuals. When she's taken along with her, she appears much more than homophobic Sarne - and, in fact, the worst writer and director she could have done for this project. <br /> <br /> Additionally, Sarne and Welch's commentary and documentary, in the DVD version, include a number of trailer and movie versions: "theater version" and "restored" version. The only difference is that the last scene of "restored" is printed in black and white. The changes made before releasing the movie have not been restored, but the documentaries are the ones that are. Both panoramic views are very good and the sound is pretty good. But I began to end it, in fact, filmmakers historians, filmmakers and movie enthusiasts are interested in it. I only give three to five stars, but others should overcome. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
