At night I saw him on the tube. The actors involved caught my attention first. The first scenes were carefully considered. Some sad funny ones. A good character to develop. I thought the last third of the movie was different. In the first part of the film I did not see it. How I bundled together to see each other. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel it never happened. Above all, I do not like a character than the original language (?). Was that other shoe? <br /> <br /> Would I recommend it? No, I do not think so. As other reviewers say, there is a large part of the slogan in the 60s, but it did not pay much attention. It turned me on in the end.
