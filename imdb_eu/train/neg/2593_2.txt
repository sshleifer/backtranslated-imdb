American Pie: Beta House is like a genius limbo. On the one hand, it is a landless comedy and jokes are really clear. On the other hand, this video is a very soft-core to activate the audience. Beta House is essentially a sex-scene collage - some humiliating, others have mumble intentions of humor - with a couple of thin plot of cohesive effort. The characters are hardly two-dimensional, the greatest development is based on the knowledge of Naked Mile, and the "significant" plot is far from the point where the writer asks you why you're in need of a story. <br /> <br /> Correctly, I do not hope to enter this film anymore. I liked three original American Pie films, and Band Camp and Naked Mile were good rentals. I thought that it was enough to unleash Naked Mile theaters, so when I saw some of the characters returning to Beta House, I was excited about this division. I realized that the scenes of freedom and sexual assault would be numerous in many ways. It was very good that, in the past, they protected the story of these stories and they were well integrated in the plot. In Beta House, however, almost writers have forgotten why the formula in AP films has worked. They spent too much energy in the nudity they forgot to write a story. <br /> <br /> This movie is disappointing and it's not worth the dollar rental. The jokes are not good, the story does not exist, and the video aspect is too slow.
