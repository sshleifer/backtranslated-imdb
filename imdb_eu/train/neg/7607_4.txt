- When the local sheriff dies, he will take his wife and decide to clean the town. However, not all people are happy to do what they do. When the seats are ordered to remain in the village, a local saloon owner (a woman) hires a killer to take care of sheriff. The improviser is not in any way aware that the bertsolaris would know that sheriffs and killers would fall in love. <br /> <br /> - There is something quite interesting about the Gunslinger concept, and it's an example of what happens with bad execution. Here's a good movie trying to get somewhere. With larger hands or a higher budget, Gunslinger could have a fun look at the Western women's role. Gunslinger is a mess of the movie. <br /> <br /> - It is wrong in the film: a cast of assistance with no interpretation capacity, a dramatic and supernatural interview, and sets it up. as sets But the biggest attacker is to edit it. The scene was surprised when the actors (and for that, the horses) started to cite, Corman called for "Action". The best is a scene of two pilots riding two standing buildings next to a building. Suddenly, they run and they will run across the corner, just like they would ride thousands of miles long. Or, apparently, take an example of people transporting across the country. A man will enter a building and in the second he appeared throughout the country to mount his horse. <br /> <br /> - Corman does not work for decent actors. Although they were not superb stars, Beverly Garland, John Ireland, and Allison Hayes were all able to get a good performance. But in Gunslinger, they do not do much work. <br /> <br /> - I have now seen MST3K and not MST3K versions of the movie. I would recommend the MST3K route.
