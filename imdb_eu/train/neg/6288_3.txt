After reading a lot of comments here, I am surprised that no one has accepted the "Mirror Image" of the 1960's Twilight Zone, called Vera Miles. Rod Serling has made Sean Ellis much better to create an incredibly powerful story that Sno Ellis made in 88 minutes before 88 minutes. A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and incomprehensible end, but with a feature film, the substance should be a bit more and the story should be sensible. Sadly, substance and meaning are "broken". Yes, it has a few moments, but it's not enough to justify your time. Other notes: Clearly, it's a current story, a character from the movie does not have a mobile phone! And despite the fact that a car accident is a story that is happening, it is never an insurance company, the driver of another car or the police that should report it. My advice: skip this change and see it instead of the original!
