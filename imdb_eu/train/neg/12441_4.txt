Some things need to be clarified. Mark Ferris's image is not what Mark Ferris has been the protagonist. I know he was my dad. Remove the photo. Mark Ferris was also a writer, at least one of them. I'm trying again to see a copy or a video. It's been years and I can take someone to get a copy, that would be great. The movie is not so bad, and it is trying to compare with today's Star Wars and other high-tech science fiction. If you look at it, just enjoy your arrogance and humor. Let your movies be snobbish and enjoy less creative and innovative movies.
