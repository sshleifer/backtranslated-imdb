Vampires Vs. The zombie leaves the news with a homicide and cannibalist illness that has been identified throughout the United States ... Travis Fontaine (CS Munro) and Jenna, her teenage daughter (Bonny Giroux), listen to the radio when forest fires and tries to escape the disease when Travis overcomes a boy When I get away I will become a zombie. A little more on the road stops Julia from her (Brinke Stevens) and her teenage daughter, Carmilla (Maratama Carlson), on the road, at this point there is a young girl named Tessa (Melanie Crystal). Julia binds to the back of the car and each other's attachment. This situation seemed strange to me, but Travis, like a soldier, will take everything and admit that Carmilla Julia's hand is out and I do not really know. So with all the unknowns, Travis leaves Julia and Tessa. Carmilla seems like a pretty girl, but she's been a vampire and she is biting people and becoming a vampire and a bit of a lesbian. Travis, Carmilla and Jenna continue to travel, seeming to be a vampire killer: "General" (Peter Ruginis) is calling someone and it probably has something, but the movie is wrong. It's a matter and I do not know how to draw this plot while it hurts me ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Published, co-written, executed and executed. Vince D'Amato Vampires vs. Zombie is the worst film of horror ever, and therefore the worst film ever. Apparently, D'Amato's screenwriter Sheridan Le Fanu was based on a classic story called 'Carmilla' (it should be sued) and an absolute mess that could drive a tank so large in the plot and in logic! What is the disease that makes people zombies? Why is Carmilla Vampire? Who is Julia? Who says the general? What do you want? Where will Travis and Jenna go? How can Travis run a man and he still has the smallest human emotion on it? What is the end with a mental ward? The viewer can even more distort the confusing and necessary dreams of the dreams. There are so many things wrong with this film, the narration is not blind, the concept is horrible and never explained correctly, but it is very boring. I do not say a positive thing about Vampire Vs. Zombies, not one. Forget about anything happening against waves vampires because it has not happened. Tell me again why the movie Vampires V is called. Zombies? <br /> <br /> D'Amato has never done anything wrong with the experiences he has never done, wrong, badly conceived, and thoughtless. Vampires Vs. Zombies do not really care about riches, I do not exaggerate a single party. Gore is a false appearance, there are some red blood-shaped blood splints, some fake effects and a mid-level climate where the zombies eat Carmilla and Jenna's intestines. This pretty gory scene is probably in full. The bad movie, but it lasts for a couple of minutes and does not compensate for another four to get rid of it. <br /> <br /> <br /> The quote on the vampire front. The zombies should be small, because they had a quote because most cars are on a road. This is a horror movie that is badly done, to see my misfortune, the whole thing is huge. The play is terribly terrifying, and I mean it's horrible. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about Vampires Vs. Zombies are one of the worst movies ever made. Next to the title (V) Vampires versus. Zoimbies indicates that he has just passed the video, well, that's too much abuse to get the nearest source of waste from the nearest source of waste.
