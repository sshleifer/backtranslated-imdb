For those who have little time, I will summarize, in a word ... pathetic. There are good examples of this film description. You can spend so much time on the screen for 2 minutes, so you can see absolutely stupid and meaningless without having to. Are you absolutely naked in the first 10 minutes? You got it! The reason that appears is so absurd, but nevertheless, it really sets the tone of that piece of puppy for youngsters. You can see in the reflections of boys about 12 years that the rubbish was written by people who really wanted to pay for this part! !!! <br /> <br /> I've seen a decadence of several franchise franchise movies over the years, but American Pie; Beta House must be one of the worst offenders, despite the fact that it is still the average nature of the original movie. a thousand times funniest than this dreck. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable, and sometimes you feel like you're actually watching a theater game. The things that happen in this movie are so incomprehensible that you really want to see a disquieting suppression (we are talking about Star Wars suspension levels as you should convince the Jar Jar reaw). > <br /> If the earth is in thin paper and most often when events occur, there is only one newborn or another pathetic joke. There is no way to talk about active talent. You get everything, pretty guys laugh at us. And how they fail !!!!! Each Gag falls flat and I laughed as the only wizard who seemed socially ignorant. Otherwise, how do you hear when the bulls try to go through the story? <br /> <br /> They make a good mistake to write everything they do to make a good choice to do something that they do to favor the smallest nonsense. The characters have to complete a number of tasks before accepting them as Beta Hous, but this is mainly because they perform tasks but they do very briefly editing, but we see little evidence of this. It's a very lazy way to tell a story. There are also opportunities to have fun. (Imagine being the Ozoko Wizard, where all the important events happened on the screen, we have seen that the Dorothy Txorimaloa is repeated and that is what he says). Surely we had a wonderful adventure then ") Lazy. Lazy LAZY !!!! <br /> <br /> The female characters do not say anything. Anything they do may appear naked, apparently without reason, and most of the movies as a visual section They're used only by the T & A braindeads you're looking for, they're not disappointed, but you're just ashamed of it. If you buy it on DVD, social crash will be helpful in your special way. Congratulations.
