What is the best thing to do with the characters that play a very badly non-cinematographic movie, does it really matter who it would be best to reflect on some of the cooler cities in New York? It's not a romance here, no comedy. The performance is very flat and very predictable. I was most annoyed by the quote for classic movies. Men, can not you see how much more you mention, the less significant your movie becomes? Try to be the original! There is no excuse for a small budget, not even the first director. Marvelous, crappy, crappy. It's not surprising that it cost me a buck ...
