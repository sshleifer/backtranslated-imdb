Wow, what's wrong can be achieved. This was very serious. There was no rumor (especially CGI was alarming), but in play, atmosphere and direction. <br /> <br /> The story was horrible - the lead arch of the protagonist was a joke. A few nights ago, to go with Vinnie Jones, she starts crying "girlfriend taking pictures". Um ... All New York photographers are children, suggestive and vulnerable? The development of its nature does not point to any justification or point - and, in the end, your characters will completely scroll loudly and completely absent. <br /> <br /> The gory moments were only clear and little-self-stressed efforts to pass on the gore of the modern MTV style - all CGI, blood is still not a real thrill. These pieces were unwanted fun and they focused on the consciousness of themselves - wonderful camera angles, etc. <br /> <br /> In general, this film delinquishes another potential idea. He could have been an athlete (until he was finally stunned by monstrous monsters) to prevent self-consciousness under the direction of consciousness. This movie was not for audiences and he did a CV, but for a lot of reasons.
