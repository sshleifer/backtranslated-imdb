I have to make three comments about this movie, which is hanging on the bottom shelf of Blockbuster. First and foremost, it is interesting to try to film the most important work that the film makers are putting forward. Some people, like Kubrick did with "Lolita", wrote that the original author was like something original. Of course, it can not happen here; Kraft-Ebing has died. Some of the original work needs have been used in the direction of the most recent and unrelated point of launch ("Tristram Shandy's latest adaptation"). You can laugh, the movie "Slaughterhouse Five" is an example. Or just take the original format and render it to film cinemas. Woody Allen, "Everything you Want to Know," would be an approach and, undoubtedly, this film. As a matter of fact, it is probably the only thing that can be done with academic work like "Psychopathia Sexualis". The potential loss is that all of the accumulated points of origin have been hidden or destroyed. It's here. <br /> <br /> The second point is cinematic style. Some people will call a "tribute" to Murnau, Pabst, Carl Dreyer, etc., but I think it's more crude than that. It's too generous and sensitive to make it too long. It's finally annoying. <br /> <br /> The third point, perhaps, is less intellectual intelligence. How did the film makers get a film about wild sex offspring and perversions so terribly boring? The movie was impossible to pay attention to and anyone who is not automatically drawn from the representation of sexual deviation will find it. I do not want to be completely unknown and say that the movie is nonsense, but I must say that the film makers reflect the source material, the copying of the film styles and the enormous denial. Give audiences an emotional level (perhaps afraid of titillation). <br /> <br /> The movie is from the start to the wrong and it does not work for me. I'm sorry to say
