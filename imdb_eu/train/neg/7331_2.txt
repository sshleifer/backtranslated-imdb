This movie was bad and hurried. I realize that financing of one of these films is difficult. However, if the plot had an original substance, someone would see that he was getting the necessary money, such cases and films are not necessary and do not exist. This movie has been on the plot and I can do it better in more ways. There is no reason to make a movie that does not compete with others. My computer informed me that I need at least ten lines to send my comment so that the lines are just the bull's space. In my opinion, there is no need to say something about this film. There is a lot of what I said and if you lose enough time to read the review, you will lose less time than God's name to watch the movie. The only exception to this is the type of person that we want to play in the 2 films that are playing for the women's entertainment network, in this case, let's see what matters to me.
