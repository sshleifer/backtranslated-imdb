SPLIT SECOND could be a good movie. A story about a homicide "Road Rage", a very young Clive Owen is showing a good performance; BUT ... but ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, filmmakers have cut their own film with idiotable camera and awesome editing. The camera jumps all of the creation in an unsuccessful attempt (I suppose) to reflect Owene's stress on business, family and traffic. This is really a pain for the viewer. <br /> <br /> Because filmmakers do not care about making a good movie, but to fake each other stupid photography, we should not lose it. .
