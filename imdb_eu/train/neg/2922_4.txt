Take beautiful young people, put them in an exotic location, bend little boys, the two protagonists will find love after a couple of great breaths, creating the smallest plots and then make a happy ending. Except except three or four, of course) Harlequin Romance is a classic (and successful) format. It's not very good, but then it's not too bad, like most small yellow pockets. The location in Budapest is especially interesting, though it has been used by the wonderful train station (designed by Gustave Eifel) or not to mention the famous thermal baths in the city.
