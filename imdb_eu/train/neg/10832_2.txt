I do not usually have trouble with movies in movies, but this really annoyed me. They swore everything they did. For the whole movie. (And, as someone else has said, get infected) it was boring, knightly and apparently. I would not be if I were you. <br /> <br /> In addition, I do not like films that I like as I would like to claim for life. Maite Drink Man Woman I love and what happens is that a Taiwanese person gives life. But I have been associated with them. I have never known anyone who swore to this film as 'actor', and I started working. So go figure. After that, William H. Macy smiled at me. Once. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid, unless it's boring.
