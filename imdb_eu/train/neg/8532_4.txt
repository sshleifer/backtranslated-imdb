The writer Robert Taylor (as Terry) "is dull, happy" and can not see it directly from another Norma Shearer (as Consuelo). "The sun shines bright when it's raining," Taylor explained. But Mr. Taylor gets a Mrs. Shearer near her. Finally, at the Shearer Palm Beach casino, Taylor "I love you!" He proclaims it. Shearer retires it as George Sanders (as Tony) is in charge of it. However, to set a game debt, Shearer tells Taylor "Her Cardboard Lover" as Mr. Lynch's jealousy. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie invites a clear and correct review of three words: "His Cardboard Movie." Shearer is the latest movie, one of the biggest stars in the world, "He Who Gets Slapped" (1924, Another Consuelo), "The Women" (1939). To be fair, this is probably MGM's Shearer movie MGM wanted to watch. However, the part is not terrifying. <br /> <br /> Moved and driven, Taylor and Shearer improved "The Escape" (1940). If Shearer has followed, maybe she would be a better actress than "main master"; Apparently, he was no longer interested in it, and he certainly did not need any money. Taylor has a great scene, reciting Christina Rossetti's "When I am Dead, My Dearest," trying to jump across Shearer's balcony, as directed by George Cukor. <br /> <br /> **** Her cartoon lover (6/42) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, George Sanders
