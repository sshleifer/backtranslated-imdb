If you want to see a movie with a completely non-symptomatic character, that's it. The play is excellent, as John Cassavetes's paranoid insanity, as they say, can really be taken away, and Peter Falk will help the best friend for his whole life. It's a big mistake, but because the lovers of amorals and misogynist thrown, it's hard to decide who's roots. Only writer and director Elaine May would leave this. I was interested in a long interview with producer Michael Hausman on the DVD, and the two stars had "different ideas" on the screenplay that the director was almost impossible to do, he was the director of photography. He made unknown demands because of the anger that the crew was constantly seated, etc. This highly dysfunctional family atmosphere is clearly visible on the screen.
