I have seen about a thousand horror movies. (my favorite) This movie is the worst. For me, it shoots an idea. So a movie that is in error may be good too. Something weird is definitely cheap. However, he does not have to say anything. I still can not understand the early karate scene with film. Something jewelery has little to offer. Save yourself the pain!
