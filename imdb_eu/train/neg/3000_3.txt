The Marty (Simon Scuddamore) school is sexually humiliated by a series of classmates, and then is in a laboratory explosion (which is also established by them). A few years later, all friendships were once again invited to a bachelor's (closing) meeting. They do not know what Marty is about to kill. Then a storm begins, the school is blocked and Marty begins revenge. <br /> <br /> Very stupid. The murder is terrifying and boring, and there are some terrific planes in the atmospheric school, but that's it. The humiliation caused by Scuddamoro is more cruel (it gets rid of it, the head of the toilet is burned and burns) and they are uncomfortable. When Scuddamore committed suicide, when he was released, it was almost impossible to see. This movie is also nondescript. It is full of Scuddamore's frontal (it's amazing in any movie), but a girl decides to take a bath ... since they can go after them! And then there is a pair that must be sex. This is the type of movie where murder everyone knows and allows himself to take himself. When I was closing with a twist, I was crying and, turning my eyes, I turned a twist on the TV I wanted to throw. Playing is simple, not good, but unbearable. Caroline Munro is there too. The woman is very beautiful, but she is not a great actor. <br /> <br /> This achieves 3 killings and an effective atmosphere. Otherwise, the mill is unforgettable. Scuddam's most tragic suicide film has earned more attention.
