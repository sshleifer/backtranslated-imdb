All day long, I see dinosaurs and have the same basic problem all day long. <br /> <br /> They do not believe in firearms. They seem to be around them or not. Dinosaur _bounce Perhaps millions of years ago they disappeared before the gunpowder was invented and the laws of physics were then different ... Aah, no. Come on If they are currently close enough to operate chemically, they should be vulnerable (or subsonic) lead projectiles. It's very easy. <br /> <br /> Look, harder reptiles on the planet today, alligators and crocodiles, are completely vulnerable to the basic fire of the rifle. They are not anything magical. You can create a round pistol on the back with heavy scales. They do not take any bullets or anything special. The bullets are small, they do not kill. Bullets are great (but not really), the challenge (as with most games) is to kill the animal, so it does not run. (The hunters think they are immoral to let their prey escape and die). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most animals, including predators, are easily thrown into shooter . They will also get rid of the noise and non-lethal injuries. There is an exception, they are great, because those fears that are so frightened are only mortal. Buffalo land is very dangerous because they are wound up when they are charged. We have seen the video of a great bull of a clay cape that saves a great bull of a lion's pride. A large cat will run, but it will not be charged as a last resort of despair. The place where the T.Rex spectrum would enter is unknown. Their behavior was only seen. With larger animals, safe hunting is capable of applying a large and well-designed projector and / or some of them applying quite quickly to deal with their load. With T.Rex, of course, it could be a serious problem. I saw a T.Rex skull (they have one in the center of the museum) and making a gun could not be so boring. If the fire is smaller, the neck may be cheaper. Little bullets would still be them, the animal is too big to kill easily! <br /> <br /> So here we have Cortez and his men (that is, apparently before the famous Mexican campaign), captured by indigenous Americans and sacrificed on the pyramid. All these sacrifices for humanity seemed to me to be delightful on the first day of T. Reso's partner, who was terrified of T. Rexes's continent. Instead of cutting their hearts and absorbing lizards, Cortez and others speak to hunt and kill the Aztecs. Okay, they may not be boys like M-16 "Carnosaur" series, but they have sharp, bullets, sharp sticks (trees) and swords. Perhaps the group of soldiers with little cars is a bit different, but there are some boys and I would bet on a dinosaur. Oh, wait, there's a cannon about 4 ints. That's the catch of a Tyrannosaurus' skull card! So they put a trap, with a group of men, cannon, sharp sticks on the precipice, and first enter T.Rex, as if the girl is pretty brown. Cortez does not have time to charge again, so they must close the range so they know their purpose. T.Rex completely rejects the flintlock fireball, and we see both crossbows and the cannonball _bounce_! Forget End of credibility Cross-screw The Cortez's trunk would overtake the armor and think of a 4-barrel ball as a wooden boat, which could be carried out by the _bag cannonball ball4 and here is T.Rex, still standing, even if not in blood, and then Cortez leads to the abyss, to fall into sharp sticks and (with a magic) to kill and kill them. Yaaay, sharp sticks! <br /> <br /> Dinos are not completely reluctant to get a rocket - they throw a second eye on a gun, so it's running, It's NOT a bear like a bear or a buffalo, at least in movies. <br /> <br /> They kill a second dinosaur bomb, made of rushes of gunpowder and precious stones. My money was still on the cannon. The designed function is to concentrate all the volume energy in one direction - For the purposes of the Bomb Effect, the application is much wider. The real pump (NOT a bomb bomb) has a steel casing, which has a very heavy explosion Andia has it. (Think: a whirlwind bomb fireworks). Only a POOF of a fireball gun will go. (Confirm me about this.)
