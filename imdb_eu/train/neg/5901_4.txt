Something to Sing About was in a conflict between James Cagney Warner, produced by Grand National Studios. B made two films in the studio, but they did not have the highest Cagney credits. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest loss films Jimmy Cagney made so little dancing to use his awful dancing. . The two Yankee Doodle Dandy and Footlight Parade are immediately considered. Two smaller films are The West Point Story and Never Steal Anything Small. Cagney himself said he never saw music music as a retirement. So why did he do so so little? <br /> <br /> Well, that was all wrong.

Gene Lockhart and William Frawley, respectively, are well-known conventional study leaders and have had regular complications. His contract demands a marriage clause, so that Cagney and Evelyn Daw's singer are hiding. Then, we will get the romance of the guided publicity studio to the leading screen Mona Barrie. I think where you are going to figure it out. <br /> <br /> The most depressing thing about something is missing Cagney's dance numbers.

Were there any useful Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell or Ruby Keeler? <br /> <br /> There's no such memorable song. And there's no voice in Daw. Jeanette MacDonald has a soprano voice that has not changed with a swing band. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, he returned to Cagney Warner Brothers. But they had to give him some honest musicals.
