I was looking for this trip, and I was extremely disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I am very much amused in the roller coaster and amusement park. <br /> <br /> The parts of the Russian mountain did well - and that was 30 seconds for a second of 90 seconds. <br /> <br /> They were watched flaky and badly executed. <br /> <br /> The Indiana Jones and Space Mountain rides were constantly trying and the mix of brilliant Disneyland, and failed everywhere. <br /> <br /> It was not exciting or exciting. at least
