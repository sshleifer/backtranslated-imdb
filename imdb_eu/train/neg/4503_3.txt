I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Geisha's souvenirs remain the imbalances of Western and Asian art. In general, the scene is beautiful, but highlighting the scenes of exoticism may be some foods. In fact, excessive cherry blossomed. Here is the cultural difference of perception: the ultimate beauty is not spectacular, since the geisha is really beautiful because it is not pumpkin west. <br /> <br /> Other comments have correctly mentioned major flaws. As a Taiwanese, no doubt, the actress is great. An actor or actor can play any type of role when he looks. Gong Li is great, but the emotional capabilities that he showed in this movie did not return to Japanese style. I saw everything Chinese WOMAN was sour and jealous. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favorite actors, did not even look at a Japanese. I mention a few feminine and delicate feminine features of Japanese women, I agree with him that they can not. These are so delicate that all modern Japanese actors claim to have the right to play in Geisha, let us not let Malaysians and cultures grow in a variety of cultures and probably do not know a lot of Japanese culture. <br /> <br /> Geisha is a good shot to turn the curiosity of US audiences. But the same film and the art would be insulting at the same time earning a movie for the best Oscar, best director or best picture.
