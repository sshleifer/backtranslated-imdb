What a horrible and horrible movie. The worst collection of topicals I've seen for a long time. I have not seen much. I left the theater for about 40 minutes to search for hard drinks to calm your nerves. Meryl Streep was just as scary as it used to be. How many moles and tortured expressions could a person have? The talents of Aidan Quinn were completely wasted. And who gave Gloria Estefan him to act? If you want to be politically correct, this film encourages racial stereotypes. (A non-frightening inexperienced solo teacher teaches violin at the poor neighborhood school). The kids were not cute too! Written by great script. Aaargh! Wes Craven repeatedly eased me. This real fear!
