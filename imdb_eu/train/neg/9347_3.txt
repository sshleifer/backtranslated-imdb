This movie confines itself to the lowest endless indolent moment, becoming something that deserves to be hung up. But no. It's flat, self conscious, unimaginative, and boring. <br /> <br /> Some of the pictures and backgrounds set do not make the movie, they make a calendar. This social-social documentary pseudo-dramatic drama ("TRUE IS that really has happened") not only fails, it does not persuade, so it does not work as a social history. The topical mixing of playful plays make this very difficult movie, this gameplay is pretty quickly dressed. The characters are single-dimensioned, as they never feel like they are. The director's personality is the protagonist of this film.
