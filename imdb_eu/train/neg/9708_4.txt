When a theater's staff finds an old movie coil, they decide to show it to Midnight Lifetime midnight show, assuming it is an old preview. Unfortunately, it is actually an old Nazi control experiment that converts the viewer into a packed zombie. It is an independent production of low budget, with many camps, but it's not worth "1.1" on this IMDb. It's so much fun. It is clear that filmmakers have a fair knowledge and love of ancient horror movies, many of which have created a tribute to homage to references and tributes. Night of the Dead (in many ways, very similar), Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness and many other things like this. <br /> <br /> I liked how I described the zombies. Although really, even though it is thought to be zombies, the physical characteristics of those who are perhaps dying are perhaps dying, perhaps incredible, but I explain the effort made by writers. The effects of the budget were honest, the performance was good, and the story was entertaining. <br /> <br /> I like it.
