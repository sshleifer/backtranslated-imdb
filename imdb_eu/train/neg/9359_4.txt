This movie is probably Muslim. <br /> <br /> Why do I write? The main character is a father's Christian and Muslim mother. He lives in the Christian country for the first twenty years. At the end of the film, he seems to have been a Muslim because of his own dressing, keeping his jacket and general outfits. She has a six-year-old child with the same hairstyle, so she is probably a Muslim, although her mother is a Christian. Thus, the main character seems to be Muslim and his son becomes Muslim. It seems that one of the main characters, Christians, is that a child grows up. There are more Muslims in the end of this film world, so it seems.
