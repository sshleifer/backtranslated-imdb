My favorite Emma is Jane Austen's novel - Emma is well sensitive in spite of her mistakes, so readers can forgive and love her, and her relationship with Knightley, warm, popular, respectful, but playful. romantic excitement Mr. Knightley is a perfect man, and an independent, clear and trusting woman who could be as close to Emma at that time. Remember that he is only 21 years old and surely he got in his mistakes and grew up. Who does not want Emma? Who does not mean Mr. Knightley? Emma's version does not make sense about things we love about Emma. I could not see it, I was so horrible. I could not see the generous and generous aspect of Emma, ​​which encourages readers: she gives patience and warmth to her father; He or she and Mrs. Weston have a close relationship, that is to say, that the happiness of her friendship shows herself the will of herself (she sacrifices herself to her single friend, sending Miss Taylor to her marriage). In this adaptation, Mr Woodhouse's character seems strange, not only the oddest, as old as it is. <br /> <br /> That adaptation is the most important thing that fails. The relationship between Knightley and Emma. These relationships are based on mutual respect and love: Mr. Knightley, Emma's slightest mistakes, are indulgent, letting his intelligence and real guardians never let himself be overwhelmed by others. and Emma looks at him, despite concealing that toy and using her opinion. At the start of the show, the argument between these dresses goes far beyond and describes all the possibilities of describing the nature of their relationship. Mr. Knightley is not enough to stimulate the sexual tension that leads to appealing (or to inspire the admiration of female audiences). <br /> <br /> It's really awesome. I can not understand why he liked anybody who really likes Emma's novel, after shutting off a thousand, to turn off after.
