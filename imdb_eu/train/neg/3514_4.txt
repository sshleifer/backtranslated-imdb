Philip. K. Dickian filmed. And for that it is a decent thing. Better than this abomination called Paycheck (Woo) and Minority Report (Spielberg). But let's wait, twisting at the end and turning it over to me was too much. The path of the movie began to frighten me in the middle, and I was sadly correct. But that does not mean that the movie is not worth the time. No, no. The first part (as it has already been mentioned) is wonderful. There are several directors where the director wishes to convey the message that is most important for the show in the future (or we can do it as if we are doing these things) or combining them. But he's paranoid and feels "unassisted." Good
