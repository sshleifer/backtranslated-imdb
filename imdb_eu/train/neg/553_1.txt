After waiting for the end, I would like to say that I did not join the series as soon as possible. The last part was all about the previous seven years. Everything is spoiled. The trip was 23 years old, but captain Janeway has the power to reduce ... let's say, only seven years. Why seven? Why not? Or anything? Why do not you avoid the whole adventure? The crew killed during the whole trip. Why do you want to keep seven Nine? Does not everyone else count or what? The crew said that returning home was not really the most important. As it is said, "it is more important than a travel destination". Disbelief And the last scene is surrounded by other federation boats and the Earth. There is no trace, return to normal life. <br /> <br /> The worst is over.
