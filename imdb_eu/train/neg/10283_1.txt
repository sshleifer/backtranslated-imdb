I feel the sound of "olds", but, of course, I did not see too many movies that I liked after the 1960s ... in general, movies seem worse and worse (though I want to enjoy Scott Baio. "The Bread, My Sweet" vehicle , which is NOT a value for the film, except in the sexual field. This film, the mother of the Las Vegas Choir, seems unable to live on its own, although it is clearly in its 50s (although it is in the 40s). I am 57 years old, and like all women I knew in the 50s and 40s, I have more than enough to live with myself (as I do, as I do 13 years of graduation from secondary school, I was legally emulated and started my journey in life.) <br /> <br /> < > The daughter is not credible in her job ... she gets a well-deserved win (a great opportunity) and she also loses the ball, but when another woman is ready to go forward, writers shoot as "opportunistic" when a person with a career-oriented career is doing everything by making the most of themselves. The discipline of his colleagues, a girl who does not apparently understand the concept of honoring her promises (in this case her boss). <br /> <br /> Daughter grudgingly "allow" to remain with her mother, temporarily, but then her mother (as her life was given to her and raised to "maturity") as a pariah of treats. Apparently, the trio's writers do not understand that "parents" do not play as children and they have to treat "children". Hollywood is just another "baloney" society that continues to strain our throat boots, just like we wanted them to entertain their people with stupidity and their creative offerings. <br /> <br /> This is sad at the end of the stupid movie. If the young male restaurant was a real and two-dimensional "telematic" nature, it would remain with AMARRA, much older and more attractive than itself. But, in the end, she "falls" for her daughter, a young girl whose clothing is superficial and at the same time has no interest, but in a plain and dull way. (The opportunistic young woman who worked with this girl was much more attractive, physically.) <br /> <br /> There was no reasoning to be presented to the public, because the restaurant preferred why her daughter (who was one). honest, selfish, centered on herself, without her mother's carelessness, she could not understand her mother - a nice, sweet and humorous woman and a daughter with a living daughter. Of course, the mother had her own mistakes ... Her husband fell down, because he drank one or two years later that he thought he was part of his proud daughter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Considering the characters that have not been developed or not, this is the short film and your time If you lose valuable, you'd really like baloney. (Where is mustard?)
