If you only saw Theodore Rex's trailer, you would think that it was a bad comedic friend with Whoopi Goldberg and a costume dinosaur. This is true, but this is, above all, a futuristic story that seems like Batman Forever that looks like a style of direction and curious characters. It was misrepresented, and it was to be marketed as a futurist story, instead of a buzzing police. This film is not traded or not, the film remains horrible. <br /> <br /> In the future, the dinosaurs have survived through a stunning technology, and they talk like a man and walk. Teddy is a detective dinosaur, who is never seriously taken, but after having killed a dinosaur, he has worked for the case, but he must be a member of the most troublesome police, Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg). Matching is a match for solving this murder, and the time for audiences to stay awake is a bit longer with this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> Teddy starts acting as a normal image, but at the end he is overwhelming to hear. For some reason, the detective is also a bad comedian and a bad emperor. It makes imitations of celebrities and accents and has really awesome lines. Whoopi thinks she's thrown out and "My butt is not a trumpet!" Wow! A puerile and immature line, even for a child's movie. Whoopi is both annoying and annoying. Teddy hoped to wait for the full length of the film that he could trim the head. <br /> <br /> This movie did not know what he wanted to be. When scenes and futuristic actions occur, there is no comedy or humor. In any non-action scenario, the characters try to make them as enjoyable as possible, in direct live branding results. The scenes of the actions are not very rare or violent, and as we have seen before, comedy is just about to do with massive jokes. There's nothing here. <br /> <br /> It seems like a dinosaur / human detective pair is quite a favorite, but it's not anywhere else. Laguia! This movie is Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Replace cartoons with dinosaurs, and set it in the future, and it is the same plot. A man dies, a dinosaur dies. A dinosaur and a detective fixes the murder, killed and a detective fixes the murder. Roger Rabbit's badgers are Christopher Lloyd and weasels. Bad guys are here like those like Christopher Lloyd and those who love it. Jessica Rabbit imitates the scene of the Roger Rabbit club on stage with dinosaurs. A much better movie can be closed! <br /> <br /> In general, this is a bad movie, as it is not even worth the VHS height. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 ****. 90 min. Light violence, language and humor.
