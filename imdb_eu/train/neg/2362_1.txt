The first series was great, one of the best Horror films of all time. This is the best one. When I saw it, I was thinking about it as bad as the fourth and fifth, the predecessor would be horrible. The boy was wrong. Terribly wrong <br /> <br /> When I first saw those ten minutes, I was tempted to really get up, but I did not think it would be better. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not just a lie to the movie, it did not have any other drama, the last two (the fourth and fifth) were just enough! Also, how many times can Freddy bring you? TERRIBLE was the play, the story was predictable and rough, and it also had a flaw. The way that Springwood went was completely wrong. First of all it does not respect. To add it, everything seems to be absolutely superior. <br /> <br /> Some say that this movie was "fun". This movie is not "fun". When is Freddy Krueger supposed to be "fun"? I called it terribly. This movie is a horror movie, not a comedy. If there is a daughter of Freddy, would not this information appear in the first place? They were finally stupid and cursive, just like everyone else. This destroys the essence and the uniqueness of the former. It just shows itself. <br /> <br /> Wes Craven's start-up is a shame that is good, however, it must be dragged on the trash bin. He would not have to work on this film. No other tracking, except the third. Third, worthy of all follow-up. <br /> <br /> This was only a DVD and I did not get a set of Nightmare On Elm Street DVDs. I got it. <br /> <br /> Abstract: a pathetic and bad attempt at a sequel. <br /> <br /> - The whole MOCKERY of the first film <br /> <br /> So please do not waste it on your unused litter.
