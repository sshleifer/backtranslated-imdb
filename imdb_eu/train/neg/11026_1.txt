I just finished reading a book about Dilling. This movie was very wrong. As they did, they created everything. His robberies and journeys were well planned, up to the second: when it was time, they had all the money or not. There were notes on each road, where they could turn, etc. Purvis had never seen her at the restaurant, and Dillinger paid for lunch after leaving Dillinger. Purvis did not even see Dillinger, before Dillinger died, only his photographs. Gang members were fictional. Dillinger never steals a bank, like this one. Unless I have ever read the book, maybe I enjoyed the movie. The play was over in places. Too much action has been done In the second thought, no doubt, if I did not read the book, I'd like to question them a lot.
