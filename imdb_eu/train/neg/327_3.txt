As Sandler's enthusiast, please do not worry about this very depressing comedy! I bought this film at $ 7.99, assuming that at least half of it should be, because my husband Sandler is there and I suppose some women would be naked (wearing a R-grade cover and a few women with a cover). Well, there are little women outfits, but no one is naked. I do not know what Sandler's career was, but I think before SNL days. I can be mistaken. This is one of his home movies. Such a theater movie looks back and remembers memories of the best waves ... but we (audience) let dry. This is not nearly a "movie!" Sandler speaks with a camera and also admits that it is a "budgetless" movie at a point (this is not a low-budget movie, NO-budget movie). So our job is to make fun of laughing at curious characters. There is no stable plot, a large cartoon is like a comedy show, but raw and badly written. It was a bad comedy that this guy was totally annoying and was not supposed to receive that first generation. And does Sandler find his comic inspiration for Henny Youngman's classic "Take my wife, please," and say the audience on the floor? I do not even want to do any logic here. Of course, Sandler's current films are not familiar ("Billy Madison" penguin is "Happy Place" by Happy Gilmore, but the comedy works. This is honestly the work of amateur artists, and although you are curious about Adam's first days of the film, you are still not interested. You'd better check the start of the SNL, or maybe a bad paper with the "Mystical Nuts" section. Sandman, of course, is not the only vain actor in this rugged vehicle. Billy Bob Thornton looks short; Billy Zane ("Titanic") has an assistant and Burt Young's team (from "Rocky") plays an important role. <br /> <br /> This awesome comedy would probably be renting thirty percent to be part of your local videoconference rental - and therefore directly. <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (from 10)
