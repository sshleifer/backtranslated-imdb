This is one of the cheap TV shows. It seems that the characters lose their minds. The premise of the story is very good according to the son's kidnapping father's son. But the story seems to be believing. Whenever you recommend it to your mother, if she does not know her well, she will do well. It's quite far away and it's not worth seeing.
