With Debbie Reynold's tep-taps, tangos and, yes, tap-dancers through this ordinary thriller, significantly manufactured '30's atmosphere. When two women kill their children, try to start a Hollywood school dance school. The problem is, one of them is full of neuroses. Did you imagine it with 10 years in advance by Robert Aldrich, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford? Nahh, Bett could never have seen so much on the screen as Joan shook his stuff, and I can not imagine another role in Bette Davis, knocking at her heart. It's a simple piece of macaw written by a frightening Henry Farrell (the idea of ​​"shock" is to mass murder of a group of rabbits!). There is no ounce of honesty in the whole bundle. * 1/2 ****
