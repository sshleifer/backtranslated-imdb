Jack (Matthew Lillard) is not a stranger Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) in the old-fashioned studio of the collection and says Jamie (Valeria Golino) a poison-specialist and expert Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy his story, Jack owns and connects to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack offers $ 100,000.00 dollars for each one, "Spanish judges" in dramatic bargains with a rich and dangerous collector. Max invites the renowned Piece (Mark Boone Junior) acquaintance with the postponed girlfriend of Mars. However, Jack crosses the collector twice, and then Jack, Jamie and Piece. <br /> <br /> The "Spanish Judges" small budget is a movie with a sensible script and it gets a good result. Valeria Golino is surprisingly beautiful, but with the actress Vincent D'Onofrio, they can not save stupid stories. What's more, the scenes to be fun unfortunately do not work, and they're really stupid and they're not fun. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All money")
