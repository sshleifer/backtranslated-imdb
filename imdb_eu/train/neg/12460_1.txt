We surrendered to the point where George Clooney's characters pulled their fingertips. We were not in the trash - we felt what we were sitting in for an hour at that driver. The movie was incomprehensible, it was boring and cumbersome, he would praise it! How did people get to sit at a confusing, slow and depressing corner of a movie pseud, and even less name an Oscar? Clooney looked ill at the sight of him. What did he think? Oh ... and what was the subtitle? - We have just had a DVD or did such original films - phrases hanging in the middle of the air? This film was also hard enough to continue. I certainly do not cast it because it made the best possible material available.
