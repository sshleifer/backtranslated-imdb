Revenge is one of my favorite movies. Moreso, one of the favorite topics of my films, "the future of revenge." After seeing Gaspar Noeren Irreversible (2002), I expected a more important expression of this issue. Instead, the film is a half-half attempt essay that has not been attempted by the lack of film and essay. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The latest scene is a free non-violent male / torture scene. They found a woman who was less than a fantasy rape of revenge. However, the movie does not follow that. Instead, the scene drawn (which started as the graph of the FAR initial rapture and which ritualized), crowns Dawson's face repentance or "this is not stated." "It does not fix anything" while his rapist's rage continues in the back. <br /> <br /> The problem of this scene was not an accident, but it was a mixture of this graphic scene. to get to the audience. I mean, do we feel rapier? Are we rewarded by Dawson? Are we bored with all the brutality of all? Do we feel Dawson's moment of lightening clarity? Apart from failure, the movie is really curious, with more style than substance. Characters are thin, monotonous conversation, etc. <br /> <br /> Normally, I try to take films in their terms, but Originally it does not seem to be what they are. Thumbs down
