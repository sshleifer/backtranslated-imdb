SPOILER: The young lover Jed Kate (Andie McDowell) outlaws her voice because she feels badly that Jed has a bond with her two girlfriends. Kat thinks he has caught himself. Katek pulled out the footwear from Jeden by door. He leaves Jed involuntarily and then sits down the road to enter her shoes. Then, a truck runs (meaning "Shrink"). And he dies. <br /> <br /> "And then a truck is attacked by him." Do you think it is possible that a scriptwriter writes an item of script? It's a comedy until then, which wants to be tasty, but it does not look like a fizz. All Jed are annoying. And then Jed dies and they are all sad, at the end they will learn to love each other and be supportive, instead of destructive. I give two friends.
