This is a wonderful piece to tell the story. The film is about an hour ahead of what we suppose. The characters often murmur inaudibly; actions often do not seem to have a relationship between each other; Nobody worried about the little girl; twin children are scared to swim in awful scars, but nothing happens; The Irish pulled their faces on their faces, apparently without reason ... it would be boring to be as boring as the movie itself. The only fun element is photography of landscapes; But anyone could point out a camera on the outside of Australia to get a memorable shot. Overall - incredibly, inconsistent, unfamiliar - and totally annoying for the audience to lose so much time.
