The film seems to be an exercise in the work of the Coppola family. It seems to be the western "A" or "B". I mean, the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy in the name of God. William Boyd must die in the grave. <br /> <br /> All Western headings "B" are here. The heroine of the two-pistol pearl in the white cap, with the white knight "C'mon Thunder", with a black beard, heroine of trouble, cattle of difficulty, coward sheriff at the top. bad guys, etc. <br /> <br /> The performance, with few exceptions, is strictly Yakima Canutt School of Realization. Chris Lybbert (who?) As a hero and Louis Schweibert (who?), The wicked man seems to be at home faster than Poverty Row's 30-year-old home. Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins play a part with the distribution of veteran plays, but they do not do enough to save it. <br /> <br /> What was the sequenced frame by Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine? Did Sheen think that she was a fantasy character? What was the black gloves? It just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Being an excellent western lover of all genres, I tried to find some salvation features in this movie. Cinematography was pretty good and the settings were very real. Aside from the hero and the main criminals, the rest of the characters were real. <br /> <br /> Producers would revive Hopalong Cassidy's character, some thoughts that could be portrayed originally when written. The hand of the bull ranch in the wrists, with a shoulder chip, the part that would highlight the stretch of Lee Marvin. <br /> <br /> What else can I say but ... the thunder, a great man.
