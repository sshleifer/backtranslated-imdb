I am a fan of film art, but unfortunately, I have to plan to denounce this movie. Creating a mismanagement of a plot based on an unexpected premise, we will tell you how to try. I also learned something after the wrong movies or I enjoyed some aspects, but there is nothing to be appreciated. The premise is not an interest, but the movie begins and ends. The play is fine, although the characters were very boring. If the protagonist wants to have such a profound goal, he is very empty. Pity I enjoy non-film movies that I do not usually, but the lack of formula does not have to mix with zero.
