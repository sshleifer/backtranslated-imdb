Geisha's reminders have filmed a beautiful movie, there is no doubt. And the performance is very good, at least, as the characters write in the scripts. <br /> <br /> However, so many small and large details are just too bad to be too much. to be fully enjoyable. A small detail is a scene that makes no sense of this kind of sensitivity (this does not ruin anything) when it plays a bell that hangs on the door of the house that lives in Sayek, in the snowy winter day. It is a bell or bell that is called the bell; That is, hanging outdoors outside the Japanese houses! The people of traditional Japanese houses did not have a door - they opened the door and announced it. (You think this is so rare that detail, but I would say something similar to the Americans, where in July a Christmas flower hung on the door and nobody thinks it). The most erroneous hairstyles for maiko and geisha, that is Asian / Chinese / kung-fu-ish, and things like nothing. In my opinion, he takes a strange attitude towards the culture he is trying to portray in positions and portraits in people and situations. <br /> <br /> So I think we know less about the Japanese culture and the geisha and the Maiko world of Kyoto (that is, "Miyako"). Then you will enjoy it more. I honestly think that this movie could be much better ... "Exotic Japan" is just another version of Hollywood.
