As Marlene Dietrich was a great admirer, (at last) I had to see this picture very sad. Miss Dietrich's first film is the color and the most beautiful blonde in the world is rub! Bad start The story is boring, involving a matter that is bored by itself: religious blame. (Who needs it?) It is enough, perhaps, to say that everything from Dietrich's films (and I've seen most of it, including "Pittsburgh"), is the only observation that deserves its performance. Color photos are fine (this is Technicolor's first version), but with any purpose. Sharp foundry: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (enough to say?). John Carradin is a strange caricature of "The Sand Diviner", which announces that everything will happen. The "happy ending" is believed to be one of the depressed ones ever thought of. Does David O. Selznick have a reputation of renown (for example, has he ever done a good movie?) Another example? And, in the end, angry, MGM DVD soundtrack is bad, apparently with a volume level. randomized Very discouraged.
