Personally I hated that this movie was predictable, the characters were stereotyped, and the whole idea was the source of "The Cutting Edge" and "Cadet Kelly". <br /> <br /> It's a boy girl sent to the main character. It hates the whole place, and to make things worse it is not like it, a man who is apparently not a man who likes it (well, all the curses in the Ikastola can not stand up to you). It's amazing that he finds it in the right way, and everyone would like him to be more fond of him, that love falls in love with him. Then comes the chance, where you have to choose between skating and hockey. He chooses hockey and then goes to national skateboarding, and enters the Olympic team. There is no wonder. <br /> <br /> The entire movie was planned, you know what's going to happen before you see it. That was so scary, I almost fell into it, and I had the time I had finished, I had a terrible headache and I had to watch myself crap like that. Do not watch this for less than ten years, or really like a movie tricks.
