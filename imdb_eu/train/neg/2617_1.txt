This movie was a mere pain. In the theater, I was wondering when the movie started. There were all configurations; a typical love story, the characters must overcome their short periods, the evil ones must be released, but nobody has started. When these things happened, I was bored hard and the devices were completely effective. High voltages and construction needed in the scenes, felt like the necessary frames were cut. Kid's things do not have to be this way. Children's films can be as exciting as adults. Forgiveness, "hey, its kids for," is a bull. I will take the "Sword Stone" every day. That was horrible. I think Disney will write anything. As children, I saw that 10 years will agree ... just junk.
