A LIFE, LOVE A LITTLE is one of Elvis's most curious films. Part slapstick, part fluff, surrealistic and strange parts. Elvis finds herself a very off-beat girl with a vague voice. It looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story does not make sense as it happens with most of Elvis Presley's films, and there is not a bunch of strange characters. It's not much in music, but I do not like it, though it's not memorable. Strange tracking Elvis and Michelle Carey enter their beach home at night, but will be delivered a few minutes later and it's a daylight! What ?? That's the essence of the movie. What ?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks great and B) has stolen the dog show.
