Some of them here have commented that this WORST Elvis film ever made. Well, they are partially correct. For me, I DO NOT ENJOY NOW! Like this movie, I have never seen anything so timid and insulting against sin and human nature. Real embarrassment to Motion Picture Industry, this is not so bad, it's good. There is no fun and unforgettable, like in other films like Elvis Clambake. This is so rotten to sit through his pain. Pure garbage Native Americans should sue their stereotyped treatment. In truth, maybe all human beings must ask for crime and this movie likes to make all the species out of 0, seriously. Rating: F
