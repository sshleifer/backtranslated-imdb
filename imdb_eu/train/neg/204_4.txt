The perfect murder wife (Mary Ellen Trainor, once the wife of Robert Zemeckis, also addressed in this section), when her husband dies at the poker, moves because he has a misfortune to get a visitor. from the outside ... he fled from madness that was dressed in a suit of Santa Claus (played by a horrible sight by Larry Drake). She goes to life trying to find a way to conceal her husband's body. He decides to use an ax once he dies with the murderer who kills the killing woman, that is, to assassinate her husband's killing murderer. Santa kills her in a wardrobe and continues to be the daughter of the woman trying to freely try to save the child. <br /> <br /> THE PREVIOUS KRIPPET RECYCLING the old "Santa Killing" tired material. The matter is also used (added nauseum) while adding female murder-his-husband-man-man-he-cheat routine. In essence, Trying to find a way to prevent a body from killing Trainor, while maintaining a safe distance from mania. There is nothing more refreshing or new about this plot, because the movements make much more. Not one of the shows.
