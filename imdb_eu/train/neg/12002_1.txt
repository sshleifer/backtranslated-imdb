It's a sad sad film. I was sitting in the theater to break my hair, because we wanted to break the chairs we had in front, because it swore the movie a powerful scene one after another. And people laughed and asked me what kind of people they could watch to enjoy this horse. <br /> <br /> Nikkhil Advani has six stories without plot and no characters of interest. The script is sad, he probably drank writing this movie. There is not even one of those stories. Nothing new, full of conversations that you had heard and heard a million times before. One of these stories is not having a sexual partner as a result of the disasters that occur each time they want to do it. Is this really serious? It's not funny, not creative, but it proves Advan does not make any comedy anymore. Another story (probably the story that I was interested in) is based on human infidelity, which will also end in the old savitri pati-parmeshwar rough. I do not know what Salmaan-Priyanka is in the plot. There was no problem in the plot plot. Can Karan Joha not take the movie to Salmaan? Why can not she get married and still with her movie? or Advani and Priyanaka want to prove the world, really, that female actors have not succeeded in getting married or hiding in movies? The film with six actors, of course, Advani can not produce the entire film. So, the full use of the Times team sponsors, encouraging his Filmfare Magazine unbelievably. And, also, some of the weird jewelry that we all love women in the film! I come to the game to give the worst score and I am surprised by the praise of the movies. They show how Bollywood's dreadful situation and how fans have made it. There will be films like Salaam E Ishq, and more likely to succeed.
