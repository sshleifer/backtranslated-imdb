This story failed! In the end, Nell is heroic and the team has to save all the donkeys of Hill House and make such a nonsense! They added the crushed heads, the faces of the peoples were cut and the ceiling turned into a giant hand! What's the hell? I love and love the original movie, I read the book and I love it! The reason behind being the original movie and book is so frightened that you did not show any ghosts. There's no gore. There is no ceiling for your hand. Ghost advertisement is just a matter of actually killing a ghost person. He can not kill us, do not throw us around the room or knock it on our head. No, we can take them wrong. Removing our security senses. Nell was selfish. He wanted only good things to himself. Yes, it kept a little bit for others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont have embarked on this wonderful story! I hate rebuilding this!
