It's a movie-making movie. Such films may be entertaining, but they need a substance for that purpose. Here it did not happen, I'm afraid. Coppola did not inherit her father's abilities, unfortunately (she did not have any sister who could make films that could swear). <br /> <br /> I wonder how this film got good reviews. <br /> <br /> Let's see: the lead director, presumably the main actor, says that the squid is as significant as the frozen one and that his voice has the same tone, the main female actress has never had a face on her face. Changes, the plot is split completely split with single-link elements, the film's idea movie must be older than Palaeolithic rocks ... Did you find it enough? <br /> <br /> I repented at all times. I watched the movie. Walking with dogs is a very entertaining entertaining movie for these innocent people. Fran√ßois Truffaut's plot as directed by Dick Cheney ... <br /> <br /> Brazil, other SF classic movies? You really have to joke ...
