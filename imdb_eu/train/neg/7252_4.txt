THE DECOY is one of the independent productions that has emerged as a new feature, but it does not have the usual errors that most of these films destroy. It has a precise story, it has a good performance, photography is very good, hero and bad guy are two wonderful men, and the background music is not too much. This is a new version of the DVD, so people find out what it is worth to look for. I do not know where all 10 years have arrived, since this film is not good, even if you are the filmmaker's mom. <br /> <br /> The last movie we saw in the theater was a great book by Warner J K Rawlings, which was a great book of "Phoenix of the Order". If compared to THE DECOY with PHOENIX, keep in mind that PHOENIX (Warners) had no story, no doubt, the director did not accept the play, the photography was horrible, and the sound partition was a mere wall. I rated Phoenix "1" because it's not a smaller scale. DECOY is 4 times better - as regards. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, give DECOY an option. Remember that this is not "Decoy 3 - Shootout". It's original If your "10" stupid scores do not have any expectations, you may enjoy the movies in their own terms.
