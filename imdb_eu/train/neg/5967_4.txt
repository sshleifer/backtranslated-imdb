Think of the "civil servants" cost 250,000 dollars. What the hell did they spend 45 million dollars glorified music to make this video? Almost unknown throwback, two or three sets, if there is no special effect that I can not see ... I know that he had to use it with hand-crafted, economical and voltage-filled script. Shoot, this bar set has to be a cost. However, I think that Jerry Bruckheimer would not have killed any less to produce it. I'm surprised I did not light anything. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think it's not a scary movie. Women's managers had good chemicals and the soundtrack was good. IMO seems to be pity, the project could be minimal that could be $ 5 million without loss of production, and another $ 6 million worth of indy films could be made.
