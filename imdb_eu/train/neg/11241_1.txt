If you are looking for candy candy, you can try Sky Captain. Sky Captain is just a video game with live broadcasts. It's nice and interesting to see the whole movie. Now, what you have said, the images are good things about Sky Captain. I expected to improve this movie, but never got any interest. After thirty minutes he began to grow on foot. Now, I have more than 2000 movies and I've probably seen them five times. However, this is just the second movie I liked for my whole life. The three main performers are wonderful. Jude Law (also in the movie I wanted to go on) is the title role. I'd rather see Ben Affleck sitting on Giglien again than seeing Law again. The last article I read said that he was thinking of staying home and being a mother at Paltrow. After this performance, I would applaud this decision. <br /> <br /> Story --- Soap operas are better written. The Sky Captain story is wrong and continues, as it progresses. <br /> <br /> Management - none. Everything was put into a special effect on the story, acting and correction. Even though "Phantom Menace" plays a better role, and that's not saying much. Avoid paying for theater prices and wait until the video release.
