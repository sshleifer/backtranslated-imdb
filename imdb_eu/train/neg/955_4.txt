I do not believe that any player of Hollywood history has survived most of the weak films he had to make David Niven's incredible charm. He could activate it, he got an Oscar, but most of the material he made was as light as two-hundred papers. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it's a lovely case. It's a music, and most of all you will remember the dance of Vera-Ellen. You'll remember that Scot's costume, because it puts Edinburgh's movies at the festival. But if you remember a single song, you must have a photo memory. <br /> <br /> The plot is clear. Vera-Ellen is a musician in Edinburgh apparently emerging from the city. The choir starts one day later. He raises money from the charge of a royal card. Now everyone thinks they are millions. Doors open when opened. <br /> <br /> The millionaire is David Niven and he is with him and he is in a state of defect. Cesar Romero has some good times as a strong producer of this music. <br /> <br /> In the end, Happy Go Lovely was very light and harmless by David Niven.
