Did they use the whole budget to pay porn stars or what?! <br /> <br /> Sound effects, background music and general editing are just as bad as you would think about the performance of the movie for 12 years. <br /> <br /> Most of the operation was good considering the script ... "innocent virgin" played very well. <br /> <br /> Mutants have a very good look and that could really be a good movie with the right brain of the wheel ... but, unfortunately, for all those involved, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The left was better than this film and these guys did not even do it. There's money too! Okay, I did not rent a movie myself!
