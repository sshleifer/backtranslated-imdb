I would not normally write a comment online, but the movie I've ever seen is the worst. It has not only been filmed as a soap series ("Youngsters and Unstoppable" really shot by professionals), but it also has tremendous cuts. No action It is not wasteful waste. <br /> <br /> Here's an example: one guy wants to kill the main character as he fired for himself. So (after a lot of shit), here is the man who puts his sword in his throat and says "You're still dead." Then the main character says: "You killed me when I died. I told you the police are threatening me." So (killer), the guy (shouts) goes: "Oh, no ... I'm in the police !! !! Oh, my God." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Remember: this is the only example. I really can not believe that this movie really exists. So: if you ever want to see (it will go), I recommend :)
