Those who know the previous Cube movies know quite well what they can expect: captured room, paranoia, bad performance ... a small person trapped in a small group of trapped people ... However, it is different. About half of the film is made on the outside of the cube, where people can see people who see inside the cube (or at least five of them). He's dealing with the cube, but you're not really much more familiar than just covered in the first two films. Surely, there is an explanation, but it seems pretty bad compared to what he suggested in the first film. <br /> <br /> Cube Zero looks pretty cheap (like the ones in the past), and that's why it only highlights some of the room's. Also, I was quite sure that there is no danger that the actor will win an award in any future. They have brought cube traps in 1, however (which is why they are almost identical, I mean a bit of embarrassment). <br /> <br /> I know that many people appreciate the film and the links to the first, but I feel the contribution that is not really necessary for an initial franchise.
