First of all, there's absolutely flirting in this movie - Anthony or any other. These people do not flirt: they just do it. The first test of resistance is to carry out more than 15 minutes of violence and sexual perversion. It would not be so bad - I like hell, violence, and perversion like the next reviewers, but it does not just take them out of context. So you're doing torture and causes. Then we will meet Donna and become something different from the movie - not better - just different: a heartless image of a road. Comedy essay is lame, there are well-written and ample rehearsals such as Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (and some fans and drag queens). Everyone deserves it. The photo is intentionally de-mentalized, so if you get a disease of the movement (or really any type of illness) - this movie is not for you. Think of it, I do not know who this film is about except for S & M gay and both sex lovers, except those who do not have scriptwriters except those who have not shot themselves about indy movies.
