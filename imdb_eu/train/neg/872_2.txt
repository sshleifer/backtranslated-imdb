First, I expected the same lines as "Caged Heat" "Ilsa, Wicked Warden". Boy, I was wrong! This movie is not exploited in the 70's by any means, in the "chain" or "female jail" exploitation. Of course, the plot consists of a series of prison women, who wear streetwear (quite comical), but nothing happens. <br /> <br /> There is not much competition, no one tries to seduce or try to escape the doctor, and the prisoners do not do it. There are 2 shower scenes, they suspect that they just recycled footage, but the battle is not broken / no one is fascinated here - or anywhere for that matter! Without earthquakes, apart from excluding simple and simple characters, a couple of prisoners who try to escape will return to prison to release prisoners? !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> PUH-LEASE, the movie was about to end with the escapees at dusk ... to keep that mess! <br /> <br /> I feel sorry.
