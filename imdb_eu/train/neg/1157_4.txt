When I finished with The Tenants, I rented it with my great friend, Snoop Dogg, with its aesthetic appearance (a passionate fetish) based on aesthetic film. Of course, I did not expect much. Sechop Dogg, I think, would often include the typical set of behaviors and images that are often seen on video clips. However, my generalization was wrong. Unfortunately, this did not get a better movie. <br /> <br /> Most would describe the movie as a serious drama, but I would describe it as a serious dramatic dark picture. The film tells the story of two difficult writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg). They are trying to create their masterpieces. Their polar anti-life forms a complex and complicated neurotic friendship. This friendship is moving around the film as a wild wild mountaineering - most of which, with the help of Snoop's character, remembers someone with a personality imbalance that is a serious individual. And if the movie is a drama, Snoop and the company were more comedian with a morbid and serious tone of drama. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it for those who pay attention to this movie. This problem has many conversations and then many more conversations. There are fake conflicts, but there are more conversations. In the end, however, he suddenly surprised me. It was a bit twisted, it was an unexpected way to complete the movie to finish. When I saw the end credits, I could not imagine the image of the director, "Oh God, how do I end this snoozer?" By the way, the director worked on tips and subtleties that were clear, all of them more visible than Waldo, in the black sweater but only in the crowded street.
