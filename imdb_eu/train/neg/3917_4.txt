"The house of the spirits" is horrible. I live in South America, I live in a country that has been trying to describe the film as a military dictatorship, and although everyone knows that movies may be far from reality, this movie does not know and stupid. Things are not as simple and linear as they are here, and of course, the political process is much more complicated and more interesting in the "House ..." plot. If you can not show the complexity of the screen it's better not to make a movie. There are some examples in cinemas that are seriously considered in politics. In some parts, I felt Carmen Miranda appear on parsley and palms. When you talk about some things, you have to be careful and respectful to your audience's mind.
