Just like those of the incredible shows of "Hero", I wanted to see this bill of the same line, but it's better. He also highlighted an actor: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was disappointed with two things. I bought a DVD that was not seen this movie, and that was a mistake. It was not better. <br /> <br /> I realize that flying martial arts is a fantasy, but I believe that this story is far from unbelievable as it is unexpectedly shaken by myself. . Hundreds of opponents defeating a blind woman? Sorry, it's too far away. Also, the main character of the "Jin" (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so angry that his conversation, the stupid appearance of his face and the stupid laugh, also ruined the movie. <br /> <br /> A wonderful color and despite this amazing action scene, this story - for me - it's just an appeal to be the film owner! This movie is not my "Hero"!
