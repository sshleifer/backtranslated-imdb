This movie could have interesting character research and could give an overview on his subject, but the real problem is that this movie is not about that. It does not give a solution to the problem. "The old man" is just a portrait of sexual dependence and creates everyday everyday life and family problems. Why do you want to see it? It is totally useless and nonsense. <br /> <br /> It does not really help that the main character is under the age of 50. You can hardly identify yourself and feel sensitive to it. It sounds like a dirty old playboy, a constant hunting for women and sex. Every day has different sex types with different women and not just prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It is also not a bad visual style, although everyone feels a bit forced. But, nevertheless, it looks better than most live video productions. Who knows, if filmmakers have given a better material capable of working, the movie would have been better faith. <br /> <br /> The story is ridiculing at times. There really are far less strange grounds than they really suppose. For example, the entire Ordell line line. Things are worse, when the movie starts to end. Similarly, the entire story that is being told, the incidents and psychiatrists that are taking place between the main characters' sessions is a bit cheap and simple. <br /> <br /> But in regards to bad movies, regards. , this is not one of them. It's not better or worse than watching any other direct live-streaming movie. <br /> <br /> I still find it strange and quite surprising that Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. they can throw them like that. It's a simple small production that's as small as that. Apparently he was disappointed in work and in money. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
