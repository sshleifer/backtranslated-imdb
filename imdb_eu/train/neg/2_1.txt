I saw the capsule comment "great performance". In my opinion, two great actors are those who make tremendous performances, and with zero chemistry, the worst effort of one good director. Robert De Niro must be the simplest and most intuitive illiterate of all ages. Jane Fonda's performance will go unhappy on the map, clearly not about that character, especially since the character is so hand-written. Melase would be similar to the aggressive rhythm of this short film. Although the film aims to be a strong story about healing illiteracy, it is a real "joke". I give it from 10 to 10, one of the worst levels of money I have ever seen.
