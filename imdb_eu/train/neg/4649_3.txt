In 1957 (yes, the date is correct) J. Arthur Rank production James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; It must be a little comedy, right? Oh, it's just awful. Gag is a movie: seeing a crowd when they see a picture. The music is thrown out properly and without forgetting. Jeannie Carson is a vibrant dancer and a talented singer. But what did he do in this movie? Diana Dors is also here, offering so much bold shots to use for prediction. His performance is not bad, but he is in the movie to look at someone. Well, there's something to be done next to the groan during the movie. The e-Bay people are selling the movies at VHS today. Pay for expense and loss of time. A hilarious one without comedy. Music without a song or memorable dance.
