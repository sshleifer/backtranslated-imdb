Oh dear! Rarely a "horror movie" got bored or laughed at me, just like this. With the start of an urgent start with a great beginner, there is nothing more than a whole lot more, with supernatural and supernatural nuances. Alice Krige is usually wasted this great and is a playful performance on the plot. Do not worry if you really do not give up. Rating: 3/10.
