'Mojo' is a story in London in the 1950s, rock starry, violence and forced homosexuality. We use a 50-minute film-making technique called 'Mojo', often in films that emphasize the physical inequalities of our time, but also speaks of an excessively fashionable fashion (much like in films made at that time); I do not know if people talk about such languages ​​outside of these films, but films from nowadays do not use a stylized language. The swirling discourse of screenwriters of the 1950s is, therefore, a very distant country, which seems to be a common summary of the past; and therefore emphasizes a particular and non-universal story. 'Mojo' is angry with Ian Hart and Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner; The latter are struggling to build a post-spiritual journey. but it feels like a piece of time, structured in an incomprehensible old language by a modern film. Truly sad.
