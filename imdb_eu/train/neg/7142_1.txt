This is the most demanding movie I have ever seen. I expected a cheesecake, but at least with some beautiful cars / races. I've got nothing. The race scene is such a small budget so that cars can look "fast", in a single scene, Mercedes SLR runs from 2 to 2 in 4 seconds, circling in circles. It's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real movie about cars, watch the fast and furious series. It may be a bit of a letdown, but this movie is 100 times better than expected. You have just seen Mischief 3000 better, the best car movie I've ever thought of.
