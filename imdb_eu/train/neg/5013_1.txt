I do not argue anyone who writes this bad mourning, like the Jones theater in January, but check if you do not have the 'Mad Men' in the AMC series starting this month. It's great, as I throw it, I suppose I'm supposed to get the money "Tabu" , and he realizes what will happen if the wrong mistake is to become a minimal performer to avoid starvation, but that's the point, but I am (now) sure that I'm able to act. <br /> <br /> I was persuaded when I first saw "Tabu" His chance of giving his flat could be later on, such as luck, a significant revelation of his nature or plot, and he would not doubtless suggest that the change of at least 17 scenes might not change the pattern. <br /> <br /> Ironically ., "Mad Men" is a character that earns his performance, at least in his first appearances, very repressed, reserved, not sure. one color, unlike his "Tabu" role. As the television series progressed, the role of his mother began to flourish in the early 60's. It is not possible to wait until they see the nature of season 2. <br /> <br /> In summary, avoid "Tabu" like the hood, but definitely look "Mad Men".
