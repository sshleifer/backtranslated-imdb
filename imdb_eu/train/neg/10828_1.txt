This is not a judgment about this movie, but it's about it. Now I'm not bad here too, I'm not a Philistine, I do not hate the movie, because there's not enough 'police academy 9', or I enjoy more than the top brow. or arty stuff, swear. <br /> <br /> 'Magnolia' is poor, and I'm honestly mystified mixed why apparently so acclaimed. From the beginning to the end, nonsense, foolishness and nonsense, about what people really love so much. Some high-quality actors are quite reasonable, and no one plays an average or worse. Additionally, my wife (who acknowledged the confession of Tom Cruise hater) tells me that the best performance of her career is far away. However, the plot is so completely inadequate that it includes stories of different characters, so that in the snail's tempo, even when significant events are changing, they are so absurd and interesting that someone seems to be blinking or lying. . <br /> <br /> It does not help people who do not identify with people with very easy identification or empathy (I do not think so, but I do not like most people). Everyone has been playing stories that are very unknown to their lives for a long time, with very intricate details that reveal their moods and emotions, and their profound and meaningful relationships in the south. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack is awesome, so far, Alanis Morisette's music has a unique stunning quality. <br /> <br /> Totally pleasing, it was three hours forced. I have repeatedly seen a section of 'Friends', regularly on the ribbed upholstery-covered uterus. It's a bit good with the bug.
