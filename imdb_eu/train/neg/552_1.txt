I sat in a few episodes of this series and I could not take it anymore. It seems that I've seen dozens of chapters already, and then he touched me ... There's nothing new here! I heard Seinfeld's joke, I saw that one of those friends fell, Happy Days's story was almost the same story, and so on. Here is not one of the actors interesting! Some were good at other shows (not here), while others were new to the profession they never entered. Avoid this!
