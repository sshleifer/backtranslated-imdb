Well, I have to be generous and give this 2. This was mainly because this woman cut her breasts shirt for free holes. It seemed fun to me. In addition, this movie has nothing more to give a good friend. It's fun to miss the "mystery science theater" comments if you're ready for someone, but it's not better than 2. And 2 is pretty much horrible.
