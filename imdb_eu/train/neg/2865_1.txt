Overall, I do not have deductions, and since this site would give me this movie, I really hate 10 out of 10 movies. I thought I only saw the worst of Uwe Boll's darkness, but I thought I'd give it at least 2.5 out of 10 (Stephen Dorff did not laugh at me anymore, so I pushed grades). Compared to Hellrayne's blood, Bloodrayne would win an Oscar for the best movie. <br /> <br /> Now, on the plot, this movie is a BTK killer, but it works well, but they can not. they made it better. The outing looked good, but that was the fastest move I had because of the boring death. I like killer movies and even suck it, they can have some terrible deaths. I'm not a fantasy film expert, but he believed that it would be shot, if he had seen it. Sorry about walking, but nothing about it is good to say, someone seems to have taken a camera and shot it ... this catastrophe. Uwe Boll in your movies I have no longer taken to my worst film to take the cake. <br /> <br /> Well I can not help explaining the plot (if it was one), but that was the best I was. If you do not mind now, I'll explore a corner and I'll go back and forth and remember the movie that was terrifying in my life ... OK not for life.
