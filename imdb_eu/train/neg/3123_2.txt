I felt like I saw mine, but it seems that this movie is a fall in the family movie. Others, however, do not make sense, as others have said, it was one of the last films of Karloff and credibility is only on the screen. It's sad that the legendary stories of all horror movies of the era of sound have been at such low levels. Marjinalki, Boris got a little better than old Bela Lugosi, but not much. <br /> <br /> Boris does his best and is trying to keep that wrong. Sharper sharp backing does not help and shine at any bright moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican pieces are dubbed in a strange monotonous English style that reminds us of the kind used in pornographic films at the end of the seventies. <br /> <br /> I think that Edgar Allen Poeren's "Usher House" is coming out, but it would be difficult to find Poe to find plenty to find in the article. <br /> <br /> However, with Boris Karloff, there are a lot better among the best films, find and give this width, even if you do not want the curse of the "crushed brain"!
