First of all, this movie is not a "thriller". Nor is it "hard and hard". It may be script-based, but the slow pace of direction is difficult. <br /> <br /> The plot is very interesting and simple. Unfortunately, we only get that meaning after the end of this image. This is more than two long sequences that allow the musicians to play, with some scenes of action that is not viewable to the audience and revealing some of the "wicked vixen" scenes. I wanted to be a fast thriller of fast promise. It was a great movie. Instead, Spike Lee came to the end.
