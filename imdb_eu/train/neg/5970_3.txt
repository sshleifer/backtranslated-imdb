Coyote Ugly could be much more effective when filmmakers were guilty of a pleasure / exploitation movie when they rated R (with great bumps). But PG-13 grades are what the day of study is for everyone. It will end with such a movie: it will not be possible for the movie PG-13 "trousers" during the movie. <br /> <br /> The script is generic. It's easy to guess what plot plot will happen 15 minutes before actually happening. The play is right, but the characters are so thin paper that nothing can be done with them. I saw a short movie rather than watching music video at some points. <br /> <br /> The only active feature of the film is the feminine carriers. We'll see in some pretty and pretty venerable outfits ... but with the PG-13 limits, they can be displayed much. There are plenty of duplicities and noisy bodies and dance numbers with a good number of choreographed bodies, but there is no nudity or sex. Tyra Banks (with age is still more beautiful) is also in short time. The new player, Piper Perabo, is very easy in the eyes (and has a killer smile) and shows a real potential performance. <br /> <br /> The only ones who could watch this movie are boys. R-rated movies are not yet supported. This public can get a lot from a titillation party, but adult audiences will be angry and deceived. <br /> <br /> Rating: movie-1 women-10
