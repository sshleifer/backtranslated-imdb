This movie mixes music, love, theater and crime with a rather odd movie with a black sniff. Basically the pile of different genres is confusing, none of which is really supposed. <br /> <br /> This movie is an attempt to become more serious as the actress of Mickey Rooney. An early childhood star, he always began to enter the happy comics and music production at the beginning of his career. In this film he chooses another view (even though the music aspects appear in the film). But his role is quite straightforward within the film. I mean Mickey Rooney as a tough player? The look of the boy is very small. He's really been in the 30s already during this movie, but it's pretty much over 16 years ago. Listening to women and talking hard to their lover only looks and feels more than 3 times. Simply, he does not persuade himself in his role. <br /> <br /> Because the movie genre mixes so many genres, because the story is too bad. There, there is a plot of crime in which there is a romantic plot and your dream is to live, but it is not in any way carried out due to the approach and management it really takes. To see it is not an interesting or compelling film. The director, László Kardos, has made 10 films throughout his life, although his career ranges from 1935 to 1957. He has been the director of the hard work of the industry and only once. While there was less work script available. His films are unknown, and usually they are not of high quality. <br /> <br /> We must also forget that this film is in the 50s, but still some 40 decades ago. 30s. This is, of course, especially that this movie has been shot in black and white. Generally, the 50s and films of the 1950s are often cheap and have no exceptions. <br /> <br /> It's curious to see Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and his team. together in a sequence. There was no single feature of Armstrong, and they would often appear in these types of films, often as he did. This movie for lovers of jazz seems to me to be able to enjoy quite a bit of music, because there are many numbers in this movie. The film received an Oscar for the best original song. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney's shorts and exits. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
