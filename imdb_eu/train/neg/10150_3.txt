Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to be in this movie and had to play a part of Mexico or cancel it. Believe, he chose wrong! It was reported that after "Dodge City", Warners continued with Errol Flynn and his usual list of friends, such as Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Mc Hugh and John Litel. Miriam Hopkins Flynn, Randolph Scott, made a great mistake in making love as an interest in love, and as a singer to make things really bad, because he proved something, and that is not to sing. The story was not very bad, but with Bogie it was clearly confusing, it was a poor West, and with a low budget, but it did not help with justice.
