Pull up At Twin Cities, we have a "Big Bad Movie" show from Monday to Friday. Tonight's nugginess was a movie movie called "She's Back," with Carrie Fisher, that she really kills women when they enter her house. Bea (Beatrice) returns to go to her husband. He wants to seek revenge on his murderers, so he "retreats". And he will not rest until it's done. Reach it constantly ... and the audience! This movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Hey, I like even bad films (my fave movie is Xanadu). I really wondered about the whole movie, I wondered how they thought it would be a good idea for a movie. Bea is so annoying. Plots are senseless; it's a bad thing; story ... well, you are scared. Anyway, if you want to watch the movie really bad - really a very bad movie, check this out. You are not disappointed. Heh
