DR. SEUSS 'HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS / (2000) ** (seven) <br /> <br /> If you want to see a vacation movie, inspire your seasonal spirits and Dr. You will continue with the classic classic Fabia of Seuss. Do not miss "Seuss doctor" how to steal Grinch's Christmas. "If you're old enough to review, you're probably too old to enjoy this movie picture, it has a lot of colors, creative production design and imaginative clothing and clothing construction, wonderful noisy loads and characters in the Whoville Townspeople's fictional town. Unfortunately, the film ends with positive components, the rest of the products on Jim Carrey's screen are just an excuse, making the devil smile, doing very gymnastics, much without much. <br /> <br /> Many people know the story As a result, Whinxille stole Christmas as a result, so I will not miss the time to write a detailed summary of reading, but I would like to say that the story of the movie is taking place in three important actions: grinch and setting, Whoville festival development, and Dr. Seuss's view Who's Stealing Christmas average view, known in those credit but they do not have familiar faces. Like "Battlefield Earth", I do not know why producers would hire expensive actors to protect their identities from those who know makeup and clothing. In any case, SNL Molly Shannon is Betty Lou, wife of Bill Irwin; later Lou Lou, the father of Little Cindy Lou, who plays with Taylor Momsen. Jeffrey Tambor is the Mayor of Whoville. Anthony Hopkins gives a sour voice to the film's narrator, and Christine Baranski is a lover lost to Grinch. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers try to put the story into original unnecessary subcategories. Focusing too much on Cindy Lou. Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman's screenplay seem to be everywhere throughout the movie; There is little focus on the director of Ron Howard, and his script is predictable, very widespread and inventive. Here, the only person that makes the distinction here is Grinch himself, all the other characters are the puppets of the plot, of course and of interest. And the conversation is too loud and frustrating. For example: Grinch: Oi, who-mankind! <br /> <br /> The film-loving factor Michael Corenblith, Rita Ryack is a designer of costume and a large makeup series, an elegant production designer. "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a very good production. The atmosphere and atmosphere created by the filmmakers is accurate and imaginative; It's like a viewer visits a world in a dream. The people of Whoville are covered with makeup, until the point where we can not recite humorous lines to the actor. In spite of being fascinated, I can not really give performances; It seems that the expensive technical department remains its place. <br /> <br /> I can talk about Jim Carrey as an actor. Her work, which almost completely destroys the movie, is as egregious as Grinch, the excessive and comical one can be similar to Seitz's work to allow the story. Surprisingly, even though there are some fun moments, some sequences are passionately clear, it's not laughter that comes with Jim Carry's unmistakable way. Almost the reality is that the film was written as directed by Carry. This feature is a comedy movie that is wildly brainless, that is, only the pale shadow of the original Christmas classic "Stealing Christmas robbery." <br /> <br /> After this film, the historians should check the coffin. The author later dropped Dr. Seuss in his grave. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
