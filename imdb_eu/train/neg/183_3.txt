The action is from the West. James Steart drives all the work on the northwest scene. The scenery and the costumes are excellent. There are actions and adventures. Stewart plays a wealthy young man who walks behind a Stewart government. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is a cynical stereotype that has always become a hero. When this film was made, Cynic was a stereotypical hero, and a portrait by Stewart who has little passions to really save. He is pleased with his two partners, which gives him an extra dimension of credibility and credibility. <br /> <br /> However, for others it is so hard, it's hard to really care or accept. It is similar to the dimensions of a western spaghetti character (it is not so bad). <br /> <br /> However, the little characters are pretty friendly. Walter Brennan, Royal Dane, Harry Morgan and others are watching it worth it.
