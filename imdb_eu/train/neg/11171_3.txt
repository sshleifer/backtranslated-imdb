An out-of-date movie, a long-standing, unexplained sequence, retrospective and almost completely masculine. The two women that appear appear to have less than 10 lines and the only romantic interests of men exist. <br /> <br /> O'Toole is always talking; unfortunately, he spent a lot of time looking at the bushes. Alastair Sims is always glad to see it, but it also uses very little. <br /> <br /> The film has a positive side, because it describes many aspects of British fascism and faxism (such as, temporarily, the graffiti of Mosley), many people do not know. Many contemporary alliances of World War Two paint a lot and all Axis are evil, history tells us that people are much harder than this! <br /> <br /> This will be a good movie when you're on the lookout for the flu and you're on top of the sofa and you will not be able to get something complicated. If you need something stabilizing your electrolytes while passing through, this is your movie.
