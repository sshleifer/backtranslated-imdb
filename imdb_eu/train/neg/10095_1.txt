Someone gave this movie 2 stars. There is a great opportunity if you need immediate professional help; For those who do not pass 30 seconds can not see what you've missed. It's pretty scary. <br /> <br /> This movie ... well ... I think the horror of porn / tobacco is a type of essay without porn or I think there is no real jewelery (performance, drawing, story, set, dialogue and sound). I thought it was about zombies. <br /> <br /> Really watching is quite scary; It will be terrified that someone will come and you will never be able to describe what they are and they will go away to watch amateur video clips or something like this. <br /> <br /> I'm so afraid I'm writing this review on my mobile phone, so I do not want to lose more than the current 1.6 I'm trying to forget, so it's so fateful. I just got up. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've ever seen and I can say (heartfeltly) never made it happen.
