After seeing a high score score, I decided to watch this movie. Beyond the high score, I've avoided reading some of the reviews. I wanted to go to the theater with a clear slate, without knowing the plot or without expecting expectations. <br /> <br /> Thanks to my evaluation, I can see you were disappointed. I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I really liked the hotel manager as he tried to avoid entering the hotel room. When I got into Enslin's room, I was prepared to do some dreadful things. <br /> <br /> The first chocolates appear in the pillow and the toilet paper is bent. Enslin reacts in a credible way. It's wrong. I'm encouraged and I think myself, that's fine. People who understand this movie understand that it is less. <br /> <br /> But what happens next was a drop. Quickness is quick to move the preview to the near generosity ... Just blast the audience with all the Hollywood horror scams and hopefully something works. Let's see, a radio clock that blinks at it? Good, that's always terrifying. Objects moving in the room? Well, you can not complain about it. Do the walls and blood sink from the blood? Great Suitors the ghost Good Something more? What happens with noises, trembling, fires, tremors, room, more blood, etc. And everything has been done before. Attempt to overcome the deficits. Audience imbalance, all sorts of things quickly follow, and can not look away. <br /> <br /> Well, it did not work for me. And what else do you know about it? When I watch a horror movie in a theater, it is common for fear of listening to some audiences in moments of fear. But this movie has no horrible moments. The viewers were silent and disinterested. I did not feel my spine. Nothing The Shining wanted to give 100 centimeters. <br /> <br /> So, who are these people all one of the best horror films? Managing friends? Sorry, I do not get that.
