I am rarely the most outraged I've made with Ali McGraw as I had this movie. God is annoying or what! Everything says in the same tone and it's horrible, so horrible, in fact Ryan O'Neal is brilliant. <br /> <br /> There's no story. It's rich, it's wood, both need a lot of sacrifice for love. His father, Stonewall Jackson, is called by his name, in two cases if you did not pass it on behalf of love. <br /> <br /> The Oscar nomination for this movie has to be a bad year. John Marley is well with Wooden's dad, but can you help? At least Ali did not win. <br /> <br /> I still think that Katharine Ross should play Jennifer, but again, if it had happened to me, Katharine Ross would have much more films. Without a doubt, McGraw is a better actor. <br /> <br /> I did not cry even when it was sick, I never felt sad. <br /> <br /> I was glad that Tommy Lee Jones was looking at it for about 15 years, and it's a good score. But now this is so old; The beard has a long mile, and its sin is not old, but it feels it.
