The movie is too slow. They are nice, but they can not be really boring. You see a lot of emotions and a sexual relationship eating a melon and maybe a bit more. It seems also that someone might be interesting, but I think that I see for 2 hours I'm not funny. Although you laugh a lot, it's not enough, and maybe it's because of despair and credibility. The plot of the boredom tries to make imbalance when the film puts some video clips in the movie. Actually, the 50's are a colorful song of absurd songs, but it's hard to say exactly, and they must be so funny that it's so sad. Sometimes you feel that feeling can turn into something on the plot, creating a powerful scene, but eventually it evaporates somehow and that's it. Besides Klipez, there is hardly any conversation to leave music alone. The director wishes to be original and artistic. Personally I can not recommend the movie. I think art is something that must be boring. The film was around the project, which confirms my short summary.
