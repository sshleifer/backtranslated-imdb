Please, I can say, first of all, I was signed up with the IMDb that I felt very strong in this movie. And my review? This is the worst film ever I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film's summary was interesting: the Nazis, shields, time trips, etc. But the movies failed to bring it all right in the plot. Remember South Park's section, using handbags Family Guy to write 'idea balls'? Also these manatees wrote unholy? Writers were like those who wanted to add all these ideas, but did not know how to link them together, and then make things more meaningful, ending the subject of the trip to Donnie Darko-esquire time, the chronology worsened. . <br /> <br /> I could tell from the morning that the movie was bad. Special effects were a small budget rather than a live DVD. The performance was not very good, but I found it worse. I will praise the Nazi paintings, they were terrific, but the Nazi evil butcher was just comical. <br /> <br /> I do not make a revenge against this film or anything, but, in fact, I am not even in the horror genre. But the movie can not be described as thriller or drama. Had this story been a good idea, it would be a good movie. It has been over hyped. Waaaaay over hyped.
