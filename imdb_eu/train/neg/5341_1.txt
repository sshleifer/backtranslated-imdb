Well loaded with an actress, I expected much more than "Delusive" delivery. The land is very artificial and manipulative. Many flashbacks add a mix. Credibility comes out of the window and becomes unbearable and completely ridiculous at the end. I would recommend anyone interested in film plots based on what is possible at least to avoid "False". It will make you frustrated. Maybe I'm not getting enough, but many of my suspicions have been completely mixed up in the story and, above all, by the end. The blurring of the line between reality and lies does not work, because all the movies do not make sense. - MERK
