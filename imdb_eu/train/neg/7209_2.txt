I became fascinated with cartoons at the time the university came back. "Get Smart" has a great charm. Even if it was a mistake, it was quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Of course, he was very interested in watching the movie version. I saw that before. I have never had to make afterwords. <br /> <br /> If everyone was wrong in the whole world (who was on the ground, though Broderick was in the role), he just did not grade it. <br /> </ p> The effects were reasonable and maybe the only thing I liked was the movie; Watching a live action show! There was a lack of story and treatment, funny or charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> It was an original cartoon, it was very bright. It was fun They became frightening images and took the FAR seriously. If it were a serious or wonderful plot, it might be nice to look like "cartoon in the movie". <br /> <br /> It does not seem to be worthwhile in part. "Legacy of Gadget".
