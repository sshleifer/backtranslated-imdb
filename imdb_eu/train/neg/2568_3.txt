Dear ... Peter Sellers has been one of the most curious talents. But his selection of films, for example, after 1964, was incredibly wonderful. He did not realize how to use his talents. It was better to work with more Kubricks in the world of cinema. Later, I was amazed by those who watched the "Nine Elms optimists" and "Being There" from the movies. <br /> <br /> That said, Boultings and Sellers have done some movies before. This is not a bad thing - I have to see "Carlton Browne" and "Top Heavens". - Using at least Sellers in the sense. But the movie "The Girl My Soup" is a bad movie, and it's a bad thing to do with Sellers. In his 1955-64 films he is usually very twisted and always thinks he's enbaxmatic. Here, Peter Sellers are trying to play a typical romantic lead. Almost vendors play Niven Cad without a jealousy. He certainly does not convince him, he can try it as well or create an interesting character. The pieces that had been left by the creators of Cary Grant had to leave, and focused on those famous, dramatic and comical celebrities. <br /> <br /> Here and Sellers really do not set any real chemistry; The best-loved William Powell and Myrna Loy is not such a love. It seems to be very artificial, all the way - I know that the fact that Danvers is a woman is a dry woman, but she does not really change it, as she convinces. Sellers also have a very nice way to "charm" ... this character has no depth, and does not really have the sympathy or interest of the audience. Sellers continues to think that it would not be able to remember the greatness of the iconoclastic spectacle of "Lolita". <br /> <br /> There's really nothing to say about land, directions or characters. In fact, they leave little or no impression. This is an anemic, pleasant, wrong and dull film I've actually seen. Sellers' undeniable talented "vehicle". <br /> <br /> Rating: - * 1/2 / *****
