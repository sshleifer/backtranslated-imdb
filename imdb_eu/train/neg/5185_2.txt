Total loss of time <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a waste of time. The script and the interviews are poorly written, the direction is short and the performance in the hammers. This movie was clear from the Rang De Basanti crowd but it is still a long way since there is no element that does not have a brand. RDB binds its audio-visual script, superb performance, good direction and a powerful social message that has never been preached. <br /> <br /> Compared to the closest to the master bedroom, Halla Bol goes back one step through these scenes. on the Persian carpet's damned heroine and the guardian of the hero looking down at a truck. All of this could be acceptable in the 1980s when the quality of the film fell and DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante fell, but the films became increasingly subtle and thought-provoking. <br /> <br> Rajkumar Santoshi is a director and I think he does in every movie that wants to send a social message, but he may not know how to do it! He wants to deepen the audience intelligently, to understand what he means. Perhaps he should pay attention to entertainment and Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khan should leave social messages. <br /> <br /> Although you do not agree with what I say, I agree that you will be in full screen. Rang De Basanti thought it was much better, and Mr. Santoshi had to leave the industry with Om Shanti Om. Industrial Bashing? That's Santoshi, who represents the backdrop of the industry, as a framework that combines with a stellar stellar witch-bitch and a strange custom. Some people think that these parts show the true face of the industry. Do not believe everything you see! <br /> <br /> With all, raise your voice against such films and do not spend your money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> * outside ****.
