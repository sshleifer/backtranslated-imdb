I loved this movie as a child, but I saw it again 20 years later, it's really awesome. Up the Academy could have been before 1980, but now it does not offer anything! Caddyshack and Stripes films are now much better than this dogpile. It's not T & A. Thousands of times we've heard a million times. <br /> <br /> I recently bought a DVD that was a jewel that I thought was a hope. Well, I was WAY off! The soundtrack only featured 2-3 episodes (not others mentioning the smasha compilation) and often voices were awful. The only thing that was interesting to me was the announcement that the lines of the character were before. Yes, I saw the movie then! <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm writing this review is the forgotten one of my two cents for forgetting to say hello. :(
