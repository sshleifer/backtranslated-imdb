The new version of Tim Burton's "Planet of the Apes" (and Charleton Heston) is a far cry from the original quality and plot. <br /> <br /> Certainly, special effects have been improved. In 1968, but no writing. The characters were boring and the conversation was awful. I watched the whole movie with a friend (with a friend who happily rented only) and completely understood why, before Christmas, all the Target "Apes Planet" were in a toy. <br /> <br /> My advice to Tim Burton: do not put this in your curriculum. <br /> <br /> My advice to others: watch the 1968 "Planet of the Apes" movie.
