Oh, god, what a horrible movie. There are good people in the movie, unfortunately it's not worth seeing. I only downloaded at the local library. If I paid to see it, I would be even more annoyed. This movie is not visible. How could Tarintino film become involved with a slow and nondescriptive rhythm? It is not surprising that he did not distribute many, all those involved had to be ashamed. I can make a better movie with a dated camera and my big toe. It's boring, I hate it. Tarintino got lost in my eyes. This joke must be sick. Do not worry about this movie. If you even touch one, you must see it, kill it.
