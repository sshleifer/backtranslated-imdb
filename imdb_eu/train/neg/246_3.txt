It is a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's "Mysterious Island". Sound editing is pretty bad. You hear the set conversation and you hear voices recorded in a recorder at the same time! She is an amateur film-maker from Boston, and has filmed around New Hampshire. For those who live in New Engalnd and for those who are reading this commentary, W. W. will be a chapter. W. This film has many bugs. Directing the director's voice and listening to the actor's directions. "OK now, get up." Other people. There is a guy talking about himself and a blue man talking about this foreigner. A stranger guy speaks with a deep voice. When you fight or are fighting, you will hear the voice of the actor. As for special effects, man! This was Brett Piper's initial work, shouting! The creatures are good but the animation is cheerful. Really jerky Like Karl Zeman's animation, JOURNEY TO BEGINNING OF TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. Thge is a good music. Bottom line, this film looks like EQUINOX or PLANET's DINUSAURS as epic Ray Harryhausen. Did you know that the MYSTERIAN PLANET was a shoestring budget for the home movie? Must see what's needed for filmmakers.
