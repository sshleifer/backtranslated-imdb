This movie is bad. I do not mean "bad" "The script was wrong" or "Acting in this scene has been a bad thing" ..... I am sorry that someone should be misunderstood for the public that does not turn this giant stack of public bundle up. I have not given any dignity (explanations) with an explanation, if I refer to that. I can think somewhere else in a few 40 years I've watched the movie. In my spleen movie. I mean, ultimately, nobody is guessing it's a bad movie, right? Well, yes. Apparently ... and the culprit is Ulli Lommel, writer and director. But the worst blockbusters really rent this customer! Find out Leave where this penis is. Stuck in the shelf, which gathers dust.
