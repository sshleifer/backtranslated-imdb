I respect Alex Cox filmmaker, I really do it. At first, it's as hard as a baby at school to be "different", a punk rocket literary, with more than his feet spaghetti western and science fiction and franchise franchise, and get out. to be ready to take the world ... but then you can see what it can really do, talent and culinary delights and talents that are innocent moments and what you need to be prepared. . However, he is among the two sides of his coin: he can really make it out of the park (Repo Man, Sid & Nancy, Walker arguably) or just try a little too hard and pull them way out of a lot more than rabbits (hell directly ). Death and the North enter the final category, and I respect (especially) the original vision to face the story of a killer detective; In addition, his face falls and his curiosity becomes dull. <br /> <br /> It's a rather strange and unpretentious style: a detective, Erik Lonnrot, has made a murderer with a hell voice, Red (something), and it seems that the murderer is leaving a disturbing trace of his victims: in the walls The message is written by Alonso Zunz (Christopher Eccleston, as if Shallow Grave did not change its appearance), and Kabbala is of great importance. Lonnrot continues his case, and his tracking methods, for example, are on the map for the first time in the triangle and then the compass, which is the protests of Treviranus, the curatorial (Miguel Sandoval) protests. He went back to the flash-forward desk and talked with the audience about the sad details of his former staff and coworkers, but after that. <br /> <br /> Oh, Cox has moments of his creativity and interest. We can see, for example, the entire field of Ecclestone in the depths of the right pole ("For his protection" if Lonnrot loses the wrong room) and after a long period of follow-up, perhaps the best or the strangest thing, which leads us through dark corridors with very few directions. We lose it in the maze of turns and curiosities. And it's never something fascinating, Miguel Garzon's cinematic, delightful. But the plot is made through hoola-hoops to keep things moving and at the same time fully compatible. The performances, safe for Boyle and Ecclestone, have been kept very well, they are very bad, especially when Sandoval returns to his seat with a delightful conversation to talk among audiences. <br /> </ br> </ br> </ br> </ br> </ br> <br /> <br /> </ br> </ br> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> </ p> </ p> <p> What is the conflict here? I never had Boyle started with his personal mission, and I only captured some of the glittering killers (and / or killers) in the building that pleased the building. an amusing kamei). On the other hand, when Boyle and Eccleston were building in the Southern section of the city ("not as big as you think"), something spectacular, "TWIST" has begun. We know in the back of our minds, but hope is not waited, and it completely disintegrates the mystery that has passed its head. As regards all of the astonishing ones as Cox's filmmaker, by contrasting with the "consistent" people, in a contradiction, I am confronted with Death and Compass, and finally the stem of the brain is cut; it's masturbation.
