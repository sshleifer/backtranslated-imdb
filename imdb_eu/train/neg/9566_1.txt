I see a lot of movies. You've watched the original wargames a few years ago and I loved it. The computer is still a "great mystery" for most of us and the movie can be convinced. <br /> <br /> This is a small budget on Wednesdays special night. Full rough, from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The earth is so weak, you will not believe it until you see the movie (I would not recommend it first). I can not cite an actor who made a good movie. But yes, I would be surprised by the script that could make a good job. Many scenes of Klixe. It looks like it looks CGI '86 versions. <br /> <br /> Well, no, that's why I'm writing it with great enthusiasm. Ignore this movie. <br /> <br /> Life is short when watching rubbish movies.
