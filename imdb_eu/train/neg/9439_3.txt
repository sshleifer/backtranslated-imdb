Twist ends can be really cool in a movie. Especially interesting is that it is in the wrong turn, but we do not pay attention. This kind of birth is what causes people to think. Then we have a rotation like this one. It turns it over, paying attention or not, what happened. When this type of random turn shows, instead of shock, it is a stunning reaction. This film begins as an interesting horror, but about 20 minutes it's just a boring conversation and stupid turns. <br /> <br /> Three young women go to a concert, so they miss to travel through the woods and stroll through the tree trunk. They end up in an old lady's house that hates men and her daughter Marion will greet her daughters (Laurel Munson). Strange festivals occur when the girl stays in this house for several days, as well as going home or going back home, and turns it into a mutilated male suspension. <br /> <br /> This movie is also caught in the conversation. And it's always a few characters. We have the three main girls, the scary senator and the old lady, and an important interview does not go beyond five decades. To make matters worse, they never say anything of interest. He is really angry that he is sitting across conversations. We want to know what is happening and instead speak and speak and speak (nothing). <br /> <br /> Plot holes are numerous here. These girls are three kilometers away from the place where the car enters the car accident ... wow, three miles! It will kill two hours or less. Why did not they ride with the housekeeper who was driving the house? He had a single seat? They never leave girls to question each other and they are unwanted, rarely looking at each other. Why should so many dumb birds be? Maybe the answers are boring. <br /> <br /> Having a Slasher movie with five characters, it's really a bad idea. It's not exciting, it's not terrifying, and the end is definitely, but it's definitely dumb. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 ****. 79 min. R nudity and violence.
