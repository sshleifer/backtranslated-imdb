That day, I remembered seeing the Nintendo Power comics like that same show like this show ... and then the word appeared to me that this show came next to me on TV! I was not static, but curious ... I thought it would be bad. All my friends have said that this show has no real meaning and very absurdity with live people (I am really gay), so I decided to see the show with little hopes. <br /> <br /> WHAT? HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!! First of all, I hate new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so muted and I hate how to make so many fanboys jumping with Tiff, it's sad. Likewise, I like Kalasaki Chef (or whatever its ordinary name) was a guy who owned a restaurant. Bad move, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is just a fake adviser to Dedede King (which is a horrible time in this show) and I hate that company's face that Deded continues to supply Kirby with. So stupid, I hate this show. <br /> <br /> Then, I started hating Kirby, even if Nintendo clearly became Kirby's reputation for just some unpleasantness. Kirby never marches Mariori in the fight for freshness, and Kirby will always be a tiny full of gayness creams. NUF SAID !!!
