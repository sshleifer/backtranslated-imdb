Comedy, drama, fantasy, what I could expect from a science fiction genre was not entirely certain, but I thought it was given by the actor involved. The tone of the movie was poorly felt, though he went through some patches of each genre, but he never felt very balanced, so I finally tried and cinematography and individual performances. There was little in depth about the nature of the story (nothing will be given here). I have to say that they have felt much more than 96 minutes in length, and not in a good way. In the end I was looking for a close, it was a measure of satisfaction but I did not expect the light or simple piece I expected. I think Tony thought what he was doing at the end of the movie ... but it was a tragic mistake to validate the previous 95 minutes with the wrong conclusion. I'm finally disappointed. The IMO would be better to stand up as "the end" as part of Art ... just. Or ... The point may be totally lost:
