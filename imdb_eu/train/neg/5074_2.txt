Two weeks ago I saw the movie in Paris at the "Paris Film Festival". Although I did not expect much, I must say I have to be disappointed as many people in the audience ... If I want to feel like that, I would say I compare that. princess mononoke and nausica from beginning to end. Of course, it's a fool. But I could not help that. The stories are very different, but the images are very similar to the world. From this perspective, a "palm tree" can not be definitively compared to Miyazaki's masterpieces. Although technically quite good, it's still boredom ... at the end, I'm sorry for all its lack of dreams that I'm not careful to watch. I value 10 to 10 (I think it's worth 3 or 4)
