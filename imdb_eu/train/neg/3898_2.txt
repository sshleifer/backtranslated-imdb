I'm sorry, I know that Fa√übinder is still one of the world's foremost military executives, and most of his films are "mastery", but when I see "Lili Marleen", in 2004, I asked what's all about what's happening in this movie and what's outside! It's just a daunting operation: Hanna Schygulla smiles like a fool! - The changes between Nazi glamor and battlefield are hilarious, as if the whole movie looked like it was in a two-day chamber. Probably this was the case and many people seem to be "real art", but for me this movie is bad and cheap. Compare Viscontis "La Caduta degli Dei" and again "Lili Marleen" is a good movie.
