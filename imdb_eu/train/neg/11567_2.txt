I decided to keep track of this series after weeks of BBC termination announcements. Though I do not like the likes of Alan Hollinghurst (I like fans, but I think the case of the Emperor's new outfit with the author's work). I admit that it is very good to admit, it is beautifully shot and it was reasonably entertained - however, I saw that the story was very thin, and seeing all three sections, they feel that this production does not feel very much. The media sexually sexually explicit "sex" was made on television - many times - so I'm not afraid of being very accidentally. I'm afraid to keep the story / content for the whole brand for production values.
