This movie was disappointing. I was looking forward to see a good movie. I'm a kind of person that starts the movie and does not end up turning off, but I did not force myself to shut myself off. <br /> <br /> I do not turn off the only reason I'm a Christian Slater fan and I wanted to work on it. I was really speechless when I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. Thank you Christian Slater for putting a little bit of humor. If you did not get this movie I would get bored. <br /> <br /> I also agree that Anthony Hopkins needs to embark on himself. When I finished the movie I did not get it on the plot. I was both confused and annoyed.
