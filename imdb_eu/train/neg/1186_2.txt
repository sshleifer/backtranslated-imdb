Walerian Borowczyks La Bete (1975) was received in different ways. Some were surprised, others were surprised, others bravely applauded. However, I was totally touched, bored and I can not stop asking why the visualization of incongruous images blurred around an orbit around a power station is regarded as an intellectual journey. <br /> <br /> What was this movie really like? Growing sexuality in a woman? I've seen some great movies on this topic, but it's not one of them. How to try to portray a growing sexuality in a girl, unless she describes it as a character of at least one person, just as she dreams of animal dreams (naked). Where there is no character, there is no character test. A woman with a beast was not a teenager, with a woman with black vines with her sex (or beasts too) she has a very positive attitude towards sexuality; So where is consistency? Is it a film about religion? Yes, of course, we should have a thematic material that is not a function, character, or charismatic priest, but with a strong desire for both young men. <br /> <br /> Is it about bestiality? The metaphorical feeling of the film prohibits realistic analysis of bestiality, especially because realistic analysis demands realistic characters. So, there is no real bestiality here. Some mythical beasts and two priests speak together about the sin of bestiality. An essay on students would be enough about the subject? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Is it a sex? Is it something I do not know. I only know that shooting a shot is not a film that makes war movie. Acting on the topic must be more than just associate organizations associated with the topic. <br /> <br /> So look at the controversy. Do not be afraid of horror, nudity, ejaculations, masturbation and things. I'm not. Look at other stories, and you will notice that this is wrong, poorly edited, misunderstood, really badly written (okay, some images are quite nice and the main character is really good.) A brain of a director of an honest thought made over masturbation will make the story a smart one. It does not. It's boring.
