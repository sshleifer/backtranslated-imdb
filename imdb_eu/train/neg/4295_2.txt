AIDS and a tragedy movie is depressing and boring. He is very slow and predictable and continues throughout the movie. I look forward to collecting it, but unfortunately it has never been done. The play is correct, but it requires a lot of writing work. And if you seek nudity, do not waste your time with non-hot actors. Due to the lack of sound quality and titles missing, I lost the movie 1/8. If you have never seen more than five gay films, or have you recently agreed that you are gay, maybe you will find an interesting movie; Otherwise, it's a short budget short film. It's one of the worst gay movies I've ever seen.
