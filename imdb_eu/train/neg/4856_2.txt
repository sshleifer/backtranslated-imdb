In my whole life I can not understand the hype and devotion about this credible reality ... and I think that we have titles ... The Old Special Operations I am a soldier for 14 years of "life style" ... This movie was totally unreal and the army When he undertook little research in his life, he wrote somebody who did little research in the fight or group or ball. <br /> <br /> Three boys EOD trouncing around Baghdad on their own ????? Get real ... Is not the command string ????? Get Real ... EOD to clean buildings ??? Get real ... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper Serbian Buck Filed? Get real ... Wait ... I missed a bad guy and killed him and then the two boys took me away without firing or firing any wound ???? Get real ... I'm a civilian in Iraq, carjack, I'm armed with only 9 million, while other civilians break into the house, get their wife punked back in the middle of the camp without bumping into the middle of Baghdad at night? Get real ... <br /> <br /> There is not absolutely any military protocol in the {Armada} and there is no similar unit to any army I have found. EOD is completely incredible and respectful to EODs that are not against this bad movie, they are not looking for yahoo savvy adrenaline but very skilled professionals work hard.
