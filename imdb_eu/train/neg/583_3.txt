I bought the adaptation of this adaptation, Anne BrontÃ«'s novel, when I read it long ago and I usually enjoyed the BBC drama. But I am very disappointed that I would think it would be as bad as ever: the whole series laughed at me much more than moving to the novel. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, music (and songs) seem to be completely out of the ordinary in an old drama (as if it were a sound written for contemporary horror film) and as a comment, I was particularly angry that the camera turned around and turned the actors. In this way, I have seen some scenes that we shot in "The North and South" and frequently appear in Tenant, but it is definitely annoying. Camera movements can not be a living wood. Most of the second task was difficult to distinguish at the beginning and the script was unclear. No first character was ever entered correctly. The boy gave a very good performance, very cute and the best feature of the film. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS Tara Fitzgerald's characterization of Helen Graham seemed cold and hard, without emotion. It seems we did not get into a realistic way. I could not believe Markham had fallen for himself and I did not mention his hairstyle. I could not feel my husband's feeling! I liked having married so many husbands ... Besides, he was the only leading actress to me. I found Toby Stephens well, her brother Helen Graham was not very good. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps difficult to adapt a novel about evil issues such as alcoholism and cruelty. Additionally, only the imagination of the reader's book is revealed in TV adaptation: some scenes are comic and raw (when Huntingdon's eyes begin to bloom) drama! I mean, is it not in the current dramatic scenes in the former?
