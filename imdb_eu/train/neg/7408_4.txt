I do not know why I clicked on a "spoiler", it is honestly enough to find out if there is not enough explanation in the movie for what is supposed to be a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Well, except the guns mask of the 80s. I have said that I did not see the Lordi team before seeing them, nor did they even win Eurovision. Apparently monsters are members of the group. Whatever However, I did not know while I was watching. I thought the monsters / demons were especially good. More or less. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure there is a semi-consistent explanation of what we see on the screen, but maybe it's better I do not know. Probably, they've been really awful. The action is quite disturbing to keep the audience entertained, even though half of the entertainment is playing on wtf jokes that the movie is exactly happening. <br /> <br /> I gave him four layers above all, I got a good laugh, especially as he explains anything. It was my mood, but I found it fun to find some reason. Then I look at the movie on the Internet and NOBODY does not know what to think about. That made me feel better, and the score got me in the middle of 10/4. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, or it's particularly consistent, but it's pretty enjoyable in both visual and sound. In general, essential but visible. Do not expect too much, and do not expect to be sensible and if you are in the right mood you will be entertained.
