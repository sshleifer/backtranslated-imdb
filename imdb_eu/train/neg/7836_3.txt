The first episode I thought was a fairly high bar. William Hurt acted as a successful man hired to kill a machine. We give little information to his character or someone who is paying for death, in fact, the section did not have any conversations. When he returns to his modernist house, a toy soldier will be given a package, which gives him a smile but he discards and goes about his business. But there is a night of hell, the soldiers are alive and they are driving against the war, driving the jeeps, shooting guns and bazooka and the helicopters too! Special effects are good for television and it is very compact that prevents the apartment around, in order to survive, sometimes with your hand and others. I will not finish until it ends, but it's enough to say that it was a little joke. This gave me the other expectations of the series, but I was very disappointed, the other episodes were trash and I lost the fourth interest. Stephen King's adaptations are always mixed bags and these are no exceptions
