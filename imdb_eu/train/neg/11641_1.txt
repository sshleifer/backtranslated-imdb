Despite being a well-defended movie, I do not restrict myself to movies that run away from those borders, and I often enjoy and accept movies that are "breaking the rules". And truthfully, Pasolini directs the rules set by cinema. But it does not seem to me to be able to break it down at all times. <br /> <br /> The work of Pasolini is visually confusing, but this is not what it's really about what the screen is. Filmed, and his movie's sauce is less than the artistic selection than the cinematic amateur. This is DECAMERON. Pasolini often preferred to use non-actors, and many directors did a great job, but under the direction of Pasolini, non-actors remained uninhibited. This is also true of DECAMERON. Pasolini often includes images designed to visualize, deceive or confuse audiences. These elements can often be used with surprising effects, but, in the hands of Pasolini, these elements rarely seem to give anything to the movie. This is also true of DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> There are many people who love or admire Pasolini's films. However, I have never met anyone, and I have never read anything about Pasolini or his work, I understood the reason for this pleasure and admiration. Taking into account only his work, I think that, basically, he was a amateur director, because he had "no rules" with no skills, and he applauded his intelligence today. "Existential courage", which confirms bad habits as filmmakers. I find his job boring, impressed and pretentious. And this is also true of DECAMERON. Unfortunately, in every film of Pasolini, it's true that it has been my misfortune.
