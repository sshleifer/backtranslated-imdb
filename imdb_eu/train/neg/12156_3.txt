Jesus Christ, I can not believe I've lost sight of this movie. I only saw Jordan Ladd's delight. But watching this movie almost takes me away. This is totally awful! I would see the survival page 93 on top of it. <br /> <br /> The line was so gentle and general. I'd love Mizuharu Misawa Tiger to make a dirty driver dirty from the glass window. I was annoyed when I was telling each "river" and "booth". I would shoot my head. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Jordan Ladd was wonderful. A true angel. But he could not keep a joke of a movie. Unfortunately, he could not finish the truth as he came out of his head when he had taken the medicine. He thought it was fun. <br /> <br /> I also loved Jordan, where Jordan unleashed yogurt. He reminded me ... a time like never before. <br /> <br /> From now on, watch this movie as incredibly horrible.
