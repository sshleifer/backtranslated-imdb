This show is awful, jokes are awful and worse. I'm one of those people who was not a fan of Corner Gas. Initially, I liked the second season for a walk like I liked. They joked all the jokes and the characters did not have anything. Well, first, it was a good Corner Gas, a great CBC comedy on Little Mosque Prairie. From this section there was no great comedy to do. Who are the people who see this show anyway, I'm honest. or maybe only those that live in the cells? Maybe they are jokes for them and they work in it? I do not know a single person who likes this show and I can not resist myself, jokes can be fully predicted and characters have been less developed than Corner Gas. Fortunately, it will not last much longer, because the success of this show is based on this show of being Muslim, it could be a great spectacle and perhaps / perhaps.
