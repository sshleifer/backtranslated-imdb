The Supreme Team are three children, Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Captain Skate Lad, all with their own source of war (buza! Chika! Woopa!) And dress and move. They worked for the governor, Kevin, and they met when they wanted to play and play heroes. They also lead to normal life and have family and school responsibilities, but most of them go away from school-based criminals. All criminals have special and singular characteristics, such as Mister Vague and his men, who never know what their plans are, but they still work. They need to find the evil and baron from a malignant robot and stop the wickedness, and often strive to win power, take revenge, and so on. <br /> <br /> The animation is very pleasant and gentle, but the style seems to be purely targeted. The backgrounds are superimposed over and the buildings look like futuristic. Music is quite enjoyable, and the show is not very bad, although the style is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> Plots are almost always absurd and ridiculous, but all this is a cartoon. It can not be blamed for that. However, this would not be at the same level as Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.
