First of all, the title character is not the main character of the movie. He is the Worship Officer's Assistant. The actor portraying Igor cries out loudly, laughing hysterically, and having a bad smile, avoiding his eyes, would be a great way to get rid of people. Igor also shouted (really he had never talked any more) with a loud voice. He also said Bat-liner idiots. For example, when he saw that the adventurer killed his followers, when he saw that Igor, he cried, "Paul! Paul! Why did you do it? I would clean it! So clean!" In another scene, Igor has told a victim "to offer surgery tools, it was time to work right now." In spite of the bad performances, the end does not make sense, while the steamer arrives to the point where the story breaks, Igor gets a bullet arrow in the head and the other lunatic mates die. Again, twice to kill "good ones". The film does not explain, only to the spectator that Igor escaped from his hospital. What ??? The bottom line you do not miss out on watching this movie. I can restore the moments I could see.
