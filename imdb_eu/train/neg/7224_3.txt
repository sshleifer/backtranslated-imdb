The movie is too gray. Very little is shown as the film progresses, as the deeper senses have much deeper meaning, but they become very rare and understandable for the storybook. It causes the movie to come back, but I did not do that. I saw the movie in the morning, I'm sure I would watch the movie tonight when I would sleep. For me, the movie was like a "Blade Runner" for men. <br /> <br /> The movie has left a lot of questions and developments. The movie leaves an impression and permanent. <br /> <br /> In addition, the extravagant look of the film does not help much. The CGI movie drops half / in the middle of the real, but it does not get a halve in a good, spectacular, impressive and imaginative, such as "Sin City" and "300". Half of the movie's characters were also created from the computer. Although it seemed unpleasant and very different, the animation of the character is not very impressive. Surely, the futuristic environment looks good and the movie, of course, was not cheap, but its style is in front of substance and, in this case, it is not really positive. <br /> <br /> Some lines are absolutely awesome and interesting. The main God of the movie, for example, says: "I want to do this but your concern is not why I want to do it." That does not mean, Horus! It's exciting and easy to put on the movie if you do not want anything to happen on the plot. Also, the deeper questions and meaning of the movie are confused in the movie's script and its script. <br /> <br /> The cast was still the best. They believed in the project and they were sure it would be something special. So I can not say anything about them. <br /> <br /> The story and the movie are original. Classical and semi-classical science fiction films, mostly modern, divide them. Perhaps the reason is why the film gave me a very redundant impression. <br /> <br /> A pure and inexperienced cinema experiment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
