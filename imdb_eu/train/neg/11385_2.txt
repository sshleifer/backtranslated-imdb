Before beginning, let's say that the experience of this movie may have a duplication, and in others it is considered less than others. So it is quite possible that the subtitles or apparently change the new DVD version. I have not read this book; I know another Japanese manga and I do not have any cultural context. <br /> <br /> Small non-spoilers. <br /> <br /> I often like science fiction stories (similar). Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.), but I did not enjoy this movie. While it was not curious, it was boring just in the middle of the middle of the century. There are all types of problems; For starters, probably more serious: conversation. Characters can not complete sentences. They are not called when they say they call each other, usually monosyllabic ("Kanedaaa!", "Tetsuoooo!", "Huh?", "Grrr" ...). This largely understands and diminishes most of the characters. It does not help at least a lot of them to consider taking just a few minutes of the screen without any interesting things that would distract themselves from stereotyped images without imagery. <br /> <br /> It's grunting. Star Trek standards have also been intensified by pseudo-philosophical randomized technologies that are uninspired and uninspired. Here there is nothing deep and significant. It seems that all is in vain, without any coherence without science fiction, which will be divided by one another. <br /> <br /> There is little understanding of the plot, it is not an excuse to start a long end sequence. There is nothing wrong with that little mistake and destruction; But in this case you will be asked "what is everything and how long is it?" He turns the development of the last 30-minute character into Tetsuo Pizza in Hutt, a little apparently without reason. <br /> <br /> At the end it looks like in 2001: a remote image chain to solve something or over the surface, let the converter look for a kaleidoscope about two hours a day. I am sure that it is a kind of art that they say; but for me there was just a lot of imaginary use of color and shapes. (Some music was also very interesting). Unfortunately, there is no style and substance. Disney tired? Do you want to watch animation movies related to "adult" themes? I'm sad I'm going to say "South Park" things like that.
