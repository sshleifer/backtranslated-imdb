Again: the movie was completely different. The kids would definitely like it, but the adults ... it's doubtful. The whole thing was a version of the original, because it was expected that the whole concept of the film was quite well-considered, but did they still fully confirm the whole movie? I mean, that the Little Mermaid is done again. The worst part of this is Morgana, "Ursula is the crazy sister", who nowhere appears and threatens Melody, and Triton is with her magical Trident. Why did not Triton do anything? Because the land does not have to do anything. I could keep it, but I do not want it. The whole thing is that the attempt to compact more money for the Mermaid is shameless and, of course, they were thrown away without any thought, because they knew they were selling it. In general, the loss of time is horrible.
