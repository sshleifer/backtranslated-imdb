This was the first time I saw it (with Return of Jafar), and I honestly thought that before the original was in sight. I was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The story was essentially the first screenplay and the situation that changed with other characters. They have Ariel and Eric daughter, Melody is not happy with life on Earth. It wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariella maintains her daughter thanks to her daughter, because she wants her protection and when she annoys and annoys Melody. And then he decides to run away and he becomes a mermaid. So he's happy to swim, and Ariel intends to go for his mermaid. <br /> <br /> The story does not write bad, but the headlines and repetitions in the first film are just too obvious. And adding that Melody is, in general, very annoying, and the movie becomes almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> There are two other characters with a full load-Tip and Dash. They are not evil characters who are themselves, just try not to think of Timon or Pumbaa! They can also leave songs as much as the original magical energy produced by the original songs. The animation, of course, does not work in pieces, but it does not use much imagination for the movements of the characters. <br /> <br /> Other tips - try to forget about Ariel's original character when you watch this movie. This beautiful, rebellious and weird teenager has "grown up" with a boring wife, a boring, boring mother, and her brand is all linked to red hair. This is much better seen if you have never seen the original - you will not compare anything. <br /> <br /> However, it might be a bit worse, there are not so many other issues as Cinderella II. But not in the same original league. But if it's not for your collection, if Disney continues, all of their hobbies will be lost.
