When it was released, I thought it was one of the most profane movies ever. However, by Martin Scorsese and some other such filmmakers like this, the main lines have been worse than in the language, but this is a violent attack on the ears. Hey, I can take it a lot, but this one was ridiculous. Only in the first six minutes did I use a dozen and a half words of the Lord in vain and many f-words. I wonder how many people came out in the theater in 1990? I could not have one. <br /> <br /> No wonder there are many actors like Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this film, Stephen Lang's image seems to have improved, at least Godly "Stonewall" Jackson plays "God and the General." The role of Langue here is the opposite: maybe he is a character who falls in love with the worst trashy person in the movie and travesty. <br /> <br /> Depression, dark, semi-pornographic and booty. : only some adjectives used to describe this story drawn in the novel are used - as well as liberal critics. Of course, some of the most well-known critics, Libs's extreme, praised the movie. However, they were unique. Most critics felt ill, as well as paid by all the public. It's disbelief that anyone can surprise such dirt and garbage. <br /> <br /> Assume me this: there are no good and enjoyable characters in this film. It's a nasty and bad movie: the worst "modern era". That is to say, the abuse of the child, the abuse of drugs, the prostitutes, not only two good hours, but also ordinary and evil wickedness. No thanks.
