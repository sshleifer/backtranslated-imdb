Spoiler !! I love Branagh, I love Helena Bonham-Carter, I love each other "Mary Shelley Frankenstein" - but this - <br /> <br /> I understand the desire to stretch actors to avoid romantic stereotypes. Well, they did, but really - the script continues, Bonham-Carte's clothes were three chic, and from time to time there was a faster "madcap" sequence than the Beatles movie or Rowan and Martin Laugh. .. <br /> <br /> I never got any points - other comments say Branagh was a dream character. I never felt. He was a loser and not very bright, and definitely lovable. It was only painful to rob bank robbery. Certainly it's not fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bonham- Carter's realistic essay as a realistic speaker ("Full Monty" understood harder than the accent of the first 15 minutes of Lancashire, and was poised by a poetic explosion before a hill that was buried beneath the monster of his aircraft. Chorus of angels or soundtrack Would you just have to? <br /> <br /> Back to classics or a spine and something with an arch. Give this to PBS. <br /> <br />
