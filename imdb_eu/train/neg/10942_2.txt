Lorenzo Lamas, Jack `Solider, works with Kelly to seek and destroy a veterinarian veterinarian and a vicious jail in Vietnam to save his sister's store for saving his sister's sister. The movie is made dreadfully and it's so bad that Ron Palillo is making a third bill and still has a 3 minute screen, and they are not good at all. In general, it's a horrible movie, but scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hanging on bushes and hanging bushes rarely laugh (unintentionally). Following better follow-up.
