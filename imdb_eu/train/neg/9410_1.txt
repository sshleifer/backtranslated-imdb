As long as you suffer! If you like people who want to see you waking up, get up, dress, take a shower, prepare dinner, have a look at each other, have sex in the dark, then go to bed to sleep ... bedroom, nice and comfortable rooms, kitchens, silence Long minutes ... If you want to get bored for two hours, if you feel a real "true false art" emotion, then you'll like it. But if you do not try to watch a good movie, there are thousands. "Whenever you are," but do we want to sleep? The German film won the Turin Film Festival, as the Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury took a bad decision, as the festival presented talented films. Maybe to be nice to German, often do not get prizes? Well, they made the "Other Lives" ... but this is excellent but not gay. So maybe it's a fashion problem. Do the Germans "come back"? It does not matter which one? Or maybe it's only for a look at some managers?
