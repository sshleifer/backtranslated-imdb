Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow is a typical teenager in the 1950s. It's not a horror or science fiction movie. The plot corresponds to a group of teens to be taken from the club "hot rod" because there is no income. After they are eliminated, they decide to try an old Haunted House. The only thing to save the film is the "ghost" (she creatures in Paul's suite), that is a monster for the film that Bluisdell has worked on.
