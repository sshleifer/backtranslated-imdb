I bought this (it was only $ 3, right?) Under "Gray Matter". The novelty that Sherriff Roscoe did not see in the DukesOfHazzard role was very curious. As other reviewers have warned, the story of bad governed secrecy with high secrecy is quite boring. <br /> <br /> And yes, there are many shots, especially the house in the pool. Some characters and some are inaccurate. I think that filmmakers may be worried about someone's neglect, so they are the exterior of the exterior building. It's really fun. After a while, the pool is like a logotype for the identification of television channels thrown, reminding us that we are watching "Gray Matters". <br /> <br /> I have also enjoyed two names. At some point, an ill-treated text messenger carries someone "scientific b * tch!" Calling. Iraina is just too inadequate. Several scenarios later, the different themes reduce this "scientific territory". He was very confused. <br /> <br /> One day the movie will disappear forever. From there, it will be impossible to find copies of it for another decade. Almost never happened. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
