If you want to watch the movie that emphasizes the style over the substance, it's for you. For me, Son de Mar SEE is beautiful, but it's not a bit of a substance, mawkish, melodramatic, manipulative love yarns if you do not turn it. It is one of those you've heard so much. <br /> <br /> Through this film, before anything else, Ulises (Jordi Molla) goes looking for tuna and has not returned, leaving his wife Martina (Leonor Watling). ) and the son to protect them from them. Then, in anger of six hours, Ulises buries, Martina marries again, and her son grows in childhood. This fast transposition is at least sloppy and sloppy: hanging around about 40 minutes or more, we are suddenly full-blown melodrama, all six minutes. I think this is called an unfair narrative of salvation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Watling) returns to find what is married. Sierra (Eduard Fernandez), a man who is nonsensically rich (what does he dump to win all this?), Because inexplicable crocodiles keep him as a pet. Martina, angrily, asks Ulysses about her absence, will tell her to go to the island of Sumatra one day and she can understand everything. <br /> <br /> And here's the thing: I WILL DO I go to the Sumatra island. Something kills in the reference script. He does not really explain where he was and why he left his wife and child for five years. He is not allowed as an honorable man, and the film meets the holes that look at at least half the length of the film. I think that the director of Bigas Luna wants to meet the lines of history, with stunning cinematographs and fleeting conversations that offer mystical traces (fish, reptiles, sea). It just works. This movie is like a solid clothing with the final "arch" of the narration. <br /> <br /> I am sure that Jordi Molla is a good actress, but I can not buy Ulises as a hero (that is, Ulises was originally). With a dull sensuality, Virgil's short stroke of about 2,000 times the same time, and every time Martina immerses herself in the orgasm explosion. This guy should be rented to regenerate outdated marriages. I'm sure Virgil would be surprised. It was not often put to me, as I understand. <br /> <br /> 'This poetic device appears in the film, and I did not think that it was a reversal of the famous Ulysses' mermaid song' (that is, the handsome girls sing singing slept remotely, if the sailors were condemned as well , mermaid said). This is Bigas Luna, you see the problem: it offers a brilliant symbolism in High Art's stunning essay. Once again, it does not work, at least in my eyes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Watling is a beautiful and magnetic young actress, but here it gives us this character that does not seem much more intellectual or even a romantic depth. Beyond that, I could easily fall in love with a wandering sign on the face (that is, as deserted), oily hair from the 60s, algae, and XXI. Fashionable bearded people. '(you know, four-day growth, no more, no less). I think the guy is a dreamer (I think), but his eyes suggest that he is suffering from false abusive handicaps. <br /> <br /> But do not despair, this movie is very good. Otherwise, do not try to think too much about black dots or what you hear in the conversation. You can quickly redirect this movie (especially in the first 40 minutes) and you have not lost much.
