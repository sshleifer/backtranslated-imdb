The cars in this movie are horrible. Playing this movie is horrible. Plots and driving scenes do not make sense and they are equally bad. If you're worried about movies that change someone, and suddenly the horny one is faster, save yourself problems and money. Cinema for fans of racing? Well, there's a mistake referring to a NASCAR driver as a rally driver. If you can not indicate any difference, go see it, it will explode. That really will come true, there are really really nice cars in this movie, they are very encouraging and realistic. The play is horrible, especially because the plot is very bad. If you want to watch the hot girls, turn on mtv or vh1. I feel bad, such as a nice car in a bad movie. If the car class coincides with the movie, bicycles would ride on bicycles.
