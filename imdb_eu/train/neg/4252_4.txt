*** Possible Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> When I saw it today, I had a bit of a wait, not too high, but not too low. It did not look like it, but it seems that the filmmakers could not think what the film should do. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film is quite mysterious. and somehow exciting, but soon it will change to ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes ... when I saw more, I almost always laughed twice. <br /> <br /> It's the horny of all the endings. However, almost squeeze / comedy ... <br /> <br /> I do not say good scenes that the movie becomes "full". <br /> <br /> 4/10 Movie-Man
