This flick was a blow. I think little girls like to be modeled on bathing suits, housekeepers or housewives, however, as they will never imagine. It is really sad that the work and life of an artist is so misunderstood. Certainly (or perhaps he might have expected), the whole nature of Artemisis and everything he promised was a standard of Hollywood, the female character was reduced; A terrifying, physically perfect, helpless creature, who did not show the character of the character that got rid of the place where he was mutilated in history. It was even more sad to see a large part of the audience find that education was inadequate in this area to understand the incredible gap between the message and the reality in the film. To portray the artist as a lover of real life, someone who accused me of being raped when he was being tortured just does not frighten me. The director does not say anything more meaningful about refusing to give his story to a real person.
