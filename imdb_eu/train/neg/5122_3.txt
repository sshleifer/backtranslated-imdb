The beloved Christians despised me and despised me because they expressed my disappointment with this movie. I condemn statements like this: "I can not believe you did not like it, the Christians did it completely!" "Everyone has spent time and nobody paid for the movie! It was made by a church and not Hollywood. We should spend money on such films! They use only $ 100,000 for the film." "A real Georgian church and a Christian school! This was written and directed by a preacher." So, apparently, the only reason I loved this movie was made, and the minimum amount of money made by this is done by Christians. That's what you need to love the movie. <br /> <br /> Look, I got the movie ALWAYS, about the background of the movie. I never heard of it, and I did not know it except football. I saw it as I see any other movie and I was disappointed. I was disappointed with erratic edits and handwriting. I was very happy after the decision, after finishing. Do not worry Other cheap films and other films made by EXPENSIVY have received less respect for me. It's not about the movie. It is the final product. <br /> <br /> The writer confesses that God does not "pray" what we say "yes", but wanted to show faith, God changes our lives. . That's the truth. However, God can change our lives and still be false. God can change our lives and we do not raise for our work. God can change our lives and our car is still old. God can change our lives and our house is still tough. Why not portray it in the movie? Others talked about their concern about the writer / director, but it was apparently defensive. <br /> <br /> I do not think the performance was horrible and there were many landscapes. I like to go to God and to acknowledge our tremendous power and our weakness. <br /> <br /> Writing and management were very weak. It is easy to distinguish it from the fact that many people do not develop. What we really do from the trainer's wife is not pregnant (well, until the movie is over). It seems to be the only ball player with the potential to be an interesting character and "I have a whitewashed father and I can not play football, but I will throw the winning spot". although I have never gotten a real field before. "Another problem was Christian school, yes, I worked in two Christian schools, I went to myself, and I had bosses and nephews in other Christian schools, in short, I had close ties with ten, not all of the problems I saw in all of these schools It was directed, I saw a completely surrealistic movie about their school and they showed me the human factor. I could see a real dose of reality and how God could work. <br /> <br /> I will finish by writing or drawing the author or a piece of work , sharing the vision of the artist's world, the international vision shown in this movie: "People who pray in the right way earn ball games, get new cars, they can not understand, get a rise and fix their home in a short time. span. "I know, I loved the movie because of the honesty of the people I made. I think I should love the movie because I did it well and for other reasons.
