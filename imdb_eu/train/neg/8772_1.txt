Nothing says it to me: people die about 4 months of the same hill. The cast was a bright star, but unfortunately producer / director / editor / God goofed. He would have had to eat a simple cake (because he was killed by Kargil's men), he hired one of Bollywood's great directors, hired a real screenwriter, hired a real editor, he was not hired by a musician. In India somehow (and it seems that the bad version of "Apocalypse Now" had heard cheap Indian medicine), he recruited a real professional team, told all the fireworks and told him the real story. Unfortunately, like bigwigs in the Indian army, it took huge decisions for its actors and it was immense to the viewer. Everyone has died over and over again. <br /> <br /> Please do not do this again, sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> ps: The next time that an Indian director decides to glorify Gurkha, Nepal will hire more than one member to represent the group. There are certainly many Nepalese people working in Bombay - the final count was 40,000 and a half million.
