OK, it's very strange to complain about something I've done. So, the movie has pushed me over that limit. I saw DOAN at the Hollywood Cemetery and I was very disappointed. The director is a question about the director, rather than using American "book lines", rather than being included in the films, he says everything that failed in this movie. <br /> <br /> American references: Native American references were really unknown and were noticed. It is clear that this director and writer attempted to address an arena that had not previously played. They should be associated with the old add-on to write something you know. In fact, they are not shown in the film or indicate that the beauty of a particular culture was not correct. <br /> <br /> Klixeak and ON THE NOSE --- I agree that this movie was an indie. So I took on more hopes. "Little Miss Sunshine" was an indie and was so popular before seeing it. Even before I was released, I was very successful. UNFORTATALLY I did not say the same about "Expiration date". "Sun" has taken us to the events of the past, but the filmmakers were so clear in their view that the results would lead us to another direction avoiding the "clis" trap. On the other hand, this movie had no way of being trapped, because it was initially TRAPPED. The old psyche mother, Hendrix pair, etc. <br /> <br /> I hate to say this, but the best movie I ever saw this year and LABURRA were both indies. "Little Miss Sunshine" was the best and this film was the worst. I would say otherwise. <br /> <br /> However, I congratulate the filmmakers on the good side of their relatives in this cemetery.
