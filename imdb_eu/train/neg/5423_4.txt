I've been using the song for a few years now, but I've never written reviews. However, this movie was so disappointed (although it was written with a low score of 6.4), I could not relax. <br /> <br /> Noise is a story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins) who is so noisy as sound pollution, as an alter ego, as the "Rectifier" as a car, and vandalizes cars that finds a car alarm headset has it. <br /> <br /> I'll take the Movie name to be a bit worse. Although one or two other sources of the aforementioned noise or noise are mentioned, the real focus of our protagonist is the car alarm. Auto alarm, auto alarm, auto alarm. There is no other focus. The movie tries to link other examples of sound pollution to automobile alarm problems, it seems to be the merits of Robbins's acting actions. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are annoying noise. Nobody likes car alarm sounds. Of course, we have a passion for baseball in our car, and this film uses this bill and the only thing to sell this movie. "In the long run," I also say that there is a sexual intercourse aimed at filmmakers who need these films to enjoy themselves (including three completely unnecessary). Honestly, it's obvious. <br /> <br /> <br /> Robbin's character, very soon in the film, becomes completely unknown. It seems that less noise does not seem to work, and even more so, that noise has begun to break into safety. In the first half of the movie, it's basically a story about how angry and self-joking is this hero of the little Rectifier. However ... transformation does not happen. He appoints him. <br /> <br /> I followed a little while. A global general social reflection is occasionally created to add to the pretension of the film, and Robbins does not feel happy that he never leaves him. <br /> <br /> In general, I think it's very clear that I'm trying to figure out what's happening to this movie, because it's not getting too much, but I think it's a big mistake. A man's opinion, joy.
