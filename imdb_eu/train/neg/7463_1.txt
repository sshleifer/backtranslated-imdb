I've NEVER been using it for a long time, EVER always watch any movie that has a regular membership on "Saturday Night Live". I did not rent a "Corky Romano", but I had to do my good work for an hour. Then my good manners failed. Stupid, not funny. Tarkina, not horny. Bad, not good In a nutshell, it's all about the video clip.
