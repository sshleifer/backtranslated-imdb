This movie includes "SlapChop" Vince Offer (who also wrote, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafuoco is the name that shouts "quality". And "supermodels take a parking lot" (such as sounds) with giant stars, sheds a sperm ("Rhymer"), corporeal corruption and black market fetuses (what a scooping man is). they are supposed to leave the ship), jokes that are much more enjoyable, a superhero and a falus giant with forced abortion. Skits are painful (for example "Batman and Rhymer"); The play is not enough to play amateurs, and it's a raw movie ... and stupid. I really think an 8-year-old team can make a more entertaining movie of the same budget <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be "Slap Shot" against Vince to scientists. To be honest I did not have the root for this case! Apparently, Scientologists have somehow said that it destroyed its reputation and sank some sort of film. It does not matter that films are contagious from the beginning to the end of junk and that they do not have 99% (compared to Ebola is more fun) ... and they are the best things about the movie. <br /> <br /> Who in this way IS Bobby Lee ("Mad TV") is wearing a diaper and participating in that pornographic fake movie. It is amazing to overcome this trajectory.
