Seriously, I do not know where to start. Someone like tertiary autism has given a dollar quote, and has said 'make a secret movie about me'. Editing is ridiculous, cinematography was at least random; Every syllable in the conversation was totally delayed and managerial ... well, is there a director? Everything was so absurd and that there was not ... and randomly ... and the whistle. <br /> <br /> <br /> Here is an SPOILER; This movie is a lie that you will never see. <br /> <br /> However, if you like this piece, you will enjoy it; Imbalance, dark blue, and partial frontal lobotomy.
