This movie is a good example of media manipulation to sell a movie that is just a TV sitcom. He has written the most extensive circulation in Puerto Rico on the amazing films of this film, silencing the rest. Casually it is the owner with the second most circulation owner. CLARIDAD is a weekly newspaper that has analyzed the form and content of the film, and has stated all its faults, clich√©s and bad texts. <br /> <br /> Because a movie makes a part of the audience. laughing jokes clearly, and because the actor and the landscape are known, he does not accept film.
