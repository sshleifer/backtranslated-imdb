The movie is not historically represented by Smith. The purpose of this film is to be "comfortable" in Smith's life to be told to the LDS church leaders. Historic accuracy seems to be disturbing. The film was designed to be an "experience in the promotion of faith", not to be a "balanced" vision of Smith. I take myself to study Smith's life and read both LDS works and LDS does not work. The film, like most LDS projects, was shot and worked well. However, this was not quite realistic at the beginning of Mormonism or Smith's life. <br /> <br /> Smithe was given a significant time to re-establish an accident that had occurred at the age of seven. This event was undoubtedly an important part of completing himself, but it seems that the main reason for joining the film is to create a pleasant view of Joseph Smith. Another point is a portrait of Smith's years of youth, a silent movie about the involvement of the Smith family's magical practices in the 1820's. Another problem is that when the film shows that Joseph Smith is a good fight he fails and sometimes he did not change his character and became violent. <br /> <br /> I went ahead. This movie was not historical and it is necessary to take a fiction film about a man. I would not recommend this movie for other entertainment purposes.
