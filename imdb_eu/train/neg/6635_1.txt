After four years he made the debut of the director of the art house snoozer "Welcome To L.A.", Alan Rudolph shows what he really wanted was a boy from Hollywood. "Roadie" is a brother-boy, room brawls, black harp, Art Carney wheelchair ... and Meat Loaf wheel. Meat Loaf (Travis W. Redfish!) Is playing on the screen, and perhaps on a lesser role (in a better movie) it might be really passionate, but Zalman King's stereotyped script. Meat Loaf keeps your eyes wide and moronic. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr. and Blondie appeared and they embarrassed. Without a doubt, "Roadie" is a bad trip. STARS NO ****
