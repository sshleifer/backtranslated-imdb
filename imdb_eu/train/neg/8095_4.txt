In Wolfe's original novel, in fact, as regards the whole story, things happen according to the exact sense of agreement. The goal is the survival of a certain type of life. The novel is full of wickedness. The only relationship with emotionally true is Sherman and his daughter, Campbell, who only touch. On the one hand, everyone can get advertising, power, money or self-growth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wolfe has criticized all New York characters and social networks. . His answer was to deny it. After all, he lived in New York and he was a member of the maritime improvement board members and admirable institutions, so that he would not like the local qualifications. (Wolfe is a Doctor of American Studies from Yale, and is not a fiction.) The weaknesses that have been considered have become a memorable novel. Nobody was good at all. And Sherman McCoy was injured, a professional protest against social justice. All of this movie is thrown away and simply imposes a moral frame in a story that is not included. Wolfe did his homework. The novel was rooted in reality. Each event has been possible, but compelling. Wolfe can do an excellent cultural anthropologist - he knows how to access a system and register his details. <br /> <br /> Yes, each one of us would find ourselves, just like Sherman and his wife do. South Bronx, threatened by a couple of black children, and a getaway after encountering one of them. This scene is transferred well printed from print to celluloid. <br /> <br /> But after that scene, the film does not feel trusted by its audiences and sometimes becomes an effort to write the message. <br /> <br /> Sherman could unexpectedly attack a child and be arrested as a novel, but he could not free himself from his prison by removing his most expensive and immediately removing a shotgun and shooting from the ceiling, as in motion. Being a fun scene, the plaster ceilings fall into all the celebrated parties and escaped, shouting. It just would not happen. The movie has revealed a lot of detail about the reality of the novel. Wolfe's sensitivity, the task of capturing reality has been lost. What we get is a buzzing, fantasy and stupid scene that does not make any audience wake up. The similar scene is still empty, Wolfe's screaming veracity. <br /> <br /> The film also fails because there is a lot of sins and salvation in a fun story of moral nihilism. Here we see "Don Juan in Hell" in opera. We will give a lecture with the help of a poet. We see the blame of Sherman. A black judge who preaches from the chair and one of the last such discourses to have a good behavior to start again. After turning Sherman into a sacrificial lamb, he feels reporter. And it's a happy ending when Sherman reflects on the reflection of the law with his smile. The scene is sitting on the film, like a star in the head of an elephant circus. <br /> <br /> The film only sets out the most common and unusual points, just like the ones that are beyond the spectator's ability to absorb any nuances. <br /> <br /> The performance is not a bad one. The movie does not look bad. And photography is pretty good, including two spectacular shots - Chrysler Building Gargoyles and Concorde landing. It's a very good botched script. <br /> <br /> The first semester of the film is roughly well in conception and execution. It preserves some small details of the novel. Sherman and Judy's dog are called Marshall. Who would miss a Marshall dog? In the second half, the focus is almost completely lost and, in general, it is not worth watching. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wolfe's right-handed wrinkle attacks a lot of people, but conveys his cone. Sadly, writers and producers did not take courage to do so, and they were able to do a wonderful New York research.
