... then it is better not to see the movie. The premise of the show has completely deteriorated. Duke boys are stupid, they are Daisy trampy, Roscoe is malicious, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jessie is a criminal ... Only original Cooter and Flash characters are true. At least Enos is low. <br /> <br /> At one moment, they open their doors to enter General Lee. - Nuff said. <br /> <br /> The original show may not be an excellent television. But it was fun and the meaning of the characters. This movie encounters a simple life like Dumb & Dumber.
