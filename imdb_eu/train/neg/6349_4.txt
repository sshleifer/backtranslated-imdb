Woody Allen has made some of the greatest comedies and I would seriously point out that Annie Hall is the biggest movie ever, but I think it's better if I think about it, but it would be difficult. Of course, he has had some pretty movies, but it's not so bad, either in Manhattan's Murder Mystery or in Sweet and Lowdown, but he never had the movie as bad as Melinda and Melinda. It's not so tired and so shameless that movies are terribly ridiculous, but how has it happened, is it still our old Woody? The plot has four friends who are eating together. They are two playwrights and another cites a funny story about a friend. Unexpectedly, it's about a young woman who starts at a dinner party. We never hear the rest writing two works to begin discussing whether comedy or tragedy is better. Both views start to see. In the midst of that woman named Melinda, both have problems with drugs and her husband. In this tragedy, he is a family friend, after suicide, decided to appear without apparent reason that may appear on the door of his old friends. Comedy is Melida, after covering her sleeping tablets, taking part in the dinner. Both are never terribly ridiculous or overwhelming, they're laughing or laughing more than once or twice. There are good performances by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell, but they can not be put together. They are far removed from all this year's other films.
