but there are not many of them. Most likely, the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Undoubtedly, the worst of this year. It's not necessary to comment on crust, throw or playback. The problem is more than that. Everything that happens on the screen takes on a whole kind of annoying (non-fun) stupidity. I do not know why I gave it 10/10 out of 1/10. Probably because Steven Martini. He really tried. Bottom line - 95 minutes of brain cells cleaned with the toilet. Avoid at any cost.
