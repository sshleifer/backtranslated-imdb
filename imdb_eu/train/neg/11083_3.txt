I saw the movie I saw it later at night. At first it was interesting, but it did not convince me in general. I'm not a fan of Tyson. Actually, I do not like boxing. Barbaric, dark and double-faced (societies) get some money to fight against each other. <br /> <br /> However, I felt the start of the movie was good. Actors well, especially George C. Scott (as Cus D'Amato). I do not know how reliable a flick is. I do not read books and books about boxer or Tyson. I do not know anything about that, but it was very fun. <br /> <br /> As I went through the film, I felt a bit lost my charm and I lost my interests too. I was awake, but the last time was not enough.
