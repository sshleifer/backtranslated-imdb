This film was made and shot in my hometown. I remember that Molly was in the city of Ringwald ... <br /> <br /> Storyline ... <br /> <br /> Basically, after 20 years the movie "was put". to rest "was not finished, it was conceived to form a group of film students - a harsh conclusion. It seems that someone does not want to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is bold, it should be remembered that this comedy is so trench in a cheek It has to be taken a little bit, but it's not a real oomph. It's just a matter of little concern for the characters, especially the transperant and the information you receive around them, it seems unimportant, and Kylie once again listening to the australian accent and watching the baby I went to school. It's not a matter of getting rid of the movies. God knows why they thought they would come to Molly Ringwald, perhaps because of the film's character (because he is paying tribute to the 80s / horror movies), but a real Aussie actor will do well. <br /> <br /> In the case of the merger, there was a great deal of representation. Some of these children (especially the two main chic - "director" and "producer") might have resembled They looked like they looked. That never looked good. There was also a feeling about these planes. Is it likely to be switched on? As it's not used, it's not smooth. <br /> <br /> Murder. Lord. Is it more terrifying? There are a couple of shock factors and raw scenes. I liked the movie, but it was not great. It lasted for 90 minutes, but it could go a bit less. Maybe if they tightened the script, it would be better. They killed many characters, but they did not have real construction to kill. Maybe they killed fewer people and would be better concentrated in a terrifying environment. <br /> <br /> I know now that it's a comedy and fun stuff. Or they were so incredible fun. But I'm not convinced. <br /> <br /> LM.
