A photographer who works as a fellowsman leads home and takes a bath that knows the hole in the ceiling. So, his neighbor indicates that he is his photographer. This movie could have a great plot but then the plot disappears hopefully. I had the problem with that movie every ten seconds that someone squeezes the heroine. If someone has come up with a scene that stirs the heroine, this would be pretty good. Whenever I thought the scene would go somewhere, someone spilled white powder. It was really generous to have a lot of drug use in a movie. A great story about a masterpiece and a photographer came to his attention. Lesbian things did not worry me. I was looking for a movie about art. I found a movie about drug abuse.
