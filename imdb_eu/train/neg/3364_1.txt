So it begins with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who have been asked to come to this house (and it's not surprising) carers always lock their doors forever without apparent reason. Everyone laughed, jokes, etc. This doctor tells them a great story about this woman and some children. They are afraid they start to feel things. Oh, the ghost of a little girl is seen. Some of the great speeches, then, come up with a horrible ghost and so on. This girl wants to know that this ghost has killed little children and have to release souls, yes, blah blah. He did it, but he does not die like he does. And this wicked ghost goes to heaven as he goes to hell. Two people survive and flee the house. The script is horrible because a boy is cut and Elanor (who kills children) says "oh no". The performance is wood, the effects are empty and the sets are used repeatedly. Basically, you would like to laugh at this bad movie, but if you seek fear, you will definitely give it to this movie. I was very disappointed when I saw this. Leave very big My sister (who gets very sacred) is bored in this movie, it's amazing.
