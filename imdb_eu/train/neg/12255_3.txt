... this is not exactly a call that accepts. In general, the movie "DinoCroc" was much better. Surely, in that movie, Matt Borlenghi drove out the whole movie, DinoCroc, crying around his little brother, who wept. But the special effects of "DinoCroc" were better, the lines were better, and the performance was better. Here are the problems with "Blood Surf" - 1) a crocodile killer with a breakdown of a boy's model with an apparent portrait. 2) Plots are ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. They are sinking into an island that is sinking aboard, where they will find a giant group of powerful ugly squadrons, trying to force the women of the group. 15-minute film was a complete waste. And 3) it's not enough croc time. There are several options for "Blood Surf": the actors are quite attractive and Matt Borlenghi feeds the film at the end of the movie. If you are dead and you have enough time to watch a movie of Matt Borlenghi / crocodile killer, jump on it and turn on "DinoCroc".
