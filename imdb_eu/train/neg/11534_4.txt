* NOTE * It has several kidneys! <br /> <br /> Let Gillian Anderson have a great respect for her as well as a pretty actress. That's why I can not understand the reasons for understanding that. after watching the movie screenplay (or missing it). <br /> <br /> The premise of the film, in my opinion, was an excellent idea, and there were some issues that really caused thought, but it was just like a fallen souffl√©. For example, I hate 99% of British cinema. It feels long, it's boring, it's usually not much after the first twenty minutes. When choosing one of the quickest, Paula Radcliffe dislikes as a marathon. With imaginative management and a minimalist plot, there is no public access to the crisis. As for the script, I thought the writer was trying to keep a few trees, when the average scene was trying to read something "Alice: F *** OFF! (Look Adam). Adam has come into the woods by Adam (Alice), which is Alice : ADAM! ADAM! "I suspect, literally, that the actors probably paid more than Kate Moss for Virgin Mobile ads. How little was there when Bridget Jones's friend, Shazza, was not proud of the word that he used? There are few establishments of the main characters in front of the deaf audience. There is a lot of sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic reaction. This character is not an automatic reaction. <br /> <br /> Alice is not that kind of woman. justice sympathy It has a great job, a London-based establishment with a roof. However, it gets into the screen, because it is wonderful, bitter and enjoyable. After the attack, some layers are thrown back, which explains why it should start. He grew up with a hard-wearing soldier, thinking of how to shoot the gun, the last expression of love he learned, so instead of following his steps, he sought something to escape to the big city. Feeling like a way of life. On the other hand, he found a group of Toffs with stereotypical middle classes, endeavoring to enrich the Lexus and the luxurious ones with an integrated security / entertainment system (that is, Mrs. Robinson Cockney becoming a boy electrician). ) Someone passes me a hundred times. The only saving of the character is Gillian Anderson. It would be in the hands of a smaller actor to be overwhelmingly unimaginable, but Anderson actually manages some fleeting humanity in this dreadful life of this man, especially as he apologizes for forgiveness. to stop attackers attack. <br /> <br /> I can not say that Adam was much better. Danny Dyer acted well with Jack the Lad, but he could not beat the lack of a script and save all the missing characters. <br /> <br /> This film was used primarily for the shock value, but the time was off and it was designed from the beginning to the end. As regards the blow, the most amazing thing about this film is Anderson Anders, a shameless proof that has made a great deal of pain. It was almost unfeasible to see the scene as a brutal attack. In a side note, in a British film, violent sex offenders would take one time each other to offer contraceptives, to rejoice their relatives, at the extreme extremity! If the National Lottery is a type of movie that needs money, I'm not surprised that people spend less than once a week choosing less pounds. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie, saying I'm giving up a lot of credit, I do not like that strong emotion about a character. I want to return a single hour of my life!
