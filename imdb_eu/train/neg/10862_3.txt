8 or 9 I saw Herzog as a movie and none of them had any impact on me. <br /> <br /> I saw several documentaries around him. Of course, he is a smart man, who has great knowledge of films and passion for them, but he is a good director. No doubt NO! Full anti-talent Do you have a good documentary for the actors mentioned above? never! <br /> <br /> It can not be corrected or written. His scripts are full of misunderstood situations, and in his films in such situations and in conversations, so many children and misfortunes do not hide the word "art". In no case. To mention the unforgettable direction, so amateur. He says he wants to correct such things and write such a noise is a lie. <br /> <br /> Scheisms like a scene arrested by Scheitz and Storsz's hide in the back of the store. HOW DOES wake up? <br /> <br /> It's a tricker; He knows what intelligence and false critics want. She knows the elements that she needs to write scripts to get your attention and pure praise. Do not mind the rest of the scripts and the crazy direction. <br /> <br /> Look at Julio Medem. Herzog can play a movie like Medem can, and then I will look back on his old movies and try to find their talent.
