Caligula decided to turn off the movie ... but then I just spent 15 minutes thinking. Unfortunately, I did it all the way. Make sure you do not have it. <br /> <br /> It's not scary or horrifying, horrifying or terrifying. Not one of those things, but desires to have everything. Instead of being boring, crazy, plain, predictable, and poorly executed (shooting a video clip, high-level special effects, or the sense of basic visual stories, it's hardly audible for conversation ... but it's not worth listening to.) /> <br /> This film is a proof of the argument that direct directors can also draw in a line.
