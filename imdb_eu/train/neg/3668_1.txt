This movie is very bad, you feel almost infected. In fact, there is a sharp relief, when it's over, it's so relaxing now to re-roll the cassette again and return to the video rental store before you infect your new video collection. In a joke I suggested that when we rented it, William Hurt seems like a movie that would be "on the phone" with his performance. I meant that he did not try hard enough. However, in a lot of scenes in this movie, Bill Hurt is in the TELEPHONE! The realization of this irony was the only pleasure derived from this misunderstanding. Cinematography and editing are dark and confusing, the story is chaotic, and the soundtrack is hardly audible. There is a small resemblance to "Falling Down", but this film has a disturbing story bass, excellent writing and theater, and a wonderful soundtrack. The "infected man" is extracted from another European tourism trap, and seeing it is like the path of unknown foreigners from a foreign country, because there is no language spoken in the steady rain, after nighttime windshields. smoking Do you get an image? Do not do this.
