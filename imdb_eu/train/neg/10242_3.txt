This movie was made by a bunch of white boys who went to school. Well, there's nothing wrong with that, it seems that he had made lots of white boys who went to school together. Cast's 90% are men of the same age. Nearly all young people are like watching a camera at a boys camp. The movie has no plot. Repeats the same action of blood baths in blood baths. There are some funny scenes and some comedies. But they do not free the flat monotony. <br /> <br /> The graphic scenes of cartoons are used to cover things that are beyond the budget or resources to be used, and it does not work very well. Everything that can be done with white blood-covered beaches is done with a lively animation. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie after seeing the trailer and it looks like Tarrentino. piece Well scene scenes are as good as ever. The rest repeats the same kind of daily and alive comedy. Sometimes it works, but it's boring to get the same things coming up again and again. More than one movie is like Satits Night Live Skits. The live comedy is hit-you-over-the-with-it. Where I can see the ideas of the story are fascinating. But the apocalyptic film is like Medevil England in America. In fact, as Wheatlry says, stories of that era were created. Part 2 is intended to make Tarrentino or perhaps he thinks he is parodied. <br /> <br /> At the opening of the LA, Wheatley mentioned that section 2 would play almost the same theater. He was asked if he thought of another work on the next section, and he answered, yes, yes.
