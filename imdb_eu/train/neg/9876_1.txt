I went out without knowing anything about this movie and I spent half an hour knowing everything. It was one of the worst movie I've ever seen. I am generally nice people, but I would like someone to like the movie, I probably would not talk to them anymore. It is likely that anyone who likes is a very personal identity and a chapel. Also, I think they are too intelligent, just like the auto-sharp bags that make the movie voices. I know everyone has a sense of humor, maybe some do not like mine, but it's okay; I do not think humor too. This movie is flat and dull at Wes Anderson's head. Go and get ready to expel; It is best to return your money too.
