"Ambushed" is not an ordinary movie of ordinary action. It's very bad to be common. A man wears a machine with a gun. The other man takes a turn and attacks the man with a greater power on the stove when he is terrified at the dangers of lead. Guess who's a good boy? Duh. This is done through "Assault". A short movie that is not a good act, not a good drama, not a good movie, "Ambushed" fails at all levels, because B-movie veterans have thrown it mechanically, as they almost always know how losers are doing. No one is recommended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
