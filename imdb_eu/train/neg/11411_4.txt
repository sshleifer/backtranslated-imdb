Storytelling has been repeatedly confirmed; "retirement of life breathing at home." Several articles of theater, film, novels, stories, poems and news have come to an end, but it is still a great platform for character analysis. <br /> <br /> 'Gideon' will be brilliant, but the interview is boring, and the story is full of topicals (although Gideon's 'wisdom' subtitle and summary made me laugh almost to myself) . The final non-influenced film is most active, but the rest is quite soft so that the focus of the actors is almost irrelevant.
