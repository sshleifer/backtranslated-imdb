This film won the 1990 Academy Award for the Best Animated Short Film. Over the last few weeks, I have seen dozens of recipients and recipients of the last 30 years and I truly believe that all this film could be the worst, but it was not chosen but only won! In 1989, I think it was a great age for the genre. The film is like a great set of characters like super-skinny Uncle Festers. It seems that simple articulated figures move using stop motion animation. All are the same: with the same face, body and clothes. The only difference is that each one has a different number on his back. Everyone is hanging on a platform, depending on magic, in space. Each one has a pole and there is also a box on the platform. The platform begins to bend a bit and the response is that men move their effort to balance the platform. Monitoring and duration of this for a long time. The only relief of the tribe is that one of them is wrong at the end, but there is not enough fun to watch. Except for stop motion animation, this short story does not interest me ... IT'S NOT. <br /> <br /> By the way, KNICK KNACK was briefly presented in 1989 and I do not know why. It was not selected. It was very short and was much better than any previous or previous year. Pixar may have been a success in the past few years, but KNICK KNACK is so clear and so funny, it seems almost criminal, he has not been ignored. Did not a few people come in? It seems that is not difficult.
