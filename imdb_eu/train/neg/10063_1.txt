I have never ever seen a bad movie in all my years, but what has a physiological significance with the songs of the movies. WOW reveals some demented Pok√©mon and multiply that can be achieved by seizing it. Animie is nonsensical because its managers are trivial and I think that a great marketing scheme is only cut out by songs and a good rating if you want to watch all the episodes of Pokemon in this movie. Understand what's happening and it's not a movie. It's just an animation to be a video. <br /> <br /> Ps: I'll give you 1, because they have only five dollars, I could not give half, half because they were not.
