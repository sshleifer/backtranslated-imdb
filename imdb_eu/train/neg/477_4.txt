I readily read that when Kay Francis refused to pay his salary, Warner Bros responded that he had lost all of his contract projects. <br /> <br /> He decided to take the money. But he suffered his career. <br /> <br /> This would appear on what was "Comet Over Broadway". (Even though he has not explained why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter are in them). "Ludicrous" is the word used by others on this plot. Murder trial The route of his false career. His success in London. His latest scene with his daughter. There are no parts to move to the next part logically. <br /> <br /> Also, sets and costumes looked like B-movie things. And her hair! Turner shows his many films this month. Check out ANOTHER and you will leave.
