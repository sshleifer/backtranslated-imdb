Man To Man tries to be a tough film: his heart is a good place, he wants to be epic and, definitely, he has a message that everyone can appreciate. But there are some problems with this photo. It tries to make it hard and it feels that it sometimes feels that the message is a responsibility against the viewer. So, it's a good idea that imagery uses images that are simpler - Man To Man does not think what the viewer decides, but strikes his message on his head. Joseph Fiennes expresses this in his role: in expressing himself with his own repertoire, with all his emotions, he looks good to him. Add a movie that is longer and faster, at the end of the day that man does not deserve to see what he sees. However, there are enough points to defend: it is entertaining, some humorous scenes and the robbery of Kristin Scott Thomas exhibition. Of course, you do not want to compare to the social masterpieces of Elephant Man (David Lynch) theater, but leaving the theater delighted. Trying to take your heart (even though your brain is obvious) and get the most time.
