This movie is very bad ... I mean really really bad. Tony Scott is a great director. I've only done all the films as enemies of the state, and it's one of the worst directors of all time. Richard Kelly (Director of Donnie Darko) was surprised at this. Richard Kelly is now my genius of my eyes, but I hope to get involved with that lesson learned. <br /> <br /> Now I love Mickey Rourke's most recent roles, but I can not even tell you the story and look that is terrifying. I'm not wrong because I love Mickey Rourke, but he has done some actions in his time and this is one of them. I do not know what to say about Keira's knight, I think it's a bit too much. I just do not feel in his films. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is bad. thats it ....... 1/10 ....... j Seaton
