I do not know if filmmakers were Saw-type movie or 12 Angry Men's descendants (people who linked together the prospects for truth). Anyway, it was wrong and it was not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I do not see blood and gore movies, but because this movie was unwilling to do something else, it should show a real murder. more. Most of them were camera shadows, reducing the horrors we felt when we felt deaths. <br /> <br /> In addition, he told me he was a policeman among the victims; He undoubtedly went to the jail, introducing evidence that helped the innocent young man, who gave him MJH, in the proof room. (And should not the MJH lawyer get access to those proofs, and the wrong proofs go back anyway, but he would not have needed help from the police?). While others also knew that this particular person was not damaging, they were still more active in their final disappearance. Gun dealers should know that their guns would intentionally misuse. He dismissed a person who dismissed the need for insurance, etc. But the crime of police seemed to him to be low, he did not know exactly what he was doing. The filmmakers could take a step further and the MJH could cheer a test that would give them more evidence. And MJH (police) is shouting in no sense of any kind. <br /> <br /> It would be more interesting if everyone puts everyone at the disposal of others to give them an idea of ​​why they were and died. The type of insurance, for example, excluded applications that were frightened by their throat; Eastern women would only be false witnesses, and so on. Yes, stronger track deaths, but more interesting. <br /> <br /> The conversation was not horrible, it was not twisted, and at the end it was a bit worse (not the worst) ever seen. At the end, the three stars came out of my classification. <br /> <br /> The actors made a decent job, especially the rubbish lines and the motivation to work. <br /> <br /> In general, waste time.
