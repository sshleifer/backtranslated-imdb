I went into the theater, a pleasant 90 minute, lit up and entertained. I did not entertain and did not leave light. This movie can not remember what he wants and does not achieve much more than anything. There are some fun lines and some great movie references (400 blows - for this character? Come here!). Even though a character does not treat it with great respect, more than thirty men reach the worst: prey, fats, dull, slobs. If you are interested in making a movie about human relations, check out parting Glances, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over the Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia. Thank you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
