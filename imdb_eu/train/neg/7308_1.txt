Liongat has yet to prove. Every Lionsgate movie has been abysmal. I tried and tried to give more opportunities and they were getting more and more fun. And Cabin Fever is definitely not an exception. <br /> <br /> I could not help making this movie so frustrating and bad. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot. The guy dies for a reason. Random viruses get infected, they are transported to children in a camp. Children begin to infect and die, they know about the city and, instead of helping, die. then water is infected and everyone dies. end <br /> <br /> Really, that's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < We and my friends, we saw that it was much more enjoyable about our fellow and fat-talked people, than paying attention to that movie. We finished it until it's over, the final way $ @ t, when we cried, it will make this movie. <br /> <br /> And I am still confused by my slow movements of random movements. a random child, and how apparently all countries are completely retarded and commonplace. And again, why did this dog beaten by the girl? why did you sit down in a seat trying to kill killer children to wait for him to die? Was this two part of their plan? wow never the best plan. I can not believe that this movie got a breakthrough. I had hardly any stomach in the DVD, and I had to sit down for less than an hour and a half in the theater. It was not terrifying, funny or even anything. You only use 90-minute waste ... I do not know, plant a tree or something. This piece of garbage is more productive than this. Plays, special effects and scripts are a joke. never get it. <br /> <br /> The cabin fever gets a bad beard scene from 10 onwards
