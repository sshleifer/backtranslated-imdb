This movie really was really bad. I'm a fan of Horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci, and even our friend, Lamberto, is getting well. I found that the first Demon films were very entertaining - they were very good because they were very good, but this is very bad. It really is really bad. It's boring, the story has never gone anywhere and I hated the characters - my wife was terrified by her husband's wife and the horrible pain of her wife. surely the best actor in the whole movie. I had deactivated about three quarters of the road, because I was very bored! Do not worry
