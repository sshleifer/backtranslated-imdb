It seems that there is a curse in gay cinema. In fact, happy endings are not very common. Except for beautiful things, gay movies break into relationships or death untimely at the end. Some, like Come Undone, will end ... the deadline. <br /> <br /> The creators of this absurd nonsense have one or two things to know about the plot, direction and time. In the first ten minutes of this film, he was confused, and even more so because of the low psychedelic nature of Jeremie Elkaim. This film seems to have been collected randomly without any follow-up or coherence. There is no way to see any kind of etereo retrospective present or sometime. I only took so much appealing unappealing. <br /> <br /> Stephen Holden, the New York Times, described this film as "beautiful and totally real." Well, Stephen seems to have invested in beer glasses, because it's really far away. Due to all the praise he received for this film, I expected something to be seen. Unfortunately, the movie was a title. And when the movie was over (I could not give it a resolution, I could add it), it's clear that writers, directors and movies did not enter.
