This work is "working" bad! It seems that nothing is tried and realistic. The plot is weak, it plays - miserable, as if the actors are asking for the first time in production, they are trying to act unexpectedly from the beginning. What is flop! Time, money and effort to all those who are concerned about the audience. Well, like any thriller, here are murders, corpses and blood. Just 5 minutes ago, imagine that someone killed someone with a knife and comes out quietly and smiling, as the whistle is not clear, as the swirling throat acts like a virtual agent. Likewise, this murder was supposed to be done by a small fragile woman with a strong man and cut her throat! He asked, politely, to lean on him? That stupid type is happening much more, and it's a question that the audience is joking about. Continuity is another big problem, for example: the groom's hunger is in bed, waiting for his bride to go out of the bathroom for a long time (...?!). The next scene opens with a couple entering the reception area asking for guidance on the places of the landscape. Is not it a last night's word ??? Tried to write about this unforeseen "movie" time.
