This was a stupid movie, with the planned story and a great performance! Willy Nelson had rigid braids. Jessica Simpson had a long-haired advertisement on her red lips, which was so much closer to her face. The premise was not fun and as I said - it's planned. It was shameful to spend all the money making for this movie. Another movie by Marilyn Monroe does not mention Blonde Ambition. It was incredibly incredible - a drop of a hat that could be accessed by the Secretary-General's Jessica Simpson - it was drooping !!!
