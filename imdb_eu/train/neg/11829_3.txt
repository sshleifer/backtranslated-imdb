In this movie I went after watching the "Borat" 82-minute show and I was quite disappointed. I was a fan of Wallace and Gromit and I went to watch animated movies. That said, I was diverted and for a moment I almost ran out, but I was waiting to improve this movie. It never happened. <br /> <br /> The visuals are amazing and the voice work is on the top, especially in my opinion, by Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remind myself that I had to head out the evil lizard bubble. Gandalf and Magneto) . The problem for me is one of the animation features for ADD-set. In fact, a fake record is loaded, which triggers an attempt to "Important Message". It's like waiting for an animated Oscar movie for the animated category, and considering the score of critics, I would not be surprised if the Academy misjudges it and would offer its hardware. If you are looking for a nice animated film about rats, take my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
