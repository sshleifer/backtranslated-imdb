I'm watching this movie right now on the WTN, it was the channel that turned on when I turned on the TV. The story is not very compelling and pretty boring to the Minister's wife (Alexandra Paul), lewdly, with a young cyclist led by Corey Sevier (laundry). It may be a plot or not. Corey tears the shirt and Alexandra diminishes. I'm not getting a feeling of getting out of it, and that's why it's wrong with Alexandra Paule. It's not very important, as I said, that it takes a lot of tee shirts and I've seen a double run. There are many saxophones in the soundtrack, which is just painful.
