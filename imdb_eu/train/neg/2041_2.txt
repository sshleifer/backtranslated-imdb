Well, I start with good points. The movie was only 86 minutes, and some of them were so bad, it was fun. Now for low points. My first warning signal came with a real "warning" movie. When the "warning" began, the following appeared: "The movie you will see has a graphic and disturbing image. It's not funny, nice or romantic for the people of death." I would save 86 minutes before and then turn off. The first words of the film were "I'm in the glue factory". The guy spoke on the phone, and the nursing home was like a glue factory. I do not know why. So the film's base is obsessed with the zombie killer and imitates it. The budget of this movie was at least $ 50 and they had to use the cheapest camera they found. The event was worse than reading from a script directly. He seems to be doing this. The script was horrible, and the great "twist" was actually a zodiac killer that wrote a biography about the zombie killer. Of course, they wanted to show this, but it was obvious in the first 10 minutes. Without the most painful details of soil, here's a horrible movie event. The zombie killer tries to compare himself with an "army" army, because soldiers are just murderers. Then, they wanted to make an attempt at "Satanic worship", in a meeting they showed some black capes. This excellent "computer hacker" could get the address of the child by giving the name and phone number of the child. For some reason, someone had to enter the FBI to get the address. I do not know why he did not just look at the phone book or use whitepages.com. There was also a random mention of 9/11 for no reason. I also learned where you are going to shoot, in seconds blood will come to blood. <br /> <br /> So, if you want bad performance, sub-scripts, camera bad work and obvious plot. You love the zodiac killer!
