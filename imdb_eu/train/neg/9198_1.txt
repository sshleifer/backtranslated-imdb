People will not explain anything! That's the only explanation why the movie's Dead House of the movie is. And that's just a terrifying whole movie. The movies are so bad you will always go forever. I really wanted to turn off and turn on the TV Paint Drying, but my word was to save everything I was asleep. I do not know why I do bad things for me. <br /> <br /> As if it were a matter of course, here's the basic story "story". A group of thirty-one people, therefore, are reluctant to go to some islands that leave the Pacific Northwest (Canada, it is cheap) because there are about 8 people and bad music. Pay after 1,000 dollars worth of $ 1,000 before losing the main ferry. That must be because all this courage is worth it! The fisherman has warned that the island is also called the Island of the Dead (I hung it was the house of the dead) and all were condemned by yadda yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> First faults here. Why would a small (century) century be on a remote island! Why would anyone like to make money? Why are older fishermen paying even more likely to be returned to others? <br /> <br /> Once there, two reasons (about 2 tenths, a small stage) and a port-john) have been broken, there is blood everywhere and no one is around. What would a rational thought do? Run a course of life. But no, those empty, clearly decides to go looking for blind people. Soon they find an old, old interior house, 50 times greater than the inside. He continues for another half hour in the woods, as an excuse to kill some of the smaller characters, and after they get bored, they go home again. Characters, like the movie, do not have anywhere. <br /> <br /> This incredible disaster is mixed with rich dialogue, malicious play, interactive pop-up game clips. the same name Why I never knew that this was a good idea with the filmmakers. Clips have no reference to some scenes and this trash can further deteriorate, if possible. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with the endless and inescapable line that saved the game. Resident Evil looks like old cinema. Badly, even though the double-dragon movie looks like the multi-faceted Oscar that looks like this landfill. As a result, Jurgen Prochnow is the only one who has not yet taken his full dignity. He could take his money and run it, but he tries to try his best with a great screenwriter and a bit of pathetic nature. The rest of the parts I am afraid. The characters are stupid and they deserve to die. <br /> <br /> Also, if you swear and crash your nonsense nudity, it's not necessarily that the movie can not be shown on Saturday morning on television. There is no fear. Pirates of the Caribbean are more terrifying than this horrible movie. And where did they come from? At first there were few people on the island. I think that they justify the reason they chose once again to re-use movies. I do not hurt you, you will see that the same zombie dies a dozen times. <br /> <br /> Who is the blame for the scandalous celluloid waste? One other than the director of Uwe Boll. There is no movie control. You can clearly see what actors do not know and what areas they really are not all about. The actors seem to read Cue Card, interrupt in the middle of long sentences and continue talking when they start to see the next card. Everything feels very natural. <br /> <br /> The Plus movie is filmed as a mini-series that is divided into two parts. In fact, I saw a better television production. And do not start my edition. The film is non-consistent and has thousands of speakers and has eleven bucks with senseless cameras. There was no real dexterity or talent. It really confuses and thinks of movies that are terribly bad movies and George A. Romero can not call anyone. The House of the Dead makes a stupid reference for romance to try to be 'postmodern', but this is not revolutionized by this as a REAL zombie movie. <br /> <br /> What is 1.85: 1 is a large amorphous image, and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is a very good impression, and it's worth it to add more ADR still used. The DVD comes with accessories, but why torture yourself. Is not this opinion advised? Stay away I'll tell you everything is condemned to you. Doomed Doomed !!!
