Like most people, I love "A Christmas Story". I had never heard this movie and, perhaps, good reason - it's horrible. It was lacking in the same name, narrator, director but the original blur. Charles Grodin had a bad chance to replace Darrin McGavin, but I can not imagine any replacement. The story is forced and the sweetness of the original is missing. Neighborhood interaction, Bumpuses, is ridiculous. "A Christmas Story" in "Ralphie's obsession with BB's gun seems to be very pretty, but his obsession with this movie is boring. Scud Farkus, the original bully of the neighborhood, is replaced by a boy and a strange hat, but Scud Farkus's threatening appeal has little to do, it would be quite difficult to be the same as the original, though this movie was made with the original crew.
