The show is average. I do not particularly laugh. However, I think that Courtney really comes out. It does not look natural. It has modes of speaking, robotic. He speaks quietly (without intonation), usually speaks (without intonation), or usually begins to speak and gradually shouts. However, it's like his cries "I pretend I cried out, I should not be loud enough". <br /> <br /> He is constantly knowing what a fun actor is doing. It's annoying. You can not really get your personality because it does not create emotions and not get angry. This husband, who does these stupid things, does not react. Very dry and plain.
