This movie was strange. The movie is based on a play. Now I am sure that everything in this movie is played well in a play, but it does not seem like a movie that looks pretty interesting. The movie "stage" is too much and they do not have to worry about interviewing a part of the interview for a movie. Everything that's been filmed today is filmed almost literally, playing with the main characters and acting interview. That's why the story really does not work and the movie visualization experience becomes almost obsolete. Outdated experience <br /> <br /> You realize that you are a comedy before you see it a bit. Initially, you think you are watching a theater, it has strange characters, but as the movie progresses, you will see that the movie is a tragicomedy, that is, it aligns more to the comedy genre. br /> <br /> Characters and conversations are really things that make this movie curious. Of course, they are great actors; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among others, but do not even take the movie to a "sufficient clock". <br /> <br /> The story is totally unpleasant. Basically, the story focuses on the brother / sister characters Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what is the story even more? The film is very poor and obsolete, with very little offer. As I said before; I'm sure the story is good and interesting on stage, but the movie is not adapting and it just does not work. <br /> <br /> The edition is horrible and time becomes and becomes. In some sequences, it is also dangerous. <br /> <br /> The director of J. Lee Thompson, of course, hopes he has made longer films than the one that failed, the theater theater, the project. <br /> <br /> Really not worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
