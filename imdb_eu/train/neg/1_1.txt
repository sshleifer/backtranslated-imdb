Robert DeNiro's illiterate of all times is more believable. This movie has little talent, it's really fun. The script is incredible. The conversation is incredible. Jane Fonda's character is caricatured and not funny. The film moves in the snail's rhythm, takes pictures that it is misleading and it is a distressing predicament. It also connects to all book clips. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent as an assistant, but what? <br /> <br /> So it's annoying to request ten lines for each review for the new IMDB rule. This movie is not valid, it does not require ten text lines to let other readers know that it's time and tape loss. Avoid the movie.
