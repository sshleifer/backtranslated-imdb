After seeing this movie soon, you will realize why it's not until it's been performed! This movie is not worth the tag "prequel". Instead, Hollywood is a plain topic, pre-movies, precious movies, etc. They shot <br /> <br /> At this movie plot, this place was bouncing on a ball of ping pong and it was the development of the character. do not exist I seriously felt that acting on comedy when watching some films was so bad. P Diddy has to infect her movies with her awesome performance; she laughs at me every time. <br /> <br /> The good thing that comes from this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis. Seeing this film has been a delight. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Carlito Way, do not see yourself. If you still see it, you decide how the original movie is ripped out, that's exactly what it is.
