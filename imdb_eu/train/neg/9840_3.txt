Christian Slater is all about cinema, independent, theater, an hour or so they waited for the treasure of that movie. The boy, I was disappointed. Julian Po never surpasses himself. The film is self-conscious. At that moment I found myself unable to stop unbelieving. Theatrical plays, of course, are theater plays, plays, of course, theatrical pieces - well, you get the idea. <br /> <br /> No sledge hammer style is required. And it's hard to feel a lot about Julian Po, we've never known much. The most horny girlfriend, the annoying people, the idiocy priest, the stupid children - why would anyone decide, especially in the long-term ambition (Slater's nature), to stop everyone from deciding?
