I mean it's a bad performance, but I think it was the director. I never thought Highlander a lot (the same director), but that could be blamed on the 80s. <br /> <br /> This, however, has no excuses. Do people shoot, when men go out of the punch! These types of mistakes, with dark, dark fighting tactics, unproductive cutting and bad visual effects, are a sub-par film of all. <br /> <br /> Then he commented on all American bullshit as much as he did. The German general almost frightened American privateity. Prepare a lot in compacted, even in small doses. <br /> <br /> In short, the war movie is not horrible, but definitely, in every aspect.
