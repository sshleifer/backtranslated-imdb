OK, the story does not make sense, the characters have no dimension, the best of the movies are good books, the cinema is a fog, and editing only a bit of mixing, but Sam has directed "Peckinpah." Somehow, his direction is not enough For those who enjoy Peckinpah and their excellent work, this movie is a disappointment, although a brilliant cast may release the audience's least effort. <br /> <br /> The answer to The Festival is San Peckinpah, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young It's also a contempt for Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill, and Gig Young. You can see excellent Peckinpah movies.
