My grandmothers and my sisters came to see this movie in the 1998 theaters, and fortunately we bought tickets, popcorn and soda and we went to the theater and sat to watch the movie. When it was over, the audience did not applaud, I recall that they did not like how they heard it, they did not like me, I did not like it, I thought it was stupid and I did not deserve it. seeing. Eddie Murphy was a hysterical, but, in spite of all, the whole movie was bad, I rarely laugh at this part, I also remember that in the theater, I almost did not laugh at other people. I really thought it was a bad thing to talk about animals, because only animals that live in cartoons exist, in live action movies, they are completely mutt! In addition to the hysterical tour of Eddie Murphy, I have not seen this movie, but stupid. <br /> <br /> I've seen Eddie Murphy in several movies and I thought I thought it was fun, I just said that I was the only fun part of this movie, I did not see Eddie Murphy really in "Great Pluto Nash". This movie is not the movie you see, in addition to Eddie Murphy, you probably do not like this, especially a lot of animals that speak to you! <br /> <br /> This movie can give you 3 stars to 5 stars.
