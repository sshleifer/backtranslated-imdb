This movie featured my favorite two Kilmer and Downey. Larry Miller is always nice in a small part. However, it seemed almost impossible to me. Michelle Monaghan may be nice but the charisma is almost free and the reason for her obsession with Downey's character does not make her understandable according to the information presented or portrayed. Finally, it seems to me unfamiliar, and although the intention is to give the viewers a headache and make the movies look like a wink, we can not leave peace or we can not even miss their protagonists. <br /> </ p> <p> The fans of the film say that people with disagreement "do not". I do not think that way. The plot was not difficult to understand. It was made of no interest and clumsy and of course it was manufactured. I do not like it. "I do not like it. A good example of the type of film that Shane Black's" Snatch "and" Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels "by Guy Ritchie," I Went Down "and Paddy Breathnach has noticed. br /> <br /> I share a birthday with Shane Black, but I want to distinguish her credits (especially scriptwriters) from any other connection.
