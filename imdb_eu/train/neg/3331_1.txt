They cover some of the three beautiful California movie festivals. Every night in the hotel they have to spend the night in a huge old house. They do not know how to kill something ... like it ... <br /> <br /> About. Horror "horror", useless and stupid. Bache and his two friends are beautiful, but the movie is too dull! Bache and his friends are not actors. Their faces are empty. The last "revelation" is laughably foreseeable and there is no way you keep the blood or gore not interested. There is a predicted nudity of women, but this is not enough to save. Doubtful, useless and unknown (good reason). A 1 full path.
