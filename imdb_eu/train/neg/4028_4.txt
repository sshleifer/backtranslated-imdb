This film was very good for actors (Robert Loggia, Ellen Parker), a good plot (from a space threatening the mysterious missile to a planet) and a lot more footage (if there were Air Lines). Unfortunately, it has ruined a melodrama and a timeline. <br /> <br /> The film creates a missile from a Soviet space attack and goes unnoticed into the atmosphere in the atmosphere. At speeds of less than five miles and at more than 4,000 kilometers, it emits a million leaks away, which burns on the ground, including glaciers, Distant Early Warning (DEW) and base skylights. <br /> <br /> All attempts to destroy the missile fail. <br /> <br /> The first first mistakes in this movie appear early. Although we do not expect much from the low budget film, some things can not be overlooked - like a little study. For example, the Soviets and the United States determine the anti-ballistic missiles with fire missiles. However, the first success of ABM tests did not take place until March 1961 by the Russians. <br /> <br /> There's not too much melodrama. Dr. Loring (Loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) relate to as many egg-board canteens. Parker's character tears and boo-hoos like a screen test on the sacrifice of the Loggia. Loggia is as heroic as bored. A scientist (Phillip Pine) cultivates so much that William Shatner looks like it. A bus driver constantly awakens the scene after the endless world of the scene. Only good actresses are Lawrence Dobkins ("Naked City"), a filmmaker directed by veteran actresses. <br /> <br /> All this can be overlooked for the timeline. After the missile information sent to DC, the Pentagon brings a group of scientists. A general (Larry Kerr) has announced that the missile will arrive in the city of New York for 63 minutes. Then there are controversies for scientists and there is a huge hole in the ambassadors, if the missiles are attacked by Russians and see if the answer is necessary. <br /> <br /> The film shows that the military were completely confused. People from Civil Defense leave their jobs and go to their stations. Eight million people go to sheltered shelters while school buses take millions of kids (and I'll see the white city of New York I've ever seen) even though the 50s science fiction movie was a standard observation. The press is kept in darkness for ten minutes. Then, terribly, a man from the Pentagon will reach Ottawa for 51 minutes, Canada. All of the aforementioned action took place in 12 minutes! Then, to add fuel to the fire, Loggia thinks a way to stop foreign missiles. Slowly, it slowly generates plutonium, it is loaded in a jeep and leads it to DC to a remote base missile to put it on a missile. Along the way, a wild driver throws him off the road, then fled. In the end, plutonium moves back and forth to combat the missile. Once again, it's all 63 minutes. <br /> <br /> The film also raises the viewer as it seems that it could be saved in Ottawa, to show off the men, women and children. The missile takes five minutes to reach New York. The loggia is still underway (4 more kilometers will go). He arrives at the base and carries the missile weapons and a two-minute countdown is announced. All in five minutes. New York neighborhoods should be minimal. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you missed the missile. ABM's head is destroyed with a massive explosion-based plutonium. Five seconds later, the explosion is dissipated and everything is clear. Yes, 100 Hiroshimas outnumbered New York on a nuclear explosion of 100 and nothing happened. Films B had all the necessary elements to make a good movie, but he lost them all. The loggia played its own character, so it did not matter to him strictly, he eventually sacrificed. They did not tell you about the other characters, nor the scientist who considered Pine. The tension that had to move along with the film was not physically permitted on the timeline (it would not be so much today or even with Jack Bauer). <br /> <br /> This movie is very difficult to find. As I know, there has been no news about any kind of support and good reason. I do not know if it was a normal movie or practice, but the government is a scene that sends the best scientists, the military and the businessman a deep shelter, saying they are valuable. There is not a single woman or a minority in the bunch. Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the movie and plays the piano a bit. An alien who was worse than "27 days" allows five Greeks to save or destroy the planet and not enter any black or Hispanic. <br /> <br /> I saw this in a special science night at Turner Classic Movies and I'm not expecting it again. If you find a copy of it somewhere, you should put it on Amazon.com.
