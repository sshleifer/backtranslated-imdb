It was very encouraging that we had seen my favorite stars 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They seemed very wonderful. But that was it. They did not work for good lines or characters. I did not understand or cared for what the characters did. <br /> <br /> Little girls' roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were pretty competent and confident in their friendly little sections. They showed some talents and it is sad that more and better films continue. Unfortunately, I do not think that Dorothy Stratten would have the opportunity to make her film an important role. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have some fans, and I was very open when I started to see it. . I am a great fan of Peter Bogdanovich, and I have enjoyed all of his first movie from "Cat's Meow" and "Targets" from "Nickleodeon". So, I was surprised that I could hardly see it awake. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is about a detective agency where detectives and clients cooperate. Five years later, Bogdanovitch's girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd, had a successful "Moonlighting" TV series starring Bogdanovich's story. Of course, the series of inequalities existed by those who have a great deal of conversation, while trying to join slapstick and screwball lines. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: there is no pale version of "Paper Moon" and "What's Up, Doc" only.
