Well, the essence of Jesus in Montreal is a smart film. Actors are very good and the film's technical side is fine. But, I was very interested in the topic and I was interested in thinking and arguing about religion (I'm hardly an atheist), it was difficult to see the movie bitter and, to my mind, to somehow consciously end my fun. Why is this movie very boring? I do not know. It's just not recommended.
