Well, it's a short and sweet review ... It was something that the movie had to be taken into practice and its life shorter and sweeter than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie is $ ^ @%. The good thing is that there has been more than 40,000 signatures to stop Uwe Boll to shoot people who love movie franchises. Blood Rayne is having a biggie. <br /> <br /> Jokes are good ... if you have not heard each other a thousand times. Playing is the origin, but I can guess the script really for that. Although I sometimes ask for a script. <br /> <br /> The film has nothing to do with the original games. If you played HELLO games, you know that the main character has not played a real motivation for homicidal outsourcing as a mass murder because he stubbed or simulated his toe. The stupid story is like that story too. as I said. I would not even steal this movie. And according to what it says in 2007, it's "The funniest movie of 2007" ... It's better to look around, the news is better than this.
