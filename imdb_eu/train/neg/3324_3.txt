I saw this accident in the summer afternoon. She was playing in the family programming channel. Initially, according to what I thought was Disney's animation. But in a few minutes, I found myself remote, so I found 'INFO BUTTON' to find out what's in my television world. I have no opposition to Harvey F. I enjoyed it in many of its films, but one thing is not a voice artist. Surely one of Hollywood's most important voices, but only works as part of a larger visual package. It was difficult to see the voice sticking to a duck stick. Like the rest cast, it's not inspired. Working on this movie was not a good voice for that talent. <br /> <br /> So, a weak voice talent, strong animations ... who was directed at this film? Teenage Gay Duck? I do not know. Are there so many young role models and homosexuals coming up with an animated duck? Nice story, and like the title, I thought it was hard to love this movie, like a duckling duckling.
