This is a movie with a spectacular box of videos, but has unknown camera talk and talk badly. Even though dark killings occur, you can hardly see it, the film is very difficult to understand. This is WCW Vanessa Sanchez (Tygres WCW folded before) and she is a good actress. I like the little preview movie, especially if it's a mistake, because seeing is fun, but scattered is not one of them. This movie is fine if you want voodoo and cunning head, but if you need something new, then pay a drop in the rent.
