The worst movie ever, this is a statement on the IMDb here that people often throw around. The Uwe Boll movie, the latest classics such as Manosen's Hands of Fate, or the last summer of Michael Bay's summer act, often jump fast when they're doing worse on the table. movie world <br /> <br /> I envy these people, because they are ignorant and they do not know how deep the cycle rabbits do. There are movies so bad, so stupid, so ridiculously improper and so hilarious that the cultures around it are to celebrate their immense horrors and their discussion boards are the best places on the Internet, unanimously agree that this film is really bad. <br /> <br /> Women and gentlemen, I present to you Ben and Arthur, a 85-minute night's epic, that is like a bad car that is so bad, you know it's horrible but you can not stop watching. Author of the "Hollywood Actor, Director", and I'm sorry if I give it to Sam Mraovich. This film has a horrifying horror. Let me know how this project is guided. Mr. Mraovich did not direct this film, wrote, produced, produced the director, got it, edited it and eventually starred. This is a man who has blinded his own ego, and thus believes in a genius that does not exist, like someone who is ugly with a child, fails to know that his wild creations really disagree. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie fails in an epic level, the performance is the worst thing to ever hear, it's the horny one in the plot, it's the best amateur edition and cinema, although it's like music nail polish. I know here that they have done a bit of tangent, but please believe me, as I am saying, as I am describing this film, I would say dirty movies were filmed in a movie tape, but it was true that it was not filmed in the movie, filmed in a digital camera, sitting in your wardrobe It's much better than that. Do not be misunderstood, I forgo low budget movies, if it's an interesting concept, for example, as I do not like. Blair Witch Project has shown that low budgets can still be an interesting movie. Ben and Arthur do not have a good concept to go back, even if the movie was shot in 20 million quotes with the best Hollywood actors, the plot is horrible and the characters are even worse. One of the main characters that is not Arthur Samraovich, who is not Arthur, is one of those bad turds that are put in more than one movie. You will not like it for 5 minutes from the beginning of the film and at the end of the film, hatred will become completely. It seems that Mr. Mraovich has forgotten that we suppose that it is a mistake for the hero. <br /> <br /> I do not want to ruin all the gritty delights that you enjoy watching this movie (I'm not paying you for this, so I'll give you two slow models, just as stupid, dear and warm as the movie is, amongst the smallest errors in the movie. One of the main characters we hear is that they "know a good lawyer and give him a call to HIM." Then the movie disappears and I talked earlier that I'm a woman, I think it's a pretty flawed post-production. The second is easy, this transsexual lawyer Afterwards, the characters are called to go to Vermonta, then we cut the backs of an airplane, which spans the palms between the sunny areas. I'm never in Vermont personally, but I'm sure there is no palm tree there. <br /> <br /> Imagine With an inconspicuous conversation of one hour and half an hour of amateur amateur, and multiplied and then multiplied by 10 and you have not yet fully prepared for Ben and Arthur. Imagine the worst movie you've seen in your life and think it's still worse and you're still not at the same level as Ben and Arthur, the movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> However, we should be glad in a sense, such as movies are a real curiosity. For a few days we hope to become a filmmaker or a screenwriter. Just because we have a new sense of trust, we know what is happening, that is, as rough as the amateur can. <br /> <br /> Genuine one, the worst movie of all time has been discovered, and is called Ben and Arthur.
