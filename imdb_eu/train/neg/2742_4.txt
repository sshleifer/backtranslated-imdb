I watched this movie channel surfing. My first reaction was: 'God again!' This day, the tendency to postpone, is very much like it, and it has become a sinister and disgraceful act. For some reason, however, I stopped and saw it until the end. Maybe it was a belief in the actors, when I expected something to encourage them. <br /> <br /> And surely they can take off and take hell. In addition, the end of the film becomes something better and really makes a point. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter also surprised me with her character. He has a side that uses Jane to keep distance and compassion. He is soft again in search of love. The only thing that surprised me was the nature of Branago ... it was the victory of the theater, the film itself is not the only thing. <br /> <br /> See if you are a student ... they are looking for pure entertainment. Sean Penn is serious! Oh my, that's been a bit hard for a couple of jokes ... it's not even the escapists.
