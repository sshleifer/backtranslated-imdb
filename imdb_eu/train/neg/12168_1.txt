This movie was bad at the beginning. The only goal of the film was to get Angela a large body. The performance was horrible. The killings were very badly played. Like I got up, I think Ally's house was abolished. But when the movie is over, Molly and the other fonts will see Ally in the cage, so Angela needs to go to her. She was really part of the black girls and Angela cabin, and Angela played guitar cats and cried out. It was horrible, and why do not you turn it over and break the whore ?!?!? Then when Angela Angel goes after a neighbor, why did not you turn him over and screw him up? So stupid. This movie sucked ...
