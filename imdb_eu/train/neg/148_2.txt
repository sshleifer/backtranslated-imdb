I am now Iraqi doing the work of cinema that is doing a lot of time. We also penetrate many pirated movies. In the meantime, it has come along with 11 other films, and I've seen it for the longest time. I have seen some other reviews that are taken seriously by this movie, but I think this is a horrible cover. It is not a tongue on cheeks, writers thought that Blade was improving the movie. This movie is over Vampire Assassin, if you have not seen it, I recommend it. At least, this movie is so compelling that you are harder than you think. That's never a recovery quality. from bad performance, to topical symbols (ie, initial credits), first special effects of fertilizers. they could not get empty tracks, that is, they should do with the movie they shot, but if you want to use the effects, close them. In regards to the cast, it seems that they were just going to be a tae bo class and just pick the first Chicken that ugly Chicken that walked. Again, in Ron Hall, like the Vampire Assassin, do not leave stunt folk action, they can not. Similarly, the comment on this is "the return of the old vampires' old movies ... no, it's not. That's all the new vampire films. Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Blade, Underworld, all super stars super-vampires are fighting. This is the newest vampire genre, bad blood, fake screams and theater theater. Of course, anyone who writes a good review about it is connected to the movie cast. But what matters to me, I paid 33 cents. In any case, someone decided to make a film in the first half of the film, much better than I can afford. Of course, I know I can not even make movies, so I did not try. I know how to watch movies. I work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, I've seen thousands of times thousands of times and this has been so bad in the midst of a worm attack.
