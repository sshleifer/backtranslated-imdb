We saw the 18/6/2009? 10 of 10 (Dir-Pete Riski): a curious psychotic movie about a autistic autistic girl who is in the hospital, shakes power and then breaks all hell. Actually, I do not know what the director has been. We arrived at the next hour and a half (at least not longer), a horror / rundown drama / zombiefest / ghost movie that was really unending and without any sense. Initially, after leaving the power, everyone is missing out on hospital, except for a small group of misfits aimed at girl and dad's boys. It seems like a typical annoying character, an awesome man of age, and a horrible type of horror, and, of course, a young girl who attracts the main character. Temporary things happen just like ghosts and monsters, which suggests that time has stopped, and when the deceased groups try to escape as they try dead. Of course, autism is a bit like this. I really hate how the girl's confusion was used, and that it was a reason to insinuate and care for the people in a hospital. We're never really found the answer to what's happening, which is very rare, so please avoid this dog. If you do not want to confuse it for an hour and a half, it's not for you or for filmmakers. What time to lose? Really!
