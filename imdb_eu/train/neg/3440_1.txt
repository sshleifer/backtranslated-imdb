never seen this movie ... it's the biggest pile ever I've ever encountered ever. and he's saying something. The story, the story and the shooting were totally false, that is, WORLD CINEMA LONG! Have you ever seen any success in sainsburys costing 99p and it was only made in 2005? This hahaha movie is like a college movie, you can see the camera in the corner of the screen ... even if you really want to see "scary shark" ... the best performance. I saw in my life ... ha ha. I mean seriously this is the greatest waste of 2 1/2 hours EVER !!
