If the movie was created with a thermometer, this movie would be absolute zero. From ten boxes I would value this: <br /> <br /> Argument: zero stars Video quality: zero stars Sound quality: zero stars Action: zero stars <br /> <br /> It is enough that high school students gather at a camera with an afternoon They had a plot and they filmed the movie. There is so much artistic value left that kids at school need to walk around the movie I prefer. <br /> <br /> However, there is something to be said about deep-skinned. Climbing "shooting" is one of the funniest stages in the train ever trained. First of all, the fighters flush each other into the track to shake their arms and retreat. The couple have bullets that do not exist with each other "duck". There's no squibs, no spark, empty, just spraypainted squirtguns around to shake around. If two adults want to play "actors", turn one day ... after cleaning the refrigerator, it will comb your carpet, close the door, circular gravel, books on the shelves, etc. Correct .
