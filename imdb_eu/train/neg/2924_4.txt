Here there was something with the female head, always having the worst way of life with a perfect life, with the prostitute at the start of the child and with Eric Roberts. However, his background is not possible to trust Dean Cain, which ultimately destroys it. It seems strange to me, but I really like Dean Cain's position and the opportunity he has made. He can not hurt because he loves his love and is the mother of his child (I think it's time to limit his children and not his brothers), but he can not forgive all that he has done. with his brother (that is, showing the love and duty that he felt in a way) and then part of his death. In the best hands, the movie would be better, but at the end of the day I got caught up with the cable, it's not bad.
