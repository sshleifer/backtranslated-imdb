"Filmak" monitors the low budget genre, which is a very effective and successful mobile camera. <br /> <br /> This fails, and HOW. <br /> <br> </ p> <p> It's amazing how many so-called "rewards" rubbish rubbish on the cover ... you ask what these critics presented ... <br /> <br> </ p> <p> This movie describes the missing words It's really that great. Really, a bad one. <br /> <br /> I saw it flat for 20 minutes, almost in constant progress. <br /> <br /> From scratch lighting, from fearless management, from bitter sound and sour faces to the ABYSMAL, and of course, this piece of filming was completely and completely pathetic. <br /> <br /> It's important, there's no quality of recovery - whatever. Save your money and watch a horror short film, there are many - Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC, just called a few. <br /> <br /> Avoid this garbage at all costs. Do not waste your money or have time to become a real movie of the trash. <br /> <br /> Check out the other comments! You have warned!
