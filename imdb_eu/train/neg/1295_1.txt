This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I love Japanese movies, and I think another movie is a masterpiece by a director, electric dragon, 80,000 v. I really liked this movie - Asano is an excellent actor and the story is very attractive. but I can not find anything about it. <br /> <br /> The film takes forever to prevent anything from happening. and the effects used by the director - just like the use of continuous percussion and slow movement - added that the confusion with her was that the plot was so slow and that the actors were overwhelmed. The boredom was not created due to excessive abuse. In this way, an asana broke through an Buddha statuette and told what it does not worship. This has not added anything to the plot. One Japanese classmate and one of my colleagues continued our time continuously. We could not believe that this film was so huge. and the end was horrible. The director at least tried to try to get the viewer through the network, but unfortunately it was wrong.
