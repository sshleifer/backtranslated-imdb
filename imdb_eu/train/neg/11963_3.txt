I like Billy Crystal, and I thought I'd love to watch the fun movie, because he admired Alan King and it would be fun to be together. I've seen all Billy movies, but I did not remember this and now I know why. It is full of false clich√©s and emotions; You can smell each of the coming scenery (and go!). Billy is not too much fun. He is busy with tearing tears, or for his effort to show his father so badly. Alan King is quite nice as well as being an extra movie. But the coincidence that coincides with Billy's father as a major health crisis, etc. Or two busy doctors can turn off their internships to get the moon around the LA. When it's over, when will it come soon! Almost writers realized that they were almost out of the corner, and it was the only way to make a scene of death. The most depressing brightness of good humor.
