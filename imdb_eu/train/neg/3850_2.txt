I saw the movie in SXSW with the director. A few people came out and the audience barely applauded. At the 60 or 70 film I watched at the festival, Frownland is the worst. <br /> <br /> At least 95 minutes is at least 95 minutes too long. The head of the main character's communication attempt came out in real time. We give you the same conclusions, oral movements, kinetic, and words and syllables that are completely repeated - KNOW YOUR POINTS. <br /> <br /> The site actually compares work to Mike Leigh early. What drugs should you do to make this statement? Due to the song Frownland Captain Beefheart, perhaps you should be able to enjoy the Replica Trout Mask on the heavy rotation to get to know this movie. Unbelievably, he won the Jury Prize at the festival. You can opt for the Audience Award.
