TV show in the 1980s, updated with feminine fresh meat and common language. "The Hazzard Dukes" passed me; I did not repeat that I was in front of the television in New York or California; or I would probably see it. However, somewhere (along with the updated 2005 release of this film), I said the Dodge Charger was fast orange, and "General Lee" is still good. <br /> <br /> Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville cousin hunky (Orange and Bo Duke Duke) are the New Orange Sage Circuit. Beautiful Jessica Simpson (like Daisy) fills her very short, but the bikini pink bikini can not even turn off competition, from a bedroom with topless coeds. Stupid drawing The Burt Reynolds ("Boss" Hogg) threatens to become a Countess Hazzard County. <br /> <br /> ** The Hazzard Dukes (27/07/27) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds
