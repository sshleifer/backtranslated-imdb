I've watched the movie recently and it's similar to the book's foundation. I blame you for scriptwriting and bad guys. Some parts came into effect (scene of gay rapa), without apparent reason. I read the book after reading the movie for about 20 years or the first time. It was difficult to read and clumsy. There are different ideas that are not excessive ... than the most sensational part of that period. At least, considering the things that were sensitive to communication, I can see the fascination created at that time. This has not happened anymore, or maybe I see things differently or both. The film tries to cover various aspects of the book, which includes scenes that make sense of someone who reads the book. However, it's a difficult movie to watch, and it may not be necessary.
