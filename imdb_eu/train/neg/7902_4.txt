Cute and playful, but hands and cheap. 'Munchies' was the Gremlins clone that emerged from the 80's. I am not imitating a lot of people. <br /> <br /> First, 'Gremlins' were great. <br /> <br /> Then came the average 'Critters'. <br /> <br /> We do not forget the 'Ghoulies' lie. <br /> <br /> But all the pits should go to Hobgoblins. <br /> <br /> Is there anymore? <br /> <br /> Now, Munchies, for me Ghoulies and Hobgoblins should fall somewhere. Actually, it seemed more fun than "Ghoulies", but I chose a darker shade. <br /> <br /> Go-get is considered to be a goofy character, but in this way you can get a hammy performance (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips), but overbearing. See listening to the horns. Where it's fun In most cases the soul is lightweight, since the story is mostly directed at munchy (hungry, hilarious, and destructive) in a number of comical encounters (sometimes worked) in a desert town like a couple of people. It's funny, but it's amazing thanks to excellence. The creatures themselves look bland and quite accurately, because they are the basic dolls. Who are the people who arrive can really speak ... and with a stance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Charlie Stratton and Nadine Van der Velde are powerful (' Critters' was) were right reasons. Harvey Korman was admitted in two roles. Robert Picardo will also appear. <br /> <br /> A little entertainment with pleasure.
