I saw this video in a friend's house. I'm glad that I have not lost any money. It has a 1975 movie scene on the cover of Capricorn One video. The films begin with a few rocky blasts, most of which are not linked to flight crew. Sibrele's smoker is a short video that prepares video broadcasts by astronauts. He edited it in the same way, to hear what the crew could say. The video ends mainly with the exhibition of the Zapruder movie. I think it's ignorant about radiation, sponsorship, starlings, and others, or that it has a sort of axis against NASA, astronauts, or, in general, American Americans. His science is bad, and the video is too bad.
