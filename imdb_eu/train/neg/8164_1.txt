I watched this movie in a real theater (probably $ 2.00) with my cousin and my uncle. I think we were between 11 and 12 years old, and in really horrifying movies. I remember feeling so excited that my cool uncle let us select the movie (and probably we will never have to do it again!) And then we are disappointed !! Boring and not scary The only thing I remember was from Silver Coke, Corky Pigeon, which was not so great, I confessed to someone. I've seen old movies and this has always been the worst in my head. This is what we can remember, the boring, non-scary, waste of our $ 6 collective, and the loss of the movie. I read some versions that say it's worth a clock and I say "Too every own," but I would not worry. It's not so bad as good.
