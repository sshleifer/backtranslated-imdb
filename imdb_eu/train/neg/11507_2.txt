Guy Ritchie's effort is noble, knocked, raped, thrown, kicked, fisted, spit, fist, sodomized, and mistreatment due to the immense performance of Madonna. His performance was a graduate of Al Drama and Public Speech at Al Gor. Guy Ritchie made a noble attempt to confirm this, and if you rejected ALL the scenes of his wife, it's a good movie. I think the best work that we will ever perform will be, that Guy needed to comfort his wife, that shooting his performance was good enough. If you can see Swept Away or watch the footwear of the 89 minutes ... go to the pedicure width.
