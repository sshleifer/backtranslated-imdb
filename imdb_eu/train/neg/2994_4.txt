I've seen this movie twice and I've liked it twice. It's a fast pace and fun, but in the end it's wrong. It is worth mentioning that it was thrown into the trash, which could give a good follow-up to the original seminary. It's obvious that "Zombie Creeping Flesh" has been a great achievement for Bruno Mattei's shortcomings and that Fulda is so wonderful. This is not Fulci sycophancy idle, the directors are completely contrasted, and you can direct who, especially, Mattei. <br /> <br /> The movie is about to appear a virus (the strangely cited Scientists seem to be "overwhelmingly secretive", seemingly apparent that the secret is more pronounced than the apocalyptic effect on humanity (Southeastern Asia), which causes a similar type of zombie caused by the virus , and the virus extends a seemingly arbitrary area of ​​land. Both protagonists risk our dangers dangerously and have to fight off their lives against Asian infected. <br /> <br /> The film is in the middle of being a zombie gore movie and out It's an action adventure, and this confusion has clearly caught the zombies themselves. It does not seem that they all have a common feature. Some have the usual mix of souls, the original and surely Fulci's creativity here. The other major groups are losing all those who feel infected by the virus But they struggle with a wild attack and a black nigger: they are not sure to go If they are still a routine technician or are sure to follow. to engage his brother who looks like his unmarried cousin. Martial arts skills are not their only talents; For the tactics of the war are well understood, which are hidden under medium oaks and grasses, and sometimes they have no explanation from heaven. This is definitely the work of Matthew. <br /> <br /> A third, more template, there is a zombie variety. This kind ironically also keeps meaning "I really thirst ... IN YOUR BLOOD." At the end of the DJ, at the end of the preaching of the gibberish libretto of human destiny, it improves the WTF factor and eliminates the expectation of a serious resolution. <br /> <br /> Afterwards, the evil head of the zombie that impels the air afterwards, overlooks a jolly smile, as if it were a bit like a bad look. Dimensional mode. However, his dialogue and dubious dubbing really prevents us from getting into a serious situation. Afterwards, the first soldier who dying encourages a credible display against an unstoppable zombie pain. In fact, this is the first and perhaps only true agricultural area, and one of the most effective scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> The guy who played the lead singer has a heart, but he has no talent, using pauses. Its lines are completely random, so it's like a confused asmatism. The scientists who try to find an antidote are completely convinced that "we now allow these two molecules to be put together!" <br /> <br /> There are moments that are still very effective. At first it explores a garage abandoned by a female protagonist. We are facing a dreadful view of the dreadful figures in the corner and entering a room and we see a mass that is tangled in the ground, shot in a blurred light in the atmosphere. Silence is constantly stopping due to the rapid breakdown of a zombie. His aggressiveness is one of the horrible horror films. It is transmitted through the hotel that includes the first events of the reflection phase before and after, and later as a refuge for our protagonists, it is encouraged with a damp atmosphere. There is a scene among the soldiers, who is clearly approaching the hordes of the deceased approaching the wardrobe, which is quite tense. It becomes dramatic when they do not know when they do not know the hotel on the upper floor when they do not see them. But this is not so rugged and it has not been as effective as it was. <br /> <br /> I can all say that the film is effectively called zombies, which are effectively effective in the film. bad cinema just or fair. Simply, the 80's Italian and gory have a lot of hope for anything I hope.
