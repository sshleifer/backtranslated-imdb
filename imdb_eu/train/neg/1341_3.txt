After the success of the Gilligan's Island TV movie series, they made several TV shows in the 1980s from classic shows. Most of these films miss the ship when the spectacles are so special in recovering humor. THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is desperate for the style of Lauren and Hardy, because it was not in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, the series is an excellent and essential comedy, is totally wasted: this 90-minute movie is less than in any single episode of 30 minutes. And despite the fact that the papers of "Eddie" and "Marilyn" are more than just a cameo in this movie, what was to become younger and refinement? With no new writing, they can use Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Even though some monsters seemed to be terribly terrified to my relatives, I did not enjoy Sid CÃ©sar as a mad scientist, especially because he did not have too much or not enough Munsters (probably in that year, the Caesar couple in 1981. Like Imogene Coca comedy, He turned the wrong way into a TV show, returning BEVERLY HILLBILLIES). At the beginning of the film a curious explanation is represented as a Munster family's wax, a local horror wax in the museum. Why should the "supposed" American family be "curious" (but curious), not famous monster? This was Munsters's latest project in its roles, which is a resurrecting series that was horrible at the end of the 1980s, which was completely new and in the 1990s there was a television movie in a DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest and Patrick camera. family dining
