In 1941, he was the main studio in Columbia and created a film with the same technical film as MGM, Paramount or Warners. That's what can be said about "Adam Had Four Sons," Ingrid Bergman (who first bounces on American films for the first time) and with almost flat screenplay by Warner Baxter. Bergman plays a French woman (this time Hollywood considered a foreign accent to be as good as another) he governed four of Baxter's children and stayed there (with a breakdown of the stock market in 1907). The men who are serving in World War II. All of the films are pretty good. When Susan Hayward gets in halfway, she's a good relief? The only person in the movie is Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; Is it also the first long-term survivor of alcoholic aspects? But the script continues to be sassy and the end is wonderful. It's not surprising four years later that Bergman has made the "valley of the decision" similar.
