Having started playing online in Toronto, he has got good press releases. The Film Festival, there were reasons for not expecting so much. One: it's a low-budget Canadian movie. Two: the same person writes, directs and stars (usually a bad sign, unless Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two respected filmmakers). But despite seeing reduced expectations, I still believed that there was much more despair than I thought. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, bad script, bad performance, awesome management! Do not waste your time or money on this turkey. It's a comedy, but I laughed twice. Also, music is awful. I do not know how to care.
