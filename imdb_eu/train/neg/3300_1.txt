This type of Swedish movie is very typical. The roommate said the performance was a bad thing, usually the actress gives a good show. The casting was bad, something you expected (you do not say what). The leader was horrible ... I do not know where they find it. In any case, do not worry about it and see "Den Tredje VÃ¥gen", that is, the Swedish prime action.
