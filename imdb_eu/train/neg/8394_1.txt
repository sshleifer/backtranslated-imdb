The extra Z-grade DTV is a horror movie. <br /> <br /> But with lines: <br /> <br /> "It's easy to die, often, often" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "Why do you read the book? that? "Because the soil is more interesting" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "You made the way here, now you can leave again!" (When he drives a man in the basement) <br /> <br /> (and sings what they sing) <br /> <br /> - It's not so clear about what the film is about to be post-structural, or bad filmmaking. The play is made dreadfully, but I know some actors, and so hamming it up? <br /> <br /> An old house, the house that lives in that time clearly, is a murder area. A (bad) movie is made for a reason and the story is re-ignited.
