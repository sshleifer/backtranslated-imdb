This is a great catastrophe of a movie. From the beginning to the end, it has a bad performance and worse management and editing. The only recoverable part of the movie is Streisand's number, because Kristofferson's fragments are not visible or can not be heard. The main problem in this film is that we do not see the character of Kristofferson in his time or Streisand's character struggling. The first one is to see a fall and the second rise. Streisand and the last numbers may be one of the main finalists of the film, if it needs to be directed and edited. The solo duration of the song was a great mistake. If the group, audience and stage scenarios were large, this number could be dynamic and interesting. This film has to be directed and edited by the imbalances of classmates at the NYU film schools. The only thing worse will be a wicked script. The last number of music is the only essential part of this film, and it is totally distorted by the worst technical decisions.
