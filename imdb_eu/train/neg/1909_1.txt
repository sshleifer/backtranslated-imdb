I have never seen one of the worst romantic comedies (the worst of movies). Boy (who works as a psychic phone) has to look gay to enter the apartment with a woman of her dreams. Hilarity is not following. Burglaries, light gay-bashing and a horrible conversation. If you read Brad Meltzer and it's like a wonderful conversation, you'll like this movie. <br /> <br /> Be smart. Avoid. If you see it, destroy the copy.
