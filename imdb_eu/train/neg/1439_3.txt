I give 3 stars for the beautiful African images. The rest ... it was pretty boring. About 50 minutes away from the plot scheme ... In World War II, the entry level lasted, oh, for about 10 minutes? Then it was a real action! It's something like this: "Walk through the savannah and breathe into beautiful sunsets!" And maybe he gave a message, "Do not kill elephants!" Very ecological I waited for Steven Segal's "new" movie, not of these ... The main actor is thinking of an artificial zipper, stained hair and too much base! And I did not see the scene when her hair was confused, or she sweat it, or her clothes were dusty. It's just a 19-year-old woman! And in a bar, where our heroine is looking, he comments on the Commander Swayze as Dracula's appearance. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and became famous in the following years. Livingstone and other explorers went to the middle of Africa between 1840-1880. If the action takes place between 1896 and 1900. Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze makes a pleasant impression as in the seat - hard on the outside, but soft and smooth on the inside. I would immerse myself with a nut, but you get it. She really manages to look like a puppy on her face. The movie is astonished. Too long and increasingly boring. do not see! Buy no! It's a waste of money!
