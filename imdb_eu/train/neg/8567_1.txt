When I rented this movie, I had very little hope ... but when I saw it, I noticed that the movie was less (much less) than I expected. The actors were bad (the doctor's wife was the worst), the story was so absurd ... It could work for a Disney movie (except murder), but this is not a comedy, it's a past masterpiece. stupidity Except for a well-chosen title, it would add the stupid movie after Dead Husbands! I give them 5 and a half.
