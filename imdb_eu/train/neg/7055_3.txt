"JAWANI DIWANI" is just a pathetic movie. I agree with the last joyce "I lost Joyride". lol. <br /> <br /> The jokes were incredible. The performances were average. Something went wrong with the movie. Emraan deserved something better. CELINA JAITLEY showed all. Hrishitta was okay. Emraan hashmi is ok too. <br /> <br /> MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a guy who wants to become a celebrity. So she uses RADHA and she loves her, her father is a music director and she only works for celebrities (her father fills everything that his daughter has said). One day, MANN and his friends go to GOA to have fun. He is known by ROMA (CELINA JAITLEY) and looks completely oblivious to his BLA BLA flirt with her. <br /> <br /> Then, that night, ROMA can not open the door of her room, and MANN decides for her help. Also, ROMA can not see it, the ROMA asked for help. Meanwhile, MANN decides to open and open the door BLA BLA BLA. ROMA enters and has a night stand. One night, Romara falls in love with her. That morning, they see those who watch the world (MAHESH). Mom loves ROMA and can not see what to see. He married them and ordered them, fearing it, mann orders and Merry's ROMA. Then her new wedding will end in the newspaper. MANN later finds ROME loves having a music video. Now it is trapped between love and glory. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> The movie is awesome. The songs "SINI NE SINI NE" are superb, and the recovery version is even better. "DIL DIWANA" is also great. The title track is wonderful. BABIES, CAN NOT VOID YOUR VIDEO.
