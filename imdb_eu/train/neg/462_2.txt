This should be one of the worst movies of all time. Awesome play, awesome script ... and good points! One definitely lost! The jokes, if they had been called, were predictable as pathetic. Pamela Anderson is still confident that her work is as simple as plastic. I was ready to give it a chance, I expected it would improve, oh no! If you are a selection of books and books, I recommend you read it right! I like Denise Richards, that's why I went on this movie, but why did she let her get herself in this movie!
