This adaptation, just like in 1949, The Heiress * (Henry Heiress *), is based on the novel Henry James. * Heiress *, the star of Olivia de Havilland, remains a respected work, despite the fact that this new remake of Jamesen's original title is less true. Her daughter (Finney) is a bad and caring daughter (Leigh), after her mother died in childbirth. Father's father does not consider his daughter, and understands it as much as every woman. Good families and a young man who seems lucky to go to court, the Father, of course, is suspicious, but his daughter does not feel any interest, the young man is lucky and forbids him. to watch him Leigh is a controversial actor? Most loved or hated either? and always has special sensitivities and tensions with his style, as in the case of dental skin. Is not this wrong, and does it play a pretty skilled role? It's just a difficult task for any actor, because the audience wants to take the characters by their shoulders and feel shaky. While the character captures a lot of sympathy, it is not very pleasing. Ben Chaplin is very beautiful and attractive (before * The Truth About Cats and Dogs *), he or she is in love with the exact number of mysteries to see the audience after his or her fortune. . Maggie Smith is one of the best actors and raises the film's height with a portrait of the aunt's senses. Finney is a wonderful, of course, as a father who dissolves for her daughter's disobedience, but her daughter loves to endanger her daughter. But does his passionate friend still want his wealth? This is * Washington Square * * * is different from a heir *. Another case is sticking to it. It's a pretty boring dish like a tap, and it's a small story that's too long.
