Beast Wars transformers grow, I was not very familiar with the original Transformers, and now I've seen an awesome movie, and now I've seen an older cartoon based, I like the original cartoon action with original cartoons and Beast Wars. <br /> <br /> I do not like BW characters, I think that the characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. <br /> </ p> <p> I mean, "AUTOBOT transforms and exits!" "MAXIMAL MAXIMIZE!" It's much better than that. The original voice of Optimus Prime still believed that he was a real commander, and more than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> <br /> Also, Powermaster Optimus Prime is much stronger than Optimus Optimus. Check it out on the web! <br /> <br /> In the nature of Megatron BW, the original series looked like a fun version of the bad version. <br /> <br /> As cooler, it changes the robots or robots that are changing. to vehicles and spaces? Gimme the original Transformers Beast Wars any day!
