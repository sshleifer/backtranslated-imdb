I find it surprising that anyone involved in the production of this series would accept responsibility. The script is so unknown that anyone who writes about Comedy Writers' Union entry has failed to write (and that's what he says!). Take out your binoculars if you like, but there's nothing like a joke. Ronnie Corbett had to break away from trash. The rest of the casts do not play before the first episode of lack of comics or comic performance, as well as after the auditions. Those who like to say they should be very entertained. The production costs are obvious for every 100 episodes. And if anyone thinks I've commented on someone who does not know English humor as a foreigner, I should add that I'm an Englishman.
