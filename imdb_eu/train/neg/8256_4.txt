The only thing you can think of describing the movie is: Common. <br /> <br /> The line around the suicide character of Gary Sinise is a hilarious premise, something similar. Did he drive golf balls to the ocean in a cabin, could he not manage the profit / proficiency of the golf community? cry me the river. I would like to be my problem. I enjoy Dylan Baker and Sinise, but this film was the correct choice or payment for Sinise. In the small Timmy Price a small club in front of his father will receive oral abuse. I am ashamed to see that.
