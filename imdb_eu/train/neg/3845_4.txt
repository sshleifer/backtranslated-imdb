Although Bette Davis made a stir with Mildred, I felt the best I did not watch the movie. At the end of the movie, I felt it was missing something missing. Leslie Howard was very good at Philip Carey as a lover, and they were so unhappy in the movie because he was in love with that movie. It is a pretty thing that is in love with a bad seed. And especially if someone like Philp Carey is sensitive, it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> In the end, what happened was the performance and not the plot. The final scene was particularly good, but I did not want to give it up. Although others find this movie well, I've found that. I'd recommend this movie for those who like bad seed to see what will happen to them when they're in love with that awesome person.
