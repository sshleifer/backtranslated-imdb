I was not "lucky" as others commented on this film: I never saw anything else ... we'll say ... Sarno's "fruitful" mind. I'm very much in favor: some of the actors who spend a lot of time with topless and (go-go) dance are not really attractive. I liked Fraulein Crank (?) ... it was so nice, it was nice! The performance was quite obsolete, even if the lines were delivered in the second language, if they had much to do with this problem. The main chore was to avoid following the plot: was there any one? I heartily agree with another comment: for a vampire movie, there is not much blood. Yes, if you want good whirlwinds, watch classic Hammer like "Dracula's fear" and "Dracula's bride". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's the most humorous one. Mrs. Doctor removes clothes from a bat-cloud ... you have never seen ... bats, I mean. <br /> <br /> It is ok if you capture the cable mode in the North of the North of the North, but, gladly, do not rent it!
