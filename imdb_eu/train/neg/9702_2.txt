I do not think this movie has been rated correctly. I took my copy and covered the PG and I wrote R. I would NOT recommend it for those under 17 or under 18, because R is the limit. <br /> <br /> Why? It has a scene in the jungle, with many topless women. I do not know for you, but this is not seen by little children. True, I think it might be traditional "style of clothing" in the African (?) Indians, but ... I think the partial nudity should be given to a R film. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the movie recently, but I think it was OK.
