This movie shows no charm and a bit of warmth, but eventually this effort is useless and excessive. Mary Tyler Moore definitely knows what to do with the screen time, but the protagonist moves away from the rest of the work. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the excess of the script. topical She is a daughter who is hiding from the university, an old woman who is difficult to achieve a job (and, first of all, ends up with an inappropriate job), the executive network executive with her executive toys, shines more than the substance. for his beliefs, etc. There is nothing wrong with one of them, that is, they are really rooted in reality, but they are a lot left together and we already have too many voices and little surprises.
