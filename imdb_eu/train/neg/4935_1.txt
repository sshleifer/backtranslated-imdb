"Cavemen" exceeded my hopes and not in a good way. I was worse than I thought. Basically, here's the show: The Cavemen are a spare race, they face prejudices, etc. It's probably the stupid idea ever created. it is worth the time to imprison for writers. A show was gathering men who joined a club, trying to pick up girls, and then something else happened. He recalls a 22-minute interview with Andy Rooney, and then slaughtered knife knives for many cannibalists. For those who have not seen this show, it's an example of the conversation: "You're sure to agree that you're riding a man." "Yes, well, I liked 10 - thousand!" Hail ... Perhaps the best writing ever I've ever seen. An immense 22-minute mess with a terrific makeup that confronts social problems ... It's a fun night. Also, I like the latest ideas that are bad for going on a car sitcoms for auto insurance ads. Gecko will do the next, or not, to have a new title of the worst show ever I've ever seen. I would even say that this is worse than "Viva Laughlin". At least the "Viva Laughlin" was inspired. <br /> <br /> I hope that such shows are directed to the Earth somewhere in the comet. <br /> <br /> (/ Without a doubt, it can not ...)
