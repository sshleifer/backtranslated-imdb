Whoever believes that this movie is not considered by anyone of his comedian genius, was burning with two movie stoners. This movie is not subtitled ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It's not to be compared to that film and Naked Gun or Airplane, since the last two films are well-written and entertaining. Class Reunion is not one of those things. The worst was the potential (good cast, good storytelling), but there are few bad ones. Funny scenes were annoying. Stoner guys, vampire, blind girl ... NOT FUNNY. A fun personage only Delores (who sold his soul to the devil). <br /> <br /> National Lampoon has made excellent films (Animal House, Vacation) but this is not one of them. I expected more from John Hughes.
