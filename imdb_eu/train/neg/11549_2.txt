Although there were some fun moments, I thought the movie was quite lame. The longer it is, the worse it is. When I got into this action at Monument Valley, I saw that I saw more stupid interactions than non-compelling characters. <br /> <br /> The daughter was particularly inconsistent. First, he will enter into the agreement, then he finds the truth and casts it. Then he returns again and then deviates them. Then he's back again. There is no motivation in its decisions. There were many interesting characters, some interesting scenes and a lot of missed options. I should say that the images are much smaller than the sum of their parts. Apparently, people like Repo Man liked it. The search engine is not 2.0 with The Searchers.
