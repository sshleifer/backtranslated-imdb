Lorenzo Lamas exudes some of the exotic stars, which kidnaps the stars of the CIA agent that captures some exotic beauty named Alexa and forces him to kidnap his daughter and fight against his previous employers. O.J Simpson also has a board, to give credibility to the talented team. I must admit I'm not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas or his movie. Take it However, compared to Kinmont's wife O.J Simpson and Lamas, Lamas seems to be Jean-Claude Van Damme. I only saw the CIA because of the renewed interest in O.J Simpson trial, if your parents had additional cables and channels, you can not escape the movie. In 1994, you could go to a community of Amish and some wizards would play on their portable TV. The film itself is a collection of activity sequences and it would be intriguing that the strange value of O.J Simpson is a line of jumping after firefighters and exchanging unmistakable humor. Also, where were Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant playing this classic camp? <br /> <br /> * from 4 (bad)
