The message from this movie is "identity is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo thinks she's "ugly duckling," but the fun stuff is not ugly (it's really much more attractive to Uma Thurman than a model-like friend). <br /> <br /> Now, would this movie be if "Ugly Duckling" was not really attractive? When will Hollywood stop this hypocrisy? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, despite the message it wants to convey, the movie is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
