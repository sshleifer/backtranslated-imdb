This 96 minute is cruel ... I love old Munster. Yes, the plot is the thing; both lines are trite; But the manager was not a fan. There is so much "intrigue" (and I use that word with great interruption), I wonder whether Starsky and Hutch are old or not. I found out that when my make-up was not in my place near the neck. In the mid 60's (wonderful) denying the passage of time, the producers represent Marilyn and Eddie with the youngest actors. Why not let grow and age? The addamen's Family-style meeting increment does not add to the Halloween party flavor. Aitona & Herman flies to Transylvania and, for some hours (wonderful), Sid Ceaser is. The character is unbelievable (I'm getting into bad robots), because it made an unknown combination of gibberish & yiddish, but it's been an ancient Arab rule. And yes, it seems that laughter is missing. In fact, there are places where the air is dead, as is the case in which the laughter is to be inserted later. The agents seem to wait in a fake audience. It is not horny; it's sad Oh, and the best part! Yvonne DeCarlo has a line that will showcase how writers and producers have touched you. Marilyn says something like: "Where could my uncle Herman and my father be in an accident, it could hit a car or trains!" Lily says something she says: "Uncle Herman is here if you need to get out of the railroad." In this regard, it is amazing: Yvonne DeCarlo's husband was the actor of the early 60's and lost a leg and almost killed a train in a horn. He never recovered, and this his family destroyed financially. (Look at the Biographies, a wonderful review of his life and career) This line could easily be modified to make him feel more sensitive. <br /> <br /> If you are a real fan of Munster, you should rent it. this mess It shows some better things to do. With almost (almost) original, almost a few years ago, it's just as bad as the remake of the show.
