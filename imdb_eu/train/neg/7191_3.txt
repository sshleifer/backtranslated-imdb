I watched tonight at Midnight Slam at the Festival des Movies du Monde in Montr√©al. What a despair This movie is rated by fans. The effect was regular. The management did not bring anything new or interesting. Land is definitely missing: the movie is about all the university titles and games that make fun prank calls (7th of the 5th). And on top of that, you can finish the movie in the first five minutes. You'll like the prank calls that you like with an ax just jumped once or twice on the whole movie, and you'd like it. If you do not, the movie is not worth it.
