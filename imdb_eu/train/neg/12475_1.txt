I do not remember going out of cinema for a long time. Not only that, but I was with 7 friends, and we all wanted to. Interesting land, clay characters, no violence. I do not like when good men died; I do not like bad when the boys got it. Fantasy and magic were as bold as milkburn and there was no coherence. In short, if you spend good entertainment in hell.
