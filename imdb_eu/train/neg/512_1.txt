Films in the movies that have been banned during film history are very important and very good. Filmmakers would like to argue that movie censors, who were so bad that they were banned, would have to ban them, that they pose a threat to your IQ and your observance. When doing so, one of the first films to be quickly hidden would be "Stroker Ace", without a doubt. This movie is horrible with the capital 'A'. Burt Reynolds was the worst movie ... if there's "Cannonball Run II", "Cop And A Half" and "Rent-A-Cop", the star of his CV male! <br /> <br /> <br / > The oil thin story introduces Stroker Ace (Reynolds) to a successful car racing car that loves fast cars and fast women. Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty) has been caught up in a strange deal with a misguided promoter. The contract requires the promotion of a new chain of fast food restaurants, for example, to dress a huge chicken. Lugs (Jim Nabors), the Ace's real blades, and a bimbo smaller than the brain parts of Pembroo Feeney (Loni Anderson), who wooed with Ace. Needham, the director of this low-level garbage, later became an actor and made several films in specialized films, stunts and car stagnation and racing scenes. Some of these films were OK, like "Hooper" and "Stunts Unlimited", but "Stroker Ace" came with a dashboard. The characters are so stupid, you feel guilty of playing actors. Anderson mostly stupidly plays this role, combining his teeth with despair. The weakness of the baby and the whole baby, and the sequences of races are not remarkable. The latest credits (Exits that can be found in all Reynolds-Needham partnerships) are generally imbalanced, which may be that the movie does not make it very funny. "Stroker Ace" is a great magnitude.
