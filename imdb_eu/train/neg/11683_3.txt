In order to link the three lines of story and not enough, "Inside Man" was very demanding and without an artistic and realistic essay. Despite his moments, the movie began to act like a thriller, although he slowed down the crawl, quickly jumped between highs and lows, and only about 20 minutes later he had more steam. I will leave Denzel in Washington, he has played very well with his human side and not just with the usual "super detects" answers. Clive Owen also did well in his duality as "evil genius" and "criminal mastermind" (non-retrospective). In general, each person created an excellent sub-section. However, when the fragments were finally collected and when everything was told, there was not a sudden "ah-ha!" or summary of all. It started with a bit of energy, lots of land, many questions and, as I said before, I would say it was close to the normal level of Spike Lee. The so-called "professional critics" I have to completely agree ... this is not a movie.
