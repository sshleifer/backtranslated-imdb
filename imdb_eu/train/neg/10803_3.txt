Ok, so watch the movie revamp and I missed an hour and so many minutes here is a basic summary of my life: Genie ghetto boom box comes out, this boy gives shaggy hair 3 wishes, I forgot to forget about the child's wishes. Shaq rages, and I think that's all. <br /> <br /> So I laughed especially, I cried ... but I especially laughed at a stunning comedy theater. Boys with nba player / rapper and shaggy hair. <br /> <br /> I recommend that this movie be used for college children who drink with their own friends and that they need a good laugh <br /> </ span> Only 10 out of 10 films will be based on 3 deliberate magicians. <br /> <br /> If you wanted 3, this great movie would be erased and the money that everyone did not pretend to be like Hollywood.
