I went into this site, about what people would think about the absolute disaster of a movie. I did not even draw the second one. The characters were in a single dimension. They were throwing all the issues that he could expect from sticking things out. I would bet (and I hope) that all the teachers involved are ashamed. There are actors here, but you should never know.

BTW I do not think the writer has ever placed himself in a real school.
