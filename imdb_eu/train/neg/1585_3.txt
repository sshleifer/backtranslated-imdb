::: SPOILER ALERT ::: <br /> <br /> Soooo, Arnie is a really good man, but after a confrontation with a helicopter and some orders he has been sent to jail (or, to a lesser extent, in some way say labor camp). He fled, but then he caught it again. It will end this time in a wonderful reality show, running by some hard-hitting boys of different subjects, and will eventually die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know it's harder than the hardest boys. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie, Arnie fan and all. However, "The Running Man" has too many mistakes. For example, the reconstruction of Arnie's fight against the helicopter, as a result of the shocked spectator, is a brief summary of the incident, with 5-10 camera angles. This means that the military helicopter, which Arnie had flown, shot 10 cameras crew members, one of them in the eye of a crew, Arnie beats. <br /> <br /> There are other mistakes. and the argument, which is theoretically very interesting and innovative, works a bit, and thus creates a stupidity and unrealistic swimming pool that is drowning. <br /> <br /> The effect can not be said to be anything better than Arnie, Arnie's average performance. The rest of the work is achieved without being particularly good or bad. <br /> <br /> The special effects are good, without any horrors. <br /> <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10
