I remember Ben's 60-year-old Sci-Fi fandom days. I was doing a lot of dialogue and bias with actors and dark actors, especially the actress Ben, Fay Spain and Jody Fair, in 1961 The Young Savages (Angela). Ben was in Chicago, in the 1970s, with the same person and his "career" and a nice life at the bottom of the person I had in a Sci-Fi. All of them were published on a daily neglected fanzine. I wanted to continue to make copies of these conversations, but as time went on, and I probably would not remember any of them, much later that year. It was really nice for me, who started the way of life (they did not even pay them for them, They only paid for the stars, and then it was a hundred dollars in salary! Well he knows how to survive and oppress him! How creature is a remake of Creature, but 50 years older!
