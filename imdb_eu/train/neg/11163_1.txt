We loved Rock of School and Jack Black. We could not watch the movie. I wanted to get out that the movie was so unique in my life that it was so bad. My husband also hated him. They were the only floating floors. My husband and I wanted to be outside the movie theater and told people how to save money. The writing was awesome. There was a great stereotype to be offered to all the Hispanic giants. The movie was not long, but it seemed like an eternity for us. In the theater the people were very restless and silent, like dry painting. I slept with my husband, I was sure that some parts would be feasible, but not. Save money and your time.
