I could not bring myself to this conclusion. I can not comment on the story, as I did not see the whole movie, and I could not see it, because it's "actress". First of all, they have looked at it strictly and I'm sure their scripts are out of their hands - but this is a minor problem. The main topic I had with the actors is not really their fault ... anyone who has thrown this film! Come on, this movie was released in 2003 ... I thought that playing young people with thirty-year-olds to play young people with new waves? I can not watch the movie as one of the first lines I have been "older than 17 years old" than myself. How can we take this seriously ????? Do not fall into this movie, go for a 90-minute walk and you'll get this movie much more than ever.
