Why remember to watch this movie if you have great movies. Time and money is wasting. The film is so bad because I wanted to see it. It's all there. The actors were bad. The script was really bad. The story is stupid. And CGI EVER the worst. Good times were the first 60 seconds of the movie. One interesting thing is that we do not want to die because we want it to be interesting, because we are so stupid enough to have it. (I do not remember the name but "Selected" was "BOYFRIEND"). <Br> /> <br /> NOTE: If you want to see a good movie, the movie is not the right choice.
