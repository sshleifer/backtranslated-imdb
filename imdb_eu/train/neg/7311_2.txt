I had heard good luck about this movie, so when I came to television movies, I wanted to see it as a horror fan. I think I can make a group "huh?" For all those who have seen it, we both claim that "the thing I have ever seen is a lie." It was not terrifying; I'll give it to Roth (I think he's a young man); Characters change throughout the movie, or "Cube." <br /> <br /> However, despite the usual scenes in your "cage", who will turn it on, etc. It was an average horror. > <br /> Some points: 1.) What was it with the child? I do not know why people are strange and stubborn. "I'm talking about slowing down slow karate", what's that? 2.) I know well that Rider's character was like Jordan Ladden, but like a young woman, I was surprised to continue and slept. Uh, illegal. <br /> <br /> 3.) It was a movie that could have been in the movie Roth. Talk about yourself without writing! 4.) What was the deputy? 5.) He immediately threw the dog? And there was little blood? Only his jeans? However, our donkeys laughed and I liked to laugh at horror movies (Dead of Living 2, Evil Dead), but I do not know if I laughed here ...
