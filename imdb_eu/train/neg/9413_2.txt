I do not really agree with other audiences of this bad movie. The only reason why I did not rate it was the result of the great talents of Carmen Miranda. At the beginning and at the end they are the best parents for elegant songs and dances. <br /> <br /> The problem is with the rest of the images. Alice Faye is empty. The song Don Ameche has a great song, but with a shameful writing it is so incredibly crisp. <br /> <br /> Soil is very hard here, Amele plays a man and a baron who sings and danced in two parts. not happy married to Fay. <br /> <br /> When Abeche and dancing strike men, Ameche's marriage seems to be a second change. Baron makes the foolish nonsense about being cleaned out of business and allowing him to play two parts. <br /> <br /> S.Z. The book is here a little, so its comedy gifts are not brilliant. To play J. Carrol Naish, his role is very uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> This is a bomb of a movie that is a girl girl.
