Everything about this movie was horrible. At the beginning of this film, it was pretty good and it's impossible to do such a great job in the biggest disaster of the gangster genre. The soundtrack was like a bad comedy. The whole song was full of film and it started to get angry. <br /> <br /> Please, please, do not worry about this DISPOSAL WILL NOT BE RELEVANT.
