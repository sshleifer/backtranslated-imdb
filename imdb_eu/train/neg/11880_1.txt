Office work, especially computer, functional copy machine, e-mail, voice mail, rogue and 'times', is a satirical choice of territories, a previously-sensible movie, "Clockwatchers" and Office Space, and very well. This latest news about the temperature / humor of "Haiku Tunnel", directed by Josh Kornbluth and Jacob Kornbluth, can only live on the front, and they are waiting for you to come out from inside. Unfortunately for the audience, this option never reaches; So what you have achieved is nice to try, but as the man once said, no cigarettes. <br /> <br /> The protagonist of the film is Josh Kornbluth (Josh Kornbluth), who explains in the opening frames. (directly in a monologue with the camera), this story is a fiction and it happens in the fictional city of San Francisco. It is an innovative nature, if not very imaginatively presented, and not all that fun. However, the attack to be followed, all - as a cancellation ... it's just that very funny. <br /> <br /> Kornbluth is a Kornbluth, an aspiring novelist she writes. as 'temp'. It's a work of adaptation, and some work on the novel sometimes takes some time. But when Bob Shelby (Warren Keith) works for a lawyer, he works well on the first day, and sends Shelby Marlina D'Amore Secretary General (Helen Shumaker) to Kornbluth to give him permission. Â» When thinking about the full-time work of the same company, Kornbluth initially fears his heart, but goes into the front position. He is wrong because of that, but at least the other secretary acknowledges his presence (which, of course, he should never have), and if there are any wrongdoing, he has seventeen important letters ... they just have to be sent - back To do it (it has been maintained because it is an easy piece of mail and "must make something easy to reserve", if everything was too much for him to get. "However, the letters are" important "and, at the end of the week, Kornbluthe has still reserved them, On the table, and there is no need, when he has learned about Shelby, that Kornbluth's days will last as long as his hair does. Quickly. <br /> <br /> Kornbluth brothers, who He also wrote, as well as John Bellucci, the screenplay of the film, that he had to take the Ben Stiller Comedy page. "If you play live, they will laugh." But they did not, and the audience did not. Objectively objectively, people The main boss (as well as most assistant people, in this case) `Play 'funny - like, he` knows' it's fun - he's never been. And this is what Kornbluthe does here; So, instead of being "entertaining", it will only come to an unbelievable and unforgivable way, when Kornbluth decides that it is a serious mistake, they have sabotaged their film. <br /> <br /> This film does not determine why it works, it is based on two fundamental reasons: correctness, which is necessarily "bad", is negligent; and, on the other, performances with Josh Kornbluth. Simply, Kornblut seems to be surprised that it is here to be effective. Unlike Stiller or Steve Martin, they both use their mood to keep them away - Kornbluth seems to have an ego that does not allow himself to clear himself; It seems that he needs to know about his audience, the real Kornbluth, which is much clearer than Kornbluth's character. And he can not get past, even in the movie. Instead of being able to link or identify millions of millions of people who could watch this movie, Kornbluthe is a great way to get rid of people just trying to reach out. Therefore, everything is correct and it is a very poor conduct, and considering what was considered weak from the beginning, with an intense incomprehensible focus (considering the potential of rich subjects), it is easy to understand why it does not fly. <br /> <br /> The saving of the grace of the film is Warren Keith Shelby's performance, which convinces subtle subtlety and where ... - it's pretty funny. Its efficiency has been reduced, however, Keith has to share with Kornbluth his scenes, which gradually impairs positive contributions to his project. <br /> <br /> Shumaker and Sarah Overman (Julie Faustino) also keep their heads above their performances, which is not highly recommended; At least scenes are visible and Overman is also able to raise Kornbluth's performance at the moment. But it's still not enough to save the day or film. <br /> <br /> Supporting Amy Resnick (Mindy), Brian Thorstenson (Clifford), June Lomena (DaVonne) and Joe Bellan. ), By the appearance of an unfavorable look by Harry Shearer, as a leader in orientation. The answer to this question demands the role: "What did he think of when he accepted it?" In any work environment, in one way or another, inevitably, situations will become forests of someone's comical cannon, and the movies of these situations will always be with us; The good ones (see paragraph) can be classics themselves. However, the Haiku tunnel will continue to be very long, since destiny is somewhere else, only "dark". I value this 1/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
