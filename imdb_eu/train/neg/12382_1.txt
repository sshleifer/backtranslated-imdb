Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn returned to their tombs, which was known as "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner Rip off" in theaters. Together with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton, these four great actors made a great cultural expression with Stanley Krame's CEO in 1967. Today is a joke. So the white white one of an Italian stereotyped family in Rhode Island leads her African-American girlfriend to her home (Insert GASP here) in honor of her father. The reactions of their relatives, of course, can be predicted. This movie started from the beginning, telegraphically, when my girlfriend started a fake rumor, she told me she wanted to leave. Get yourself aside and rent the original. Take a walk in Wake.
