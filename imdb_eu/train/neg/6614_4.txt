Sholay - It's considered one of the biggest films. I always asked if they asked me if they had a classical restart. Horra RGV announced this movie and was glad to see it. I always thought that it would be a good movie, but we would change something RGV every week. And the movie is a very good B-Grade movie, it's something I did not expect. <br /> <br /> I really tried to find positive, but I ordered Sholay to keep myself in my head. Cinematography is horrible. The movie wants to be the same. But that's it. The sequence of actions is weak. The script was a potential. The biggest mistake is editing. You do not even feel a scene. For example, the comedy sequences felt very inadequate and forced places. Ironic was just as funny as the original comedy. And no character is ever developing. And the scene will not last until the end. And the end was very disappointing. <br /> <br /> It's the main question. Amitabh Bachchan was just as good as Gabbar Singh. It seemed to him that he seemed to concentrate too much, it seems only a threatening character, but you are not going out. Mohanlal is hardly ever in the movie, but it does not make up for its scene. Ajay Devgan was decent. There was so much performance, everything he gave, the script was weak. Prashant Raj is very sure and makes the most of the movies. <br /> <br /> I had the greatest expectations with Sushmita Sen, it was probably the best. It was expressive, but it was not enough yet. Nisha Kothari surprised me. Although most of them were disinterested, but the emotional aftermath of his friend's death was pretty good. Apparently he has to find his talent and not the director who will help her look pretty. But what I liked the most was chemistry. Ajay Devgan and Prashant Raj were not friends. Ajay-Nisha was not a pair. Sushmita and Prashant did not find passion. And Amitabh and Mohanlal did not need a hateful passion. <br /> <br /> As far as the songs are concerned, they often suck. Urmila Mehbooba was too impressed and almost slept. However, he was danced well. Holi number is nice, but not memorable. The other song itself happened. I was disappointed with someone who looked at this movie. RGV had a great deal of hope for its Jungle, but it seems to have lost talent in filming this movie. Fortunately, he regains his talent for Sarkar Raj. But this movie is forgotten. All the positives are still boring boring film.
