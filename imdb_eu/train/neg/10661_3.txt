"The F.B.I." da. Featuring star star Reed Hadley, star star! The movie begins with an unexpected kidnapping (a convenient thing?), That is, one thing and another, that is, the main story that explains it is "Big House, U.S.A". the story of breaking the prison. This story is very popular, at least. TV is just as "violent" as a show. <br /> <br /> BA - Throw a trip! Image: Ralph Meeker was sent to prison; His friends in the room are the following criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (Reading a "Muscle" magazine), and William Talman (Reading a "Detective" magazine!). Honest You should know, at the beginning, a scene should emphasize what is "missing" to the boy to end the "voice". If you do not want to hang out, do not miss the opening between "Iceman" and the boy (Peter Votrian, like asthmatic exiles). <br /> <br /> *** Big House, USA (1955) Howard W. Koch ~ Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
