So American Pie: Beta House is the 6th movie of American Pie. Although it really has nothing to do with the original three Pie movies, although some characters are related to the characters of the original trilogy, and Eugene Levy is there (can not the guy get a better concert?). <br /> <br /> There is very little to complete this film. No fun joke. Playing is painful, especially when the "ya'll" word "British" looks like "British" seems like a little girl who might have imagined the Canadian imagination. I feel like a stupid movie. Why do not I go to college to go to college (but they all get good grades), girls get rid of their clothes in the public, they all have unprotected sex disorders without baby's and no ETS, and you can ejaculate everything. Photo of the little girl's family without her? The series really fell to the softcore pornographic standards. Next, perhaps, they will eventually break and hire Ron Jeremy as head. I'm convinced that they will only link to the series link if their character is removed from any 3rd Uncle Stifler or something like that.
