This film has proven "commercial" cinema, or, on the other, Hollywood movies are a serious crisis. There's absolutely no reason to overcome this movie's expected success on the name of Shaquiller. What is deserving about the land: it's a bit more intricate. What else? The screen is a bit dark, O'Neal is a bad actor but Francis Capra is even worse. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10.
