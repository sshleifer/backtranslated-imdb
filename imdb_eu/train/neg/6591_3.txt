That's the sound of Stan and Ollie in their tombs. <br /> <br /> I will not disturb the list of key mistakes in this movie, as they are so obvious, they do not say. The small things, that is, all the "new adventures of Laurel and Hardy" were killed in more than thirty years. Small things like that. <br /> <br /> The idea might be bad for actors to play buffi, called Laurel and Hardy. It can be as bad as that, it can work. To get a bad idea, try to find two actors to represent the pair. Ok, they can say they are nephews, but the final result is the same. <br /> <br /> Bronson Pinchot can be fun. Okay, forget about his malignant stranger "Cousin Larry" schtick in Perfect Strangers and look at Romance. Here, however, it's sour. It's probably not his fault, and all like the director and the support cast are better than the materials - it surely earns money. There are those who say that Americans are hard to master effective English accent. This is not why Pinchot helped. What is Stan? Welsh? Iran? In pakistan It only approaches through Stan's brand, but as a lie is excessive, there's nothing to write at home. Gailard Sartain is doing just like Ollie, but it's like saying it's getting into a dog's dirt or knacking kick worse. <br /> <br /> Remember the originals with a second degree of time, intuitive group work and their own love? Well that is absolutely missing, with two stupid men and two jokes, you can park the buses during parking. Although the originals are plots that can be summarized in a panel, this has a long mummy hokum (that is, a bad title!), Mixed with the twin brotherhood scenes. I can not see 108 films of Laurel and Hardy, but I think it is safer than it was before the fans of this series. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main problem was playing original games, or at least using their accents. He felt at least natural and non-energized, Pinchot and Sartain were shot in opposition to the opposition. And when did Stan malapropisms, and so much? "I would give you a deceptive censure"; "I would like to marinate my friend." Stop! <br /> <br /> The only highlight of the moment is the Bozo the Clown reference, the character shared by Larry Harmon's L & H comic. Harmon, of course, bought the copyright names (to surprise Laurel and Hardy after watching a Â®) and was the director and producer of this travesty. <br /> <br /> There are many questions. Will Stan and Ollie think they are alive today? Will they throw glass mummies? Stan is knocked in the genitalia with a spear and finished in a big CGI end? Let's not wait. <br /> <br /> I laughed once, but I think all this was credible. Why was this film first created? Who could think the authors? The worst movie ever I've ever seen, absolute abilities, I've seen the disease after the first five minutes. It's as entertaining as the head is, while a red puddle and sharp nettle strengthen the backway.
